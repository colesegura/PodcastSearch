It is I, Dee Trussell, and this is an anomalous podcast intro. It's a Saturday morning, and it's raining outside. And the reason it's a Saturday morning is because yesterday was Friday, and these things keep happening. But also the reason I'm recording this on a Saturday morning is because I spent all day yesterday after returning home from this glorious work that I'm involved in, that I can't talk about yet. And I tried to record some kind of fancy podcast intro. Lots of bells and whistles. Try to be funny. That's always gonna be a disaster when you're trying to be funny. Just forget it. And also was like putting a lot of icing in there. You know, that's just clearly a sign of something's off. It's like, you know what I mean? You're making up for your lack of cake with too much icing. Usually a sign that something is off. So simplicity is always the answer to those situations. And in this case, why am I trying to do some kind of fancy flowery podcast intro when I have one of the great meditation teachers alive today. He's written so many great books on this podcast. It doesn't make any sense. It's weird. So I figure, you know what? I'm just gonna read this wonderful text I got today from Damien Eccles, who was on the podcast a couple months ago, I think. And what's kind of funny about this text is that it actually is the podcast intro because it's a wonderful text about meditation. So I'm just gonna read this text. I asked for his permission, he said I could. This is from his journal. Exactly how does magic work? To answer this, we turn to quantum physics. This particular field of science has discovered that we exist within a unified divine matrix. And the first law of how this matrix works is known as quantum entanglement. Quantum entanglement stipulates that all things which have been physically linked remain linked on an energetic level, even if they become separated by vast distances. Experiments have shown that by taking two photons which have been linked and then separating them, we can still interact with one and have an effect on the other, even if it's nowhere near us. So how does this explain magic? Because at one point, the matter of which we are made was touching all other matter. In fact, it said that if you removed all the empty space or dark energy of the universe, you could compress all the remaining matter in the entire universe into an area the size of a green pea, which is exactly the state we were in before the Big Bang. The matter of which we are made is entangled on a quantum level with a matter of everything else in existence. The implications of this are that by causing a change in ourselves, we also cause a change in the external universe. In fact, we now know this is true because of experiments which have shown that the universe is holographic, meaning that within each tiny piece of the universe, the reflection of the universe in its entirety can be found. What does this look like in a practical real-world scenario? For the answer to that, we can look at a study conducted by the World Peace Group. What they found was that by gathering enough trained meditators together in one place, they could create what they called the super-radiance effect. Part of the super-radiance effect was that war-related deaths in the surrounding area of Lebanon dropped by as much as 76%. Violent crime rates and even the number of house fires dropped dramatically. The experiment was conducted seven more times over the next two years, while other possible influences such as holiday, the weather, et cetera, were all statistically controlled for. One thing they found was that the greater the number of trained meditation practitioners taking part, the greater the super-radiance effect was. And as the number of practitioners taking part fell, the number of war-deaths rose. The group, again, attempting to calculate just how many people in an area would need to practice some kind of technique that fills the practitioner with inner peace, be it transcendental meditation, ceremonial magic, et cetera, they found that the answer was the square root of 1% of the population. This number was arrived at by another experiment conducted by the group in a Lebanese village called Baskinta, and Baskinta is 1% of the population began practicing meditation, fighting stopped entirely. Now, I have not checked these sources or looked at how these studies worked, but I can tell you anecdotal evidence from my own life, which I've noticed, which is if I'm meditating, things do get way better. And I think maybe the way to look at that is instead of going into why that could be happening, though I love the quantum entanglement stuff, and I was just reading a tweet by Mitch Horowitz, another former guest in the podcast who said that Sherman Helmsley from, what's that show, Moving On Up? What's it called? It's called The Jeffersons, and I loved it when I was a kid, but I had no idea that Sherman Helmsley was a disciplined follower of an ancient hermetic tradition that might have existed prior to the building of the pyramids, and it's all wrapped up in this book called The Qibalian, the Qibalian. I'd heard about it, but I never spent any time with it. Wow, what a cool book. It has a lot of great ideas in it, a lot of very simple concepts that can become very complex, but one of them that I love is that opposites are actually the same thing at different degrees, which is crazy when you consider that, meaning that if you have some kind of, I don't know, an aspect of yourself that you're not happy with, you could actually sort of connect, or you already are connected with that thing's opposite, because it's basically the same thing. If you're experiencing some kind of, I don't know, confusion, for example, that confusion is actually the experience of dawning realization, because if you didn't have dawning realization, you wouldn't know you were confused. And similarly, this like happens in the natural world. For example, heat and cold, they're the same thing. It's just a continuum that we're all on. And so within these ideas are all these potential things, potentialities, which is that you could theoretically like jump, so to speak, jump opposites. I don't know if you saw Bandersnatch, the black mirror, the weird black mirror, choose your own adventure thing on Netflix, pretty cool. But there is like kind of like, I don't know, I don't know how many versions of the story there, but I think there's this concept you could like jump through mirrors and to alternate dimensions, you know? And when you're looking in a mirror, you're essentially seeing the opposite of you. I mean, it's you, but it's you in reverse. Left is right, right is left. This is like the, sounds crazy, but it's like, this is the, when you're watching a weatherman or woman, you're seeing someone who's like really good at doing everything in the opposite, because the weather map that they're seeing is on a green screen and they're having to look at another thing anyway. I saw somebody do it at the CNN building in Atlanta and then when I realized what they were doing, it was crazy. If I had to do that, I would simultaneously shit my pants, piss myself, probably have some kind of seizure and collapse. Regardless, there was this idea in Bandersnatch that you could jump from one into a mirror into another dimension, which is where you would be living a completely different life and sort of travel through the black mirror, cynical, depressing and annoying yet awesome multiverse. Similarly, this concept of opposites being the same thing on different levels has within it a weird potential for a kind of like form of mentation, a kind of like cognitive exploration of things that you thought you were disconnected from, but that you were completely connected to. And that wonderful text I got from Damien also has within it this idea of the kind of interconnectivity of all things and how if you begin to meditate in whatever way that may be, because the meditation is just like a path, the destination or the sort of state that it potentially could open up within you. It's like, there's lots of ways to get bicep muscles. That's what I tell all the people I train at my private gym. And some of my students, we lift, we lift like watermelons or like various types of fruit. Some of my students, we do kettlebells and some of my students, I just fill their biceps up with a kind of mucus that forms muscles, but those are for the more advanced students, believe it or not. There's lots of ways to get biceps. Similarly, there's lots of ways to create some spaciousness within the medieval torture chamber you call your mind. Not that your mind is a medieval torture chamber, but sometimes I'm definitely putting myself on the rack. And when you achieve that spaciousness, it's not just as though suddenly you feel better, it's that those around you, that the things around you also begin to conform to that bigger space. And so that's the weird thing that I have definitely noticed that happens, which is when you start working out, meditating, jogging, whatever it is, if you start some consistent thing that runs counter to whatever particular pattern you're in that you don't like, it's not just like suddenly you start changing, it's like suddenly your luck gets a little better, suddenly colors seem a little brighter, suddenly people seem a little nicer, you know? It's like the radio station changes from some kind of sad, weird, industrial loop to something a little sweeter. And then unfortunately, if you're me, you go back to the industrial loop and you keep doing that over and over again, which brings us to one of my favorite sayings which emanated from today's guest, Sharon Salzburg, which is the healing is in the return. It's okay. If your pendulum is swinging to the opposite, if you find yourself going down degrees and up degrees and you feel a little woozy, it's okay. And Sharon has a real talent at expressing ways to sort of open up to that swinging pendulum that for some of us, sometimes we find ourselves sitting at a bar and sometimes we find ourselves on a meditation cushion. Sometimes you're watching the Ted Bundy documentary on Netflix, which is awesome. And sometimes you're sitting in front of a candle watching your breath. And this pendulum is actually part of the process, but I don't wanna spoil it for you. I would like to invite you to go to Sharon's website and sign up. I just signed up. I'm doing it this year. I've talked about this on the podcast in a previous year and I didn't do it. This year, I'm doing it. Go to SharonSolzburg.com and sign up. If you're listening to this on the second of February, there's three more days that you could sign up for this thing. And basically, we're gonna meditate every day in February. And I don't know that I've ever pulled off an entire month of straight meditation. I'm gonna admit that right now. I haven't done it. It's like, I think I'm, I'll get to a point where I'm like, I'm doing it. This is gonna be it. This is it. But I'll always miss a day or two, which is fine. But this time, we're gonna do it. We're gonna win the meditation challenge and our meditation biceps are gonna be engorged and ripped. And then we can lay on the beach of enlightenment and make people jealous about our spiritual muscles. What a great podcast we have for you today.

I can't believe I get to be hanging out with him. It's pretty incredible. And I never thought I'd be so happy at 5 a.m. in the morning holding a little baby. Seems to be not only causing my brain to release some kind of incredible blast of pure sweet joy, but it's also teaching me about something I read in a book, of course. I mean, it wasn't on a bathroom wall, but it could have been, the book wasn't that long. The saying is, the great way is easy for he who holds no preferences. And that really applies to when you're hanging out with a baby because if you've got something you wanna do, some place you wanna be, some thing that needs to get done, if you don't want there to be a sudden explosion of poop all over your shoes or maybe you're hoping to get a little bit more sleep, you're gonna be hurting. But if you just sorta go into the moment with the baby, suddenly it's like you're in paradise. The other thing I figured out, well I didn't figure it out, who am I fooling? Erin, my wife, was a nanny for years. So she knows how to do this with babies. She's taught me a lot. One of the things is with a baby, you gotta, you gotta, you have to roll their cigarettes extra small because they're, just kidding. With a baby, you have to, you should react to what's happening because when they're screaming, and this is what I was doing when he's screaming, I would sing to him. Because I like singing to him, but when they're upset, you should acknowledge they're actually upset. So even though they don't speak English yet, you can talk to them and say, hey, I know you're upset, we're gonna get through this. Don't sing to them, like some weirdo. She didn't tell me that, I just figured that out. I was thinking, you know, if I was a tiny little thing, and I was legitimately freaking out, some weirdo with an ungroomed beard came and started singing some babbling song to me about clowns would not be a great way to start the morning. So that's something that I really like about having a baby as it teaches you, not just how important it is to be in the moment, but how important it is to save your clown songs for moments when somebody isn't screaming. That's the end of Baby Report. And now we shall blow the blessing horn. Every time we blow this, it causes over 5,000 spontaneous orgasms across the planet, you might be one of them. And also it purifies you of all your dark past karmas and cleanses your Akashic record collection, which is filthy. So here we go, the horn of blessing. Also, there is a under a 15% chance that when you hear the horn of blessing, you go permanently blind, insane. But it's a very, odds are not, it's 15%. It's like, is it a 15% chance that it will happen? Or is it more like an 85% chance that it won't? Right? See, that's the best way to look at it. So here we go, the horn of blessing, now. Try to take a good look at your eyes, for your eyes, for your eyes. Take a good look at your eyes, for your eyes. Boy, not the horn of blessing again. Guaranteed if there was a horn of blessing, and some angelic being would blow it every two years, and it would cleanse all of the darkness from humanity. There would be at least 10 people, who would be like, great, fucking horn of blessing. And who does he think he is blowing that horn? You can just blow the horn of blessing. You can just cleanse Akashic records. You can just blow the horn. It's dangerous to blow the horn. He's blowing it wrong. It's not the way the angels of the past blew the horn of blessing. What's happening? So horn blowing skills are not, by the way, who gave him the horn? There'd be news reports like, oh, what's happened to the horn of blessing angel? The new horn of blessing angel, complaints surround the new horn of blessing angel. His blessing horn does not sound like the previous horns of previous generations. What's up with that angel? Well, I'm not an angel, and it's not a blessing horn. It's actually a hunting horn that was hanging above my father's bed where he died. This is hunting horn. He wanted to die a wooden knight. So I like blowing his energy out into the universe because he was a really sweet, cool guy. Of course, I'm gonna think that. He was my dad. But according to something I read on the wall of the bathroom, you're all my dad and my mom, and I love you. Speaking of dads and moms, there's something that connects dads and moms, and that thing is called, for lack of a better word, an erection. We need them. Behind every great human is their father's erection. These are words perhaps better left unspoken if you're erection phobic, or if you are someone who just teleported in off of the Mayflower from a more puritanical time in human history where the body was considered to be vulgar, but the reality of the situation is that anyone who is wobbling around on this wonderful planet was at least partially exploded out of an erection. And I hesitated. You know, I was like, oh man, I don't know, should I do a Bluetooth, I got a Bluetooth commercial. But then also it's this great teacher, and is it blasphemous? And then I realized, what's wrong with you? Do you think the fountain of all existence is blasphemous? To quote George Washington, if boners are evil, I wanna live on another planet. We're gonna jump to this commercial and we'll be right back. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the erection, wizards, warlocks, priestesses, and shamans over at bluetchoo.com.

Welcome to you, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, It's the Dunkitrustle Family Hour Podcast. Okay, Sharon, welcome back to the DTFH. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much, it's been too long I think. It's been way too long, way too long. But you know how time works with, especially when it comes with teachers and students forever reverberating in my mind is something you said to me at the Ramdas retreat when I asked you if drinking whiskey and watching Westworld was a practice. And you said, it's a practice, but you're practicing the wrong thing. I'm kind of glad I was right in the moment. Well, there you go. I think about it every time I drink whiskey. But I wanted to sort of circle around the concept of practice for our conversation today because you have coming up your meditation challenge, which is something you do once a year. It starts on February 1st. I wonder if you could just give a synopsis of what that is. Sure, well, something like seven years ago or so, I had a book come out called Real Happiness, which is kind of a guide to starting a meditation practice or renewing one, maybe if you used to have one. And the full title was Real Happiness, the Power of Meditation, a 28-day program, and came out like in January or something. And I'm because it was my assistant at the time who was my mutual friend, said, why don't you do a challenge? Cause February has 28 days. And I said, I don't think so, but she was totally right. We did it and it's a beautiful expression. It was all on my website. So people were practicing every day, they were sharing their experience. Some people were blogging, some people were commenting, some people were just reading, but it formed this tremendous sense of community. As we asked everyone to be really honest, you know, I said, if you're not like sitting for two minutes and floating in the air, please don't say you are. So we got really hard to heart to connect to one another. I had done a series of guided meditations for this site called Hapify, which has lent us each February the meditations. So everybody gets a guided meditation they can stream, like three months, I think, each day. And I write and people ask questions and they also have ways of talking to one another. So it's a beautiful experience. The, wait, you did it because there's, you chose February because it's the shortest month because there's only 28 days. No, because it's the subtitle of the book. It's a 28 day program. Oh, I got you. Yes. There's something that I'd go back and forth on and I wonder if you could help clarify it for me. It's something I heard Ram Dass say once regarding meditation and he said, I don't often recommend it to people that I don't want it to help people to meditate. Don't meditate, just forget about it. Don't, you know, when you're right, when it's time to do it, you'll do it. But then whenever I have a, an actual consistent practice, things become so wonderful in my life that it feels really difficult to not start advising people about this experience. How do you think someone should go about conveying the idea that meditation is great without sounding like a jerk or without, you know, you don't, I believe it. Well, you know, I think people are different and I have the kind of mind where I'm very helped by structure. And so having a method, having a program, having a commitment, it needs to be a realistic one. Like I'm not gonna say I'm gonna sit eight hours a day for 40 years, you know, but it's more like 10 minutes a day for a month or you know, whatever proves to be realistic. That helps me enormously because I'm the kind of person if I said, you know, I think I'll practice three times a week. It'd be Monday and I think, ah, I think I'll start Wednesday. Every Wednesday, I think I'll do three times on Saturday and I'd never do it. But like every day is every day and it's just clear. And it also helped me tremendously with the very significant problem I had with self-judgment because this is when I was living in India in the early 70s and I wasn't always on retreat. Sometimes you're just living a life. It was a very simple life because there were no computers, there were no faxes, there were no cell phones, no one had a job. Where were you in India? Practicing and buying vegetables or something, you know. Where were you in India, Sharon? I was in India from basically- Which part of India? Oh, Northern India. Well, I was practicing in the winters in Burgaya, which is in the state of Bihar. And then we get very, very hot. And so we would just go up to the mountains somewhere and then go back when we could. And so we'd rent a house in the mountains, we were just living together and cooking. And even in those situations, I found it was very hard for me to have a daily practice. That's like without a job, without a computer, without a cell phone. And my problem really was judgment because when I'd sit, it would feel lovely and I'd feel peaceful. I'd think, oh, good, I'm gonna stay in India for the rest of my life, feeling exactly like this. And when I was cranky or restless or bored or my knee hurt, I'd get up and it doesn't work. And I went to one of my teachers, a man named Menindra, and I described that pattern. And he said, for you, I have just one piece of advice. And that is just put your body there. He said, every day you put your body there. One day it's gonna feel one way, other days it's gonna feel another way. That's not up to us. And it's not even always that significant, because there's so much hidden going on and there's so much unknown going on. And we just have to do it and keep putting our hearts in, putting our energy there. Have you ever watched the crystallization process, like crystals forming in liquid? Have you ever watched that? It's a fascinating thing to watch because there's so much beauty in crystals, snowflakes, so many patterns in crystals, and they just form. They don't, like whatever the substrate is, the crystal's forming and isn't furrowing its brow to produce a perfectly unique and beautiful geometry. It just happens this way. Do you think meditation might be a little bit like that, that just sitting still for some reason is causing this kind of form to, or something like that within? I think definitely. It sort of reminds me of the first time I ever walked to Labyrinth, and I was actually in San Francisco at Grace Cathedral and it was outdoors. So somebody had created this sort of stone sculpture so that it formed Labyrinth, which I was just walking along, and of course it's a pre-patterned walk and with the goal, so to speak, of getting right into the center, right into the heart center of the whole maze. So I was walking along and there was one point where I was so close to the center. And then my path took me out almost to the edge and I thought, oh no, I must have made a mistake. But it's only like one step in front of the other. So I kept going and I discovered that to my surprise having been so close to the center and then so far away, I just kept going and then there I was right in the center. And I just experienced that for a while and then I went inside where there was an identical Labyrinth because it's the same pattern, but on a rug. And I started walking and I had the identical experience. I was almost in the center then I was way out of the edge and I thought, oh no, I must have made a mistake. I thought, didn't you just have this experience like five minutes ago? And sometimes our path is like that. It can be very mysterious and yet the call is to keep going because otherwise it's just a story. Other people can do it and I can't do it or I can do it next year when things are calmer or whatever it is, it's just a story. We're telling what we have to do is actually walk it. And again, it needs to be reasonable. You don't want to make some crazy commitment to something that's abusive or endless without seeing that kind of result. But once you have framed it in some way, then I come down on the side of having been very helped by the commitment to daily practice. Rhombus of course had the guru whom we loved, absolutely. The thought of being coerced or forced would be so antithetical to that relationship. Right, right, okay, sure. That makes sense. That helps clarify that, thank you. There seems to be something suspicious either about the human nervous system, our brains, our energetic systems or the universe itself that this thing that is so simple to do, which is to sit, I'm sitting right now, you're sitting right now. But you remove all the other stuff you might do while you're sitting so that you're just sitting. Something like that would be so incredibly difficult to keep doing over time. It's beyond suspicious. It reminds me, I was playing a video game and the character that I was controlling, it just hit a wall, they didn't even try to explain why they couldn't go further. There's just an invisible barrier there. It's kind of bad game design. Similarly, there seems to be something fundamentally suspicious in the great difficulty of sitting still every single day. And especially when this act over time produces, and I almost feel guilty talking about production or result as I've been taught that this isn't really the point necessarily, you can get caught in these things, but it does seem to produce better sleep, less anxiety, deeper connections with the people around you, a sense that you haven't actually ever been alive. Except now you're sort of alive, a feeling of being surrounded by a great deal of wisdom that you had been missing for a long time. And even though there is this realization of these things, and you think, oh, okay, this must be the thing they're talking about then. This must be some form of enlightenment. The great meditator. The next day you're like, you know, I think I just want to play piano today. I don't want to go and sit. What is that? Well, I think those results are worthy results. You know, I also don't condone on the side of there, you know, there's no goal or, I mean, you don't want to be obsessed with it, you know, because then you're never doing the thing. You're just thinking about what it's going to get you. Right. It's a waste of time. And also we reify the goal in such a way, like it's got to feel exactly like this. Like when I started practice for some reason, I had this crazy idea in my head that good meditation meant being bathed in brilliant white light. I don't have any white light. I had some other beautiful experiences of love and I had some really painful experiences that were super important, but I discounted everything because it wasn't a white light. No one ever said I had a white light and it wasn't true, but it was fixated, you know, that's how we get. We get fixated on an experience. We say nothing else counts, and especially because we're so phobic about pain and sometimes pain is important. And even waking up during neutral times is a big part of mindfulness. Like all the times we're just sort of, you know, very pleasant and unpleasant. We're kind of waiting for something better to happen. And we are half asleep. You know, we're not really alive. And so we want to be more present during every moment. And that's hard to believe when we get caught in that idea of what should be happening. But if you can unwind from that, then of course, I mean, you're putting effort into something it has to bring some benefit. Another problem is that the real benefit and the kind of enduring benefit that comes from meditation practice happens in our life. It's not necessarily captured in like a great breakthrough moment. You can't necessarily say at 11 and 14, I loved myself completely and it was never an issue again, you know, but start to notice when you're in conversation with somebody or you're meeting a stranger or you just really made a mistake in how you speak to yourself. You start to think, I'm changing. This is different than it used to be. And even before that happens, oddly enough, sometimes it's someone else who says it to us, like, you know, I have many people who come to me and say, you'll have this experience maybe someday who come to me and say, I was gonna stop meditating because I thought nothing was happening. And then my kids came to me and said, please don't stop, you're much better. Wow. You know, things like that. And, you know, not as kind of critical or a quick to anger or more patient, really listening. Those things, that's why we practice in the end is to have a different sort of life. And it really does have that effect. Why we resisted and we looked the other way and we're so conditioned, you know, it's got to feel a certain way. It doesn't feel that way there for it's no good or I can't really do it. It's too selfish, I hear that a lot. It's too selfish, you know, it should be taking care of others. It should be like to do this is insane. Why am I sitting and doing nothing? Or, you know, I mean, there are lots of reasons that we come up with and it's a very strong reality. It is a very strong reality. And that selfish idea, the idea that meditation, self-improvement, that form of self is selfish is really fascinating. It's also in that same box, you've got, well, if you love yourself, you must be narcissistic. You know, the other day, I spontaneously told someone I like myself instead of, you know, saying, oh, I should say, like, I actually meant it. And I couldn't believe it. I was like, oh, wow, it just came out of my mouth. This is incredible. I, holy crap, this is incredible. And then I apologized. I'm sorry. I felt weird and guilty. But it's interesting to me because meditation seems to be the opposite of selfishness. It seems to be that the problem is one of selfishness in the sense that we are compressed into these identities in such a tight way. You know, like when you're in too small an apartment with roommates, it's the worst situation. But the human body is such a tiny little apartment. If that's all you think you are, and you're stuck in there with yourself. I know, all the time. And you're not going to work. You're working from home. You're always there, you know? And so within this situation, this compressed situation, there is, it's fundamentally a selfish predicament. And I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the phenomena of the self. And how you, after so many, many years of a practice, how you can, what you consider yourself to be. Well, you know, a lot of the long-waging and sort of the poetry and the imagery of some of the spirituality I encountered in India, not really within the Buddhist context, which is different. But there's a lot about killing the ego and annihilating the self. I'm just kind of scared. That doesn't sound that good, you know? Yeah. There was this little part of me that had been with me all the time, I was now, you know, annihilated, didn't really feel good. But I'm within the Buddhist perspective. It's not that at all. It's sort of like the way we hold ourselves, the story we tell about who we are, the conceptualization we have, that's what's wrong. So we consider ourselves very separate. We consider ourselves really isolated. We consider ourselves all powerful. Even though we meet the evidence moment after moment, I couldn't decide what thought to have. It just came. I couldn't keep sleeping as in Bay. I couldn't say to myself, you've grieved enough, it's done. Or you'll never be great again. But we believe that we should be in control. Because that's what we're taught and that's reinforced all the time. So we tend to see the self as solitary, as in control, as disconnected, like independent and disconnected. And what the whole spiritual path ultimately comes to is having a sense of self that's more intertwined or it's about interbeing. So it doesn't negate the individuality, which is what people also forget about. Like people say, well, if there's no self, how am I gonna walk out of the room? And the idea is, there's never been a self in that old way of holding it. So you walked into the room and you're gonna be able to walk out of the room. Somebody once pointed randomly to someone in the room and said, well, there's no self, how come she's not doing my taxes? We're individual and yet we are also connected. So a common example would be like, if you go out and you look at a tree, it's a tree. And it's just there, it's like an entity and that's true. But there's also a way of looking at the tree and sensing the soil, which is nourishing it and everything that affects that soil. Which means like the rainfall and everything that affects the rainfall, which we now know is kind of vast expanse of things. And the sunlight and the moonlight, the quality of the air and who planted the tree and you get to see the tree as a network of relationship. That is also part, it's a pattern of life coming together right there. So it's tree on one level and on another level, it's a network and that's true of us as well. So more and more over time, I see that interconnection is the opposite of the kind of old egoic solitary idea of self, but we tend to fear that the opposite of that idea is like a blank, you know, and that either we all become a soup and there's no individuality or we've killed ourselves in some way and it's not that appealing. I think it's important to actually understand that and to look at things in the light of interconnection. The Vietnamese Zen master, Thich Nhat Hanh, he does this exercise or did this exercise. We've like hold up a string bean and say, now see the world. You know, you start thinking about the sun, you know, and everything that is happening in that string bean. So about connections, about relationship. Why is something that is so obvious that it's been scientifically verified that everybody kind of knows on an intellectual level? Why is something like that a thing we have to learn and not a thing that we just naturally are? Are human beings as a species malfunctioning or are we malfunctioning or is it just that we are sort of slowly growing into a different identity than the one that we currently seem to be stuck in and it does seem like that fixation is somewhat catastrophic right now. Yeah, well, that's a very interesting question. Of course, it's much nicer to think we're growing into it, isn't it? Yes, yes. I think that's so much nicer. I think I'll think that way for now on. Okay, me too. Thank you so much. I mean, I don't really know, you know, the why's are difficult. They also had a teacher in India who was very much trying to help us move from only asking why to just saying what, like what's happening right now? Because not that you never ask why, but we were very fixated on that. And his point was that if you're asking why, you're always gonna involve a belief system, which means someone else's vision of what's true. And it would be different if you say, why am I experiencing this to a Jungian therapist? They might have one response. And if you take that very same experience and go to a Freudian therapist, they might have another response or a scholar of this or that or my sort of funniest experience of that was in India, you know, with some teachers who are very, very in the kind of classical mode of Buddhist cosmology of say rebirth and many lives. And I mean, been many things in many lives. Other teachers I had would say, you don't have to believe that. You know, the whole point is the method and you're an awareness and practice. And you don't have to just, and that my funniest teacher was probably from an injury said, you don't have to believe it. It's true, but you don't have to believe it. You know, it's okay, I'm not gonna deal with it, but I want to ask somebody a teacher because I had quite significant physical pain as well as emotional pain when I was first starting to practice. And I said, why? Like, why do I have so much pain? Nobody else seems to have so much pain as I do. And he said, well, you must have tortured many small animals in the previous life. And then he felt needles. Not only did I have pain, I felt like the slowniest person on earth, you know. I think animals, little animals, little baby animals. But in that context of that cosmology that made a certain sense, you're working off a kind of karma that you created by doing this thing. And I thought, that's not useful actually for me. You know, it's not a helpful context. I see what you're saying. Yeah, sure. It's like, I remember you at one of the retreats, I think you were talking about add-ons. Yeah. You know, the problem of just the way that we seem to have some phenomena, we experienced some phenomena in the moment and then create an infinite story around that phenomena. And I guess, metaphysically, that's an add-on, the reincarnation stuff. Yeah, yeah, I mean, unless it's useful for you, you know, it's fun to sort of see like what you just did. Like you reframed everything for me instead of being sort of doleful, you know. It was like, oh, we're getting better. So it's useful to see the add-on as an add-on just to play, you know. Yes. When I reverse it, whoa. Right. Well, I do, you know, to defend my whying, my whying-ness. Okay. I think that the enlightenment of the Buddha is a thing that some people think as like something that happened in antiquity and people of all kinds of ideas about it. But sometimes I think, no, I think this was some kind of nuclear bomb that went off. And I think it has barely, the first shock wave hasn't even gone around the planet yet. That it's just happening right now. And I think that for whatever reason, it took a little bit longer to get to the West, but it's starting to sink in a little bit. And maybe the reason that it took longer to get to the West is because the West seems to be more fixated on the stories and on the identity or the ego and the stories surrounding the ego. So sometimes I think, oh, is this just the same thing that happens when, you know, over the course of millennia, a thing suddenly begins to develop an optic nerve, for example, like in this case, it's odd because it seems like humans have created illusionary appendages, the past and the future and all the stories about what we are and have ignored the only appendage, which seems to be the present moment, which makes us a really clumsy and sad creature in that sense. So yeah, sometimes I do get this feeling of, I wonder if this is like that there is actually the potential for what so many embarrassing people have bugled out about the age of Aquarius, the coming age of realization, the matreah, the second coming of Christ, the singularity, so many different names for it. Do you have anything to say about that? Because that is a part of Buddhism, which is a mapping out of time. And from what I've read, we're in the state that sucks right before things get really wonderful. I think it could be possible. I'm a New Yorker, it's a little hard for me. Look at the subways. How can you say that? Have you never been on the subways? They don't work anymore. I mean, it's really tough and I was, I don't know where I was teaching somewhere. I think just now Puerto Rico, I was just, I just came back from Puerto Rico and I was saying, you know, in New York, it's like, if you get into an elevator with somebody, at least when I was growing up here, you don't look at them, you don't smile at them, you kind of turn around and you don't talk to them. People were looking at me like, ooh, tough, you know, that stuff, I don't remember if I could be like, it's so warm, you know, gracious and generous. Yeah. I think there is room, certainly, to believe that because I mean, also we have to think of who has told our story so far, you know, the story of evolution and you don't hear a lot about survival of the fittest, you don't hear a lot about tendon befriend, which is an alternative response to the amygdala taking over and fight and flight and freeze. You know, it doesn't get a lot of air time, but it also exists. You know, Sharon, someone just told me this and I didn't verify it, so I don't know if it's true, but apparently Darwin talks about love hundreds of more times than he talks about survival of the fittest, but that's what we grabbed onto. Similarly in Buddhism, I'm working with David Nickton right now and sometimes he talks about how people really seem to be fixated on the first two noble truths, suffering, because we know that. And then the last, the end of suffering, no one, like that's the one that seems to get ignored quite a bit. So yes, Darwin apparently did spend a lot of time talking about love, but what does that even mean? And you can't sell missiles if you're talking about love or prisons. But if we don't realize the potency of love, we think it's something stupid and something sentimental because that's what we've been taught. I mean, most people, maybe it's changing with age, but I would venture, I guess, that more people are taught that it's a doggie dog world that are taught about the power of love. That's right. And so if you don't understand that it's potent, it's real, it's important, and you're gonna understand it's a training, but some people got it and I did not mean to luck, then we're not gonna do the things we can do to really change the world. And I think we can't change the world. You mean a training, what do you mean by a training? Well, when I started teaching loving kindness practice in the West, no one else I knew was really doing it and it was a little bit controversial and largely around those two points, one is, well, that's stupid, that's just, that's like what I say these days is that's kind of a girly practice, it's just like sentimental and gooey and ignoring real pain and being conflict avoidant and ignoring some real problems and just covering it with this goo. But the other point was that people didn't believe you could grow in love, you know, you can be more loved that you've got a dose, you know, maybe childhood, I don't know why, but, or it was like, great, it would just come upon you and that there's nothing you could do. And, you know, because the Buddhist perspective is totally the opposite, it's a training and like it's an education, it's a training and awareness, paying attention differently. It's like, this is a little bit like what you're saying before, if you think about yourself at the end of the day and you only think about the mistakes you made and the problems you have and nothing good, that's gonna form a reality for your world, but if you give it a little air time to like, did anything else happen today, is it good within me? It feels like discussing things too, but it's not pretending, it's not being hypocritical, it's saying, you know what, I only go there pretty much as a matter of routine. What about a fuller picture of my day? What about a fuller picture of who I am that admits both things, the joy and the sorrow and all of that, that's the truth of things. The truth, yeah, the truth. And that's what we're broadening to, we pay attention to the good, to the great things that come upon us, to the joy, as well as the power of just reaching out and having someone not feel so alone, even if you can't fix their problem, they don't have to feel all alone in it. But we realize, oh, this is like a training, this is moving out of one's comfort zone and taking a few risks and an awareness and that's what the training means. When did love become synonymous with weakness? Well, that's an interesting question, I don't know, I guess I should be reading mid-Victorian novels, but it's sort of, yeah, I can, it's, I think that there seems to be something so backwards right now when it comes to love or the contemplation of love. And it's insane that people don't think this is a thing that can be developed or they think that they could just be good at it right away. The greatest of things, everyone talks about, oh, love, love, love, love, love, the greatest of things. But you imagine that you're just sort of born with this ability, you know? My baby, my baby can't even burp, you know? But love is there, there is love, there's love beyond, love, there's the most amazing love ever. But then this is a love that is at this moment sort of based on a phenomena. And if love is based on a phenomena, then we're in trouble because now we've got this nipple, so to speak, that we're suckling love from, in this case, a baby. And if that's the case, oh my God, what are we all gonna have babies so we can experience love? Are we gonna use babies like nitrous oxide canisters at a Grateful Dead concert, or are you just gonna have babies scattered around when they start growing up? Forget it, no more love, it's a teenager now. Send it to the prison, you know what I mean? I'm gonna have to wait. Oh boy, so much karma I'm gonna burn off when Sweet Forest becomes a teen. But what I mean is this, there seems to be so many misconceptions about love. One, it's romantic that it's flowery, that it's perfumey, oozy, that it's something temporary, and certainly something that happens just by luck. You turn the corner and there he is, there she is, there it is, oh my God. So I would love it if you could talk a little bit about the basics of cultivating love, but maybe before that, if you could give your definition of what love is. I think my definition these days is really connection. It doesn't mean liking somebody, it doesn't mean approving of them, but it's having some fundamental sense of connection that our lives have something to do with one another, and even if, and it doesn't mean a certain action, it doesn't mean I'm gonna invite you to dinner or spend any time with you. But in my heart, I can wish you to be free of suffering, I can wish you to be happy. And that sense of connection, it can expand quite considerably too. In a funny way, we're all in this together. It's like we don't easily live in a time where you can't just silo off somebody and say, well, you do over there, doesn't matter. Because it's gonna affect me over here. We do live in an interconnected universe, that's why it's powerful, because it's true. That's how things actually are. And so I would say connection, maybe the most startling change in view about love that I've had and I've seen is that it's not external to us, it's ours. I like everybody, so strongly had a view of love, it's almost like a commodity in someone else's hands. And if they chose to give it to me, there would be love in my life, but they chose to take it away in whatever form, like maybe your kid is not gonna wanna be a scientist, they wanna be a musician, or maybe the other way around with you. You know, it's frustrating. You know, then it feels like, wait, you're taking away this person who loved him, be reft, I don't have that anymore, but I saw a movie, I don't know, it was like 11 years old, my niece, something like that. My goddaughter was a chick, she had a tiny little partner, she was a little girl, but she didn't speak, she barked, because it was a talent show. That was her audition, Mr. Bark, and it was a movie called Dan in Real Life, and one of the characters in the movie said, love is not a feeling, it's an ability. Love is not a feeling, it's an ability. And of course it is also a feeling, but I was captivated by this notion of love as an ability, because it's so resembled experiences I had had during meditation where the image I used is like, it was almost like the UPS person was standing at my doorstep with a package of love, I looked down at the address and said, I don't think so, I'm sort of walking off, I said, wait a minute, I have nothing, but really love is inside of us. It's an ability, it's a capacity, and some people or situations or art or many things may like spark it and enhance it or threaten it, but it's ours. It's ours to cultivate, it's ours to recognize. You know, it's a very different picture than what we grow up with most of us. It absolutely is. And it's also outside of us though, isn't it? I mean, in Buddhism, the inside and the outside, aren't these sort of terms of convenience in relation to the reality of things, which is there just seems to be some kind of fundamental goodness to reality? Yeah, no, I think that is true, and it's almost more like we so exclusively tend to think of it as outside of ourselves in the hands of another, like what if they leave me? What if they don't like what I wrote? What if they criticize me? Then I'm nothing. And to realize that we respond to people with appreciation, with compassion from within, that there's a wholeness within us that other people may bring forth or people can't threaten us, you know? There's some really nasty people in this world too. Yeah, but we don't have to hold this hatred in our hearts for them. Yeah, look, we have this capacity no matter what we have to have love. Yeah, what I love about meditating and the exploration of the self or just following the breath and all the things that seem to go along with that, I don't know, the byproducts of that, you know, watching your breath, you're also, I'm not really in control of my breath. It just seems to do its own thing. And then your thoughts, of course, mindfulness, it's like, I'm certainly not making these thoughts, I hope I'm not, I would be so embarrassed and bummed by some of them. So these are just seem to be bubbling up. And obviously, like the external stuff, if you think you're controlling the wind, holy shit, you're out of your mind, you know? But then also, you know, what's going on with your lungs and within you, and it gets to the point where you start running into a really perplexing place where it's like, wait, the birds are the same as my thoughts. The birds are in the trees, like my thoughts are in my mind, both of these things are doing their own thing where am I? And so then somewhere within that, it's the nasty people, where are they? What is that? Fine, if there doesn't seem to be any kind of selfness in the normal sense of the word and within me, where is it in the people who are nasty? What is that? The growling people, the people who are manipulative, the people who are devious, and manipulative in the same way that you've had a lifetime of practice cultivating love and kindness. Some people have a lifetime of practice cultivating, manipulating and exploiting and hurting. What is that? Is that a reflection? Is that a reflection of something? Is it a malfunction? Is it a distortion? What is that? Well, it's a distortion, that's a good word for it. I think it's, you know, if I go back to the Buddha saying that everybody wants to be happy and not happy in a superficial sense, we want a sense of belonging. We want a sense of being at home somewhere in his body and his mind with one another on this planet. Right. We all want that and we are also very ignorant often about, we don't often have a clue about where real happiness is to be found and we are taught so many things, including outright lies, you know, about where happiness will be found and we're taught them again and again and again. And so we do absorb that and we do believe it and people do, you know, the most insane things to try to be happy because they think it will make them happy. And because we're not in a habit of introspection, really taking a look, you think, oh, that hurt, you know. Yeah, right. I had a great, it was so free, it was so amazing, you know. Look at that, look how lonely I am now or, you know, look at how I alienated all these people or I diminished them in some way and now I have, you know, it's just like, and so it's a combination, I think, of the ignorance and then not looking to see the results. And so, but we can, we can really say what's really hard, I think, for people, including me is that, you know, when we look at ourselves, when I look at myself and I've been, I've loved your sequence of words like growling, nasty, you know, whatever. Yeah. It does come from a place of pain in me. You know, not believing I'm worth anything or not believing in the consequences of action or, you know, things don't matter or whatever it is. It's some real ignorance. But you look at some other people, somebody asked me this question once, I was on a panel, they said, I look at these people who are causing so much harm in this world and they don't look like they're suffering. They look pretty self-satisfied. You know, he said, if I could, oh, and I said, I agree, you know, that's hard for me too. So they started fraying at the edges. I think, oh, good, you know, I can have compassion. Bleeding eyes, just one bloody tear every once in a while. Please, that would help so much. A tooth falls out, some kind of just like, like, you know, a slow motion, the same thing that happens to vampires when you, in movies, when the light shines, it just has slow motion disintegration of evil would be amazing. But, yeah. But, you know, of course, the, I have, as I'm rolling through my mind, I can't bring up one single person who's an obvious jerk that actually seems happy. Like maybe, you know, you watch like your favorite, like, hyper-conservative polemicist, whoever it may be, or hyper-leftist polemicist, watch it just to someone who's getting paid to get pissed off and say scandalous things. They don't look happy. In other words, they're having a baby's great because I could just think, would I want them to hold my baby? You know what I mean? You, I wish I could hand the baby to this. I would love for you to hold the baby. Sean Hannity, no, I would not want him to hold the baby. You know? So I think, you know, there's some power in them. There's some, ah, in them. But they don't have enough power that they would make you want them to hold the most precious thing there is. So I don't know if that's necessarily bloody tears, but it's pretty embarrassing if people don't want you to hold their baby. I think that's beautiful. I'm gonna try to quote you. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. I would love that. But, Sharon, I, there's something I wanted to talk with you talk with you about, and it's, so I was, you know, as I was getting ready to chat with you and what time went by so fast when I have about 10 more minutes. I became really fascinated with Deepa Ma. Deepa Ma. It's so beautiful. And I started researching her and I just wondered if I could ask you a few questions about your experience with her. I'm so happy. You know, she's the person who told me to teach. Yes, I do, yes, I do know that. And I remember we talked about that in an interview and then so I wanted to look deeper into what she was talking about. And I was really thrilled to find out that, because now I have a real, you know, not that there aren't real families, but now I have a, I guess you could say a typical family structure. And she's considered the patron saint of householders from what I read. Now, I just wanna, hopefully this will work. I'm gonna try this. I found this online. Are you seeing that? That image on the screen, do you see that? See, I knew that would happen. Hang on Sharon, sorry. Sharon, can you hear me? Ah, bummer. Okay, hang on. Can you hear me Sharon? Yes. Did you hear me when I was showing you that image? Okay, I don't know what's happening. For whatever reason, the audio just doesn't translate into the next place. I don't wanna mess with it because who needs the images? I can put them up later, it doesn't matter. But so I was really fascinated by her because she seems to be this connection for some of the great Buddhist teachers of the West right now. Joseph Goldstein, Jack Cornfield, Sharon Salzburg, if you haven't heard of her, you should. She's wonderful, you should look into her. And what I found specifically wonderful about her was it seems like she was teaching a kind of, that there was no boundary between formal meditation and life. And that the quote, and I'm gonna read it and I'll pop right back so we can hear you talk about it. The quote that I found, and I assume there will be sound in the next frame, so my apologies for this, but I'll just read the, I'm gonna read this quote. Can you still hear me Sharon? Yeah. Oh, perfect, okay. If you are busy, then busyness is the meditation. And when you do calculations, know that you are doing calculations. Meditation is always possible at any time. If you are rushing to the office, then you should be mindful of rushing. Deepa ma, now, does that also mean that when I'm drinking whiskey, I'm meditating? Oh, you're practicing something. I'm sorry, but can you talk a little bit about this because I love it, but it seems like an easy way to trick yourself into thinking you're meditating. You know, what you said to me really hit home. It was a kind of wrathful thing to say in the best possible sense of the word and it worked. It burned into me and I'm so happy that I practice now. And I don't think that, I'm not at the point of realization where I can say, oh yes, this is meditating too. This is meditating, this is meditating. Some things don't seem like that at all. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the positive side of this and also the way you get caught in that kind of thinking. Yeah, well, I mean, one actual translation of the word that we translate usually as meditation, the word is Bhavana, B-H-A-V-A-N-A in like a poly, language of the original Buddhist texts. It means cultivation. So yes, if you're drinking whiskey and watching something on TV, you are cultivating something. Right. It's a meditation, but is it what you wanna be cultivating? Right. You know, and there's a point where we have to use the circumstance we are in and that may be that you're very busy. Maybe you don't have much time to sit down formally and close your eyes and you can certainly use those situations and they're creative and they're important and it's part of bringing things into your life, but people do actually misuse that, not deepermore, of course, you know, but I've heard it many times, the most uncharming way is probably I was teaching a class in New York and somebody said, well, a lot of younger meditation teachers than you say you don't have to do a formal period of practice every day. So, what do you think? So from my dotage, I said, well, you know, I think theoretically that is true and it's really a theory. That is really the story we tell. It can happen and it needs to happen, you know, riding the subway, meeting a stranger, thanking somebody on the street, being asked for money on the street, holding your baby, you know, your baby's not sleeping, you know. We want to be able to bring more balance, more awareness, more love, more compassion to cultivate those states in every one of those circumstances, but what's gonna make that easiest and what's gonna make that real? You know, there's a contemporary of Deepa Muzz who she wasn't actually my teacher, but she was a teacher and also a Bengali woman and who'd been put in an arranged marriage which is part of Deepa Muzz's story. But she had a different story. She had very tyrannical in-laws and this other woman and they never let her formally meditate. They never let her go off on retreat. Yet she grew and advanced and became a teacher and so people used to ask her, how did you do that when you couldn't go on retreat? And she'd say it was very mindful, stirring the rice. Wow. And I knew the difference between her and me is that she really was very mindful, stirring the rice. It's what she had. Right. Her intention to grow and understand was so strong. Whereas I could say very glibly, well, everything's meditation, and you know, I'm mindful, stirring the rice, but am I really mindful, stirring the rice? Probably not. Right. You know, there's one thing. So to only practice without some kind of basis in a more formal practice is probably the hardest thing of all. It's doable and it's important to look at, but if you can have both, how great is that, you know? Right. I've read some stuff about it and what comes across over and over again is, it is like just what you're saying. It's possible in the way some four-year-olds play Beethoven on the piano. It happens, but you go and play the piano and see how it sounds. And if it's not Beethoven, don't act like it is, right? It's more like that. But then, as I was researching Deep of Mind, I wonder if you could talk about this or we could wrap up on this question. And it's a kind of frosting-style question, but it's something that I'm interested in. In Buddhism, I have noticed that there does seem to be a mystical quality to it and that there, I've had my experiences that I don't wanna talk about right now just because I don't understand them at all and I don't, like I don't, I'm doing the Chogim Chrompa disowning thing, so to speak, so whatever. But then there does seem to be this sort of secret in Buddhism. I don't know if you'd even call it a secret or I mean, it's out there, but you know what I mean. It's not what they focus on. It's not even mentioned. It's usually just, you know, go practice, watch your breath. And then within that, some things can happen that I've read about merging with a Buddha mind, so to speak, potentially some kind of experience that might seem to be like making a connection with a higher self, so to speak, or something, you know, it's so funny. If you say, you know, I went and meditated and had an experience of hearing or connecting with some kind of angelic form. People are like, watch out, man, are you okay? If you're like, I smoked DMT and I talked to entities, they're like, cool, that's awesome, right? If you do it, it's like so, but with Buddhism and it's really sort of, this stuff gets strangely swept under the rug. So I was reading the Wikipedia of Deepama and it said that she was demonstrating miracles, that she had been studying a style of Buddhism that had within it some kind of esoteric, mystical, magical lessons or stages, and as described in Wikipedia, it's just Wikipedia, so who knows, walking through walls, flying through the air, I believe, there were some others, but those are the two that stuck out. Can you talk a little bit about that? If I were going to sit somewhere, she could take a potato and bake it in her hands and make it taste like chocolate, that was pretty cool. Whoa, I will take that over walking through walls. We have doors, but can you talk a little bit about this? Did you witness anything like that? I never saw her do it, but it certainly was discussed. I mean, she, I wouldn't call it esoteric exactly. It's like the definition of normality in a lot of Asian, a lot of the Asian worlds is very different than ours. It's much broader than ours, but there are practices and they're ordinary practices, but she was really good at them. Maybe the best way of describing it is, within any kind of Buddhist approach, there are certain practices that rest primarily on the strength of concentration, I'll describe that in a minute, and then there are practices that rest primarily on the strength of mindfulness. Like David Nickton may have different vocabulary for this, but it's there somewhere. So concentration is just gathering our scattered energy and awareness together. So you're aware of the breath and your mind is all over the place and you go back, right? And if you do that enough, your mind gets very focused. It's like the energy of the universe becomes available to you. And there are certain experiences you can have if you only did that, if you only kept coming back to the breath and back to the breath, which are called jhana. It's like, sometimes it's translated as trance, which isn't right. It's like altered states of consciousness that are extraordinary. So if you pursue only that and you're just gathering all this energy in it and claim to it, then that's said to be the path to psychic power. Most teachers do, and it's sort of in the Buddhist framework, is you practice that a little bit as we do, and when you get concentrated enough, you more start paying attention to a wider array of experiences, physical pain and pleasure and sorrow and joy and all the different things that are coming up, restlessness and calm, and you're just opening your awareness so that what you're looking at is the kind of the changing nature of all those things, and you're almost looking at change itself in the end. So that's why mindfulness, which is that more open awareness, is said to lead to wisdom or insight, whereas only concentration will lead to power. If you're only practicing concentration, it's not going to necessarily make you more loving. It's not going to make you wiser, but it will make you more powerful. So then there are ways of practicing. Mininja was also Deepama's teacher when she was in Burma, and she got to be a Dharma student through incredible painful suffering. She was in an arranged marriage, but when she was like 12, I think, but she and her husband fell very deeply in love, and then they didn't have children for about 18 years, which was considered her problem and a disgrace. But her husband really loved her, and he didn't want to get another wife, and then they had three children, two of which died, two of whom died. And they were living in Burma at the time, they were Bengali, but her husband was in civil service. They were living in Burma, and one day he came home from work who wasn't feeling that well, and he died by that night. So she was completely overcome by grief, and she developed a heart condition, she couldn't get out of bed, and she just had Deepa. Deepama was like a nickname, Deepa's mother. She had Deepa to raise, but she couldn't get out of bed. The doctor came and said, you're actually gonna die of a broken heart, unless you do something about your mind, you should learn how to meditate. So she got up, she got out of bed, and the meditation room was on what we would call the second floor, and they said she was too weak to actually walk up the stairs, she had to crawl up the stairs to get to the meditation room, and she practiced, and when she came out, it's like somehow she had metabolized the terrible suffering into compassion. And she was a beautiful, compassionate person, although fierce. It's like when you were talking to me earlier, I thought, you know, you sit with her, and she said, no naps, like you sit, you know? Right. Like she was very fierce, but she was incredibly kind and loving, and I started with all kinds of people, and she never deviated from that, because she knew, like anyone's life could change at a dime. You know, you pick up your phone, and you have a different life than the one you had before two seconds ago. Right. And she knew that, everyone was included in that kind of compassion. So way back in that time, Mininja was her teacher in Burma, and he decided he wanted to take out some of the ancient texts to talk about how to develop those powers, and see if it was true. So she had phenomenal concentration, so we tried it with her. And it's something like, you know, in those cultures that consider physical phenomenon to be earth, air, water, fire, and space, and she could focus so strongly, say, on space. They said she could see the space between the molecules and the wall. She could just go through. Wow. You know, it's interesting, because I have friends who are so upset about that, and they were saying, did you see it? And I said, no, I didn't see it. But if they hear a story about New Coral Vava, who didn't do that necessarily, but could say to it, like you said, to a friend of mine, and this is, you know, it was so long ago, there were no cell phones. This was the year when, if you wanted to call someone in the States, you had to go to a city like New Delhi, and go to an international hotel, and book a trunk call for 24 hours, and then, you know, to then scream into the phone. So, you know, a friend of mine was there once, and Maharaja and New Coral Vava got everyone else to leave, except this guy and his wife, and on Monday, he said to them, you should call your mother, your family needs you. So then they had to go from like, Brindavan to New Delhi, check into the hotel, and 24 hours later, he was talking to his mother, and his mother said, oh, thank God the State Department found you. Wow. Yeah. And so I asked these friends who are very upset, I said, do you believe that? And they said, oh yeah, you know, and I said, why do you believe that, and not someone being able to walk through walls? And they said, because one is the mind, and the other is like physical reality. So, you know, is that different? You know, like, you know, it seemed to me that's a very impressive accomplishment, to be able to look at somebody and say, cool, oh, you know, I don't know where. Right. You know, the world is just bigger and stranger than we take it to be. So, I just think of her, her sort of psychic attainments in that light, you know, like, I didn't see them, people I trusted saw them, like I'm an injured trainer in them. And at the same time, they were so not what you think about, like, I never think about her making a potato in her hand. You know, they make me taste like chocolate. I think about her telling me to teach. I think about how loving she was, you know? Well, and also, you know, what's so funny about these miracles, and I think I understand why, not why not, I think, because I think personally, it would be impolite for someone to demonstrate that to me at this moment in my life. It would throw me off if I saw someone walk through a wall. I'd never stop talking about it. It would be ridiculous. And I would also probably always have bloody noses from trying it myself. So it'd be you. Make space, just keep changing the space. Find the space between the molecules. But also, there is something to me that is spectacularly miraculous about the fact that I'm talking to you right now using this incredible technology. And probably the reason that I'm having, not only having this conversation with you, but also that my life is fundamentally improved because of a couple of sentences you said to me was because of your encounter with this person. Totally. That's way better than a chocolate potato or walking through walls. I can get a chocolate potato, theoretically. I can go make one in the kitchen. And I can, if I wanna walk through a wall, I can do it. I have a door. It separates different areas in the house. So I think that's something that gets really overlooked with these people. Everyone's like, holy shit, they knew that. They said, go call that person, but they don't even think about like, yeah. And also they created a ripple that is continuing to move through society in a way that we don't even know where it's gonna go. That, to me, is a grand miracle. And definitely would rather have one Sharon Salzburg than a trillion chocolate potatoes. Thank you. Oh. An infinite number, a sea of chocolate potatoes. Sharon, thank you so much for giving me your time. I'm very grateful to you. And these moments are really special to me. And thank you very much. Thank you so much. And I can't wait to see you and hold the baby. Oh, I cannot wait. I can't wait for the spring. And I'm gonna be, this time I'm doing the challenge. All right. Joining in, this time I signed up last time and I didn't pull it off. This time is different. But could you please tell the listeners or the watchers potentially where they can find you and how they can connect with you? Yeah. That is to SharonSalsburg.com. And all the information about the challenge should be very prominent on there. We're gonna start February 1st. And I think there's a little leeway if we wanna start a little bit later, but it does start. And really it's a beautiful, strengthened community kind of exercise. And people get a lot out of it. So I'm really happy. It's time we're rolling around again. Me too. And I'll see you real soon. Sharon, thank you so much. Hare Krishna, thank you. Thank you. That was SharonSalsburg, everybody.

What you're about to listen to, it was an idea I had for like a kind of special Halloween episode. It is definitely not the recording of somebody who represents a group of people that have made contact with a very powerful legion of aliens who are about to appear on our planet. It's just an actor that I got to say what you're about to listen to. So don't worry, I'm not being threatened. I definitely did not make an agreement with a very powerful group of people to put secret messages into this podcast in exchange for wealth and power. It's just a Halloween gag. So this is what I was gonna do until I realized by the time anybody listened to this, it wouldn't even be Halloween anyway. You know we have an agreement and if you break this agreement, it's gonna be very detrimental to your wellbeing. You know what you're supposed to do with your podcast. You know the messages that you're supposed to put out there. So if you decide to break this contract, are you recording this? Obviously I did not record a person who represents a group of people that have made contact with a fleet of alien ships that are just outside of Jupiter and are about to make this their home planet. I have most certainly not made a deal with them in which in exchange for playing a simple tone on my podcast, a sound wave on my podcast, I will receive more wealth than I've ever dreamed of and eternal life along with a harem of some of the most beautiful, not just women but beings from all across the galaxy. Nope, this is just a Halloween gag, meaning the following tone that you're about to hear is nothing you should worry about and in fact is something you should enjoy with headphones and a room with ultraviolet light preferably and you should listen to it at least three times in a row to ensure that the sonic seeds or the eggs of the great mother are planted in the nest of your wretched human mind. Again, I'm not selling out my species, just a fun Halloween gag. So let's listen to this innocent tone that is definitely not a mind control sound wave that will force you to be obedient to the great ones when at last they come. Welcome to the world of transformation. Yes, ma'am. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Are you happy now? Ah! I've definitely not sold my species out to aliens but even if I had, I would still be excited about today's guest, Mitch Horowitz is with us today. We're gonna jump right into it but first, some quick business. I can remember one of my friends telling me the terrible story of feeling his teeth get punched out by a upset pseudo web designer who had become frustrated with his notes and crawled into his window, wearing a pair of brass knuckles and carrying a iron pentagram. He smashed his teeth in with the brass knuckles and then he heated up that iron pentagram and left a horrible eternal burn on my friend's neck. This used to happen all the time because pseudo web designers who barely understood how to make websites would get all jacked up on meth or amphetamines and then you would complain about the horrific website that they made for you and they would come and just break your legs, beat you, abuse you, burn you or even climb into family cemeteries and dig up the coffins and crypts of your family members and desecrate their bodies. We no longer have to go through this thanks to Squarespace.com because Squarespace has everything you need to make a beautiful website. They have award-winning templates that you can choose from to create any kind of website you desire. They have everything you need from a shopping cart function to the ability to size to any device. You no longer have to worry about having to rewrite HTML or even worse, ask some moon-boggled lunatic to make it so that your website fits to every device, a request that would surely end with you waking up in the middle of the night with chopsticks being hammered into your nipples by a lunatic. We're safe now. We have Squarespace to save us from these horrible moments. I still have scars on my nipples from those days. Squarespace, you don't need it just because you wanna build a business, by the way. It's the ultimate tool if you just wanna make an announcement, if you wanna promote your band, if your wedding's coming up, or maybe you just want to make a website that you could send to your dad that makes him think someone has built a website accusing him of being in cahoots with ISIS. I'm not recommending that you do that, but you certainly could do that by going to Squarespace.com. Ford slash Duncan.

And finally, if you're in LA on Friday, November the 16th, I'm gonna be doing a kind of podcast thing. I don't know what you call it. With my meditation teacher, David Nickturn, that's gonna be at the Samarasah Center from seven to nine o'clock. And it's a conversation that we have about meditation and Buddhism. I've really enjoyed these chats and I hope you will head out and say hello. That's Friday, November the 16th at the Samarasah Center in Echo Park. All right, let's do this podcast. Sweet friends, today's guest is a occult scholar an expert in metaphysics, an author and a wonderful speaker who has just published a fantastic book on the topic of new thought, which you might be familiar with if you've seen The Secret or if you've read Napoleon Hill's Thinking Row Rich or Ernest Holmes, The Science of Mind or if you live in LA and go to Agape Church. It's the concept that our thoughts create reality and different methods that can be used based on that concept to bring us closer to our goals and to bring things into our lives that we desire. It's a fantastic and controversial philosophy and our guest today does a brilliant job not only in explaining this idea but also in addressing some of the more difficult, paradoxical parts of the idea that some other authors seem afraid to even mention. You can find out more about Mitch by going to MitchHorowitz.com. I'll have all the links at DuncanTrestle.com but now everybody please welcome to the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast, Mitch Horowitz. Here we go. Welcome, welcome, welcome to you that you are with us. Shake hands for me to be blue. Welcome to you. Wha, what? It's the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast. Mitch, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for being a guest. Thank you. Great to be here. I am a big fan of yours. And I admire your ability not just to write, but also your ability to convey some of these very dense ideas in an informative and entertaining way that are, I think, so important to be able to be a bridge like that. And so I was floored in an interesting way, knowing you were coming here in the sense that there's a million different things that we could talk about. But I thought you have this wonderful book, The Miracle Club, that's out right now, which is, covers a thing that I have been deeply interested in and have used with some success and also have a little bit of, for lack of a better word, apprehension about it to some degree. Is that the right word? Not appreh, yeah, apprehension. And so that's what I'd love to talk about. And I really want to take advantage of the time that we have so that my listeners can maybe get a little seminar in converting thought patterns into reality, which I think is a possibility, but maybe isn't as quite as easy as it sounds. So I just want to start off with a question I saw you ask yourself in one of your many great talks online. Is the purpose of the spiritual search, thy will be done or my will be done? That's the central question. That's the central question. I want to be very plain about answering that rather than alluding it or trying to dilute or change the question. For me, at age 52, the central purpose is my will be done. That's the path I walk. I believe that desire is sacred. I believe that we are here for a limited period of time to be generative and to be productive. And I realize all the baggage that my response comes with. I realize people are going to hear that and say, well, which I, and which I are you thinking from? Which I are you manifesting from? Is there a difference between the higher will and the lower will? I honor and I bow before all those questions, but I've been walking this path for a long time. And I'm not going to be here for an infinite amount of time. When you're looking at life from middle age and from children who have entered adolescence, it tends to render your focus sharper and more serious. And I believe that the individual will and individual desire is sacred. And I don't make a distinction between higher and lower. And frankly, at this point in my path, I don't even make a distinction among multiple eyes. I don't speak in terms of ego, inner, outer, personality, essence. I think there's one of you and me, and we're here for a finite period of time. Many things have claims on us, but attainment has a primary claim, I believe. And I believe in the statement, my will be done. Cool, that's great. Okay, great. You just made me scratch off all the other questions I have for you. Wait, just hang out and enjoy the weather? Yeah, why not? Well, I did one thing that, and again, okay, before this question, there's like, oh God, forgive me, I'm going to quote Bob Marley. All right. A hungry man is an angry man. Yeah. And I think that it's all good and well to get to this point of like, thy will be done through me. Therefore, I'm not going to sort of try, or I'm not going to push forward some something into the world that's going to give me material comfort. Yes. But when you're hungry, or you have a kid that needs food, or there's like an actual deep, deep, real primordial need there. Yes. I don't know, the thy will be done thing, I think becomes a little, it seems like a great idea. Yes. Until you need a glass of water and there's no water around. Yes. And you know, some survival issues. So that being said, I was watching a Chogim Chomper Rinpoche talk, and he said something that stuck with me, which is, before you can reject yourself, you need to know yourself. Yes. Similarly, even though you did say, look, it's all sacred, I do feel like, isn't there a sort of step-by-step process here before you start getting into mind manifestation? Won't it save you some trouble to actually know who you are so you can really know what you want? Yeah.

These sweet, wonderful, magical chewables are made in the USA and since Bluechew prepares and ships direct, they're cheaper than a pharmacy. Thank you, Bluechew. That's a wonderful question. My wish is that getting in touch with one's authentic desires becomes a form of self-scrutiny, a path to self-scrutiny because there are going to be failures. There are going to be dead ends. There are especially going to be failures of perspective. We've all had the experience where we wanted something. Maybe we lusted after another person or maybe there was a particular job offer that we wanted to get and I've certainly had experiences where I could be very persuasive with myself and others about something I wanted to attain, maybe something in my career and I've had the experience, as I'm sure your listeners have had, of not getting it and saying, thank God I didn't get that. That would have been the worst thing and that calls into question about this whole nature of who am I, what is my perspective? Am I able to see more than a couple of feet forward on the road? My contention is this. I think that over the course of life there are inevitably times where we're going to make terrible mistakes. We're going to demonstrate a lack of perspective. We're going to be thinking from a place of very short-term gratification and we may get hurt. But I do believe, I really do believe in my heart that there are instances in life where every sensitive person does have moments of exquisite clarity and exquisite perspective. And I was just speaking with someone about this. There are some people you meet who know exactly what they want out of life at age six and however they get buffeted around by the currents of life, they still know it. They still know it and they feel intrinsically when they're separate from it, when they're gravitating more closely to it. I would say in truth, we all have that primordial understanding of what we really want. We may circle around it. We may hit dead ends. We may bump into walls. But I don't think that life has played this cruel joke on us in which we're fully bereft of perspective. We're sometimes bereft of it and we're sometimes misled and we will get hurt. But there are many, many times, I think, moments of sensitivity, moments of exquisite instinct where we do feel what we want. And I counsel people, follow that. That's precious, precious information that we're being granted. Cool. Because it's like, yeah, you get these desires and then it's sort of like the Buddhist concept of the poison arrow. So here is some desire, whatever it may be. And then the desire gets almost instantly followed with a myriad of judgments or potential repercussions or this is an indication of you slipping into a bad place or all of these things follow this initial desire. And it seems like what you're saying is that initial desire has within it some kind of truth, some kind of... I really believe it does. And it's funny, we repeat things to ourselves like, well, money doesn't make you happy or career success doesn't make you happy. And I would take a second look at those truisms. I would take a second look at those truisms because, for example, let's say you can identify a famous actor who behaves obnoxiously. And there are any number of examples that you could select from. You could look at that person and say, well, see, he's a case in point. The pinnacle of success hasn't made him happy. He misbehaves. And I would say, well, let's take a second look at this. It may be true that that person misbehaves and that is a problem. It's also a problem for those around that person and they have things to answer for themselves because they're remaining in his orbit because he gives them goodies. But the fact is, if that person didn't become the performer that he or she is, I believe they would probably have a yawning gap in their lives and they would probably feel a sense of being lost and stuck in a kind of vacuum and not knowing what to do. I think our desires can point towards something very vital and significant. I was watching recently this two-part documentary about Elvis Presley on HBO and Bruce Springsteen was narrating part of it. And Bruce said that later in his life, when Elvis was up on stage in his sequined jumpsuit and everything, that actually was the real guy. That's who he was. And it was only when he got home at night and tried to function as a private individual that he had difficulties. And I thought that was a good observation and it was probably an observation basically that Bruce was making about himself and putting on somebody else, which is what we often do, but I thought it was valid. But I also thought to myself, and so what? And so what? I think he's correct. That was the guy on stage. He was funny, he was relaxed, his fans loved him, he loved them. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? He was providing for people. I'm not aware that he ever did anything that deprived anybody of anything around him to which they were entitled. So what's wrong if Elvis was only real when he was on stage? I think we have to be flexible about these things and we have to ask ourselves, maybe that's exactly where he belonged and exactly what he should be doing. So he never got the garage door fixed. All right, get somebody else to get the garage door fixed. It has to be fixed and we have to take care of that, but that's not his job. His job is to do that. What's your job? That's what I would put back onto the listener. Yeah, okay, okay, so this is great. And again, it's just every so many grimoires or so many books on magic, they start off with this inevitable warning. Beware, beware, beware, your mind, you'll lose your, even the cutting through spiritual materialism that Trump has starts with. Don't go down this path if you can avoid it because once you start going down, you gotta go all the way. Once you jump in the river, all the way. So okay, warnings aside. Now, listeners have some desire. Whatever it may be, no matter how mundane or greedy or freakish or whatever, let's just say some folks have these desires and they want to bring this into their reality, whatever it is. And your book presents a kind of methodology that has been refined and developed by many people over time. And so I would just love to start getting into that methodology from the moment of knowing something that you want to the process that a person might go through to see some version of that appear in their own life in a real way. Yes, the inception point starts with a clarified passionate desire as we've been talking about. And that's easier, that's not as easy as it sounds and it's not as plainly available to us as it sounds because we mislead ourselves and we tell ourselves things by rote, I'd like to have lots of kids or I'd like to travel or I'd like to climb the corporate ladder or what have you. Beware of mental habits because we can get into this recitation of things that we feel will make us look good in the eyes of others or make us look good in our own eyes in some way. It's exquisitely important to have a clarified desire, not just a desire, but I'm even gonna go so far as to say an obsessive aim, a central wish that you have for your life to the exclusion of everything else because I think that kind of concentrated, psychical energy is extraordinarily impactful and important and if you scrutinize the lives of people you admire whether it be Bob Dylan or Nelson Mandela or Helen Keller or Steve Jobs or whomever it may happen to be, you will almost always find that that person was motivated by one obsessional desire and it was all consuming and it can be very threatening in a certain way because I think it's a tough bargain that life strikes with us. We're not given everything and I actually personally believe that well-roundedness is overrated. Bob Marley was not sitting around worrying about his tennis game or worrying about whether the dishwasher was fixed. He was being Bob Marley. He had this vision of himself as this musical prophet which he was, which he was. Helen Keller was dedicated to uplifting the idea of human possibility and human potential. I don't know whether she was a nice person to spend Christmas with or not. I have no idea. That was the central facet of her life. You have to arrive at that and that's a very tough bargain to strike with life but it can also be a very gratifying bargain. The next thing is you need to come up with a really concrete integrated plan of both mental visualization, affirmation, creativity and outer action and knowing just when to strike and you will know when you're exquisitely focused, relationships and tasks that are superfluous tend to fall away and I don't mean to sound ruthless about this. I'm just trying to be honest with the listener. When you become focused, you find that you develop much less taste and patience for things that are frivolous. That can include small talk, that can include movies or television shows that really truly are not worthwhile and that don't build your aim and your outlook and your point of view, books that don't build your aim and your outlook and your point of view. And I think you need to be very concrete with yourself about writing down and committing to paper what your goals are, dates, numbers, periods of time by which you wanna reach things. I think I'm not really talking about a go with the flow approach and the reason I prescribe this and the reason I think it's so important to write things down and to be specific in terms of numbers and dates is because these things not only serve to focus and harness one's mental energies and it's my contention that we do have mental energies that go beyond the cognitive and motor functions and such but the very act of writing something down from its point of inception is almost the bringing of a tactile physical actualization of what you're after into the world. And I would challenge the listener, try it, try it. Right now in my pocket, I am carrying with me a card on which I've written a particular goal, a particular sum of money and the date by which I want to reach it. And I have laminated this card with packing tape because I carry it with me everywhere and I want it to be very, very sturdy. There is a certain special something that comes from my carrying that card around because it's a tactile representation of my aim into the world and it's very no holds barred. It's realistic, but it's very, very bold. And my contention to you would be that if you do this as a mature adult, not flitting from one flower to another like a bumblebee, but you really know what you want and you're prepared to employ affirmation, visualization, prayer, chanting, meditation, every mental faculty that you're disposed including physical modalities. And you're willing to act in outer life in all kinds of ways that are constructive and that are appropriate to the furthering and the pursuit of your goal. And you do this with a concentrated, obsessive passion. You're going to get where you want to go. You're going to get where you want to go. Try it. Well, here's what I want to talk about. So a person finds themselves either, well, either the person just dies or they find themselves suddenly surrounded as a person begins to wake up. So a person suddenly finds themselves surrounded by this massive chaotic matter that they stumbled into throughout their lives. Cause they've been kind of like sleepwalking or whatever. And they thought they wanted this or they thought they wanted that, but quite often they end up in sort of what they think up as a rut or there's just a, they don't have enough money to pay rent. They can't, their car's about to get repossessed. They are alcoholics, their life is like in a kind of like very, very dark and darkened state. And within that darkened state, it's not just that around them is chaos, within their mind is some form of chaos and their will is very weak because they're sort of being, they've created a feedback loop where there's a constant reflection of all their past decisions in the form of everything around them. And it's affirming their, how could you, sort of their, I don't want to say impotence cause it sounds so severe, but it's kind of confirming this state. So I bring that up only because people in that state of consciousness, though they might want to have single pointed focus, even getting that is almost as difficult as a person whose legs have atrophied and who wants to stand up. Yes, yes. What I mean, their will has atrophied. And so now they do have the desire. Right, right. But it's, the desire is even foggy. So how does a person in that state begin to sharpen the will to get to this point of a kind of single pointed fixation? Yeah, that's a wonderful, wonderful question. And I would respond to that in a couple of ways. First, one of the things that I try to be very clear about in the book and that I refer to many times is that we do live under many laws and forces. I don't believe that within the cosmic framework that we have to function in within this life, not everything is controlled by this one mental super law, which is why I don't use terms like manifest or law of attraction or things like that. It may be, and this is part of a broader discussion, that awareness or intellect or consciousness is the ultimate arbiter of experience. And I do believe that's true, but I also believe that we live in a world in which we experience multiple laws and forces. The law of gravity, for example, is ever operative, but you'll experience it differently on the moon than on the planet Earth because gravity responds to mass. Our lives are a lot like that. So it's not that thought is the only game in town. Obviously we live under physical limitations. Our bodies eventually decline. There's mortality. There's never been an exception to that. So there are things facing the individual and there are emergencies facing the individual that I do not contend are the result of mind or thought. It's very, very important to understand that. And I think when the individual is in a desperate situation and he or she just doesn't know what's coming next, the repossession man may be outside the door and so on, there's a couple of things I would say. First of all, I believe very strongly in the power of prayer. And I don't believe life plays a cruel joke on us in which it sends some guy to tell you, hey, you gotta focus your thoughts, but when you're in emotional agony, you can't focus your thoughts. I can't focus my thoughts all the time. I happen to be in a very good mood right now and I'm psyched to be here with you, but I would be misrepresenting myself to the listener if I didn't say there are also times and nights where I'm in agony or I'm guilty of committing an act of road rage or I behave like a real asshole towards somebody and I don't mean to, but the Mitch that you're hearing right now is the best that I am. Thursday afternoon at two o'clock, I might be in a really shitty mood and be an asshole in Starbucks. And I might also be feeling very sad over something and not able to focus my thoughts. I do believe that prayer is a real and a powerful thing. I do believe in the existence of higher and extra physical forces outside us to whom we can appeal and I do believe that there are no rules involved in prayer. I've never liked the new thought orthodoxy that you have to pray in this state of calm expectancy and satisfaction as though you've already received what you're after and according to your faith, so shall it be. I know there's precedent for that in scripture, but there's also precedent in scripture for people arguing with God, for getting pissed off with God, for begging, for being angry, for asking God to change his or her mind about things like when Cain is punished for this act of fratricide, he says to God, the punishment you've given me, it's too great, I can't take it. And God says, okay, I'll amend it. I'll put this mark on you where nobody will be able to hurt you. And there are many instances in scripture of the creator changing his or her mind after somebody argues with him or confronts him. There are no rules with regard to prayer. That's fascinating. Yeah, it's right there, it's right there. People get pissed off and they're like, I can't put up with this. And he's like, okay, I'll work with you here. And so I do think that prayer is ever and always available and I do think extraordinary things can happen from it. I would also say that if you're in desperate need, don't condition your solution to such an extent that you narrow the path to which it can reach you. Magic or answered prayers or options or possibilities may reach you in all kinds of different ways. Accept them, accept them when they come into your life. If somebody offers you something, you accept it. You don't say, no, I think there might be something better over there. So it may be that you pray for relief from something and relief may come in an unusual unexpected way. It may even come in a way that brings with it other problems and complexities, but it's there. It's what's being presented to you. So when you're kind of going along the path, don't condition your ideas too heavily of what your response might look like. It might come to you in different ways. The path of prayer is open to you. It would be a cruel joke if channeling one's thoughts in positive directions were the only way to kind of get out of a problem because there are times honestly when we're facing emergencies or anguish where that it can't be done. And there are sufferings in life. New thought's failure is that it's never come up with a theology of suffering. It has never found a way to meet people who are suffering. That's one of the things I make an effort to work on or to correct in the Miracle Club because I do think that people who are suffering or who might have a disease from which frankly there is no real prospect of recovery, although there are miracles and there are anomalies and I talk about that in the book. But there are things that play out also according to convention and New Thought has to be able to meet those people as well. If you're forced to consume half a loaf of bread rather than a whole loaf and you have to, can that half a loaf be consumed while standing fully erect? And if so, other things may happen. Other things may happen that open up possibilities that are unexpected. New Thought has to be able to address that person. Yes, when New Thought, you can run into some really problematic, you can run into some problems with the math which one specific problem that I wanted to bring up to you is I was at a New Thought church once that I love and it's authentically like chain, like help. This stuff is not in a kind of like sweet way help. Literally has had a real, I've used it and it works. But I can remember sitting in this church and there was a sweepstake for a car. Someone, you know, there's a raise in money for the church and someone was gonna win this car. And I'm sitting there thinking like, wait a minute, are we now in a visualization contest? You know what I mean? Is it the person who like has in the best use, whatever this skill is or science or however it's science in mind, they've won and everybody else is a little weaker than them? Right, right. Or is it a multi-verse situation where you win the thing, and you split into another multi-verse where everyone else is lost? Could be. Or, so yeah, but you know what I'm saying? I do. Everyone on the planet suddenly begins to adhere to this sort of idea that I can focus my will and manifest or whatever word you want. I don't, what word would, well, I don't wanna get mixed up. Select actually is what I use, select. I could select some reality. Yeah. But in a planet where there appears to be limited resources. Yes. Problems with countries that you can't, you can't come into certain countries. That's exactly right. So how does this, to me that seems to be one of the big logical problems with this. How do you work that out? That's a great question. And you know, I would refer back to what I was saying a little while ago, which is that we do live under a complex of laws and forces. And I've always rejected the new age principle that there are no accidents. I think there are accidents. I think things that happen to people sometimes are matters of geography, economics, politics, things that are weather patterns, things that are completely out of the hand of the individual. So when the nation of the Philippines is struck by a horrible monsoon, I completely and roundedly reject the notion that some of my friends in New Thought might hold, which is that, well, you know, the vibrational frequency of people's thoughts was operating on the level of that disaster. There is absolutely no way to verify that. Yeah. In fact, I don't even want to hear from people in such situations who haven't passed through natural disasters, who haven't lived through war, who haven't lived through poverty. This is one of the reasons why I ultimately break with the way of thought of Rhonda Byrne, the writer and filmmaker behind The Secret. I think Rhonda has a lot of good insights into human nature, and there's a lot of very good things I can say about Rhonda. But she was being interviewed several years ago by a reporter from the Associated Press named Tara Burghardt. And Rhonda famously doesn't give interviews. And Tara just emailed her. And Rhonda responded to all these really hardcore questions. And my hat was really off to Tara. And she asked her the $64,000 question, which is plainly put, what do you say about people who perished in horrible events, like the Holocaust or 9-11, are you saying that their thoughts created that? And Rhonda responded by saying, well, first of all, there were also miraculous exceptions to those events. OK. And secondly, I do think that it is possible, this is Rhonda speaking, that a population of people can be thinking along the lines of a certain vibrational frequency that vibrate to or have an affinity or correlation with certain events. Not only do I disagree with that, but I think that if you speak about events that you haven't passed through or experienced yourself, such as a horrible catastrophe of war or environmental devastation or a tidal wave or an earthquake, it's nothing other than throwing a stone. I'm just speaking about and explaining away my neighbor's circumstance. I want to hear from the person who went through that him or herself if they're still around to record that to me. I want to hear the testimony of people who have been through this. Tell me about what you've been through. Tell me about what you've experienced, not what somebody has experienced from another country or another time and place that you've never gone through. I believe there are accidents. I believe that the law of mentation, if there is such a thing, is one vital part of our lives, one part that begs experimentation, along with many other things, including weather patterns and hostilities and political conflicts that the individual him or herself bears no responsibility for. I would also say this, particularly with respect to lotteries and gambling and cars. There are people who come to me sometimes and they want help at the poker table or something like that. And I'll do my best to help them because I do believe that the mind can play a role in these things. And I'll meet them where they are and I'll say, well, let's try this together. Just do me a favor. If you win, and I hope you do, give away 10% of whatever you want to someplace worthy. That's the deal. So let's see what happens. Let's try it together. But more often, I find that uncanny results and correlations occur in people's lives over an extended period of time. There's sometimes an interval or a gestation period. A human life requires nine months of gestation. A horse requires 11 months of gestation. There are gestation periods for everything in nature. So there must be apropos of our minds as well. So I ask people to watch very, very carefully what unfolds over a long period of time because we're very forgetful. We can be holding some thought and there's an interval and we forget all about it. Sometimes these things occur over very broad periods of time, not in connection with the sweepstakes or so. That's great. And that's such an important thing to realize Personally, I always want results way faster than they're ever going to come. Me too. Me too. In a big way. And so then there is this period in between whatever the thing may be, planting the seed, saying the prayer, preparing the focus. And then some amount of time passes. And within that amount of time, you might even see a reversal, some backsliding or something. And you're like, this shit doesn't work. Oh, shit. That's right. Fuck all of it. But yet, if you allow that sort of transitory phenomena to confuse you, then you can again start mentating, I guess you would say, certain patterns that are going to affirm that temporary thing. And then you end up going backwards. The backwards happens because of, let's say, whatever. Nature. Nature. It's just some unpredictable, chaotic thing. But then you attach to that a story. And the story is, fuck Horowitz or some version of it. This shit don't work. It's a bunch of, yeah, from the witches. Right. Sadly. And now you're producing the sort of the opposite of what you recommended, which is single-pointed focus on a specific thing. And how many mythological stories of realization are just prior to the realization of this being or that? That's right. That's right. Always met with the opposite of what they wanted to have happen. Always met by some test. Yes. And that was true of Moses, for example. If one makes a mythical reading of the life of Moses, he had all these weird ups and downs occur. He spoke with a speech impediment. He didn't want to be selected as the leader of the Hebrews. He committed a murder in anger. He never was able actually to get his arms around his anger problem. He was ultimately punished by God at the end of his life, not being permitted to enter the Promised Land because he was pissed off all the time. I mean, obviously, I'm making a mythical reading of the life of Moses. But it was very Byzantine and serpentine. And all kinds of things happened. But ultimately, ultimately, he did do what his aim was, which was he led the Hebrews out of Egypt. And it was very, very tough. And they spent a generation in the wilderness. All kinds of things occurred. But he did do that. And it was very serpentine. It's funny, there's this popular expression, careful what you wish for, you just might get it. And I do the forensics on that in the book. And the closest I've been able to come is I think that popular expression originated with Gerta, who put it differently. What he wrote was, what you wish for when you are young will come upon you in waves when you are old. So be careful. And a lot of people would want to argue with that and say, that doesn't make any sense to me. The ideals and the wishes I had when I was young haven't come upon me in waves. I'm very dissatisfied. Gerta's contention was, we are extremely forgetful. And if you take a yellow light and just don't judge what he's saying immediately, but actually really go back across the layers of your life and ask, is Gerta correct? Have I gotten in waves what I wished for, when I was young? Was I not careful? Was I not careful? That's where that popular expression comes from. How cool. That is so simultaneously terrifying and cool. Yeah, yeah. Holy shit, man. Oh my God. Wow, wow, wow, that's cool. Whoa. And I think that, so here are these waves crashing into our lives. And who knows? It depends on what lens you want to look through. Let's imagine, I'm reading this wonderful book on karma right now, and it's sort of breaking down the Vedic conception of karma, which has a lot of really, really cool breakdown, the different sorts of karma that some, there's like four types. One is the karma which has within it every single thing you've done thus far, including in all your past lives. This is sort of somehow intertwined in your energy body. And so this thing flowers into your life just like what Gerta might say, waves of this thing coming to you. Waves, yeah, yeah. And so now you have all these waves that are crashing in and you're looking at them and you're like, what the fuck? This is not what I want now. Yes. And so now you have to deal with it. Yes. And there's no way around it. You just have to pay your tab, you know? Right. You gotta pay the bill. There's no way out of that paying bill. Right, right. So I just want to talk a little bit about how to simultaneously pay the bill, so to speak, while working on from this sort of like tsunami of past karma. Yes. When you were unconscious, though I don't want to say you were unconscious as a teen, but you know, kind of just like, well, I mean, if I, when you look back at what you were as a teen versus what you are now, it's almost as though it might as well have been a past life. Yes, yes, yes. Okay, so how do we deal with not confusing our desire to not pay our karmic tab, so to speak, and the thing that we actually want? How do I discern these two things? That's fascinating. This question, and I've wrestled with this myself, you know, how does one pay the karmic debt while also pursuing aspiration? Yeah. You know, because it seems like these could be two tasks that pull you in opposite directions. And now it's interesting, if you were to speak to somebody who was a traditional Hindu, he or she would say, well, what is karma? Karma can be seen as the accumulation of past lives, and as you're alluding all the events from these past lives. If you were to speak to somebody who's interested in, say, the multiple worlds theory of the physicist Hugh Everett, and Hugh Everett who was interpreting the Schrodinger's cat experiment to mean that we live in multiple worlds. There are multiple outcomes and possibilities. There's an infinitude of events going on, all the time, all around us, which is why I use the word select rather than manifest, because I grew to what Hugh Everett was talking about. And he would say, well, you know, if you were to take that idea to its ultimate extent, it's possible that there are an infinitude of wives, episodes, things occurring all around us. And Hugh Everett might say, you know, I agree with the traditional Hindu, but he and I have a little bit of a different way of looking at things. I don't so much see it as past lives as I do intimate lives. And what happens in those intimate lives may be going on all the time. So your way of paying your karmic debt, so to speak, might be selecting something different, might be selecting an approach of nonviolence if there's been violence in your past, at least in as much as you can cognitively recall it. So I always tell people, you know, this act of selection could be not only your pathway into entering an experience, but it also could be a manner of paying the karmic tab, so to speak. And choosing a path or attempting to choose a path of nonviolence to the greatest extent possible can be extremely important. And when I say nonviolence, I'm not just limiting that strictly to a physical definition, but what I'm saying is not doing anything that would violate anybody else's ability to seek his or her highest sense of self-expression. Man, that is such a great definition. And how easy is it to hear nonviolence and think, okay, no problem, I'm just not gonna go around punching people. Right. You know, you hear something like that, and you're like, ah, that's easy, nonviolence, I'm not very violent. And then I find myself sitting with someone, and I am giving them an unholy ear beating about Cog-U Buddhism. And I'm watching this aggressive recitation of something, they're clearly not that interested in. Right, right. Pouring out of me in this weird, in a weird, it's like, feels masturbatory, and it's gross to watch, and you wanna jump out of your own body because you're like, watching this like, this person, they are nice because they're listening to you. Yeah. Yet, if you really, if I look at like the energy that I'm, that's sort of tied up in the thing I'm saying, there's aggression. Aggression, and I will say this, and I don't say this to be morbidly self-disclosing, but I say it because I think people will relate to this. I can track out periods of my life, especially where I'm standing there in front of the shaving mirror, and I'm shaving away, and my thoughts are just going, going on this repeat loop. And I'm having these horrible revenge fantasies, things that I might never act on in a tactile way, but I'm thinking of people who said or did something that really pissed me off, people who did something that I felt was really selfish or irresponsible, and I look at the clock and an hour and 15 minutes have passed, and I've been thinking about this person while I'm shaving, while I'm showering, while I'm preparing breakfast, while I'm commuting, while I'm riding my bike, whatever it is, and I ask myself, what am I unleashing in my life? I mean, medically, you could tell, if you sort of hooked me up to various sensory equipment that there's probably bad stuff going on in my body, but what else is going on? What else is going on? And that's a kind of violence. That's a kind of violence of the psyche, and I believe it has to have consequence, and that's been one of the most difficult things for me to wrap myself around, because I will, these thoughts can become very revolving and consume enormous amounts of time and energy. What's the consequence of that? I know, I had this realization, this sort of paranoid realization. I was thinking about shit talking, the habit that people have of shit talking. Heavy, yes, yes. And like, so there's the past time of shit talking. I'm a comedian, so many of my friends are comedians, and my God, it's like tennis for comedians. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was okay, but so I was just sort of thinking though about this sort of game, and it's the shit talk game, where usually you'll bring up some person, and then within that, there's usually the masquerade of maybe some kind of legitimate concern. It's blah, blah, blah, okay? Right, right. Did you see what the, you know what I mean? But really, within it is like, you've taken this simulated version of a person and thrown it out on this weird game board, which is the connection between you and the person talking. It's an arena, and then you start letting these judgment lines run out to attack the person until the person has just been desiccated by both of you and your friends, sophisticated and self-frighteous outlook. So I was thinking about that, and I was thinking, wait a minute, if there were some metaphysical slash mycilio-connective mechanism connecting us to that person, then you'd be charging that person up with all your negativity, and maybe that person, when you got around them, would act in some way that they might not have because they've gotten this heavy charge. Anyway, I had this dream after I'd been thinking that and getting really paranoid. And the dream was, I'm sure you get these dreams, someone comes and tells you something, and you can never, I can never see who it is. And the person is saying to me, it's usually a group of people these days, but people are saying, listen, regardless whether that's true or not, you have created a part of your brain that is this person, this is a simulated person. And when you're talking shit about the person, really what you're doing is cutting a little tiny simulated part of your brain and hurting yourself, it doesn't matter, who knows. Yes, yes. But why are you like beating up something that's living in your head? Yes. That. You know, speaking in terms of the practical, and you were asking me before about what a person can do, who's in anguish or who's in some desperate situation, I wanna lay this on everybody and on myself. And this is really the truth. And you can use this and you can use this right now. If you desist from all gossip and tail-bearing and rumor-spreading, you will find yourself standing more erect almost instantly. There is a nobility that gets infused in the character of the person who resists gossip and rumors and trash talk that is felt almost immediately. And it's incredible. When I was a kid, I had an Orthodox bar mitzvah. I grew up in a traditional Jewish household and I went to a synagogue in Queens. I read about this in the Miracle Club and there was a rabbi who was in charge of the Youth Congregation. And the Youth Congregation was like the worst job because these were rowdy kids who didn't wanna be cooped up in some basement of a synagogue on a sunny Saturday afternoon and we behaved like shit and we were terrible. And one day, this rabbi whose name was Larry Ziffer. He lives in Baltimore today. I always give dates and names because I want people to be able to shadow me and follow me on this shit so they know I'm not making anything up. I just spoke to Larry recently. Larry Ziffer, he was a youth rabbi. He lives in Baltimore today. And he was speaking to the congregation of kids one morning. You know, just kids, young adolescents, rowdy. And he said, within Judaism, the only sin that surpasses rumor and tail-bearing is that of murder. So only by murdering someone have you done something worse in the eyes of the creator than if you trash-talk them and you put them down. And I tell you, that room full of kids was so silent and so quiet and you could just feel this pregnant energy in the room where every kid in that room by dint of his silence was demonstrating, he knew he was being told the absolute truth. And I swear to you, I'll never forget these words. Larry, who was a slight man, a thin man, he looked out, but it could have been as if a 12-foot giant was talking to us. He said to the group of kids, there's no joke about it. There's no joke about it. That gossip and tail-bearing is surpassed only by murder because when you're killing someone's reputation, that is tandem out to wiping out the individual. And I never forgot it. I was nine years old and I never forgot it. And the beauty of this is, and thank you, Larry, is available to everybody. All you need to do as you're being asked, desist from rumor, desist from gossip. People don't wanna do it because it's enjoyable, it floods us with adrenaline, it makes us feel important. We like to interject ourselves into the lives of other people. We're afraid that we're gonna be boring to people if we don't gossip and tail-bear. We won't have the goodies to expose to them at lunch and everything. My challenge is just try it. You'll feel out of sorts for about an hour. That feeling will pass and you will feel so much better. It's a universal law, just try it. Wow, man. It's almost like conversational alcoholism or something. Yes, exactly. Alcoholics feel like they gotta do this shit. Exactly. Yeah, yeah. And you do, I've noticed one thing to do, which I wouldn't, I mean, I listen to Mitch. I don't know what, but. Playing traffic. The next thing, time, you do find yourself doing this game of shit talking somebody with someone. Instead of stopping yourself, maybe give yourself one more time to do it, but this time actually really look at the way you feel when you're doing it. Yes, yes. Because it's like, yeah, I guess there is this kind of like, it's eating something that's like hyper, hyper sweet or something. Perfectly put, that's exactly an algae I've used myself. It's a sugar high and you crash and you feel awful. You feel disoriented, you feel awful. Awful, man. I've had that experience. So do it and maybe watch how bad you feel. And then it's like, oh, this is not even a good, this sucks, but then how about this, Mitch? So we have the person who has started to wake up and because they've got stumbled into their place because of either, like prayers, they didn't even know they were saying when they were a kid or prayers of the action of unconsciousness or whatever. Not only are they surrounded by kind of like living situation that they don't really want to be in anymore or ever, but also they find themselves surrounded by people who are reflecting that state of consciousness. So what are they to do when suddenly they realize it's not really enough for me right now to just shift my thinking if it also, I'm going to experience a direct rejection from everyone around me because they are all devotees of shit talk land. They're devotees of violence. They want to hurt. They like the low vibe. They like to scratch the flesh of life in this way or that way. And I don't want to do that anymore. But that being said, I don't want to be a high-roading self where I just piece of shit and stick my nose up. And then, you know what I mean? So how is a person to navigate? We need friends. We need our connections. We need our friends. What are you to do? It's very similar again to when an alcoholic sobers up. Yeah, that's a very important question because people are very often surrounded by others by whom they feel intimidated, by whom they feel put down, who they feel are negative towards them. I would say that it is incumbent upon you, absolutely incumbent upon you to separate yourself from cruel people. Do it immediately. Do it without reservation and burn your bridges behind you. And it's that simple. And there are people who are listening to this who are saying, okay, great, but I can't do that because it's my boss or it's somebody I depend upon economically or whose house I live in. And I recognize that. And I would say, do it silently. The point is not to be high and mighty or not to visit upon somebody your own impressions of them because they have their own impressions of you. And the point is to do it silently, separate it first inwardly and vow to yourself and write out the vow if necessary and sign it and carry it with you that you will at the first possible opportunity separate from them physically, however long it takes. And if you want inspiration, I'm gonna recommend a very unusual source for this. And I wanna be very clear that I'm not drawing any kind of analogy because I'm about to invoke the name of a sacred man. And that sacred man is Frederick Douglass who wrote three memoirs, all of them outstanding stories of human endurance about his life as a slave and his escape from slavery and his emergence as a hero of abolitionism. Frederick Douglass told this story in all three of his memoirs and it can be read and profited from on many different levels in any of his memoirs. He talked about at the age of 15 standing up to a cruel slave master and getting into a physical confrontation with this man whose name was Covey for about two hours and Covey who was famously known as a breaker of slaves and was a very sadistic, horrible figure was unable to get the best of Frederick physically. And Frederick felt that Covey was probably somewhat embarrassed by this and Frederick wrote that at that moment I experienced an inner revolution that would never really be able to be rolled back, that would never be able to be reversed. I had asserted myself as an independent human being. I had successfully stood up to this man and I was still enslaved, I was still enslaved but I vowed to myself inwardly that from that moment I would be inwardly free and I would look for and find the first possible opportunity to be physically free, which he did a couple of years later and I would never, never compare the circumstances of anybody's life in the 21st century to the circumstances faced by a 15 year old boy who had been forced into slavery but the psychological verity of what Frederick Douglass was writing there is universally applicable and I think he wanted it to be universally applicable. He was not able to escape from slavery at that particular point in his life but it was a turning point. He did assert himself independently and it doesn't have to be a physical assertion and sometimes it can't be a physical assertion but pay attention to the part where he vowed inwardly that he would be forever separate from this horrible institution that had enslaved him and at the first possible opportunity he would be physically separate. Read Frederick Douglass' memoirs. Any one of them tells this story. Any one of them is equally valid. You can find any one of them online. You can find it on your phone right now. Make that inner vow and separate from cruel people. I love it man, it's really interesting to me that sometimes though you do have to make an actual, if you're in an abusive situation, you've got to get out, stop tricking yourself. Also a lot of times if you're in an abusive situation, you will, your first analysis will be there is no exit, it is, but then if you really think about it, you'll realize like, well, I mean, I do have a small key in my pocket. There's usually some way out. But in there are other situations that are different from this and not so immediately horrible. Of course, yeah. What do you have to say about the idea that when you begin to make this a vow, so to speak, or connect with this internal freedom, it really doesn't seem to be necessarily based on transitory phenomena. Yeah. That there seems to be a natural falling away of the other people in your life. That's right. What's right. Is that similar? Is that actually a kind of representation of this thought metaphysics? In other words, by sort of, you just started meditating and maybe you started eating a little better and maybe you started exercising and you stopped drinking. And then all of a sudden you look around and you realize, wait, I have a lot of new friends. Right, right. I didn't do anything. I didn't make some dramatic call. You know, it just kind of naturally happened. It's though, weirdly, it's like I'm in a completely different universe. Right. What is that? Do you really, this concept of, what did you say? Choosing, picking? Selecting. Selecting. Is this as though there's like a multiverse and we're like throwing some kind of grappling hook into some version of ourself? And very quickly, are we the ones throwing the grappling hook or is some future version of ourselves throwing lines out and pulling us in? What a wonderful question. You know, it's a lot to bite off, but I'll try to be very plain about it. I do believe that our minds have extra physical qualities. And if somebody who is materialist was listening to our conversation, they would probably agree with much of what we're saying. Yeah, separate from cruel people. And yeah, you might find yourself in different circumstances, different relationships, because psychologically you've done the right thing, X, Y, and Z, and that's fine. And I believe all that's true. But I'm not a materialist, and I do take an extra physical perspective on existence. And I write about this in some detail in the book, and I'm speaking about it in shorthand now, but I do believe in Hugh Everett's analysis. I do believe there is a superposition, a quality, complex to life, and that there's an infinitude of things happening. And when we select something through our emotionalized thoughts, or our mental pictures, or our perspective, it's almost like we're imposing a matrix grid on this infinitude. And we're locating one thing in time. And you've raised a magnificent question. Who's locating? Is it me, the speaker right now, or is it Mitch in the future who's doing it? I've wondered whether we possess one mind, but it's ever operative. And things that I'm recollecting right now as my past, things that happened five minutes ago, things that happened 30 years ago that are as real to me as the chair that I'm seated upon right now, might be things that are ever changing, ever operative, ever morphing, ever transitioning, based on the perspective that I have concentrated on or selected or chosen in the, I can't say right now, but I can say in the experience that I'm having, an experience that has in itself a past, a present, a future, all of which feels as real to me, apropos of the past, as the words that I'm uttering to you right now, but which might be ever changing. There may be one mind that I experience as linear, because that's what my sensory equipment permits, but in fact, I'm selecting from among an infinitude of things, which I'm just experiencing as in the present right now, because that's my capacity. Yeah, it's like, it's almost as though, like let's, you know, you've got all these little creeks and the creeks turn into rivers and the rivers just join together and now you have this one river and that river turns into the ocean. Right. And maybe those little creeks, they're like, have you, you know, I've heard, I've heard of a place where we're really fucking big. Right. You know, and this, shut up, you fucking hippie, I don't know what you're talking about, right? And maybe the little creeks might say to the other, you know, we're going to become the same thing eventually or you know, we're being pulled. You know, we're being drawn in. Do you feel this pulling? Yes. That's our desire and who knows, but sometimes I do get this sense, not only of there being this like perfected self or a self that is awakened, that is in some way or another, God, it sounds so absolutely insane, but giving me thoughts. Yeah, yeah. And you know, people might be listening and saying to themselves, well, that's great, but how do I verify any of this? Yes. You fucking hippie lunatics, you know? And I would say this, and this is one of the things I write about at the end of The Miracle Club, there's something I think all of us experience and have experienced, which I happen to call a time collapse, where we have these moments of exquisite awareness in life. Sometimes they come at the height of joy and ecstasy, sometimes they come when we're experiencing this absolute grief that seems to still, everything in our lives that seems to still, all the sensory information that's coming to us, they usually come at some kind of extreme event or heightened awareness. We experience time collapses, where we're having an experience, not only of deja vu, but of past, present, future, where everything suddenly seems mixed together and everything seems to be occurring at once. And I write about three of these episodes in my own life at the end of The Miracle Club. There are others I could have referenced, but I invite the reader in that case to think of times, as I'm sure most will, where he or she has had such experiences, where everything seems to be occurring at once. And it feels extraordinarily real. And you could say, well, that's just an experience. And it's like, well, sure, it's an experience, it's testimony, but what else do we have? I mean, everything that we know about SSRIs, for example, as a class of drugs, comes from experience, comes from testimony. Everything that we know about pain management comes from experience, comes from testimony. It's a tool, it's a tool. So I'd say this can be a kind of metaphysical tool, if I could put it in those terms. Watch for or think back on those periods of time collapse where everything seemed to be happening at once. Everything seemed to be functioning with a kind of congruity. That may be reality. That may be a wonderful measurement. That's great, great, great. Wow, you know what? This is, we are now, I know you have a busy schedule, so man, as much as I would love to kidnap you for probably at least a week to chat with you. Unfortunately, you have to go, you're doing a talk.

139^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 506: Dr. Andrew Weil Transcript and Discussion^2022-05-07^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. What's up, pals? You're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And wow, you know, I know you've probably already listened to this, but I gotta play it for those of you who might not have heard it. They somehow recorded the sound of a black hole. And it's spooky. This is what it sounds like. Isn't that creepy? Almost sounds like voices. I want to brag, but I'm a pretty sophisticated audio engineer at this point. I've been doing the podcast for a long time, been to a lot of different audio schools for music and sound. And I realized maybe if I work with a plug-in, I could adjust this so I could bring out that voice in there and hear what it is. So I just started changing the frequencies. And you can see right there, right around there, you can hear that the higher frequencies sound like that. Voices, listen, right there, do you hear that? Right there. Now if I dial it up weirdly to frequency 666, not frequency, frequency, I get this. And the more I adjusted it, the weirder it got. Now listen to this. You hear that? That sounds like voices to me. So I dialed in the frequency even harder and harder and harder, and this is what I got. You might have got your questioning not straight. Skater, will you please state your name? I'm Archdemon Slashnort. And what is your address? I live in the citadel of eternal horror by the molting pits in the lava pool. And how old are you? I just celebrated my 500th molting as did my lava pup who is now celebrating its 73rd molting. And what is your perception? I flay the skin from the unbaptized and puppeteer their skeletons in front of the lava pools for the young demon children. Now, where are you here? I was in a shitty relationship with Johnny Depp. I normally don't mate with humans, but I'm a big fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. I think he's a wonderful actor. At that point, it just goes back to the fucking boring black hole sounds, but holy shit, if I'm correct in my analysis of that audio, it appears that Johnny Depp is on trial all across the universe right now. And that freaks me out. We got a great podcast for you today. Dr. Andrew Wilde is here with us. This guy's cool. He opened up about what went down between him and Albert and Tim Leary at Harvard. The incident that got Richard Albert, who later went on to become Ram Dass, kicked out of Harvard. Not only that, we had a great talk about psychedelics, the benefits of cocoa leaves, and he may have cured my COVID smell. We're gonna jump right into it, but first this. Do you know a long time ago, doctors wouldn't wash their hands? One second, they'd have their fist far inside a corpse's asshole. The next second, they'd be delivering a baby.

I think it's safe to say that the psychedelic revolution of the 60s might not have happened had today's guest, Dr. Andrew Weil, not written a series of exposés for the Harvard Press that got Richard Alpert and Tim Leary out of Harvard. Richard Alpert went on to become Ramdas, one of my teachers. You know what happened with Timothy Leary and who knows what would have happened if they had remained at Harvard as professors and scholars. I don't know. Dr. Weil completely opened up about his relationship with Ramdas and how it evolved over the years and not only that, we talked about the stigmatization of the cocoa leaf. The plant that cocaine is derived from and now there's actually a lot of benefit to chewing the cocoa leaf and how crazy it is that that along with a lot of other plant medicines are currently illegal in large parts of the world. It's a really good podcast. I hope you enjoy it.

I just wanna call the class of tonight everyone is here to see the new healthy Pokemon's the time that they inspire to feed their ancestors The President of the United States vis-a-vis-a Real Punch Dr. Weil! Welcome to Kris and Your Video Dr. Will, Welcome toなた Dr. Welcome to the Dunker Trussell family our podcast is so nice to meet you Hello, good to meet you How are you doing over there? Where are you right now? I'm in Tucson, Arizona Nice, nice It gets pretty hot out there though, huh? If we've had some nice cool weather it's just starting to get hot It's pretty clear what's coming Oh yeah, right, yeah We just get rain up here in the mountains which Where are you? Asheville, North Carolina Oh, nice place Yeah, pretty nice, pretty nice I am, you know not only am I a tremendous I just love Ram Dass and I love psychedelic culture and you I just thought we could start off by chatting a little bit about your time at Harvard because you were at Harvard at one of the most wild times maybe in the history of that school you were there with Tim Leary as a professor Richard Alpert, aka Ram Dass and I don't know if you were aware of this or not but also the unabomber Yes, I didn't know that till I afterward Okay, you never crossed paths with him Not as far as I know It's just to me mind-blowing But by the way, one other person I was a student of Richard Evans Shultes who was the director of the Harvard Botanical Museum and he was one of the great pioneers of psychedelic plant research especially in South America So, you know, he was a major influence on me at that time too Yes, I just can't imagine what it's like to be in the presence of all these people Every single one of you were and are innovators in your field and every single one of you really shaped not just psychedelic culture but, you know, culture itself I don't know if there's much of a difference So, I have to ask I was watching an interview and you talked about having, in 1961 having a powerful mescaline experience that had you listened to it you would have dropped out of school but then you didn't talk about what that experience was I was wondering if we could just start off by you if you feel comfortable telling us what experience Yeah, this was synthetic mescaline that I got from a chemical company and, you know, I took a good solid dose of it I had taken it once before and nothing much happened and I had not used marijuana I had really no other experience of drugs except for alcohol So, I really didn't know what to expect and on that second time that I took it I guess I had what you'd call a mystical experience You know, I was sort of the white light I felt that everything was connected I felt that what was inside my head was what was outside my head was a reflection of what was inside my head that everything was as it should be and I also, I think, saw that a lot of what I was doing as a student at Harvard was relatively meaningless and that's why I said if I'd followed that vision I don't think I would have stayed in school Okay, wow, yeah, now I... Because we're so lucky now that we're living in the I don't know which psychedelic revolution they're calling this, but one of them and we do have lots of data out there somewhat of an understanding of a lot of these substances Back then, they were relatively new, right? You didn't know what this was No, very few people had heard of them I had read Aldous Huxley's book, The Doors of Perception which was about his mescaline experiences that made me really curious and want to try it Nobody I knew really knew anything about it I had heard that there were these two people at Harvard who were interested in studying it, Albert and Leary I went and met them, talked to them I'll just give you my brief impressions Leary was very charming He was like an Irish leprechaun very twinkly in his eyes and he really thought that these were the most interesting things he'd ever come across and he felt that they were going to completely change society and he was incredibly enthusiastic about them He did not foresee any opposition to using them really wanted to study their positive potential Albert was a different story He was, I think, uncomfortable in himself There was... I did not feel the same kind of level of comfort talking with him and I had asked if I could be a subject in their research and Leary said no, they were sorry because they told the university they couldn't use undergraduates but he gave me some leads as to where I could get hold of mescaline and one of those panned out I found this chemical company that was willing to sell it Back then, did you just... you could just write a letter or how did you... I just wrote a letter, said I wanted to study mescaline and it arrived in my doorstep Wow, that is so cool because, you know, I lived through the U2, all of us anyone around at a certain age lived through what is known as the war on drugs the stigmatization of all consciousness altering substances and the homogenization of them is just one thing called a drug that was bad so can you just talk about what that was like to take a psychedelic prior to all the conditioning that made us feel like, oh my God, we're taking drugs or we're ruining our minds or we're destroying our lives with this drug Well, let me tell you one story from just a little bit before that there were a group of people that I knew who were dosed without their knowledge with LSD at a party, this was about 1960 and literally no one had ever heard of LSD and when they felt the effects of it they thought they had food poisoning I mean, really interesting they had no way to interpret what was happening to them Wow, they didn't... oh my God, right So there's a strong... you know, you have to learn to interpret the effects of substances you know why, that's with pot that's why so many people that trying the first time feel nothing you have to learn to get high on it and with psychedelics I think there was something similar that in a time when nobody knew anything about them we had no expectations you wouldn't know what was happening to you So it was... was it less terrifying for them or less unnerving or some of the stuff that it can appear in a typical bad trip was how... Are you saying some of that is informed more by the culture than the substance itself? Well, you know, one of the great contributions of Lerian Alpert was their insistence that the effects of substances are due to an interaction of the substance the pharmacological effect and what they called set and setting that is a person's expectations of what's going to happen and that can be unconscious and then the effects of the environment in which they take it and effects of set and setting combined can completely reverse pharmacological action you can give a stimulant to someone under certain conditions of set and setting and they'll fall asleep and the opposite with sedatives So, you know, there's enormous room for the shaping of these experiences by what you think is going to happen and where you're taking it and the other people who are around and so forth How old were you? How old were you at this time? So, I was 20, actually, you know, 1960, I was 18 Wow, you are a hot shot you're 18 years old at Harvard you are so interested in these substances because of one book, you're going to the offices of people who would later be these like No, actually, it goes back further, I'll tell you this is funny in the summer before I entered Harvard so it was the summer after high school there was an article in the Philadelphia paper where I grew up about a student at a college in California supposedly who died from taking mescaline and it said that he had taken it very unlikely and it said that he had taken it for inspiration in a creative writing course and it made the mistake of quoting a line from one of his last papers and I just remember the line was galaxies of exploding colors and when I read that, I wanted to take that So, I started asking you know, I just started asking what is this, where can I get it? Of course, nobody knew anything Doctor, did we have a connection here because what got me into LSD was when I was in elementary school and the cops came to do a film strip that's what they did at the time and they were showing all how all the drugs are bad and they got to LSD and I remember them saying, people see dragons and I as a kid in elementary schools I want to see dragons, what is this? You can see dragons? Exactly, exactly So yeah, that's, you know that got, it piqued my interest that later I followed through Okay, so just so we could just talk about it You, okay, you're a writer at Harvard and you had your own group of people that were studying masculine because they weren't letting undergraduates get high We weren't studying it, we were just taking it Oh, you know, is there a difference? I don't know, I know you mean scientifically probably a big difference but so somewhere along the line you start writing these exposés on showing that like this the line between professor and student scientist and experiencer was growing blurry and because of your expose Alpert, not Leary gets fired from Harvard Can you talk about that? Like what precipitated that? Do you feel bad about it? Because I'm just curious like now with all this water under the bridge what are your feelings about that? I think everything played out the way it was supposed to play out I was a reporter for the undergraduate newspaper the Harvard Crimson I was also a botany major studying the Schultes I was taking masculine myself So I had a, I'd say a split personality you know, I wore different hats but I was one of the only people on the undergraduate newspaper with a science background So as this controversy started to develop about these two professors who were using these substances and there was a growing group of students around them I was asked to cover the stories related to that and there was a whole series of stories about faculty, stormy faculty meetings and so forth So I was reporting on that and I got a lot of points for that from the, you know, being in the undergraduate newspaper and yes, it is true that the stories I wrote that was eventually what led the university to fire Alpert that was front page news in the New York Times So it was a huge coup for the Harvard undergraduate newspaper but it was also the first time that most people in this country read about psychedelics So that explosion, I mean, that really disseminated knowledge and awareness of all this, I think, for the first time It took several years for me to realize the implications of what, of all that I then went to medical school and in my senior year at Harvard Medical School I wanted to do human experiments with marijuana They'd never been done, you know once in history people had given pot to human subjects Nothing on it was becoming like such a huge thing in those studies So I tried to devote my senior year research time to doing a human study of pot just to get basic information That caused, I kind of even begin to tell you how difficult it was to get permission to do that from the Federal Bureau of Narcotics from the Food and Drug Administration from the state of Massachusetts from Harvard University, from Boston University where I was going to conduct the experiments Eventually, the Harvard gave permission for me to do it and the only reason they did was because I saw minutes of their meetings that I was the one who had blown the whistle on Alpert and here So that got me points within the academic community and I was allowed to do these pot experiments which showed that pot was a relatively mild substance and people didn't want to hear that in those days Was this post, was that post Nixon when you did the pot? No, not yet, not yet That's coming later Okay, so even then it was stigmatized Even pre-Nixon, it was like, okay, okay, sorry But then I began to realize that I really had to make amends for the whole thing I'd done to Albert and Leary I did an internship in San Francisco and Leary at that time was living in Berkeley This was 1968, 69 and I called him up and he invited me over to his home very friendly, he had no hard feelings He said, you know, this was exactly what was supposed to happen We had a really good time But then I said, you know, I really would like to talk to Albert He said he thought that would be more difficult But he gave me, I think he told me how to reach him I had to go back to the East Coast This was now Nixon's first year and to go from San Francisco in that year to Washington, D.C. was horrible and I was serving my military time in the public health service and got a job at the National Institute of Mental Health They hired me to coordinate marijuana research in the country But before I got there, they decided I was an undesirable person because the research I had published was not what they wanted out there and I had done it without their support and they'd been given, oh, it's a complicated story but the National Institute of Mental Health was a democratic pork barrel and suddenly it found itself under a hostile Republican administration that was asking them what they had done with their money and they had been given several hundred thousand dollars by Congress years before to study pot and they hadn't done anything they hadn't published a single word and I was the only one who had published research on it not with their money and it also said stuff they didn't want to hear So they tried to get rid of me and they couldn't and I was given no job I had to report to a windowless closet with a telephone in it and they would tell people I wasn't there when people would call up wanting my opinion on marijuana they said they didn't know where I was opened my mouth, really bad stuff but I thought, okay, I'll stick this out you know, if it's better than going to Vietnam but it was during that time I got a number for Alper, he was somewhere in New England I called up, a woman answered the phone and I said I'd like to talk to him he got on the phone, I said, this is Andy Weil and he just went shhh and uh hahahahahaha so I said, you know, that I'd been doing a lot of thinking and it was really important for me to talk about what happened and why and there was just silence and then finally he said that he was flying into Washington I think a couple weeks later and that he had to fly out and I could pick him up and take him to the airport wow so I went to this hotel in Virginia I did not know he had been giving a talk I think to the American Psychological Association and I was in my car outside and out comes this guy with a beard and white robes uh you know, this was his first appearance as Ram Dass and I also didn't know the talk he gave that I picked him up from was the basis of his book Be Here Now which shortly afterwards I read and had a huge influence on me I'm pretty sure that when at last we're living in a society that hasn't been completely impaired and set back by the idiot or on drugs that we will realize that the thing we call micro dosing now is actually correct dosing that because of the prohibition people were just basically OD'ing on all kinds of substances including cannabis which is why I love loomy labs because they are the creators of micro dose gummies these are the perfect dose of THC it's incredible somehow it's legal everywhere I don't know why I'm not gonna question it or challenge it because I live in a place that for whatever dumb reason has made marijuana illegal I fly with these things I just throw these delicious gummies in my backpack I travel with them it is amazing and look I could go on and on raving about these wonderful gifts from God but I thought I might share with you the testimonial of my brother-in-law John who went through almost an entire jar of these things over the few days that he was staying with us I've tried many brands of gummies over the years I've tried different formulas of CBD, THC, Delta, etc and I always felt like I was wasting my money and I was hundreds of dollars just on that quest for the perfect, like, edible gummy that isn't too much or too little like, we've all been there we've overdone the dose I don't like feeling like I've blown my brain matter all the way to the hiades and I'm praying for it to end but I also want to, you know feel a little background glow but so one day I tried the loomy gummies and once I felt the subtle glow emanating from that gummy in my tummy I realized I had found kind of what I had been looking for the Goldilocks Zone the loomy gummies I zeroed in on what is to me the perfect cocktail of THC, CBD, Delta, whatever is in it, I'm not a chemist but it's a great daily driver that is reliable It goes on for another five minutes or so but you get the point loomy labs, microdose, gummies are perfect to learn more about microdosing THC just do a quick search online or go to

labs music so he got in the car he didn't say much, you know I said that I had gotten into a position similar to what he'd been in at Harvard where I was in an institution that was very hostile and that I was leading this kind of double life sort of like, you know, looking like a straight doctor but I was, you know, increasingly using substances and seeing the world in a different way he mostly just listened and but, you know, he just listened anyway, I shortly afterwards listened to the tape of the talk that he'd given and as I say that was very influential it got me into starting to meditate and doing yoga and being interested in the Eastern religion and I really felt he was a teacher of mine even though it was, you know, in an odd sort of way anyway, over the years we kept in contact when he had his stroke, I did a fundraiser for him in Santa Fe I gave a talk but finally, I guess a few years before he died a mutual friend was very insistent that we get together and spend time and, you know, clear all this karma up so I went to Maui and I had dinner with him I spent a little time with him and then we had a very intense morning together just one on one and in the midst of it, he said, you know, you did me a blessing and he said, you know, that I would not have been Ram Dass if I had not been forced out of Harvard and in fact, I think if he'd stay there it would have killed him spiritually and in lots of other ways so, you know, it just felt like a closure of something and I think we reached some point of common ground there and I do, you know, I have great respect for him and he has been a teacher of mine I've learned even though not in a formal way that I've, you know, a lot of inspiration for what I did really came from him Thank you for that, thank you for that and yeah, I think that I often think what if you had not written those exposés not only would there be a Ram Dass sometimes I wonder would there be the psychedelic revolution what if they had, you know, gone out of the orbit of what a normal academic does but then just gone back in at some point and then just stayed as like professors or writers or serious scientists what do you think, what do you think would have happened in an alternate timeline? Gosh, I think it could have been very different from what we've seen today but, you know, also there was such positive interest in psychedelics early on you know, great stuff with terminal cancer patients, with prisoners and then, you know, it all got just clamped down I don't know whether you've seen my, you know, one of my early books called From Chocolate to Morphine Oh yeah, it got banned in Florida, they tried to, did they ban it? They wanted to burn your book That came out right as the war on drugs began it was like just the beginning of that and yes, the book, there was attempts to ban the book Florida Florida, yeah So I had, I was on the other end of that kind of stuff for a long time and it's wonderful to see what's happening today, you know It's taken a very long time, but I think this is unstoppable now, this momentum I cannot believe the mainstreaming of some of this stuff you know, like a few months ago Vogue magazine had a cover story on psilocybin and more recently Town and Country magazine, I mean of all things Town and Country magazine had a feature article called Why is Everyone Smoking Toad Venom? Town and Country? What the fuck? Well, that this is this is because of And by the way, something that I, it annoys me a little bit I was, and you know who Wade Davis is, so he and I wrote the first scientific paper on Toad Venom and nobody ever, we don't get credit for that, it was like is the first, yeah Wait, you wrote the, are you talking about a bufatin, or? Yeah, yeah, bufo alvarius, the Sonoran desert toad in my backyard where I live and you know, this was long ago in the, I think it was in the 80s or right around 1990 that I heard about people smoking toad venom and I was living in a ranch fairly far out from Tucson and the toads were all over the place, they'd hop in my house at night, you know, they're gigantic and so I tried milking the venom and Wade and I smoked it, amazing, you know, it was like an amazing experience and we wrote a scientific paper about this, it was the first documented use of a psychedelic from an animal source, you know, that was a really important discovery and we speculated about whether indigenous people could have used it, I don't know if there's any real evidence for that, but you know, it's amazing to see what's happened with that. Yeah, well I'll tell you, I'm sorry for the toads, people should be using synthetic methoxy DMT. I don't think people understand like how they're harvesting the venom from the toads is really horrible, I've seen videos of it. It doesn't harm the toad but people are taking the toads and keeping them in captivity and the habitat is disappearing and they're becoming very scarce and it's an endangered resource. I mean, from the toad's perspective, here you have over millions of years evolved a poison that's supposed to keep things from eating you and then these monkey descendants realize it gets you high, it's just rotten luck. I know. But can you talk a little bit about 5MEO DMT? I have smoked synthetic 5MEO DMT and it was, I just wasn't prepared for it, it was. Yeah, you know, people describe it as a rocket ship into the void. Have you ever done a regular DMT? Love regular DMT. Okay, so that's, you know, amazing quick trip into this visual, you know, mostly paradise and interesting stuff. Yeah. But 5MEO DMT, it's just you're not there, you dissolve and when you come back, most people find that rather pleasant. But if, you know, the going out can be scary if you're not prepared for that. Yes, I'm curious, do you have any idea why adding, what is it, you add an oxygen molecule to DMT and it turns it into this like impersonal evaporation? Well, you know, in South America, there are a number of plant derived snuffs that indigenous people use that are psychedelic and that contain both. So usually plants produce both 5MEO and regular DMT together and that combination is probably, you know, pleasant. So it's just odd that this toad produces only one of them and it's the only toad that has this and it's probably some random mutation that turned Pufatenin, which is a pure poison into this 5MEO DMT. Wow. That is why I did not know that you wrote the first paper on that. That is incredible because it is everywhere now and a lot of people, you know, use it, if, you know, or using it ritualistically and it's becoming like woven into. Yeah, I would never predicted that. I think it was just amazing to see that. Over the course of your lifetime, after all the drama and Harvard and everything, you have been one of the leaders in what's known as integrative medicine. Can you talk a little bit about what the model of like human physiology and healing was prior to the work you have innovated in that field? Well, you know, I trained doctors at the University of Arizona and the trainings that we give are designed to teach people all the things they should have learned in medical school, but are left out like nutrition, which is completely neglected. And one of the even bigger omissions is about the healing potential of the human organism. You know, I don't think I heard the word healing used in my years at medical school, except in the phrase wound healing in my first year histology course. I mean, that should be like the study of medicine should begin with the fact that that bodies heal themselves. Right. You know, this is like amazing that we have this potential to, you know, know that something's wrong, to heal, to regenerate, to adapt injury and loss. And, you know, the body has a healing system and has internal mechanisms of healing, and that's what medicine should focus on. Right. And also, most diseases end by themselves. And they end by themselves because the body takes care of them. There's an adage in medicine, probably hundreds of years old that I love that the business of the doctor is to distract the patient while time heals the disease. And I really believe that that's the fact. But most doctors and most patients are very pessimistic about their body's abilities to deal with things. And when I'm with a patient, I'm always thinking, why is healing not happening here? What can I do from outside that might facilitate that? So, integrative medicine, that's where it starts on that premise that healing is possible and that you need to understand the nature of it. And then we look at people as whole organisms. You know, it's not just a physical body, we're also mental emotional beings and spiritual entities. You know, that principle I talked about, about how set and setting can reverse the pharmacological action of a drug, the mind can do unbelievable things. And that's completely omitted from conventional medicine. You know, we only look at the physical body. Why? Why is it omitted? It's part of the materialistic paradigm that dominates Western science. It's that, you know, scientists only believe in that which they can see, touch, measure, remove. If you observe a change in a physical system, the cause has to be physical. You know, non-physical causation of physical events is not allowed for in materialistic philosophy. So, that's why we've never been able to take placebo responses seriously or understand how warts fall off by suggestion. And it's also why we don't take advantage of all of the mind methods of using, taking advantage of the mind to influence the body. I mean, there are these wonderful therapies like hypnosis and visualization and guided imagery, incredibly effective, cost effective and very underutilized, because people don't believe in them. They don't think they're, you know, they're real.

I've reported a lot of cases in my writings over the years. Some that I've experienced, personally some that I've seen in patients. I'll just tell you one quick story. I was traveling, this must be in the 1980s, I was traveling from the Pacific Northwest back to Arizona. I stopped off to see my friend Paul Stamets near Olympia, Washington, and I got into a hot tub that he had and it looked a little sketchy to me. I mean, I'm very careful about hot tubs. What do you mean, dirty? It didn't look like it should have. The next day when I got out, I started getting these, I thought it was a rash at first, but then it was like pustules on my arm that were sore and they began spreading. I got them on my legs and it seemed like they had puss in them, but if I'd squeezed them, nothing came out and they were painful. This is hot tub folliculitis and it's caused by pseudomonas, which is a nasty bacteria and it's generally resistant to antibiotics. I didn't want to take antibiotics and I couldn't do anything. I was on my way home, so I was soaking them with hot compresses. By the time I got home, I had some peering on my face. I didn't like this at all, so I was freaked out. I had a wife of a friend of mine in Washington State who had become certified in this technique called guided imagery. My wife then had had a very positive experience with guided imagery and she said, why don't you call her and maybe she can do a session with you over the phone. I said, that's ridiculous. This is a bacterial infection. What possibly could that do for it? She said, well, why don't you try because she'd had a dramatic experience with it. I called my friend Marilyn and she said she'd never done a session over the phone, but she was willing to try. I remember sitting in my living room, I had the phone receiver cradled in my shoulder and she said, she put me in a relaxed state and then she said, go to one of these that's causing you the most discomfort. It was one on my cheek and she said, what do you see there? I said, well, I see a mass of swirling, angry energy and she says, and what is it trying to tell you? I listened and I said, well, it's saying it can't come out that it can only be absorbed inward and she said, so what does that mean? I said, well, I've been trying to force this out and I was soaking it, squeezing it and she said, so what should you be doing? I said, well, I guess I should be resting more and I think taking vitamin C, something else I got or I got sort of eating, eating chili peppers. So when I hung up, my wife said she could see a change in the way these looked. I couldn't, but the next morning when I woke up, it receded and over the next 24 hours, it disappeared. I mean, I could give you story after story of this kind of thing, but it is so distressing to me that doctors do not use these methods. They never think to use them. No, is this because, okay, is this because I don't think it's necessarily because doctors are sinister? Isn't it more that the entire system, they'll get a lawsuit, they'll get sued. They didn't learn it and it doesn't fit in with their preconceptions of know how the body works. Yeah. This is, okay, the other thing, because I have a friend, my friend Mitch Horowitz writes a lot about the ESP research and how there is data showing that there's clearly some kind of possibility of what we call extrasensory perception, but that data gets left out. It gets actively, not accidentally, actively suppressed. Right, actively. It doesn't fit with the preconceptions of materialistic science. Also, I think this is one of the ways that psychedelics can change the world, because I have experienced so clearly when I've been in psychedelic states that everything is conscious, that my consciousness is continuous with the consciousness of animals, of plants, of even things that we say are inanimate, that I just think consciousness is basic and I know so many people who have had that realization in psychedelic states and you can't explain that to a materialist who has not had such an experience, but I think that's where I see the real potential of psychedelics to change everything. The world is in such desperate shape right now and that's one of the only things I see that has the potential to change consciousness which could lead to changes in behavior. When you were talking about consciousness as this continuous thing running through everything, do you mean it's sort of a field or something? Yeah, I mean, personally, my belief, and just a belief, it's a belief based on my experience, is that consciousness is primary and that consciousness organizes matter into more and more elaborate forms. But the materialist version of it is that consciousness is something that is created by the brain that rises out of electrical and chemical activity in the brain and that when the brain dies, that's the end of consciousness. It's not what I think. Right, it's like consciousness is almost, I mean, I've read theories of consciousness that make it seem almost like a mistake or like a heat coming off an engine or something like that. So the fancy word for mistake in science is epiphenomenon. That's what the materialists say. Consciousness is an epiphenomenon. It's an incidental thing that just arises out of the chemistry and electrical activity of the brain. Just something in why even bother with it. But I get it because how to quantify consciousness, how to measure it, how to, you know, have a sample of consciousness that you can look at with a microscope, it's, you can't. And so it has to, maybe they just have to ignore it until we get better scopes or something to pick it up. What a shame. But it's changing. And I think a major reason why it's changing is because more and more people have had this vision that has come to most people, I think, through psychedelic experience. Do you feel that social media and like the current like, I don't know, systems that people are using to interact with are, you know, part of the reason that there's so much confusion in the world right now? Yeah, I do. I mean, it's got such potential, but I think a lot of it is just toxic out there at the moment and the effects it's having on people. Not great. So do you recommend, when you are working with people, do you recommend a psychedelic regimen or do you have any suggestions for, I mean, right now everyone is, I think it's so destigmatized, you're allowed to talk about it now, but what sorts of psychoactive substances do you think are best for healing? Well, let me first say, you know, in the pre-pandemic days, which is hard to remember now, when I was doing a lot of traveling and speaking, you know, all over the country and in other places, for the past few years, no matter what I was talking about, whether it was healthy aging, anti-inflammatory diet, integrative medicine, I would get questions from the audience about psychedelics. Sure. People wanting to know how you can get them, how you can use them, how they can find a psychedelic guide, and that has only increased. So I think there's tremendous interest in and desire for people to try these things. In our doctor trainings, we have been, our main thing is a two-year fellowship for physicians, and we have classes of about 80 each. We've graduated like 2,500 physicians in all specialties from that now, and there's tremendous demand from them to learn about psychedelics and their potential in medicine and how to use them in therapy and how to get trained to use them. So clearly, this is happening. And I do add, I think for many, many people, this can be very valuable, but it's important that the experience be structured in the right way. If you want to get the best bang for your buck out of them. And I think, I don't know how this is all going to play out as this becomes more and more available and more legalized. I think there's a lot of questions there. Big corporations are going to try to get in on it. People are going to try to patent these things. How are they going to be used? I don't know, but I'm sure some people will just use them recreationally, but I think there is a tremendous potential. And also, I am a little disappointed that people always focus on emotional mental illness, and I see huge potential in physical illness. I've seen such dramatic changes, cures, remissions of autoimmune diseases, of chronic pain syndromes, of all sorts of things, that people get a break from their usual way of interpreting what's happening in their body, and they see the possibility that they can live without the discomfort they've been having. One term that gets thrown around a lot is neurogenesis, the idea that you can rewire your brain via psychedelics. Do you have any theories regarding neurogenesis, or is the reason that chronic pain is just your brain is finding new pathways? Well, I think one of the most interesting things about pain, there are two aspects of it. There's the primary reception of it from nerves in the body, and then there's the secondary interpretation of it, which is something happening in the brain. And it is possible to interpret pain in a different way. Actually, that's how opioids work. Often, if you give somebody not so much of an opioid that they're doped up, and they can say what they're feeling, a lot of people say, well, the pain is still there, but it doesn't bother me anymore. So that's an effect in the brain. And in hypnosis, I've seen very dramatic cures of pain with hypnosis, and often the suggestion to people is the hurt is going out of the pain. And that's the same thing, you're working on the brain. And whether I don't know that this is rewiring, maybe it is, or it's like, you know, the bed, I think the brain is very plastic. It has incredible capacity to, you know, to change, and you can learn to interpret signals differently. Can you talk a little bit about your breathing technique? I, you know, I think, you know, one of the, one, I'm not going to speak for myself, but I, because often I'll say people when I mean me. I'm stressed out, man. I got kids, you know. Join the club. There's the World War Three seems to just around the corner, you know, it's just so much is going on. And I, you know, I'm addictive, so there's a lot. I'm down to weed, man. I can't do benzos. I get addicted to them, so I can't have them around. But I sure would love a method to relax that didn't involve taking some hyper addictive, potentially neurologically destructive substance. Well, there's a technique I call the 478 breath that I've been teaching for a long time. It's a yoga technique. I learned it from an old osteopath who was one of my mentors. Very simple. It's, it's, you know, breathing in through your nose quietly to account of four, holding your breath for account of seven, blowing air out through your mouth forcibly for account of eight, and doing four breath cycles at a time can work up to eight. But you have to do this regularly. And it changes the tone of the involuntary nervous system. It is, it is the, of all the techniques and remedies I've studied in my many years. This is the one I've gotten the most positive feedback about. I mean, incredible what this can do. It slows heart rate, lowers blood pressure, improves digestion. It's by far the most effective anti anxiety measure I've ever discovered. It makes benzos look pathetically weak by comparison. And it gets better the more you do it. And, and I teach it to everybody. I mean, you can, if you just Google 478 breath in my name on YouTube, you'll find me teaching you the method. And I've had great fun teaching this to groups of people. At least I'll tell you a funny story. A few years ago, I was contacted by the NSA out of the blue and they asked me to meet with some of their top people and they, they had read my stuff and they wanted me to come in to their headquarters in Maryland and give a talk on dealing with stress. This was around the time of Snowden and they said it was like people were really stressed. Sonya, I went there. It was quite a trip. And I, I gave a talk to, I think they, there were a thousand people in the, in an auditorium and then it was closed circuit televised around the world. So I don't know how many people did it. And in the course of this, I had everybody doing that 478 breath, which was really powerful. And so I think I've done this with large groups of people. And as I said, I've gotten great, great feedback on it. This is one of the most fascinating, on top of the, what was it, the Better Homes and Gardens, what was the one talking about? Yeah, no, it's your town and country. Okay, town and country. To me, this is one of the other things where, you know, if we, if you cut back a few decades and like, we're shown visions of this, how the, you know, spiritual, new age, psychedelic culture and luminaries, weirdly were like, are beginning to have this kind of healing relationship with the very systems that, you know, have done a lot of harm to the psychedelic movement. It's, it's wild, isn't it? I mean, did you, was there a moment where you're like, no way, I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to teach these people to relax. I want them all to, I jumped at the chance to do that. That'd be great. Yeah, cool. Cause they want to know that. Absolutely. Also, they probably know everything on you, right? They've been reading your emails for a long time. See if they can do what they want because they got everything on you, man, everything. They got us. Okay. Now forgive me for this. This is truly self, self-interest playing through my podcast. I got COVID and my smell is messed up. I'm sorry. It's not often that you get a chance to have a one-on-one with a world famous doctor. My smell is messed up. My pee, my poop, my bio, all smell like oatmeal. Coffee smells like oatmeal and it's crazy. How long ago did you have COVID? This was probably, I don't know, nine months or something like that. Has it changed any in that time? Has it improved some? Yes. It went through no smell to all of a sudden, you know, in the middle of like, in the evenings, I would start smelling this rancid hell smell and then now it's all kind of leveled out to, I guess where my brain is like, yeah, we don't know what this is, so we're going to make it smell like that. So time is on your side. You know, the chances are this will come back. They don't know exactly why this happens, but one theory is that it's due to inflammation in areas of the nerves that mediate smell. So anti-inflammatory things may help like turmeric, which is a very powerful natural anti-inflammatory agent, and it's easy to get turmeric supplements. Sure. Get ones that have black pepper in them as well, because it's for facilitate absorption. Okay. But that's something that might help. Thank you very much. I'm going to try. It's the most, it's the weirdest thing that ever happened to me. Yeah. It's cool though. I mean, I like it because it shows you, you know, it teaches me a lot like about how the brain works and how or what, you know, it's a fascinating thing that just my brain is returning a signal for, you know, that's unified across a lot of different things. Most of them gross, but it is very weird to pee oatmeal. I got to tell you. I have never heard that one. That's fascinating. It's so weird. It's so cool. I just want it to stop. I want to fix it. It'll get better. You could also try taking some zinc as a supplement, because that's something I found has helped people who've lost smell as a result, usually have a viral infection. Thank you. I would love to know about your work with River Styx Foundation. First of all, I just love that name. Can you talk a little bit about what it is and why they named it that? This is a foundation that's whose main purpose is to protect indigenous uses of substances. And they have a project with Peyote Conservation. It was started. There's a man named Cody Swift, who has headed it. His father gave the name, and I think he was very interested in Greek mythology, why he chose that particular name. I don't know, but it's an arresting name. And I've been working with him because one of the plants that I have been interested in for a long time is coca leaf. And that is such a persecuted substance. It is so different from cocaine. It has many health benefits, and it's been not only maligned and neglected. So we have a project trying to stimulate research on coca, on seeing if we can get legal supplies of it here. And he's also very interested in other plants that have been maligned, neglected, suppressed. So there's a whole list of ones that I'd like to look at. Aphedra is a good one. That's a Chinese herb that has been used for thousands of years as a treatment for asthma and other conditions. And it is a source of a drug called ephedrine, which can be used as a starting material for meth. But the plant itself is, as with coca, the plant itself is benign and has beneficial uses. Another one similar to that is cotton. You may remember that this is one from Yemen and Ethiopia. That's also a natural stimulant, got very bad press during the Iraq war, because GIs were using it. I remember hearing about it and wanting to try it. But is it illegal in the West? It was made illegal. Whoa. Okay, if we could just jump back, because we can't skip over coca leaf. I mean, if you think about this, this plant. This is the sacred plant of indigenous peoples in the Andes. I've studied it for many, many years in South America and in the Amazon. It's a major healing plant, especially for GI disorders. It stabilizes blood sugar. It may help prevent diabetes. Lots of potential. And we can't use it. We can't get it, because it has been blamed for all of our problems with cocaine. The problems come from isolating cocaine from coca leaf. It's not coca. Coca has a lot of other things in it that modify the effects of cocaine. Cocaine is there in very small amounts. It's an amazing plant that has such a history. The way that that plant has been suppressed and maligned and persecuted, I think it's it's everything that's wrong with the way that we've approached these natural substances. What is the indigenous method of absorbing coca leaf? How do they take it? They chew dried leaves with a bit of some alkaline substance, which can be roasted seashells or ashes of plants that facilitate absorption of the substances in coca. And they hold it in their mouth and swallow the juices and do this, you know, a number of times a day. And it kind of combines the uses of coffee and chewing gum in our culture. Have you tried that? Have you chewed? Oh, yeah. I've used it many, many. What's the effect? You get a pleasant numbness in your mouth and then a warm glow in your stomach. It takes away hunger and you get energy from it. But it's it's a it's not a kind of jangling energy that you get from coffee. It's a I think a more useful kind of energy. Sure. It just seems to me so silly that we don't have access to this. Well, you know, who does have access? Coca-Cola. I read that Coca-Cola, right? They have a deal. They get tons of this stuff shipped in, right? They're the only that's the only legal export of coca is to a chemical company in New Jersey that extracts the cocaine, sells that to a pharmaceutical company, and then they make a flavoring extract from the rest of the stuff that they give to Coca-Cola. So early when they say that cocaine used to be in Coca-Cola, it's not that it was cocoa leaf, the psychoactive substance was in Coca-Cola. So right. And then they removed that the psychoactive substance, but they kept the cocaine, I guess to conserve the name because there were, you know, hundreds of cocoa products on the market in the late 1800s. And now there's only one Coca-Cola. So I think they put it in mostly to just keep the rights to the name. And Columbia recently, an entrepreneur was, has been selling a coca beer. I mean, technically illegal, but and also a coca soft drink and Coca-Cola is suing him for infringement on their trademark. And he's counter suing on behalf of Columbia, saying that the name belongs to Columbia and the indigenous population of Columbia. So it's going to be interesting that Coca-Cola is doing it illegally. So we'll see what happens. I hate cocaine, dog. I hate cocaine. I crash like I do cocaine at the time. Well, it's the, it is the, it is the perfect illustration of how to go wrong in dealing with what nature produces, you know, to take that one element out of the leaf and then represent that as being, you know, the only thing of interest and disseminating it to the world. And then when you get into a lot of trouble, you blame the leaf for all of that and try to stamp it out. Right. Wow. That is amazing. Amazing story. Whenever I've heard the stories of the old days, Coca-Cola, having cocaine in it, or a more Libertine approach to these substances, it's always seemed incredible to me. And I hope that that's where we're headed now. Or is, do you, what are you currently engaged in? What are you working on right now? And how can we tune into that? Well, I have a website, drwile.com, d-r-w-e-i-l.com has a lot of my health information and medical stuff. There's the website of the Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, which is integrativemedicine.arizona.edu. You can see about all of our activities and their programs for the public there. I have written a lot of books, all of which are in print that you can get from Arizona. So, you know, the River Sticks Foundation, you can check on their projects. And, you know, we've started a Coca project with them, which I'm very excited about. So my hand's in a lot of pies. You're busy. And also, this is the, you are proof of everything you're teaching, because I have to tell you, you seem like young, young, like you seem, you know, like when we think of age, like, I'm sorry if this is something everyone says to you or you hear this a lot, but wow, I, it's, you know, I remember as I'm research getting ready for this. And then I looked at your birthday and that's when it was like, wow, holy shit, it works. I'm gonna be 80 on June 8th. I can't believe it. How did that happen? Yeah, but you, you're, you're not, you know, you're not 80. Like our understanding of 80 is, I guess an 80, a person who has not taken time to do the breathing and to eat the right stuff. That's just a sick person who happens to be 80. But do you have, last thoughts, do you have any predictions as far as aging, aging technology? And can you let people know what your skincare regimen is? I have, first of all, I have a book called Healthy Aging that I recommend, you know, you look at. I'm not very interested in life extension. I think that's a waste of time. I think what we should be concerned with is how to stay healthy as you age and be able to enjoy life and delay the onset, reduce the risk of age related diseases. And I think you do that by, you know, doing all the things under your control that we know that influence, you know, general health, starting with, you know, eating right. And the first step of that is avoiding refined process and manufactured foods, getting regular physical activity, good rest and sleep, doing that breathing technique, which is, you know, really effective way of neutralizing stress, laughing, having fun. I tell people not to listen to the news. I've long ago was recommending what I called news fast. And I think that's even more important today because the news is just dreadful and it's a major source of anxiety. And I have to say that I think my uses of substances over the years has strongly contributed to my physical health and emotional health. You are an amazing human. I am just so lucky.

I'm going to be at the Bell House in Brooklyn with the wonderful Ian Fightance. I'm also going to be at the Arlington Draft House. Bell House, February 6th, Arlington Draft House, February 7th, and 8th. Come see us live. All right, let's do the show. Greetings to you, beautiful travelers on the Infinite River of Time. It is I, D. Trussell, and you are listening to the Ducatrussell Family Hour Podcast, a transmission being outputted from my alchemical cosmic acoustic laboratory in the heart of beautiful Echo Park, California. Now a skeptic might come plotting into this place and look around and think, this ain't an acoustic alchemical laboratory, you hippie. This is just some downstairs room with a bed in it and a table and some weird electronic shit in here. Where's the alchemy? Where's the laboratory? What are you even talking about? It's best to leave people like that alone, because they're not ready to recognize just how insanely magical the dimension that we happen to have temporarily incarnated into is. So they need to call laboratories offices. They need to call occult ceremonies, shows, and most importantly, they need to call themselves a human being instead of the eternal God fragment they are spinning off into time. And I get it. It's going to be really hard to get a job if during the interview you tell them that you're really excited to be a neophyte initiate and that you're really looking forward to joining their cobble of money harvesting wizards masquerading as a bank in this particular point in the time space continuum. You're probably not going to get hired if you say that. Instead, you're going to have to say, I'm really excited to work at this bank. I really love what Bank of America has to offer its customers. This is the double edge sort of language, grammar. You can use it to completely domesticate a undomesticatable series of phenomena, which make up any given human life, or you can use it to underline the incredible magical nature of that phenomena. It's up to you. And some people don't want to hear your underlining of the incredible magical nature of phenomena. They want to hear you talk in the language of the day and distinguishing one from the other is a really valuable skill set for someone to acquire in this dimension. Because otherwise, you're going to find yourself getting a lot of eye rolls, getting rejected, and most importantly, getting into the most laborious and boring form of egoic arm wrestling there ever could be, which is trying to get into some kind of intellectual argument about magic with somebody who's a complete skeptic, a cynic, or just doesn't want to hear your bullshit. The very worst thing you could do in that situation is try to win them over to your side. The very worst thing that you could do is to temporarily peel the scales off someone's eyes who is already on the precipice of some kind of hardcore nervous breakdown. Do you really want to rattle somebody's birdcage like that? Do you really want to freak somebody out and help them see that the skyscrapers in their city are actually massive occult towers designed to harvest energy using particular techniques connected to some sigil called the brand logo? It's not fair. They're just enjoying their life as it is. They don't want to think about the fact that every company has an inner circle of powerful wizards that run the company. They want to call them the president of the company. They don't want to call her the imperial sorceress. They're not interested in using that language even though that's exactly what's happening. Wizards, where do they always live? Towers. What are skyscrapers? Rectangular towers. And what's in the top of those towers? The executive suites. Somewhere in the top of every office building is an executive suite. And it is in that executive suite with the grand views of the circuit board of wizard towers that any city is that some cobble of chosen people gather together and have rituals where in which they strategize ways to harvest more energy from the circuitry not just to that city but of the planet itself. They talk about things that sound mundane like maybe we should change the color of our logo when what they're really talking about is re-energizing their sigil because it doesn't seem to be hypnotizing or magnetizing people to their particular form of energy harvesting. They don't want to say that out loud. The language of the day seems normal because that's what we're raised with but in some future time it will probably seem just as magical and arcane as anything that you might read in any ancient book of magic. The main thing is it's an easy thing to find yourself completely mundanified. It's an easy thing as a result of the slow hypnotic process that happens to anyone living in modern society to lose track of the fact that you're only here for a tiny little bit of time and during that time whatever society at large might tell you is the right way to live is not necessarily the right way to live. You only have to look back through history to see the way that others were told to live and how absolutely insane those particular ways of being might seem to us now. For example, there was a point in human history when it was somewhat normal to smell the burning flesh of a witch being incinerated in your village because she had caused someone's cow to produce sour milk. This was normal back then. You might have a conversation about it over some mead that evening in the tavern how they finally incinerated that damn witch and thank god the milk wasn't going to be sour anymore. Think of that madness but back then if you had spoken up and said something like I'm not really sure that's the reason the milk was going sour you would be the next person thrown upon the pyre. Offer unto Caesar what is Caesar's? I think one of the meanings of that is call it an office building around people who want to call it an office building and call it a wizard's tower around people who are interested in potentially redefining their reality to escape from the dark claustrophobia inducing mind prison that can happen to a human being in the modern world regardless it's not about trying to freak other people out or show people that you have some kind of mystical superiority or any of that insane shit it's more about reawakening the part of yourself that fell asleep not all at once but over the course of years. If you can't do this if you don't have kids but now that I have a kid I get to hang out in playgrounds and when you're hanging out in playgrounds you get to listen to the way kids talk to each other when they're playing and it's the most magical mystical beautiful kind of conversation you could ever hear because they have yet to be dulled down warped stretched out and dried out on the terrible meat smoker that is the inevitable process of the modern world nobody has yet to tell them that at some point they're going to have to pay income tax balance their checkbooks do a budget not eat too many carbohydrates or find a great job and hopefully learn how to polish their shoes so that they shine with that specific sparkle that indicates a really enthusiastic worker in a really important company somewhere in manhattan no one's done that to them yet satan has yet to pry open their skulls and take big fat shits on their brains so they get to enjoy magical mystical joyful existence for a few years but slowly they will potentially dry out as most of us have me included which is why it's good from time to time to remind yourself the thing you call your home is a temple and what's happening inside there is the evolution of your soul and that you're being inhaled into the lungs of the divine with every single moment and then anything that comes your way throughout the day is not just some random occurrence but is an actual encounter with the great eternal ever-evolving alien that we call god and then in those moments instead of shirking away averting your eyes avoiding the reality of what's happening to you by trying to place a mundane boring mask of modernity upon the face of the great eternal godhead you can at least for a second enjoy the blazing glory of the truth of your reality and maybe in that moment get a little spark of inspiration that puts the particular pep in your step that draws others to you that magnetizes others to you who aren't afraid to admit that offices are actually wizard towers my friends this is the duncan trustle family hour podcast and we have got a fantastic podcast for you today we're going to get right into it but first this have

have you sweety started getting the coronavirus fear yet i just traveled back from denver where we sold out the whole weekend and johnny pemberton and i actually wore cowboy bandanas through the airport we looked like complete assholes there wasn't a single person in the airport that was wearing a face mask and i'm pretty sure that i must have passed at least two doctors based on the look they were giving me which wasn't the normal look of weird judgment and fear i was getting from people at the airport but that look is someone who wants to tell you hey that's not going to do anything that being said when you're wearing a bandana you become hyper aware of sneezes because for every like sneeze that happens that normally you might just try to like not acknowledge happen because you don't want to worry about getting a cold you get this smug sense of vindication because there are people out there who truly are that a dream come true for whatever particular virus has decided to inhabit their festering bodies it's like most of us like we try to at least do the thing where you like shove your face into the crook of your arm because you don't want to do it into your hands because your hands touch everything and you smear the disease everywhere but some people they just free sneeze baby they're just blowing big blasts of horrific virulent mist wherever they can into their hands into people's hair they're not even thinking about it it's almost like they're doing some kind of performance art based on the knowledge that many people right now just under the surface are really sweating bullets over this brand new virus that apparently came to us via a potentially government sponsored bio weapons laboratory in Wuhan China either that or because somebody decided to eat raw bad both of these possibilities are equally fucked up in completely different ways but regardless wear a bandana at the airport I thought when Johnny gave me the bandana and because I was like the hypochondriac we're in Denver we had like the the actual like disease movie experience where I went to three different drug stores you know I got a one-year-old I don't want to bring a brand new disease into the house we went to three different drug stores to find the right kind of mask which it has to be some special weird kind of mask in every single one they got this weird look in their eyes and they're like we've been sold out for days a run on germ masks oh god if I had the slightest business acumen when news of this new disease came out I would have been found out what companies manufacturing these freaking masks and bought stock in it but instead I just sat and watched the impeachment trials I would never do that anyway it's like when a war is breaking out are you gonna buy weapons it's a different conversation for a different podcast but the point is we're on the way to the airport and Johnny reaches into his backpack he's picked up two really nice bandanas from a western wear store and he gives me one and I'm like Johnny I think if we wear this they're gonna shoot us when we come to the airport it's like nothing's gonna happen just watch and sure enough nothing happened it makes me want to start wearing face bandanas everywhere because it's like weirdly liberating you know they can they can only see your eyes they can't it's like it's does the same thing for me that my beard does but even better and also there's like something really fun about just knowing you're being viciously judged by your fellow brothers and sisters for wearing a bandana and oh and also they're worried because they're like whoa like either this guy is like some kind of like throwback bad cowboy or just sick and couldn't find a face mask and we should be worried about them what I've read is that the face masks what they the thing that they do is they keep your hands from touching your mouth and your nose that's the main way to protect you because apparently in any given day most human beings touch their nose and their mouth like some in 700,000 times like just essentially like that your fingers just rain germs down on your nose and your mouth and you know you see I don't know if you've ever gone down an escalator and realized that you just basically like had your hand on the escalator the whole time or you know like just realized like oh my god I've been like I don't mean just like holding the escalator I mean that thing where you like kind of rub your hand on the escalator you don't really think about it you're just nervous or whatever you know you're on a date you're like maybe I'll massage the escalator railing but and then and then suddenly you realize you just like you know put your your hand in your mouth for a second or just kind of scratched under your nose and when you do that you're basically like a spaceship dropping some alien species on another planet only it's not another planet it's your respiratory tract and they colonize your lungs temporarily until your immune system fights them which is like the aliens already living on the planet fight back and either wipe them out or they wipe you out but because they weren't meant to live on that planet the planet dies and that planet of course is your body and then your festering body becomes like a escape hatch for people who are trying to escape or your last breaths or whatever and that's how the virus is spread which is why when you see one of these obnoxious sons of bitches prancing through a subway car sneezing as though they're like fucking graffiti artists for germs you should give them a hard stare I mean what are you gonna what are you gonna say to them they're sick who knows I'm not gonna confront somebody for sneezing because then you got to get in their face which is exactly what the germs want so you just have to back off turn away try to get away for them regardless I don't know man this Wuhan virus thing is so weird because you could find any information you want to about it on the internet you can find people saying it's like a low-level flu you can find people saying it's the new Spanish flu you can find people saying it's a some kind of like propaganda mechanism that China is using to invade Hong Kong you can find people saying anything you want on the internet now which means you essentially just have to make your own decision and I'll admit to you I did this and I have to I should do it anyway if you live in California you should do it anyway but we ordered a shit ton of water and a lot of like canned food you know just in case so what you end up with a bunch of extra water and canned food floating around it's fine nothing's gonna happen generally nothing ever happens but I don't think there's anything wrong I don't think it makes you a prepper if you have a couple of weeks supply of water and food in your house that just seems like a smart thing to do on a planet where meteorites smash into it from time to time we'll be right back sweet darlings I am a huge fan of CBD the reason being sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and can't go back to sleep I have a weird form of insomnia and

apparent preaching came bursting out of me during this particular late night podcast it uh it's not all that though thank god it is super funny but that being said I got lucky enough to make contact with some devotees from the Arata Krishna temple in Denver a particular devotee by the name of Ananda came with uh a group of just wonderful devotee musicians and at the beginning of the podcast there

of applause thank you very much good evening thank you Duncan so much for having us Duncan has asked us to come out here and share a very traditional and wonderful practice who here has heard of Kirtan has anyone heard of Kirtan before oh super sweet okay Kirtan is is such a potent form of meditation because sound carries consciousness isn't it right and and there's this sensitivity that we as living entities have to sound someone ever told you it's not what you say but it's how you said it right because consciousness is carried by this medium of sound vibration and so the ancients understood this potent practice and with that in mind they they this practice of mantra this practice of Kirtan helps to elevate the consciousness beyond the limitations of matter and so as you see up here we have this maha mantra this is a mantra that's given in many of the ancient yogic texts that describes not only the original state the natural state of the living being right but engages one in that function so this will need your participation though because Kirtan is a is a is a team sport um so we we have a few tests because it's late so it's going to make sure everyone's okay so we're going to work on some clapping we're going to just practice clapping together okay so you'll follow me you ready okay there it is there now now who speaks anyone speaks Sanskrit in here okay it's okay Daniva there you go so we're going to go with the pronunciation i'll say two words at a time and you can repeat after me okay Hare Krishna Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama Hare Hare Fantastic oh you guys are hired so what we're going to do we're going to we're going to create some movement here does that sound good but we need your help so the way it'll work is we'll chant this full mantra through and then you'll all repeat we'll chant it to a nice tune a nice beat we have some flute all right so we'll chant the full mantra tune then we'll all repeat and like that we'll create this kind of loop that we can all jump on that elevator and allow that perspective and that consciousness to elevate we'll start with a few invocation mantras feel free to close your eyes and or feel that presence that space within yourself of openness of gratitude of an opportunity is okay krishtana prashtida morning possess me jayashree krishtana chetanya prabhu

Thank you so much so Here's the thing when we do a live podcast a few things When I do an intro to the podcast usually it takes me. Oh, thank you. It's What to you might seem like thank you What what might seem like my just mindless stoned babble For me sometimes that takes days like Recording edit and I'm getting better, but it does take a little bit of time So it's and I don't have my synthesizers here and I damn well wish I brought up. I Miss I miss them so much. Thank you So I won't be able to create a song like I usually do but One thing I love to do when I have a group of people here sharing the podcast space is to Get ideas from you about what I should talk about for an opening rant for the podcast And then we'll try to roll with it and see what happens because that is what especially with Kirtan What happens is a sort of beautiful group consciousness Which is why I feel so lucky that they were so generous to come out here and do that on it like on I just they didn't like I called the temple at like 330 because I'm like damn we And the devotees are so generous that the temple they gave me a Nanda's number and he's like Well I'm driving friends to the airport, but I think I can do it So sweet So sweet So give me some give me some topics. What should we talk about tonight? What you okay? Pina grams love all right shapes. That's fun Ketamine pina grams two of my favorite things Okay Here's what we got okay hold on one at a time because I it's late at night, but I'll tell you what I heard We got pina grams. We got ketamine. We got Robert Anton Wilson. Someone said DMT burning man What's it Fisting Come on fisting David Koresh pina grams and ketamine. All right, that sounds fun So even though we've started Even though we've already started we have to do a fake start because that's what they're gonna hear When we upload it so like I just came out or something like that So please just a big cheer make it sound like we're in some math not yet. I'll sell that Okay, here we go. Never done a podcast this late I Greetings dear friends it is I Duncan Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast live from the Denver comedy work Welcome Oh you guys want to sing the song Okay, hold up, let's do it, but let's do it when I ring this gong Oh Welcome all of you glad you are with us Shake hands no need to be blue. Welcome to you It's welcome Welcome love that Too much I don't have my sense I'd like to Pina grams Wow, what a shape I Can remember when I used to think pentagrams were evil. There was a time I grew up in North Carolina And there was a time when I really did believe that that shape represented Something like bad like there could be a bad shape and Like when God was creating shapes And looking through is like square that's a good Triangle all right, I like the triangle Two triangles together I like them Squares wait what the fuck is this Five-pointed star Get this the fuck out of my universe creating laboratory And it's spun down and rained down on the earth Got on the got on the bottom of the most evil sea creature of all time the starfish Got into the sand dollar that oh my god What's more evil than a sand dollar? But I remember like when I when I still was a little superstitious about the pentagram I remember walking down the beach and picking up a sand dollar and seeing the pentagram And I somehow have missed it. Yeah, those appear on them. I'm like holy fucking shit. This is a bad sign, man This must be some kind of evil beach or something. I don't know what this is I used to have a lot of Things that are just natural that I was afraid of you know like 13 I used to be legitimately Terrified of the number 13. Are there people here who scared of 13 still anybody? 12 plus one. Yes, that's right. My brilliant mathematician friend It is 12 plus one It's also 14 minus one Yeah, just did that without a calculator Not bragging But 13 man that one really got me cuz that 2013's when my mom died 2013's when I got one of my balls cut off Yeah, just happened in the same year. Yeah, it's fucked up man 13 So then ever since then I've been like I was sent for a while. I was just really scared of that number 13 wherever would pop up I get scared now Here's a funny weird thing that happened to me once when I was in a going to liberal arts college You had to do service to get the degree at Warren Wilson College. And so My friends and I we figured that we could just like Make up a thing we were gonna do, but really it was a way to go to India like doing service. So I literally I told my the school. I'm like, okay. I want to go do service at the Hari Krishna temple in Vrindavan in India and then go do service in Dharamsala Teaching English to the monks and so we were going to do service at the school Dharamsala teaching English to the monks and so we went to the Vrindavan Hari Krishna temple and It was so great. The person there one of the devotees was like just chant Hari Krishna that will be your service here And we're all like yeah Good to us like we were picturing like cleaning out like ditches or something. You know, I was like, okay For how many hours shall we chant? But then Dharamsala is cool. I did get to sit with some of the monks and I can remember You know, there was somebody else teaching the monks English and these are Tibetan monks and in Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism The number 13 is actually a very sacred number. It's in fact their lucky number. It's like their seven and so There was this guy trying to explain to one of these monks how in the United States Some buildings don't have a 13th floor like you know like and the monk was he was looking at him perplexed Because in his mind he was like so they're floating above each other How does it work? Yeah 13 that number used to scare me so much and then And then my my son was born on January 3rd 13. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah But then this is when I when I that didn't fix it that did not fix it I was still like oh shit man. I don't know One three four shed you should have waited He would have been like you induced me motherfucker. I couldn't wait and stop but then We got him home and he got jaundice and and we had to take him back to a Nick you and that was scary and You know you're exhausted to any parents any parents out this like you know how tired you are right after that You know you the man not the woman. She's fine Totally joking about that you're both beyond time So then we in terrified because it's brand new being to the world Suddenly you just the last thing you would want something to be wrong with that baby And so you we went to this Nick you and we they put him in like it's in a Nick you it's like all these tiny little babies And they're in these like I don't know like dog pins. What are they cause? I'm not a doctor like Really like a juror like what you put a gerbil in but it's a baby and there's Aquariums They're already what yeah, they're in the matrix dude It was wild all the babies are floating in this pink goo And there's a thing is stuck to their head that projects reality into him And Keanu Reeves came in and like God is sad it got us to a better hospital. It was cool But regardless the baby was Placed in one of these and the number well what? Oh an isolate Oh an isolate What a weird name that's so fucked up an isolate It's not we're not gonna put you in solitary confinement. We're gonna We're gonna put you in an isolate for the next 25 years That's cool. Well, he was in an isolate and Is there like a more masculine thing like An isolate man. It's a tenet windows. It's one of those with tenet windows He was in an isolate and the number the isolate was 13 Yeah, and in somewhere right around that time I get a Text and it's a movie of Ramdas and the people at his house Singing happy incarnation to my boy I know But right at the moment, you know right at that place where you're like Fuck this. I've got one ball. No mom Is this now gonna like be like this eternal thing for me like am I always gonna be is this what 13 is But really it was in fact the exact opposite like the number 13 is now like My favorite number and I not because I think there's any special thing about the number 13 or a pentagram or anything like that But because what it represents is that that thing that keeps reappearing in your life Over and over and over again that you don't want to face your bad luck your thing that thing At some point you realize that that thing was your greatest teacher chasing you all around the planet Like listen wait listen. I know you wait come here for a second come here listen like get the fuck away baby No And the Bhagavad Gita one of the verses the Krishna says is of subduers I am time and Yeah, and let me tell you eventually your number 13 It's gonna catch you like on the nature channel, you know When you see like the baby thing whatever an elk whatever running running and the wolves are coming And it's getting tired and tired and tired I saw it just last night a wolf chasing a little baby gazelle or antelope And they both like when the wolf caught it they both just sat there for a second caught their breath And then the wolf ate it But yeah your number 13 is gonna catch you and So you might as well just sit down let it eat you up and that sounds really dark That sounds really dark, but I mean it in this way and the person I'm gonna bring to the stage for a few minutes Is probably gonna be able to explain it to you better than me but another great verse in the Bhagavad Gita is Arjuna this warrior fighting in this battle Krishna as his charioteer and He has Krishna show him his universal form and this is where we get the famous Oppenheimer quote that you've heard You know, do you does anyone want to yell it out? Yes, yes, I am become death destroyer of worlds and then there's a lot of other scary things That you hear one of them being something along the lines of look look look in my teeth I think it's Arjuna saying I see in your teeth all the warriors everyone being devoured by you devoured by you That's what's happening to us. We're in the digestive system of God and It's wonderful because that means God thought you were good enough to eat Like let me have a bite of that So let let it let God eat you that's what I that's what I would say if God who's picked you in the great Infinite menu of possibility to devour over the course of your lifetime Just lay back and enjoy getting chewed up You're getting eaten by love But it's that doesn't mean it's not gonna hurt it's still skinner So now very for about ten minutes I'm going to invite back to the stage Ananda who I just wanted to have a little chat about vice-nava bhakti yoga with and then after that We're gonna bring Pemberton up and get real fucking weird. So Okay Okay, but now please welcome back to the stage the wonderful Ananda. Are you still here? Yay! Thank you so much Why am I making this really awkward? Thank you so much. Thank you What do you think? Yes, I got this. It's like yeah, that's great Yeah, it's a pretty good one. I got lucky with that one My other one broke But it already been burned up at Burning Man When did you become a heart? Do you consider yourself a Hari Krishna? I'm assuming yes, okay, I drank the Kool-Aid Okay, good I drank the Kool-Aid What's the flavor of that Kool-Aid? Nectar Bliss When did it happen? So I was um It was about ten years ago. I first met a few monks. I was on campus. I was going to school at Northern Arizona University I was studying music and yeah Flagstaff and So going to school there and I came across these monks just doing some kirtan and I had no idea what it was I just thought it was a jam and I said can I bring my drum and jam with you guys and I'm like, yeah, sure And so I brought my drum over and I remember it was a it was a musical experience I'd never had before what they weren't great musicians But it wasn't it wasn't the music it was it was actually a vibration that was something much more profound, right? That I was experiencing and so from that through a very organic process of me Just having the experience with kirtan with the knowledge presented in Bhagavad Gita I came to this resolution that I want to I want to immerse myself in this and actually experience something Because I've realized throughout my life that I can't expect an experience unless I experiment I can't just be an armchair philosopher Right Or I just think of a lot of things but then I don't invest myself in them And so then from that I kind of made one of the most spontaneous decisions of my life And I shaved my head got on a bus to Chicago and ended up traveling around the country Different music festival sharing Bhagavad Gita teaching meditation And then I ended up here in Denver 2012 Was there I mean this with great respect? Yeah, yeah Was there ever a point in this where you're like, well, I'm in I'm in a cult I mean, it's interesting I mean I ask myself that all the time It's an important question If you don't ask yourself that question, that's the that's the concern Yeah It's interesting because the word cult has such this connotation By the way society has kind of molded, you know, what we know to be cults, right? Jonestown Totally That kind of thing Yeah, literally the Kool-Aid Yeah Literally the Kool-Aid Yeah So my question really to myself it wasn't like am I in a cult? My question was more like what am I and what I am and what is what I'm experiencing genuine Right And and the answer was always yes And and because of that then I've continued endeavoring in this culture of spiritual realization Sure Right, which is where the word cult comes from But cult means culture Right Right, so it was it was this progressive and consistent experience of a culture of self-realization Right You know to me after you get past the cult thing because by the way it's like and you and I right now you know what we sound like Exactly the way people in cults talk but fuck it I'm just gonna say But you know when you do think about it's like we're all going around with like weird green rectangles in our wallets That we give people for stuff and we put like crazy shit in our cars so we can drive to a place We don't want to be for eight hours a day and then we come back exhausted We've been away from our kids all day and then we lean back pop on Sean Hannity Let our ulcers bleed a little bit and we sit back and we go well, but at least I'm not in a cult So yes, I know exactly what you mean, but once you get past that and there's something that I am have been Particularly with chanting Ari Krishna that is always I've always gotten to a point where it becomes so powerful That it's frightening like there's something in it that is so you know the story Maybe you can tell the story of the Rosalila the gopis going off into the forest because do you know about do you know what I'm talking about Yeah Yeah, so just this experience of total absorption Yes Right where it's said in Sanskrit that living entities were us Jivas were this by nature it's called Tattashta And Tattashta means on the ocean or at the ocean at the beach where the water just meets the sand It's not quite beach and it's not quite ocean it's that Tata in the middle that Tattashta area and living entities were like this also We want to be absorbed in something and so this past time of the divine dance The gopis of Vrindavan are exhibiting the highest level of absorption in pure love for the divine The gopis can you make something out of that? Yeah, totally totally gopis so in the Vedic canon not only does it describe a very in-depth philosophy and a very in-depth theology Right and a science of meditation a science of Self-realization But it describes the various levels that living entities actually attain to a love for God right in in Greek the words agape This kind of is a different type of love than just maybe what we experienced which is which is actually a reflection like Plato's cave in allegory Right I'm looking at a I'm looking at a wall and I'm seeing shadows but actually it's a dim reflection of the of the true reality So in a similar way there are these relationships that we experience these reflections of relationships that we experience And it's described that that love for God continues to increase more and more in such a way that it becomes absolutely selfless It's it's not a love that's based on what do I get but how much can I give right And so the gopis exhibit the highest level of this love and in Sanskrit it's called Prema So in this in this exhibition of divine love they're they're fully giving of themselves in this divine Prema which is devoid of any blemish But they all the thing that's one of the stories I love is you hear Christmas flute in the forest and they leave everything they leave the candles burning They leave everything they hear this flute is so beautiful and they and they just they're like all right fuck whatever this was I'm going in that direction That's what you did and and that's what you're talking about I think when you're saying eventually you've got to get off the couch and like go towards the flute You got to go for it but wow it's scary because at some point it can feel irresponsible you feel like you're you know what I mean You're like you really are detaching from a map that has been lived on by lots of people in the modern world called popular culture Yeah and you're heading off into the forest and then those maps they start getting a little different a little blurry and you're not quite sure To me that's scary that's scary sometimes I wonder would it have been better to not hear the flute and just watch Sean Hannity Joseph Campbell talks about the hero's journey right and that that there's this and and and within that there's a wonderful book that I that I just recently read called falling upward by Richard Roar you've heard this book amazing book right and he talks about the necessary suffering of growth right there there are There's certain there's a type of fungus right that actually only grows after it's shocked like we hear of like in the redwoods Like the seeds actually only take root after fire right because because the heat of the fire and then the ash and the nutrition that comes from the burning fuel right actually then allows those seeds to then grow deeply into the earth and then grow strong so there is this necessary suffering that comes preemptively before growth inevitably and and yeah it is scary but it's a lot scarier to be ignorant of reality so wow I got lucky tonight Wow I'm so lucky that you came Ananda you are brilliant thank you so much for chanting with us and for your wisdom Ananda everybody

crisis because they sent me a beautiful bouquet of flowers right before I went on the road and it made it seem like I had like done something very romantic for my wife when in fact it just like randomly happened and so for a second I had to think like Jesus Christ do I lie and tell her that I ordered these four because I'm going on the road and then I felt bad because I'm like why didn't you think to order flowers before you went on the road she's wonderful she's the mother of your child but I told her the truth I said they came from Ram Dass which is I guess not I guess is still kind of not the truth I mean I said you know the spirit of the universe brought these to you but anyway they're beautiful that's the point they're really beautiful and they smell so good and it filled our

applause for Johnny Payburn and everybody Johnny where's your guitar Johnny we're gonna do it again we did it we rehearsed it differently him coming out now everybody you probably saw him this weekend a giant round of applause for Johnny Payburn Johnny welcome welcome this is fun Johnny recently has also gotten into a cult what's yours called I don't know is it marriage I don't know with so many cults if you so if you had to start a cult yeah what would it look like what would it look like if I had to start a cult I mean I've kind of thought about this a little bit because I think a cult is essentially like what you want the ultimate birthday party to be you know it's like a cult is what you want the ultimate birthday party yeah if like the ultimate birthday like if you could if you could like custom build your ultimate birthday party which would for me be no birthday party do you hate birthday parties I hate birthday parties I hate them this is the this is the duality of the universe right here this is this because I don't want to have a big old party I want to have like a bunch of country musicians who are all dead like reanimate them okay have them play in like a big nice lawn there's a lot of shade okay but I want what upon the reanimation say Johnny Cash he'd be good you know he's a good singer I actually wasn't going to have him though so you know he's great but I mean who would you who would you reanimate I'd probably get Ernest Tub up there okay Ernest Tub so you've just like brought Ernest Tub back from the dead yeah so he's probably screaming right he's like what the fuck am I I'm coughing what do you say to him say hey it's my birthday I guess yeah you what where's my wife I'm gonna ask him if he wants a cigarette he would definitely want a cigarette okay so now you've calmed him down a little bit he's smoking a cigarette you've got a reanimated zombie country singer what do you do after he sings at your party do you kill him again and like bring him back once a year yeah once a year yeah he's like a zombies chain to the ground and I think it would be we don't have a lot of oxygen a lot of pure oxygen IV fluids yeah and you know that would be it that's what you really need that would be it okay so you got your undead country singers what else is in this cult I mean I don't know like pure oxygen pure oxygen IV fluids and maybe um I don't know I could just be custom tailored if you want demoral you could have that I suppose I'm in that's all you had to say that's that's the cult but it's a one day cult it's like a thing you live to die your voice sounds so perfect for the voicemail message of this cult hi welcome to Johnny Pemberton's birthday death cult if you're here for the first time you like to listen to Ernest Tub press 2 if you'd like to listen to Hank Williams the third he's still alive you've reached the wrong message what's the demoral number man oh you have to show up for that okay I don't know if that's really a cult well first of all let me just say only like I'm not saying that the hard Christians are a cult or whatever I hope I don't sound like I'm bashing them by the way I love cults PS they're all awesome yeah it's great to be a cult cult's great it's fine that's right it means you're doing something right it's a fucking cult so it must be interesting have you ever encountered like an actual dangerous cult I don't think so maybe I have I didn't know it I did go to the museum of psychiatry put on by the Scientologists I did go to that hey they're great we upload this to the internet I don't want to lose it love them they're great let's talk about something else they're great it's fine I love them I'm a member now I have a son they know his name I bet they do they can't wait to meet him how was that fun it was actually pretty fun psychiatry kills that's the name of the museum I don't think it's still there we left though that was the weirdest part they really want to get all your information and they have like a bunch of people kind of hanging out who are really nice and they're like why are you here you're just like hanging out at the exit you're like of the psychiatry museum oh hey Bob hey Julia good to see you Bob is about 60 and Julia is like 22 you guys aren't friends yeah but she's hanging out oh wow what are you guys just like hey you've been watching oh cool you live there wow that's a cool name it's not my name ha ha ha ha ha it was crazy oh what a beautiful name I love the Simpsons ha ha ha there was a cult that would come to my college like an authentic cult cult the kind of cult that you hear about on the news but I don't think they ever made it on the news and I can't remember the name of the cult but like matching footwear is that the name of the cult do they have matching footwear you know sandals you know I'm gonna be honest man at the time I wasn't like paying attention to the cultist sandals but you're right that's where you should look first why what are you saying I just always think about the Heavens Gate Nikes you know that was such a good move but they matched what are you saying like don't go to a cult that has matching shoes no do I don't hear such a death call either no I do I think the Heavens Gate they had like a good internet presence ha ha ha they had so much stuff going for they had like a clear design like they had like a nice like um graphical what do you call it they had a nice they were art directed yeah honestly my publicist is actually was having Gates publicist I'm not joking he's wonderful man you're lucky he's hard to get who are these people who showed up they showed up in a bus that on the back of the bus was written going home and ha ha like yeah just what you'd expect and they were beautiful that that was the other thing about them these weren't like these were like like glamour hippies you know what I mean like they were pretty they're like you know I'm talking about like sometimes you run into a particular type of hippie that really does look like he came out of a JR Tolkien book or something you know like sometimes I wonder if those are the aliens like I've been given a DMT pin by one of them I'm not joking it's the kind of people who like they're like this like oh you have to pay for that yeah exactly exactly overalls they're like beautiful like they they come from some just they just hopped into like hell for a few minutes like hi what's up hi my name's Mercurio I by the way for any authorities here all this stuff I say it as a joke I did none of this has really happened but I remember one of them like gave me a DMT vape pen and was like here first of all he was referring to himself in the plural so he's like we wanted to give this to you and he's like we are trying to upshift the consciousness of planet earth right now so we made a bunch of these and we're just trying to get them out to as many people as we can yeah we know we like there's some DMT vape pen blacksmith shop underneath the rainbow where all these beautiful hippies are like very beautiful vape pen it was like that and then he's gone just vanishes into the crowd the beautiful hippie all that I'm left with very very powerful DMT vape pen just joking never happened but it was like that version of hippie but sinister they were like sinister so they would stand in the courtyard of the college one of them reading the bible ferociously reading the bible and me and my friend Emil would like I remember Emil Amis the best we went and stood you know just watching them laughing because we knew it was a cult and he made eye contact with me that's good oh fuck man this shit this guy made Charles Manson look like somebody who works at like a shoe store or something like that this was like his charisma he just was like the lord sat here's his laugh it's like the lord detests mockers I was frozen I was like we gotta get the fuck out of here man I don't know I don't know what this is but they might have magic powers who knows I don't know and we split but every year they would show up and at least like one student from warren wilson would be gone they get in the van they get in the bus they went home going home it was seven tribes I would remember it wasn't the seven it might have been though it was up in North Carolina it could have been the seven tribes PS if it is the seven tribes it's not that's not what I'm talking about leave me alone I have a son I love you guys whatever you are it's fine no offense if you're one of them all I know is they took people away in a bus that said going home on the back maybe they took them home I don't know they just gave people rides I don't know but that's an interesting life I guess if you go away in the hippie bus that's like could be cool I think I wanted to do that when I was young I wanted to be like a bohemian me too there's not enough toilets though it's one of the biggest problems sanitation because you have a show coming up where you're going to talk about this can we talk about it here for a second sure if you want to awesome cool yeah Johnny's about to dive into something that I think is one of the most difficult things to do in comedy I tried to do it this weekend with some success because I've had testicular cancer but thank you so much I really appreciate it but and it's scary to do that because on one hand you don't want to bum people out you know what I mean on the other hand it's really if you haven't figured out an angle on it where you're actually cool with it they're going to sense that you have to really come to terms with it but tell me about your bowel disease it's like the worst setup but it's like sorry I mean it's nothing you can do you couldn't do a good job it's not possible that's the nature of the thing is that anyway you slice it it's still shit you know right it's called all sort of colitis but I had my colon taken out a long time ago so now I have something called pouchitis sometimes and it's exactly you better be booing the disease demon how else could I possibly interpret right that's what it is and it's something I've dealt with it for such a long time it's not like a thing where I don't think about it actively a lot but I've had a lot of crazy experiences because of it and I think a lot of those experiences because I had them when I was so young they've like colored a lot of things for me that I think if I didn't have those experiences I think I'd be a much different person maybe not as good I would have a lot more learning to do I think right because I learned a lot of stuff really in the hard way when I was really young and didn't realize I was learning it's more just like you have to deal with situations that are that primitive that kind of makes you think about things differently you mean like it's just like because it's two things tied in it's not just that you have you know a limp or a spinal disorder some kind of thing like that what's going on with you is actually tied in to piss to pooping right so it's like why did I say pissing I was gonna say I don't know what a bowel is but so it's like you also have tied into it this like thing that's like almost Freudian man you know like real quick when my wife was pregnant I had to go buy her diapers yeah sorry this is something that happens because sometimes when people are really pregnant they pee themselves that just happens but I remember going in there and really feeling embarrassed about buying the diapers and then thinking like did some awful person in the distant past like do for diapers what Hitler did for the Hitler mustache why am I ashamed of this thinking around like oh so that's what I'm saying it's like it's tied into a thing that we're already kind of hung up about which makes sense because it's ties in like a thing of like basic human sanitation so you feel like you are it's the thing is abhorrent for a reason like shit smells bad because it's dirty and it's not you're not supposed to eat it what? wait what did you just say then what will I eat you're not supposed to eat it it's not supposed to there's also like a lot of stuff that has to do with like control and there's a lot of things we all have like this false sense of control in our lives and I think if you if you have a bowel disease you lack a lot of control on a very fundamental part of your life and so it sort of teaches you to be humble in that sense where you're kind of like oh I don't have control over this thing that everyone else has control over so maybe I'll try to exercise control on something else I got you you can exercise control on the arts because you can create stuff and you have control over the thing you've created right beautiful script man it's like this sounds like it is a non sequitur but it leads into what we're talking about I saw this thing on YouTube man it's the most fucked up thing I've seen so many fucked it's not the most fucked up thing the most fucked up thing I saw well on the internet the most fucked up thing I saw on the internet recently was a pit bull chewing a guy's dick off did a podcast I'm glad you didn't send me that I almost did I bet you did I was within seconds of like I've never seen a more horrible thing in my life this has nothing to do with what we're talking about but what I did see was it's a guy it's some sports event who has picked up some kind of firecracker and was I guess gonna throw it or something and it just blew his hand off wow and I was watching it because there's the moment where the guy's kind of looking at his hand yeah and people are like screaming before everyone just starts screaming and you see him like looking and you know he's thinking like is this a dream this is a dream right I didn't just drunkenly pick up an explosive and blow my hand off did I but for the rest of his life his hand's gone there's no way it's coming back and so that guy was starting a new life after that where he's gonna have to like do everything over again you might be a better guy yeah I hope so you know about Daruma the Japanese monk Daruma I think that's his name there are these little clay or paper mache figurines of this I don't know maybe 15th century something monk named Daruma I don't know his full name but he how the Daruma works is you color in you make a goal and you color in one of the eyes when you make the goal when you finish the goal you color in the other eye and this monk Daruma he was such a procrastinator and having so much trouble getting stuff done that he cut his arm off as a reminder to himself he's such as like a severe reminding himself of what to basically like to teach himself as like a like a permanent reminder that he could cut off his own arm I mean wow essentially no I know what you mean though this is like that verse in the bible if your eye offends the pluck it out it's like this concept of like whatever the thing is in you that's holding you back extreme commitment it's like getting a face tattoo or something where it's like well I guess I'm gonna be a rapper you know I mean it's funny but I really think that's fucking absolutely true if you like get a bunch of face tattoos you're basically so committed to your thing what else can you fucking do you gotta do it that's true do you think somebody came up to Daruma and they're like listen do you want a face tattoo or you want to cut your arm off he's like it's cooler to have one arm than a face tattoo but I know what you mean that I do think that is one of the most important things a person can do in their life is find a thing like that and like commit to it to do it to really go for it but it's rare it's rare to pull it off you know like for most of us I think it's thrust upon us you know like a thing comes our way and then a bowel disease our balls get sick our you know whatever you have a baby whatever it may be that your plans whatever your idea what was going to happen in your life doesn't happen and goes completely in the different direction than you thought it would and in that moment this is something Ramadan talks about all the time that's the moment where you can choose to be up all night thinking man if only I hadn't picked up that fucking firecracker man I would have that's it that's that's a moment where you can do that or you just do what you're supposed to do when you're dreaming which is get into the next dream it's like fuck well got one hand now oh shit I got one ball now you have a bowel disease on the guy who has this now that's how it is and that's it and then with the moment you stop resisting that everything becomes exactly the way it was before it becomes even better you know usually better yeah definitely better because you've you've learned a lot because it's something where you can't it's a lesson that you can't unlearn especially if your hand blows off because you're looking at it all the goddamn time and here's the good news my friends this is the first official announcement Johnny and I are starting a cult and and here's the even better news we have put in everyone's drink tonight there oh wait did everyone get their drinks it's a virus it's it's gonna give you a bowel disease not for another year though you have a year I would also like to invite you to snip off one of your balls if you're a man in the audience and maybe blow your hand off and then they will know you are our family no don't it's not a tomorrow thing this is a now thing yeah with there's no such thing it's tomorrow baby tomorrow doesn't exist this reminds me of something a channeler said to me Paul Selig one of his channeled entities I've interviewed him on my podcast I don't know if I said this on the podcast and I feel like I shouldn't I think it's okay for me to say it say it okay Paul Selig when I was introduced to him in New York I didn't really quite believe in channelers I was like I don't know if this stuff is real the person who introduced me to him I trusted but I thought it'd make an interesting podcast I was sitting with this guy and like you can just feel energy and then I he smells he smells he smells great here's the point that still smells he smells great it still smells so I mean it's I'm right I am right no don't agree with him he gave you a bowel disease the point is this one of these entities said to me pain is only one of the ways to learn that's just one you know and I'm all caught up in that one for some reason but y'all you don't have to snip your ball get a bowel disease or have your hand blown off apparently you can also learn and grow and get it wise by love by loving and opening up to others apparently that's what they say but that's true so I think it's the idea and I love what Ananda said up front is dive into that you know and I'm not going to get all cheesy and spiritual for much longer because Johnny's about to sing an incredible song that we respect stage yeah you are I'm going to play the parts but one of the things that Neem Karoli Baba said about Jesus is he lost himself in love not he's fake you fucking atheist I thought Jesus fucking Christ man Boramir and the Lord of the Rings is fake but I learned from him like he doesn't have to be real oh no shit no offense a lot of my friends are atheists but we get it Jesus is fake okay so what what's real man that's what I want to know get on the bus baby get on the bus he lost himself in love that's what you can do that's the most intense thing you could do just ask how you can help and do that that's the next thing and then watch what happens to your life sure maybe your balls still get snipped off or you'll get the bowel disease or your hand will get blown off or whatever but it won't be the same as when you don't have that in your life that sense of how can I help how can I give this is what I've learned from Ram Dass that's my cheesy fucking thing I'll probably snip it out of the podcast that's how I feel hey you guys are awesome I love you I love you and now Johnny is going to sing a couple of songs we've got about nine minutes left here can I see your guitar Johnny do you want this pick or no I'll just do hands what's your thing with me using my just my hands on your guitar no it's not I just thought you'd like a pick but it grosses you out once I picked up his guitar it's not at all and he's like don't get your hand cells on my guitar do you know how old these strings are no they're fucking these are eleven year old strings change your strings no they say man change your strings change your life man I don't want to change this right now that's good but that's this song weirdly coincidentally the name of this song

141^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - BRODY STEVENS Transcript and Discussion^2013-12-24^Welcome to the CPAP Games Live from the Hayes Bedroom, it's another eventful night, Bruce. It sure is, Ron. Steve has been flailing everywhere struggling with this CPAP. His wife, Michelle, is as tense as a fiddle string trying to contain her rage. Michelle's rolling Steve over. There he goes, and the mask is off! Oh my, the snoring! Michelle throws an elbow, now a shove! And she's leaving for the couch, taking her place as the Hayes' 100-pound lab. Bask in that dog breath, Steve. With all this struggle, Steve should get inspired. Absolutely, Bruce.

Innovation. Inspire is not for everyone. Talk to your doctor to see if it's right for you and review important safety information at Inspiresleep.com. Happy holidays, everybody! And I want to send some special love out to those of you who have journeyed to the homes of your significant others for the first time during the holiday season. That is a very stressful situation. It's a kind of hidden cold war that nobody even talks about. No one talks about it on the news. No one will talk about it on TV. But right now, if you really tune in and take a deep breath and really feel the force that is the connective tissue between all human minds on the planet right now, you can actually feel the tangible, oozing stress of boyfriends sitting at various tables and couches with the disappointed parents of their girlfriends. It is a real sweat right now. It's a little marathon that nobody ever talks about. It's the process of getting through two or three or maybe even four days with your significant others' parents. And man, it's a mindfuck. It's a mindfuck. It might be great. Maybe their parents are awesome. But sometimes their parents could be awesome, but they don't think you're awesome. The parents could be disappointed by you, for example. This has been my primary experience every time that I've ever gone home with any significant other. Now, I could easily be projecting this, but I imagine that if you're a traditional Republican parent, the last thing you want to see your girlfriend bringing into the house is some bearded acid casualty. Weirdo who won't stop spouting off about unfortunate philosophies that have absolutely nothing to do with steel production or whatever business they were part of when they were young. It's a weird feeling. Now, I don't know the answer to getting through it. Quite often, for me, the answer had been finding some prescription medication and trying to numb myself as much as I could during the time period, but I don't think that's the best answer. I mean, really, I think there's a lot of cool ways you can frame it so that you don't have to feel so freaked out. You could pretend to be an anthropologist. You could pretend to be some form of Jane Goodall who has journeyed deep into the breeding grid where your significant other's parents live. Because if you're somebody who comes from a city or if you're somebody who hasn't had a lot of time in suburbia and you suddenly find yourself there, it's really fascinating. That is a breeding grid. That's just like the place in America where the mating happens. That's the mating pond, especially if you're in the house that your significant other grew up in. Holy shit, you can smell the condensed exhalations of a lifetime in that place and feel the weird house smell that parents are able to create. You know, every house has its own kind of BO and it's just the strangest thing. You get into that thing and then you can feel the vibration of the place. You are feeling the oven that grew the personality of the person you are now in love with. And you should look at it as though you're an anthropologist. Just study and watch. Not like a Vulcan. Open your heart. Be there fully in the moment, but don't allow yourself to shut down because you can't handle the stress of all the strange, unresolved issues that inevitably are echoing around the walls of whatever home your beloved grew up in. Now, it's not always the case. I know that there are great families out there and it could be that you're in some kind of tree house with a bunch of amazing hippie parents and they're just completely embracing and loving you and not sizing you up, trying to see what way you're going to destroy their son or daughter. It could be that you're with people who have been practicing unconditional positive regards since the 60s. Maybe they know how to manufacture DMT or maybe they're all massage therapists or yogis and you walk in and you just feel like you've come home. Congratulations if that's happened to you. But if you're somebody who finds yourself in what might as well be an insane asylum surrounded by parents who perhaps worship some kind of drooling death god that hates gays and marijuana, then that's a tricky place to be, you know? Because like, oh, you're going to try to, if you really, really want to see what you act like when you're trying to be something you're not, there's no better time to study that than when you're with the parents of your significant other. Because more than likely you are going to try to transform into some version of Captain Kirk mixed with Obama. You want them to think that you are, that you came walking down a stairway made of sunbeams into their daughter's life. You want them to think that you have, or one of the people who helped come up with a cure for smallpox or you would like it if they started crying with love and happiness over the fact that you are with their daughter. And so you're going to start acting in all these ridiculous ways. And it's hilarious to watch. Don't try to change it. Just watch the tail feathers pop up as you have the conversation with the father. Listen to your, listen to, listen to the internal publicist that lives inside your head spitting out facts that you think somehow are going to make this man like you more. And then watch the way that you listen to the man as he talks to you. Are you feigning interest? Well, that's interesting. Watch yourself feign interest. Watch yourself pretend to think whatever thing he said is funny. Did you suddenly just become a Republican? Wait a minute. Are you listening to yourself actually say things that seem to mirror Mike Huckabee's monologues on the Fox News Network? Did that just happen to you? Yes. Was it that quick? Was it that quick that you immediately shifted and became something you're absolutely not? You're like a soldier right now. Only you're not in the jungle wearing camouflage that looks like the forest. You're on the breeding grid of middle America wearing the subjective camouflage that makes your significant other's parents think that you're some mix between Rush Limbaugh and Jerry Falwell and that's fine. You can do that. You can do that. I mean, you certainly don't want to upset the situation. Maybe you're the opposite of that. And for some weird reason, you want to rattle things up at your girlfriend or boyfriend's house. You're just in revolt. Now you're in rebellion against these weird old progenitors who at some point merge their genetic material together so that your sweet darling could give you blowjobs one day. Don't rebel and don't act like something you're not if you can help it. Just be exactly who you are. Be completely honest. See what happens. Not asshole honest either. Don't get into some table talk about your last DMT trip or try to tell the parents that the holidays are actually based on an ancient pagan druidic mushroom cults or geastic rituals that happened during the solstice. There's no need to have that conversation. Just be in the moment. Open your heart and try to love these two people. Even if they're complete dicks, which they really might be. They might be alcoholic, angry, judgmental, fundamentalist dicks. It's possible, it's possible, but you owe them a big thanks, don't you? Because you're in love. And if these two sweet darlings created your beloved whoever, then they're your greatest friends, even though they don't like you. So just go from that platform if you can. And if you're spending Christmas by yourself, congratulations. Somehow you manage to not get entangled into the terrible web that so many other little human flies are now wriggling on as they try to pass time so that they can finally return back to their lives where they are fully themselves. That's really the main thing, isn't it? That's really the main problem when you go back home with your parents, isn't it? It's that you feel like they don't accept you for who you are. You feel like you're having to act like somebody else. And that sucks. It creates a kind of cognitive dissonance. And also if your parents have always not been very happy with who you are, then when you end up going back or being around them, then you kind of have like, sometimes you guys know about the observer effect, I'm sure. That's in quantum physics. It's the idea that the actual observation of quantum particles can change the way they act. Well, and that sometimes when you're around judgmental parents, you're the quantum particle and their judgment seems to actually cause some kind of shift in your psychic energy so that you revert backwards many years and turn back into that oily, fat, confused being that they tried to change in so many different ways using techniques such as shaming, yelling or abuse, punching maybe. And so then suddenly you find yourself back and you're that old thing that you used to be before you climbed out of your shell and managed to start becoming something authentic and real. That's a fun thing to watch. Watch that too. You don't just have to be at the parents of your girlfriend's house to study things. If you end up at your parents' house, you can study that too. And if you end up by yourself, you can study the reactions that you're having too. You can watch the way that from time to time waves of sentiment might roll over you or there could be a feeling that something's wrong with you because you're not in the presence of some family or some girlfriend or boyfriend. All of these things are fun to watch because what you're seeing is a lifetime worth of conditioning, culminating in whatever your emotional state is during the winter solstice and it's a really cool time to look at how you have been programmed and how you've been conditioned and not in an awful way. Just let yourself be there with it because it's really cool and it's really fun. And also if you're lucky enough to be in Los Angeles right now, it's amazing because there's no traffic or very little traffic. Also I think the combined tension of all the actors that are usually trying to get to auditions when that's not in the air, it's like somebody loosened the belt of the city by three or four notches. It just feels more relaxed. So happy holidays everybody, enjoy the breeding grid, enjoy being with your family, enjoy watching the way that you are trying to trick everybody into thinking that you're something different than you are. Just watch it. Don't suddenly come out of the closet or don't suddenly start acting like David Bowie. That's just rebellion anyway. The best thing you could do is just watch the way you interact when you're in the presence of your progenitors or the progenitors of your sweet darling lover because it's hilarious and I think you can really learn a lot from it. Hare Krishna! Today's guest, Stevens Brody Stevens is awesome. Just quick advertisements, really quick because this is a long podcast.

Finally, there's no better way if you really want to retreat into the darkness of Christmas and you don't feel like watching cable and you want to catch up on reading but you don't want to hold some flop book or maybe you're jogging or maybe sometimes when we're with our girlfriend's parents, we find ourselves going on a lot more walks than usual or volunteering to wash the dishes more. Anything to take us out of the pressure cooker that is the home of our significant other's parents. It can be really brutal is what I'm saying. If you want a little escape and you've got an iPhone or a smartphone or a tablet or pretty much anything with electricity in it, then you should download audiobooks from Audible.com. You've got great audiobooks. Right now, I am listening to a Jack Cornfield audiobook called A Path With Heart and it's amazing. I love it. It's a really good, it's got a lot of good meditation instruction on it as well as some awesome observations about Buddhism. Some things I'd never even thought of which is that boredom is actually a form of anger. Never considered that but in Buddhism, boredom is considered to be a form of anger. It's not weird. And also, anger is generally results from fear. I guess I kind of knew that but the next time you find yourself about to get really pissed off and yell at somebody, if you stop and look at what's generating that, it's fear. You're afraid. There's some kind of thing that you're afraid is going to happen. You're afraid you're going to, you're just afraid of losing control or losing a person or whatever. The audiobook is filled with cool little tidbits like that and if you go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership, you can get the book for free and you can cancel the membership if you don't want to stay with Audible. They just basically give a free audiobook out. And when you do that, they give us 15 bucks every time somebody signs up. So it's a way for you to support this podcast and get a free audiobook.

Now, everybody, let's start this podcast. I'm trying to think of a way to summarize Brody Stevens because I give them a big introduction on the podcast anyway. But some people, I get around them and they're so authentically themselves that they become my teacher no matter what it is that they're doing because it's like, wow, here's a person who is fearlessly just letting himself be exactly who he is. And that's Brody Stevens. Be somebody who has fully realized that the funniest thing you can do is just be yourself. And that is a real, to surrender to that and to really just allow yourself to be as you are, it takes some serious, serious courage. And also, it makes, if you're a stand-up comedian, it will make you one of the funniest comedians out there. And that's who Brody Stevens is. And we're all very happy that he's having this immense surge of success because we love him. And when I say we, I mean the entire human race. So everybody please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast for the second time, the man who now has a show on Comedy Central, Midnights at Sunday. Please watch it. Please, please tune in so that the show keeps going for a long time. This is a man who has also been on HBO. He's also, you've seen him in the Hangover. If you haven't seen him perform live, please go see him perform live because you will witness one of the most hilarious and unique comics around today. Okay. I think I'm going to repeat all this stuff while he's in the room. So forgive me for the weird intro. I love you guys. Happy holidays. Hug your mommy. Hug your daddy. No matter how awful they are or how awful you think they are because they're not really awful, underneath all that stuff that you feel that you're reacting to is a great molten core of love for you. And no matter how, what weird ways that love might come out, just have faith that underneath it all, they just want you to be okay. I think. Okay, everybody here at the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, Steven Brody Stevens. Enjoy it. I'm here with a comedian who's been on my podcast for a long time, and he's been on my podcast for a long time, and he's been on my podcast for a long time, and he's been on my podcast for a long time. I'm here with a comedian who's been on my podcast in some very dark times and is now experiencing what a lot of comedians consider the very height of success, the culmination, the fruition of years and years and years and years and years of work, rejection, not being accepted, being pushed away by crowds, maintaining the integrity. His integrity as an artist, not pandering. He could have changed it any time. Any time he could have changed. Any time he could have started doing crappy jokes or he could have gotten married and talked about what it's like to have to drive his kids around in the SUV, but he didn't do it. He got up on stage night after night after night after night in the filthy original room of the comedy store, fully being himself. Somewhere along that path, he had a nervous breakdown, ended up going into a mental hospital and like the phoenix rising from the ashes, Brody Stevens emerged and he emerged better. He emerged with more confidence, fully himself and because of that, the universe is now rewarding him with great gifts and he has his own show on Comedy Central called Enjoy It. Everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour, the great Brody Stevens. Wow, thank you, Duncan. That was a great intro. Thank you. I had my eyes closed and I was just letting you go and I was playing off you as pantomining. Pantomining. Yeah, it was awesome. I wish we'd filmed that. Yeah, it would have been good. We actually put two videos up on Instagram. Yeah, Brody just did the Oculus Rift. He came over and tried on VR goggles and I actually forgot to tell him that it causes motion sickness and it made him a little nauseous. Yeah, I'm just getting over that actually right now. So I'm a little nauseous from that, but. What are your impressions of the Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles? The physical goggles, putting them on, they're pretty comfortable, not uncomfortable. But in the game, what do you think of being in that place? I thought it was kind of cool. I wanted to explore more. It was like we were at a Spanish villa. Yes. I saw, you could see things and go up to it. I'm going to go up to the wall and kind of try and look over and using the keyboard. I know there's probably a learning curve, but using a keyboard. I walked in the house and I wanted to go upstairs and see what's happening. Do they have a flat screen or is it, it's probably a king size, no, I would say it's a queen size bed. They don't overdo it in those Spanish villas. Right. That's where I felt I was. So. Italian villa. Italian villa, exactly. But it was kind of cool. There was birds. There were sounds. It was peaceful and it was fairly clear when I sat. I'm just kind of given a tech review. When I sat still, I was, it really had that high definition. You're right there and you can hear it, but when you move, it took a little to adjust. But me personally, I guess, yeah, I got a little, after a minute or two, kind of started getting a little sickness, nauseous and it, it's taken me probably about 15 minutes to settle down. And it is so cool to see you right now because I've, we've all watched you, all of your friends watched you go into what, uh, many, what is in Western society, one of the very, like one of the really low place, a really, really low place, which is that you ended up having a manic episode and, uh, became, uh, you were put violent. You became violent. You became depressed. You were put into a mental hospital. Shocking. Uh, and, and, and you, and the whole thing was, um, what was really fascinating about it was a whole thing is like when you tweeted your nervous breakdown. So people saw this sort of, uh, acceleration, uh, in the direction of psychosis. They sort of watched it happen. A lot of your really close friends were like trying to protect you and help you. And, uh, you ended up, um, coming out of the mental hospital and you had, um, you were medicated, uh, you were on a lot of like medications and, uh, I'm sorry. When your dog's barking, we're going to edit that. You were, uh, heavily medicated. And when you did this podcast, you were in a really rough state, man. You weren't like yourself. You were, uh, medicated. You didn't, you, they, they hadn't figured out like the right balance of medication and you didn't know what to do. And you were in, uh, you know, sort of still recovering from this, you know, uh, break that happened this, this, um, whatever you want to call it. Um, and now being around you, it's like being around you before all that happened. Only a million times better. That's what's cool. That's a really cool thing to me, Brody. That's an amazing thing to me that you, um, that you climbed out of it. And now not only that, but you're having all of this like worldly success to go along with it. Well, I wouldn't call it worldly. They can't access the show in Canada. You know what I mean? Like the world is giving you treasures now. I would say that in form of a billboard, there's a physical treasure, something that's tangible. You have a full size billboard over pink dot on Sunset Boulevard. Now this is, for those of you who don't know about the comedy store, this is a particularly poignant spot to get a billboard when you've been working for how many years you've been doing standup comedy? I put the February of 1994 on my, my track. Wow. So that is so long to be, and you're, you're not just a comic who goes up once a week or once, you know, every once in a while. You're a comic who has been working nonstop. Like you go out at night and you do multiple sets. You seem to constantly be writing. You've, you've really, really, really put the time into it. So you're partially right. You don't partially agree with that. Well, I don't think I, I'm picking, I mean, I, I'm, I'm not picking apart what you said. I don't know if I do multiple sets. It's rare actually in Los Angeles too. I've just, I've seen your tweets. Sometimes you tweet about doing. I think you're right. You're right. I think you're right. I, I, I do, but I'm comparing myself to say a New York comedian who really does multiple sets when you're doing six. Yeah. Up to six at night. I'm not, I'm not doing that. Am I getting that mic time as much as them for the most part? Most guys, yes. If you want to look at it that way, but stand up wise, you know, New York comedians and my eyes, that's where it's at. That's the energy. That's the development ground. And I will always give respect to those comedians. Not to say there aren't funny people coming out of Los Angeles and other cities, but I think my opinion, the true American comedian has to spend time, stand up wise in New York for a period of time, whether it be a year. How much time did you spend in New York? I spent three years. Three years doing shows in New York. Yeah. We're feeling the energy, you know, learning customs of the East coast and. What, like what? Well, you know, you got a different kind of person out there. You know, I grew up here in Southern California. I went to school in, in Phoenix. I mean, I kind of was around this Southwestern Los Angeles, no snow kind of vibe. And I knew that, you know, later on in life that you, you, you got to kind of experience things. And in my heart, I always wanted to go to New York. There's just some, some draw for me, even as a, you know, I think it started when I was in maybe junior high school, high school. I always wanted to go to New York. It was just something that was drawing me there. And so when I had the opportunity to go there, which was in 1997, I kind of jumped at it. What's your favorite New York memory? I would say my favorite New York memory, if you're to say. I mean, there's, there's a lot of, I have a lot of memories, a lot of moments I can talk about. I would say, you know, a highlight. I mean, you're asking memories. I have tons of memories. There are some memories that stick out a little more than others. But I would say my highlight, we'll talk about maybe professionally, I would say is performing at the Luna Lounge there in New York, which was like the equivalent equivalent to Largo or, you know, Comedy Death Ray out here in Los Angeles. It had that kind of clout. And when I did a couple spots and I hosted and I was performing with Todd Barry or Mark Marin or maybe even Dave Chappelle at the time came up and those kind of comedians. I was performing with considering, you know, the top hip comedians and that gave me confidence right there. That was kind of the final validation that I needed. Like, hey, I can go to Los Angeles with a marketable skill and somehow maybe get, get something, whatever that may be. But that was kind of, I think, my highlight if you had a look at that. When, so when, for those of you who haven't seen Brody, he has one of the most unique standup acts that you'll ever see. It's amazing. And it's, it's just not like anything else. A lot of comedians, you know, they sort of adhere to this very similar form, almost like, you know, a comedy is almost a form of haiku or something with this very specific rhythm and a very specific pattern. And Brody, even though you have that, you still have that pattern. What you're doing is my favorite kind of thing to see because it shows you how, how, how gigantic standup could be as a form of self expression, how, how you can actually redefine the art form and be this completely unique original thing. And I think a lot of comics forget that. And because out of fear, you begin to imitate what seems to be successful. Talk about how you got to that place. You couldn't have started off like that in the very beginning. There had to be some kind of evolution to get you to the point where you're sort of fearlessly just being yourself on stage. Yeah, I would say growing up, I grew up in Los Angeles, I grew up in the same Fernando Valley, fairly typical divorced parent, mother, single, raising two kids. It was common at the time. And how often would you see your dad? I would see my dad at first when they first got separated and 77, 76. I would see my dad for the summers up in Sacramento. Same with me. I would go visit my dad in the summers. Yeah, I would see him up there. And you'd say you'd say for the whole summer pretty much. Yeah, just I did that a couple, couple summers. I would go up there. So I saw my dad and when would you and your sister go there together? No, it was mostly me. My sister would be with my mom doing her thing. So I would go away. I guess it was like boarding school, maybe with my father and I would go on. He was a salesman. So I went on runs all through Sacramento, Marysville, Auburn, Truckee, fell off a horse in Truckee. Very traumatic. I always look when I see the weather, I always look at Truckee, California, because it's always cold there. It's like one of the top cold weather spots. Yeah. So I always have a fond. If you want to look at it that way, even though I fell off a horse, I fell off a big horse. Anyway, I would go to Tahoe, Reno. My father would take me to these these games. I know I'm kind of like, no, God, given you a little bit of a background. And I never, you know, I didn't feel like I was a funny kid. I was just I could tell people like me and my dad would say I use my son as bait to pick up chicks. My dad got a lot of chicks. My dad hooked up and on these runs with you. Probably I think so. Like I had a van, you know, something's going on. You were sleeping. You were sleeping in the van. Well, we would stay in motels or friends' houses, that kind of thing. But my dad was a salesman, so he had a lot of friends. Was he selling? He was selling at the time, mostly ski ski gloves and goggles and jackets. Western wear. He had a he had a company head, hand and foot. That was his company. I think he kept it for forever as he went into another. He went into Western wear. But at the time he was doing, you know, ski gloves, goggles, jackets. So we would go to Lake Tahoe and all through that region to stores. And I guess he would go to stores. And I mean, I mean, it was a legitimate thing. My dad was a salesman. And no, I just mean, like, would he try to go to stores to get them to start selling? I guess, you know, that's what they are. Check up on product, that kind of thing. This is pre-internet, man. This is like what your dad did. I wonder how many people still do that. It seems like I'm sure people do. They go check in on stores, their accounts. They have their, you know, there's there's guys coming in, you know, maybe have a they have stuff with sports authority. They have stuff at Dix. They have stuff at Big Five. And then you got the people got a target account or you got an account in another store. So I mean, I think there is that communication, but I would see my dad do it. And I was around my dad and he never touched me and never got weird. He loved me. He would take me everywhere, minor league baseball. He, I didn't really see his temper. You know, my dad had kind of a temper, you know, later on in life, I learned about that or he would be sensitive about things. But I never really, you know, had that feeling. It was a good childhood with my father. What kind of music would you listen to when you're in the van driving on these trips? He was into Little, Little River Band, Al Demiola, George Benson. You know, some comedy tapes. Sometimes we'd listen to comedy, but he wasn't like, didn't say, hey, listen to this album and that. So, but I think it was mostly, you know, rock, soft rock. He was into. So, and he was a smoker. I think think everyone smoked. Do you like Paul Mauls? I was his big cigarette, but he was a likeable guy. I'll smoke Paul Mauls. Who else? Yeah. No, who? I think Elron Hubbard. Well, my mom had a Dianetics book. I'll tell you that right now. I saw one. Oh, really? Yeah. Did she? Oh, hold on. My mom's had some weird books. Really? Yeah. What's the famous Dianetics Elron Hubbard? The big one. The one with the fire or whatever on it. Yeah. That's the big one. I think it's called Dianetics. Yeah. I caught my mom had, she had that book, you know. Really? No, she never got into Scientology though. I don't know. I'm gonna, I'll, I can ask her. Guaranteed she didn't. I don't, I don't think she did. But why she had the book? She had the book. You wouldn't know if your mom was a Scientologist for sure. All right. Well, okay. So there's a little bit of my background meaning like, okay, maybe I got some from my father that my mom was not particularly funny. She was a worry type person around me. So my sister, kind of funny, but not really, I guess. Not when we played around, we had some fun as a kid. We'd do little games like, hey, let's play Mickey Mouse Club for mom and dad. And we play around with, you know, you know, goof around. Yeah. Nothing weird, kid stuff. Yeah. So fairly normal. And once I moved back to LA, my father was down here, continuing sales, and he would come to my Little League games. He would come over to the house. It was very comforting, comforting for me to see that my mother and father were still friendly around me. And I liked it when my dad came over, even though they were divorced or separated at the time. And my mom was dating. She began dating Jack. Her, she went on to marry Jack and be with him for over 20 years. Wow. She began dating him, I believe in 78, 79. But I just, how old were you when she started dating Jack? Nine, eight or nine. See, this is one to me, one of the weirdest parts of having a divorced mom is when they start dating again. Because I can remember, you know, being in my house in North Carolina and my mom and started dating again. And it's the morning and my mom comes out of the bedroom and with her is this guy who she had humped the night before. And it was in like his, you know, he's got to deal with that. You know, he is dating, you know, he is his girlfriend as kids and it's a weird thing. And he's got to deal with like looking at me and I'm looking at him. And I know he has humped my mom. Like he has been inside my mom the night before. And that's just a weird, I was happy for her, but it was just a weird experience to have to deal with the fact that a new man is clambered on top of your mother and is doing like middle-aged divorced moms. How old were you at that point? I was probably 27. Oh, 27? No, I'm just kidding. I was like nine. So you had those thoughts in your head at nine? No, I don't know. Maybe 11. I don't know. I was okay. I was old enough to know that humping was happening at night. Gotcha. Luckily, I did not see my mother dating different guys. Maybe one or two guys I know she went out with. But what's another thing that's weird to me now is I consider that those guys who are humping my mom are probably younger than me now. Younger than you now. You know what I mean? Like, they're younger than me. These guys that were humping my mom were probably like early 30s. Yeah, they were early 30s. I don't know. How long ago was this? That would make you 39. 39? Yeah. You were nine, they were 30. It doesn't add up. Oh, yeah, you're right. That's kind of right. Am I right? Even I know that. Yeah, that's easy math. I guess you're right. So they're probably 35. No, I think, how old, can I ask, how old your mom is? She died. At what age? She died when she was 68. Okay, 68. I think. And these kids were younger than her? I don't know. 20 years younger? I guess that's a good point, man. 15 years, let's say 15 years younger. I don't want to know the exact age of the man humping on my mom. I don't want to do this math. So 53? I don't want to do this math. Okay, all right, all right. Well, you made it very descriptive. It's my fault. I summoned this demon. I want to put it back into the Pentagon. All right, put it back in. Put it back in. All right. So, no, I was lucky that my mom, I didn't see my mom coming home with different guys. And she was very, you know, kept that world. And I knew she went out. I knew she was a part of groups like Tennis Without Partners. And is that a dating? I think so. That was back in the day. And I knew she did a couple of things like that, but... Partners. She didn't bring it home. If it was happening, it wasn't coming home. And then she began... Now, my dad all the time, I saw him hook. I knew he was hooking up with chicks. Yeah. This guy got it. So... My dad was humping multiple people in the apartment complex he lived at, the Tropicana. And I would always be friends with whatever grubby fellow divorce child was there for the summer. They all live in the big apartments. My dad lived in sunrise apartments on Manzanita or whatever, Greenback Lane. Yeah. Isn't that weird? This was the divorce boom. This is the... Wait, you... This happened to you when? This was 76, 77. Okay, you were in the pre-divorce boom because the real divorce boom happened in the 80s. So your mom getting divorced at that time was even more stigmatized than... I think so, yeah. It was a little weird. Oh, yeah, man. It was stigmatized. Then in the 80s, suddenly it was like everyone just acknowledged the fact that these long-term monogamous relationships weren't working anymore, that the model was falling apart, and that was the divorce boom of the 80s, which gave birth to an entire genre of music. In the 80s, if you listen to that music, you know, that's when you've got like, turn around, ride out, every now and then, I fall apart. Are these like single-mother songs? And I need you more than now. Yeah, those are single-mother songs. Those are single-mom songs, okay. They're divorce songs. And there's like... My mom loved Barbara Streisand. She loved Carol Burnett. She loved Lena Horne. My mom was big into that. So, but yeah, I mean, I was a child of divorce in the 80s too. So I felt that one, and I just... And it's brutal. Listen, here's the thing, man, you can't... Like, we all try to make it normal in our heads. We all try to make it normal. Well, it was normal. It's it... Well, normal to me. Well, it's normal in the sense that it happened. But I think that that initial wound that happens to a kid when your parents get divorced is something that gets deeply, deeply underestimated by people. And then you spend a lot of time covering up that pain and that grief. Because when you're a kid, you don't know how to grieve. I honestly, I mean, I did not feel that grief. I didn't see it. I mean, I heard my father and mom argue a few times in Sacramento. We lived in CME Valley the first three years of my life. I rarely... I mean, not rarely. I don't remember much about that, our neighbors or what have you. Again, 1970, 71, 72, 73 of them. My father felt like, hey, Sacramento, booming town. I can do more business. And he was right, I guess. I mean, enough to where... You know, he was working. So my mom went up. We went up there. Yes. And I didn't hear fighting or anything. I didn't feel anything was weird. I was a little weird. That's kind of where my weirdness started. You know, breaking toys. I remember I would get these. And I know we're kind of just rambling a little bit here, but you're kind of getting to where I'm giving you a pre Brody. This is young Steven, baby Steven. Baby Steven. And some of this can be seen and explained in the HBO Comedy Central, both of them. Of course, Comedy Central version of what I've been doing. Enjoy it. Enjoy it. So I started doing weird stuff up there. Not violent, but I remember I damaged a doll house. There was a doll house, like a big one. Couple houses down the street. And I went in the back and just damaged it. I remember I would get... Wait, you went in someone's backyard. Well, it might have been open. I don't know. So maybe a gate. The gate was open. How old were you? I was probably four, maybe five. So you're five and you toddled into somebody's backyard? I was walking. I was in a toddler. You probably toddled. You're five. You're still new at walking. I'm walking. I'm walking. You toddled in and you vandalized. I by myself. Do you remember doing that? Yeah, I kind of do. It was like a wooden, nice... I broke the windows. I remember I was into breaking windows, breaking stuff. I mean, I didn't trash the whole thing, like these kids do at these mansions. What you read about in the news? But I did damage it and I remember that I got in trouble. Somehow my fingerprints were on the shingles. They fingerprinted the doll? I don't know, but I mean, maybe I admitted it to it. I don't know, but I remember my dad beat me with a stick, like hit me hard in my ass. Your dad spanked you with a stick? Well, he had a stick, yeah. What kind of... Like a birch stick? Like an old... We're talking like... Like a branch? Jesus Christ, Brody, this is like a little house on the prairie shit. Well, my dad ran a tight ship, you know? It's like, you vandalized, you're gonna get... I didn't look at it that way. I mean, I felt like... I mean, I didn't get beat with a stick. I mean, it was a form of spanking. I actually probably got spanked by my dad. Was your dad religious? I think he was spiritual, more than religious. Okay, my dad, I remember, maybe in my life, spanked me a couple times, maybe. The stick, I think I got hit with once, but the stick was around. The stick was the threat. If you want to understand the spread of novelty, originality, fetishes, and a variety of sadomasochism, all you have to do is trace it to the spanking dads of the 80s. They created... This is in the 70s. Or this is 74, 75. Spanking dads are to unique people what Fukushima is to radiation. Once you start spanking your son or your daughter, you are in the process of producing some very, very unique people. That's for sure. Well, because you don't know what, you're a kid. But I'm acting weird anyway. I'm vandalizing. My vandalized before my dad hit me. That's what I'm saying. This being of such power, which is your dad, this Titanic. Your dad is like a Titanic. He was big. He had strong hands. I didn't get my dad's hands. I got my mom's hands. They pick you up when he put you on his lap? No, I just remember I got lashed with it. I'm not making it up. I mean, we're doing maybe some... We're doing some hypnosis here and we're bringing it out. I remember the stick. I remember a swat. That's all I'm saying. And I deserved it. I vandalized a dollhouse. And then there was wet cement on a sidewalk. The sky was working on a sidewalk. And I just walked in it and stomped all over it for just no reason. I did that. I ate foreign objects. I mean, I'm not a normal kid. Something's not right with this kid if you look from afar. I remember I was down the street. I would hang out. Nothing you're saying really seems abnormal for a kid. Kids... Okay. Breaking... Okay. Toys? Here's a toy. Yeah. Here's a Tonka truck. We went to Sears. We went to Montgomery Ward. We just spent X amount of dollars out of our heart, mom and dad, for this Tonka truck, for the holidays or whatever. And I take this truck and I just throw it on the ground. Not out of anger, just because I want to see something smack and break. You wanted to watch something disintegrate. Essentially, yeah. I had a whole graveyard for my G.I. Joe's. I used to take them and throw them up into the air and watch them land. And if they landed the right way, their heads would snap off and then I would bury them in this creepy G.I. Joe graveyard. You know why I was doing that? I was doing that because my fucking parents got divorced and I felt weird inside and also when your parents get divorced, they're going through such intense stress. And so you're in the presence of a being who's trying. You disagree. I mean, look, all this stuff happened before my parents were divorced. This is pre. How long before? Divorce. How long before? Two to three years. Yeah. Well, you know what, man? I mean, you're right in what you're saying. I'm saying like, you are right. I'm saying me specifically. Yes. I feel like the divorce, it really did not. I mean, yes, having a father male figure in your life every day, every night with you, all the way up until say college. We'll say that is, and if your father's on the ball and he's the wisdom and he gets it, you're going to learn from him. Yes. Did I have that? Not necessarily. No, I didn't. I had it not sporadically, a little more than sporadic. Yes. But I had it. I knew it was there and I knew he cared and he loved me. But technically speaking, where you see how divorce can affect people, not having a male figure around on a consistent basis. Ideally, your blood father, but there's plenty of stepfathers and everyone who stepped into those father type roles. Even an older brother, a male energy in my life down in Southern California up until college even. I'm coming home to women. I'm coming home to my mom. And your sister. I'm coming home to my sister. I'm coming home to my grandmother. I'm coming home to my dad who's around. Again, my dad was around. He went to my little games, little league games. He handled baseball. He handled sports. He handled that angle and that was his involvement. It was never, ever to the day he died, never asked me to pay for a meal. I guess that's common, but I knew he didn't have a lot of money. Yes. At least, I mean, he wasn't rich, but he did live beyond his means. But I knew, I just knew he cared when one day we went through that Carl's Jr. drive-thru. And I got a junior Mac. No, I'm kidding. But junior Mac, it doesn't make sense. But I knew he cared. He loved me. And I was weird growing up. I can go in. So that's my father issue up into the point. He passed away. So I'm going to give you- How old were you when he passed away? He passed away at 63. And I was 27 at the time. That's young, man. Yeah, go ahead. That's young. That's young to have to go through that. That's young. I think 27 is a prime time. And here's the deal. I'm keeping it. And I told people this on other podcasts, not necessarily Joe's podcast, Rogan's or even most I'll mention this because when I am going through currently, I'm going through stresses and anxiety. And I get it. Everybody's got it. Everyone's got their personal issues. But not everybody's personal issues are out there for the public to see, whether I decided to do it or agreed to it or not. It's out there, number one. Yes. So I also have family. I have family issues, which we all have. I have a lot on my plate, which is new for me. It's adjustment. I'm not saying it's bad. But for me to not get emotional about talking maybe about my father or talking about my mother's health or the fact that she's aging or the fact that, I mean, those two things or maybe, I mean, those are the main two reasons on this specific podcast. And I know I'm kind of defending myself and I know your crowd is smart enough to accept me. Yes. But I'm just going, I'm asking you, please don't edit this out. OK. But I feel like just to let you know, I'm a little, I'm at like one and a half RPMs because I need to be. It's very difficult for me to talk about my mother without breaking down. And this isn't the Barbara Walters interview. So I'm going to kind of keep it at that. So please understand that that's where I'm at. I got it. OK. Totally respect that. OK. Thank you. Yeah. Well, so you're after all this, at some point, you decided to do stand up comedy. When was that? OK. That was 1994. I never really knew about stand up comedy. I never wanted to be an actor. I never wanted to be a musician. I wanted to be a baseball player. I knew I had a good arm. I was semi successful. I had a lot of people around me telling me I was good. I had decent statistics through high school. I wasn't a star, but I was people knew me. Right. And again, funny to my teammates, funny to certain girls, just maybe a funny guy, but I didn't feel it. And there were jerks. No, I had normal high school. But again, tie in my little mental issues. Let's go back. This guy's breaking things, throwing raw. Normal stuff. Well, you were four. Well, I was four, but I was drinking water out of the gutter. This is what all kids do. I don't think so. I do not think so. I got peed on by a kid. That's not weird. That happens everywhere. I got peed on in the shower at Arizona State. Normal. Go ahead. I don't want to cut that urinate on story. It's one of the worst things that happened to me. We were doing that thing. I was very, I don't remember how old I was. I was young. And you're doing the thing like show, you know, when you're a kid, you're like, you show me yours. I'll show you mine. Yeah. Yeah. I went through that. It was. Thank you. Thank you. It's this kid and his sister, right? So the kids pulled out his cock. I pulled out my cock. The little girl pulls her pants down. It's the first time I'd ever seen a genitals. I was like five, four. Thank you. You're making me feel better. First time I'd ever seen it. And as I'm looking at this strange thing that I'd never seen before, like your brain can't accept it. You don't know what it is. It's like a new, it's like seeing a new somebody else's. Yeah. It's crazy. And as I'm looking at it, suddenly this little fucking kid starts pissing on me. That's weird. And then, and then like I'm screaming. The kids are screaming. The kid is, he's like, pulls his pants up. He's like, they're running. He's like, don't tell my mom. Please don't tell my mom. I don't know. I don't know. I guess he had instant regret. He goes back into his house. And he'll always remember that, by the way. What? He'll always remember that is what he's knowing. He right now, if he's still alive, he knows that he urinated on a kid at that age. I would remember that. Both parties suffer. My mom was in the garden. And I still remember his mom coming up to the fence and saying over the fence, your son is disgusting. But I had just gotten pissed on. You know, like who's son's more disgusting? Like this was a, the whole thing was a mess. But she beat her kids. So it was really bad. With the stick, like my father? No, I think she like did, did like ABC after school special level beatings on them. Did this happen in a vandalized dollhouse? Let me tell you what, you say that, and I'm not going to go into detail here. You mentioned being urinated on. I think that is, it's a weird power move. And I'll tell you this and maybe in future podcast, maybe future years, I will, I had a similar experience. Yes. I'm not going to go into detail and even, even what you had with the, I'll show you, I'll show you mine. Yes. Okay. I had those experiences. Now, those experiences took place after my father wasn't around on a daily basis. Right. So you want to look at divorce and I'm not, there's no blame. I'm not blaming myself even though I do. For the divorce? No, not the divorce for me being in these situations where certain things like that happened because I feel if I had a male figure there nightly, an older brother there daily to say, Hey, Steven, which is my real name, who gives a F? Look at my, look at my cock. You know, look at yours. Let me, let me, let me rub you. Let me, I'm going to rub it on you, but not in a gay, a brotherly way. How does that help? But if you had a, well, whatever, I'm just saying if you had an older brother, I'm saying that you would get that locker room mentality as a kid where you're not as sensitive. So I feel growing up without a male figure on my side. My brother never rubbed his cock on me. All right. I'm okay. Okay. I'm not saying I would want that to happen. I'm saying when I was in Arizona state, guys would do that as a joke. You know what I mean? That's locker room activity. You know, guys get homoeroticism. Exactly. Repressed homosexuality. Guys who desperately want to give a blow job, rub their cock. I've never wanted to do that. I've been accused. Not you, but you know, like some guys are gay and they, they're repressing it. And so then the way it comes out is they do stuff like that. And then they, they transform it into a kind of a joke or it's like athleticism to them. But it's really just like they, they, they're probably more predisposed to be with guys, but they've pushed it away so much because their fathers were too strict and they had a stick. What? Their father said a stick? Yeah, exactly. I'll tell you what. I play baseball at Arizona state, to be honest. I never urinated on anybody and I didn't get off on, I never, I've never done that other than when you said you were a kid and I'll go into that later on in my life. But after that, after I was say seventh grade on, yeah. Seventh grade on any type of abuse, physical or sensual, didn't happen. It stopped there. So seventh grade, it stopped, but even to this day, right now at this very moment, it affects me, whatever, what happened before. Yes. But the more I talk about it, it's the therapeutic, the more I get it out there. Yes. I feel better not only in a selfish way, I feel better. And I know- Why is that selfish? I know it's weird because I analyze. I analyze because sometimes I retweets and people say, it's all about me, I've been on podcasts, it's all about you. But that's all you could do. See, this is the thing. All you can do is work on yourself. You can't change the people around you. You can't change people. You can only change you. That's all you can do. So if people think that selfish, it's ridiculous. And that only shows how twisted our society is. Because sometimes I just went to this meditation retreat and I learned a lot from it. And one of the things I realized is that I have a really hard time loving myself. It's really- There's parts of myself that I can't fully embrace and that I can't love. And that's according to this Ram Dass camp that I hang out with. That's one of the primary spiritual activities is learning to love and embrace yourself. You talk to people about this and say, you've got to learn to love yourself. And the first thing they'll tell you is that's selfish. That's selfish to love yourself. You- Loving yourself is somehow puffed up or egotistical or wrong. I think that's ridiculous. I think that the very first person you encounter in this dimension is you. So that's the first person you should start loving. Okay. Make sense. Love it. No pun intended. My thoughts on me feeling selfish. Again, you're dealing with the mind that I think- I mean, like I said, up to seventh grade. Something happened there. Yes. Okay. I got it. So you're tying that in with, you're tying it in with culture, genetics, chemistry, whatever. Yes. Later on in life, it was more mental and not physical for the most part. Okay. So that issue. When I say selfish, I feel like I'm not the type of guy to go on Twitter, for example, and go, great job, loved you on that. Or, hey, check this guy out. Yes. Or send a card. Send a nice note. Like, thank you. Actually write down a note. Send it. Or actually get somebody a gift. Or- Yeah. Okay. Okay. So hold on. If I may interrupt you for a moment, just to pull you out of this where you're not, maybe you're going to turn it where things you do do. But one thing I remember, I was at the comedy store, I was a little bummed out. I just was feeling kind of like lonely and just sort of like weird. And I remember walking to the parking lot and you pulled up and you like got out of the car and you like gave me a hug. You're like, you look great. And you were just being so, like, you were just being so like kind and like, just everything you were saying completely took me out of feeling kind of gloomy. Like from just, and it was just a few, like, it was like, you know, a minute or two minutes hanging out with you. But the energy was so good that I felt great. And I don't think that a truly selfish person is capable of doing that. I think truly selfish people, people who are, you know, sucking in instead of putting out, that selfishness, people who are pulling in at all times, trying to draw from everything around them some kind of affirmation or just that, that kind of thing. Those people can't generally generate the sense of buoyancy that people like you can. So I don't, I don't really consider you selfish. Okay. Well, thank you. You know, in that sense, again, I feel like I'm tangibly selfish. You know, I not good with Christmas gifts. I'm not, I'm not good. If you're registered, you get married. Well, you, here's the thing, people, this whole selfishness thing. It's like number one, you are a self. So saying you're selfish is a lot like water saying, I'm wet. It's like water saying, Oh God, I feel terrible because I'm wet. Everything I touch is gets water on it. Well, you're water and that's what you do. And human beings are a self and in everything that you see. Well, but I like it when I receive a card. I like it when I get a gift. I like it when I get a nice tweet or maybe somebody pulls me a, not pulls me aside, but says, Hey, I like your, I like your work or you're a good guy. So I feel I do that. I'm very like you explained. I, and I'm not, and I'm not saying I want people to see this like, Hey, look, get the cameras on me hugging Duncan and saying that good. Let's get the cameras on me giving this comedian some advice. I don't, I know that's a, that's something I'm providing and it's putting out positive energy. I know you feel good about it. I enjoy talking. I enjoy expressing that when I'm in a comfortable situation, but that's comedy. Now you go into family life and they can't take it. You go into a professional, you know, we talk about a comedy. We're talking comedy store, right? I'm in my element. It's like I'm on the baseball field. I'm in the locker room. I don't have my sister. I don't have my mom. I don't have outsiders. Again, that's a reality. You're going to have to deal with that. But that one moment we had comfortable setting, not unlike where we are today or again at the club, it's like, yeah, I'm real. I'm putting it out there. I feel good about that. And also in terms of energy, again, I talked about not watching TV shows, not watching because I like it. But then I also go, Hey, I did 2,500 audience warm-ups. I put all my energy out in a real positive, honest way to make those shows. And maybe for selfish reasons, I don't want to go back to that. But I can learn early on why I'm a certain way with my warm-up early on. Yes, early on roots. But I give out a lot of energy on these shows. And I feel like you give out a lot of energy all the time. Well, I really did it on these shows. Chelsea or Best Damn Sports show specifically, and now hopefully a little more on the Midnight Show with Chris Hardwick. And I get a kick out of that. I know the comedians appreciate it. I appreciate it. And that's it. But on top of it, I mean, you got to recharge. I'm not like that all the time. You know, I say, I go to Starbucks and I'm not like, yes, you got it. Push, believe, venti, F no. You know, I don't think people are expecting me to do that. But so that's my idea. And I think that does make me feel good. And I think many people, philanthropists and great men and women over the years say, it's OK to be selfish. It's OK to give. It's all right to feel good to volunteer. But that's well, not the best. I think the service. But I don't honestly, I said the ball. Go ahead. Go ahead, Duncan. The best service you don't you were going to say you don't volunteer. Honest. Here's the deal. I if you watch if you watch one of my shows coming up on Comedy Central. Yes. Brodie Stevens in joy yet. Yes. Sunday nights. It says midnight. Sometimes it's on earlier if you have direct TV, whatever. I actually go volunteer, you know, I go down to downtown and I help out and. And it was real. It was a funny thing that people do, I think, and it's something I'm just learning. So people want to volunteer. People want to, you know, there's an instinct in people where I want to, you know, give service to people. So what ends up happening is people getting their head like, OK, one day I'm going to sign up, go work at a soup kitchen. I'll go down to the laugh factory and dish out gravy for Thanksgiving or I'll do some kind of little act of kindness to people I don't know. And a lot of times in the process of doing that, people completely neglect and disregard the people around them. So in other words, you've broken humanity up into like the homeless and the needy and the poor and the hungry and all this stuff and you only are doing service when you're like doing some kind of organized intentional trip down to some impoverished area and you're giving out soup and food. Well, I think that's ridiculous. You can render service to everyone that you come in contact with just by being open to them and giving them your attention and also by loving yourself and showing people that you could fully be yourself without having to get destroyed or crushed by the universe. And that's a very, very difficult thing for people to accept. Yeah, my phone's ringing, but whatever. OK. And I take LeMick doll. I've mentioned that before. It's a mood stabilizer. Sometimes I have to go back and say, you know, repeat. You were talking about I'm saying that you think that you're selfish when in fact the very act of being a very positive person who is very who's open. OK. You're open about your mental breakdown, which you were and in which you are on podcasts. We are hoping about that and you fully allow people into your lives. What it does is it creates a catharsis for people who listen to you and they don't want to talk about the time that weird thing happened to them when they were in junior high school. They don't want to talk about having a father who dies or they don't want to go into those places because they feel like somehow talking about it or or feeling feeling compassion for themselves about it is somehow wrong or bad. And every time you do that, you free people up a little bit because here's the truth, man. Everybody on planet Earth has suffered. They've suffered even if they seem like they have wonderful lives and even a great family and all this stuff. No matter what, if you get pushed out into this dimension, you are going to suffer. You're going to hurt. You're going to get rejected. You're not going to get what you want. You're going to feel lonely. You're going to feel sad. And until you learn to really embrace that and until you really learn that it's okay to feel those things, if you're always just going to be running away from yourself and the fact that you're somebody who kind of fearlessly just talks about that stuff, I think that's a service. And I think that's a service that is just as good, if not better, than giving some turkey sandwiches to people once a year. Thank you. And I agree, I agree with you 100%. No, I'm not into volunteering. And you'll see it on the episode. I'm glad I did it. It wasn't like I had a bad attitude. I actually enjoyed doing it and it did feel, felt right. I feel, you know, but in the show, I'm going to have a sip of water here. Go ahead. I'll have one too. You know, in the show, Zach actually recommends me to volunteer. Yes. For real, serious. And he feels like that will, he is always looking out for my personal health. Zach Alephanakis. Yes. He could actually, and I think he does, could care less about my professional career. As long as I'm happy. He's your friend. He's my friend. So I guess happy for me, if you wanted to say happy, I guess would be a couple bucks so I could survive and allow myself to be myself. Okay. So Zach wants me to be happy. And part of that happiness of him searching for it, he feels like, hey, you know what, maybe if you volunteer, it'll take your mind off you or whatever. Yes. Might make you happy. So we're happier. Appreciative. Yes. So I go down there and I'm not into it. I'm not, I, I, I, I, that's not me. I've done the laugh factory on Thanksgiving or Christmas where you feed the homeless and you do it. It's all right. So it's, it's like, look, my, my, my giveness is when I say this, I can look at it two ways. I can actually look at the audience warm up. I've done 2,500. I've had a crowd, essentially 80 to 150 people right there in my face. For years, different groups, successful groups, football teams, military rehab groups, Christian groups, you know, second chance groups, all that stuff. So I talk to them again, I'm doing my job. We've got to bring energy and clapping, but I do connect and I listen and I do, you know, I don't try to preach, but I give them advice sitting up, looking good. I'm saying, Hey, I'm doing audience warm up. I'm from Recita. I drove at Pinto. I come from a divorced family. You know, I say that kind of stuff and I go, I'm making it. Now I'm not saying you're going to make it, whatever making it is, but you put out the energy and see where that takes you and you, and you go for it. And some, you know what? Honestly, some people aren't wired to go that way. Some people won't go that way, but maybe there's five people in that audience who go, yeah, I'm going to try and do it and go for it. So and even now people listening to this, you know, there's somebody out there guaranteed who had some kind of mental breakdown, maybe got hospitalized. They're at the tail end of being hospitalized. They, they're out of the hospital now. They're dealing with what it's like to be stigmatized for having a mental breakdown. Perhaps they think that they'll never reintegrate back into society. And to hear somebody who went through that publicly and then is, you know, actually reintegrating in this really beautiful way. That is an, that's, that's got to feel great. Feels great for me, man. I mean, I love it because it's this idea. It's this idea that no matter what happens to you, if you just let go and trust the universe is going to pull you back out of it and you're in and heal you. That is beautiful. I love that, man. I think it's an incredible, incredible, it's an incredible thing to like, to know has happened. Oh, I, again, a wonderful statement and I agree with you wholeheartedly. It's like coughing and I get, my throat's kind of bothering me today. We'll edit the coughs out. Hey, you made that statement about, you know, what the statement was about. The statement is about, we got to stop as human beings. It doesn't mean don't. You got to trust. You got to trust, but also not just that. It's like everybody wants to have like, okay, so everybody wants to create a situation where in this, right now I'm doing something good, right? So that's usually when it happens a few times a year. You go and you dish soup out somewhere and it's like, okay, I'm doing something good. Or maybe on Sunday you go to church and like, okay, now I'm doing something good or whatever it is. There's always these moments where it's like, okay, this is good. So you've got all the good moments. And now if you look at your life as a pie chart, you got this little slice of the pie and that's where I'm good. And then you have every other thing and the other slice of the pie. It may be you're like, that's where I'm selfish or that's where I'm not doing good. And that's where I'm fixated on myself too much and all that. But the reality of the situation is that you are a person. So being selfish is actually when you're serving yourself, you're serving a person. And just taking that mental step of being like, all right, well, I'm going to start being compassionate to myself. I'm going to allow myself to accept the fact that I went through it. A really hellish moment for a year and a half of hell. All right, good. I like how you said that being selfish for yourself is okay. Going on tagging that, I do say to myself, the best when I'm better, when I'm happy, when I'm me, when I don't have stress and I don't have judgment, we all win. It's a win-win. Yes. I'm better suited. I remember when I was working at Macy's in, this is after college, I was taking a comedy class at UCLA. I was taking a, working on a film, USC, so I was at USC film school, not in it, but helping out with lights and all that technical stuff. And I also worked on another film before just to see if I liked holding a, being around it. And I didn't. I hated lights. I hated tape. It's not me. Right. And so I started, okay, so I did that. I'm getting a little off track here. It's okay. No, you're not. Okay. So me being me, the best me being me, everybody wins. I remember working at Macy's, Bingo, working there. And I was selling China. I was actually up on the fifth floor. This was during, after college, during the holidays. So I had to wear a suit, kind of spin in my wheels. I took a comedy class. I think I may be into it. I'm feeling it, but I got to work. It's $7.75 an hour, but it's a place to go every day as opposed to doing a sales job where it's okay. So I had to place less money, but consistent structure. So I did that. And I remember I was working there and one girl put in my head, one lady, and she goes, she would come in a couple of times. She goes, you're so good at this. You're my knight in shining armor. She says, you should be a waiter. You make more money. You got a good personality. So she put that in my head like, I can make more money being a waiter. Yes. So the Northridge earthquake happened in 1994 or in January. And I had been taking, this is also a callback to what you were saying earlier. I had been taking a comedy class and I knew, I think that's what I could feel it. That's where I was drawn to that. I was told I was funny from teammates growing up in school. I could tell like girls and teammates laughed at me, but I wasn't the class clown. Teachers always liked me, that sort of stuff. But I didn't have that confidence. I wanted to be a baseball player. And I felt like, and I wasn't graceful, but I had a good arm and it's part of that's being picked on and not having that older brother to say, hey, it's okay. Don't worry about them. Screw them or my father around. My dad didn't even know. He didn't care. And a lot of this is in my head, but it was in my head. So I know me being me is the best thing I can be. So yes, I go to Seattle and that's where I start performing. That's the callback. The original question due to my mood stabilizer and my lmictal was selfishness, the best me. Yeah. The question was, what we were talking about in a very circuitous way was what ended up with you being on stage. And were you always on like, were you always confident in the way that you are now when you started doing stand up? Like you must have started off as in a different form doing maybe more traditional stand up. Or because when I see you do stand up, it's it's it's its own unique thing. It's completely unique. It's just your energy. I've seen you walk through the crowd. You drum on the stool. You do these things that I would never think of to do as a comic and it works. Okay. Yeah. I got there. There isn't a secret. I don't have a secret how I got there. Again, childhood, baseball. I was around winners. I mean, I wasn't completely around females. I was playing little league baseball. I had coaches. My dad was there. So there was some male influence on me. Then when I went to college, I still had that. So I had that structure. I had that even though I was sensitive and picked on and not confident, I still had that structure and that sense of accomplishment that I went to college that I made this move up to Seattle. And that's where I just started. I said, I'm going to put my same energy that I put into school because I just wanted to graduate. Same energy that I put into baseball. I just wanted to be on the team and see how far I can go and maybe play professionally. That's everyone's goal. Yes. So I did those things. And then when I had the entertainment bug, I followed it. I just followed my instinct. And my instinct was to see how films are made and then go, you know what? I'm not that grip guy. And then I did the comedy class to back it up to see if it was in my heart. And it was. I would drive to UCLA every, it's funny, UCLA. I would drive to UCLA every Wednesday to do a two minute, three minute set in front of other students and Pauly Shore's sister was the teacher. Sandy Shore. Exactly. Sandy Seashore. I didn't know. I just, I needed structure and that was good for me because I had that in baseball. I had that in college and I did that and I knew right there. Okay. I feel it. I get it. And I did one open mic in Los Angeles and I go, you know what? There's desperation around here. This is not where I want to be. And I always want to go to New York, but I wasn't ready for it. And I had the bug for comedy, but I said, I'm not going to start here in LA. And I said, I want to learn more about comedy while I'm here. And I took a business of comedy class at UCLA and learned all about the business. And Danny Robinson, who's an agent. APA. APA taught the class and he just, I mean, this is 1994. Things have changed. But back then it was like, you learn everything about the clubs, how it is, contracts. And his advice to me, because I wanted to be a comedian, there was other guys who were like sniffing it out. And he said, you know what? If you want to, you know, do comedy, get out of LA. Right. You got to get out. And I was spinning my wheels at that point. It's so big, no support system. But I remember I would drive by the comedy store every night after class and just look at it and feel that energy. Think about that. UCLA, Danny Robinson, business of comedy classes. You're driving down Sunset Boulevard. 1993, maybe 94. Some inkling, perhaps. Some inkling, some sense that maybe you could be a comic and you're driving down the exact same street where now there's a full size billboard with your face on it. That is nuts, man. I think that is so cool because you just, you know, people get so down in the dumps. And if you get stuck in the idea that where you are is where you're going to stay. Then you really can get frozen up just because things are, you know, in this situation, man, you were just being courageous. Like, look, I get it now. I understand about you. Like you're never going to, it seems like you will eventually, but you have a hard time really embracing how awesome you are. You don't want that for some reason or you don't, and that's why you keep saying you wanted a father figure or a big brother because you needed somebody who you could trust to tell you you're fucking awesome, you're wonderful, and give you that confidence because you have a hard time giving it to yourself for some reason, which is why I'm saying it because you deserve it, man. I mean, that is courage to like end up just taking a comedy class, takes balls. That takes so much courage to do something like that. A lot of people, if they told people they were doing that, they would seem like lunatics. But then to like take a business of comedy class and say, okay, I'm going to take a business of comedy class and then to relocate to do comedy. Well, I was lucky to have family in Seattle, and yeah, I was lucky. I mean, I had it, again, I'm not going to give me a sob story, so we'll keep it positive here. But I was lucky that I didn't have the stressors. My mom did the best job she could to make my life easy, almost too easy. And that's a Jewish mother for you. And that kind of, she did her best. My dad did his best. I think my mom worried a lot, and it caused me to worry, and it caused me to overthink, and it kind of got in my head. As I've gotten older, I appreciate it, and I never felt neglected. I felt overly unneglected, and that was like I knew back then. Let me swim a little bit. My dad gave me a little more freedom. But I was still always scared of him, like wouldn't curse in front of him, wouldn't totally be myself, wouldn't let my father know I was a sexual being attracted to women. The fact of my father and my mother seeing young Steven be with a girl, going to prom, having a crush on a girl, I think my mom still thinks I'm a virgin. My dad died thinking maybe I was gay. But I wasn't, 10%. My mom, I think, has given into the fact that I've been sexual with a woman. So you have a, wait, given into the fact of, why does she have to give into the fact? I'm saying that, no, perfect. But, well, yeah, I'm sure if you asked her today, Jackie, do you think Steven's a virgin? She would go, I hope not. That would be her answer. So in her head, she's thinking that, all right? I come, and again, this is not a blame at all on my parents. I'm lucky they met because I got my dad's bipolar-ness, if you want to call it that, because I'm similar to him. I've show signs. Well, that's the thing. Now, look where you're at. I mean, that's a funny thing. It's like every, legit, look, it's not, this isn't a blame game. It's just like the main thing is just, you have to don't resist the fact that you went through it. Nobody wants to admit how hard things were for them. And they think that by admitting that, they're being victims or whiny or whatever. It's like, no, once you get to a nice place, or even if you're not at a nice place, just know that, just you have to respect the past. All right, here's the deal on that. I can see where you're going. You want to move forward and be positive. And you're saying, accept the past, everyone's got their- And honestly appraise what happened. Because this is in occultism and in Buddhism. And there's two similar activities, which you can do. And this is called get fertilizing the field. And so what that is is, and modern psychotherapy is a version of this, but what it is is you look with non-judgment and full honesty at yourself. You look at everything and you see everything. You see everything. And that being that will come forward after months or years or meditation, or maybe using a psychedelic, that being that you'll begin to see, you won't like. It's painful, man. The new? No, the ego structure. What was there? This self, the self, the human self, that so many people don't like themselves. They don't like themselves. And you know how you can really tell somebody truly doesn't like themselves? Is they have a lot of people they hate. When you get around a person who's like, oh, this person sucks and I don't like this person, this person's horrible. And you see what that person did? No, look at this tweet this person did. Those are the people who hate themselves the most. Because they're so separated from who they really are that they've projected it under the screens of all the people around them and they're constantly haunted by assholes. Because really the asshole is inside of them. And that's one of the beautiful things about starting to really look at yourself and fully embrace yourself and love yourself is every time you love a piece of yourself that you are in denial about, that piece vanishes from the external world. That part of yourself that you didn't like or that thing you feel bad about, the moment you start loving that, that kind of asshole disappears from your life almost instantly. Because the asshole is never there. You don't know what a person's like. You can't imagine what a person's like. It's impossible to know what anyone else is like except for you. Because you're just making assessments based on a person's actions around you for like, you know, it's certain moments. So anyway, that's what I'm getting at. What I'm getting at is really look at your path. If you have the courage to do it, look at who you are and accept the fact that you have suffered and have compassion for that being. That's the idea. It's fun, man. It's a beautiful, painful exercise, but it's awesome. I thank you again. I've always agreed with what you said. And maybe I'm different on these podcasts. I mean, I can see that in my head right now, where I'm at on this very podcast, if you want to break it down, I'm thinking of, and you can see it, maybe I'm defending. I'm just kind of clearing it up, making my story specific. We all have specific stories. Everyone's got those stories. But I feel like I can give my specific story. And then I know I get the tweets. I get the emails based on a lot of different stuff, you know, podcasting and that, on how I've helped people. And it feels good. I didn't intend to do that. I accept it. I'm fine with it. I appreciate it. And I know it's happening. And I understand like there are actually professional parameters. The more you, I mean, that's a great thing about podcasting. You can just talk and go. But I also am aware that there's formats to follow. And I'm constantly adjusting. And I'm just in the moment, whether I like to be or not. But I can be professional. I can do a scene from a fake sitcom or play a character or whatever and be in that moment. It's hard for me to not keep it tight when I'm opening up about myself. And again, making excuses. But I think Duncan comes back and cleans it up and puts a bow on it for this particular, you know, this situation we're happening. So let's move on from the past and talk about the future. Yes. I do feel better. I do feel that the more I talk about these things, it feels good. It allows me also professionally, if you want to talk about that. It relieves stress. When did you start feeling after the last time you did the podcast? You can ask me questions. Yeah. The last time you did the podcast, you're in a very dark place. Yeah. And at what point after that did you start feeling better? Okay. When I had my episode, my breakdown, I think, and again, it was due to stopping my meds cold turkey. It was being on an antibiotic. It was having pressure. It was travel. Whatever happened, it happened. It was a manic episode triggered by something, the various issues. Yes. It did happen. And I do feel I have bipolar. I saw Sanjay Gupta, CNN special, talking to a 16-year-old, unidentified. And he kind of was describing me, kind of like how I am, how I was. And it was funny. Like his sister, her name was actually Stephanie, not like my sister. I don't really hear voices. I hear my own voice. We all hear voices. But nobody's talking to me and saying, Brody, walk into the ball, do this. There's none of that. I'm not at that point. But I think I do have, I've come to grips that I think I do have bipolarism. But it's not the violent kind. It's not pick up a machete and flip out in the grocery store. It's not that. I did go through that. I mean, I guess that guy is there. I don't think to the point where I'm stabbing people. But it might be to the point where I'm on a bender. Everybody's got that girl inside of them. Everybody. I don't know. I don't think so. It's called the shadow. Oh, it is? Oh, yeah. It's called the shadow. Everybody has a shadow. Everybody has a side that's like this dark, malicious, malevolent, cruel, awful thing. We all have. But I had, and I had 40 years of that built up in me. Yeah. And a lot of it had to do with professional frustrations, professional people being not nice over the years to me. Yeah, you weren't getting as much respect as you probably deserve. I wasn't getting the respect. I was wound up, I'm just describing this episode I had. And it was, yeah, it was crazy. And I ended up in the hospital. And while I was doing my episode, yeah, I was like in another world. It was like that game I was playing earlier. I was in a different world going in and out and knowing something was up. But is this confident? Is this the new Brody? Because, I mean, I was told to celebrate. I was told to enjoy. Take a victory lap. And I knew that I had an HBO show opportunity. I really don't have to think about warm-up anymore. I was doing festivals. I was getting cool emails. I was doing all that. You had to pay the piper, Stevens. That's the thing, man. Everybody tries to avoid that shadow. You try to shut yourself off to it. You try to lock the demon underneath the castle. But if you really want success, I think you've got to deal with it. One way or another, you've got to pay the piper. And that means having a breakdown. And what is a breakdown? A breakdown is not like a breakdown of your true self. It's just that when the mask you've been wearing for so long finally cracks off because you've outgrown it. But I did have a breakdown? You did. But it didn't, I mean, it revealed like an angry side. Yes. It revealed also a funny guy, a guy being energy. Yes. I mean, I was manic. I had energy like when I'm doing warm-up. I'm being, people think I'm funny when I put out energy. You are funny. So probably no matter what you do is going to be funny, including a nervous breakdown. Well, yeah. And I guess I took that energy of performing. It was like, OK, I'm on stage and I did it on Twitter. And I was filming it and getting kicked out of Starbucks. It's a reality show. I got things happening and tied in with all this stuff. All right. So that happens. And I'm in the hospital and it's a shock. I don't belong here. I mean, I felt like, OK, I'll be here for 72 days. I mean, 72 hours. Right. And how long were you in there? 17 days. 17 days. You were there for two weeks in a mental hospital. Yeah. And I fought it for the first three days, four days. It was like, why am I here? I went off my meds. I made a mistake. I'm not crazy. And I would get treated just like a number, another patient. And it bothered me. And it kind of just added more to my, you know, a little bit of my anger, my mania. Like, it's a mistake. But then they started, you know, giving me different medications to kind of chill me out, stabilize me. And I actually started after three or four days of arguing with male nurses, arguing with staff. I had to get moved around. I was in a regular, you know, this is where people are. And there's some like crazy people in my ward who I didn't feel completely safe around. One guy's name was, I think his name was Phoenix or, he was, one of my friends knows who visited me. The guy was kind of, might have been Montana. Whatever his name was, he was intense and nuts. You can tell there was like nutty people in here and I'm not that guy. So I kind of was fighting that and they go, you got to get out of here. We're going to put you in intensive care. So they put me in another room, another wing and the guy was like, or the Filipino guy, I remember, the male nurse and they had some big Arab guy, I believe, Persian maybe, Persian. And they were being mean to me. I was like, I go, why am I here? Why am I, I'm getting treated like crap. Just like, be nice to me. Yeah. And they go, settle down. We, you need to take your meds. I go, I've been taking them. And he goes, well, you need to take, you need to write. And I go, I go, can you stop yelling at me? I mean, stop being mean to me. We're not being mean to you. If you don't be quiet, we're going to give you a shot. You want to stay like yelling at me? Jesus. Yes. And he go, what, are you not like Jewish people? Is that what it is? Wow. So they put me in that thing and I was there for like two days, three days. And I wrote a note. I complained. I felt like I was being treated unjust and I made a complaint, a league, a technical complaint that this, this nurse and this guy were aggressive towards me, threatening me. I felt anti-semitic vibes and I'm making a complaint. Yes. You know, I was still in, I was still manicky. Yes. And they're putting me on meds. I'm taking Saracwil and Depakote. These are heavy drugs. These are the drugs. You were still on that when you did the podcast the last time, I think. I was for the, yeah, I think I was. So they put you on these heavy meds. And then after three days, because these people are, again, crazy, crazy people in there, you know, girls, some weird kids. And I was being very friendly because I, again, still met manic, but stay into myself, not doing activities. So they felt like I don't belong here. And then after three days, they put me into the addiction wing, which was next over. And that was more chill. Why addiction? They thought it'd just be a better situation for me because it was just calmer and it was like girls in there who were addicted to pills or, you know, there's some cutters, I guess, but it was more mellow, it was better. Now I'm six days in, I'm stable. You know, there's a schedule of food and their structure. And I start getting consistent guests visiting me. I had guests visit me the first couple of days. And I was like, still in that manic phase. And that's why I was saying like, you know, even before the visitors, that's where I got the tweet out because I was able to use the public phone. And I knew I could call the comedy store and give somebody that I trust because I was tweeting like a maniac, which I was. And I felt like, Hey, I got a public phone here. I call the comedy store. Get, I got Benji's number, Benji of follow. Yes. And I said, Benji, I'm going to give you my password. I need you to tweet this out because I'd been tweeting everything up to that point. Like, Hey, the cops are here. I'm gone or even right before that. Right. Not the cops. So you're like smuggling tweets out of a mental hospital. Yeah. Because I was still first time. I bet that's the first time in human history that anyone has smuggled a tweet. Yeah. You have to give up your password. You have to know the, I mean, they had cell phones, but they also had a pay phone and pay phone, you receive calls, cell phone, you can call out and sometimes receive it. So I was able to do that. And then I had a couple of visitors come in and they snuck in phones. And I said, effort, I'm here. I feel like I'm here unjustly almost sneak in a photo. This is a one, this is a one time shot. Right. You know, and I remember one time I had, I had the phone or somebody brought in, I don't think somebody brought in my phone, but they had their phone. Yeah. And I had it like right under my, my lap under my bed and the doctor, a nurse, a male nurse guy came in. Nice guys. Like they started to be nicer to me, but do you have a phone in here? Are you, I go, no, have you been taking pictures or anything? I think they got wind that I was tweeting. Yeah. And I go, no, and I had the phone right there under, I mean, he could have like pulled the blankets up and go, you're, you know, you're going to isolation. I don't know. So I got the tweets out and then that stopped and it was just like, hey, I'm going to, I'm going to like just chill. They're giving me my meds. I'll watch TV. My friends are visiting me and I figure, okay, I'll be out in five or six days. Everything's settled. And then I would meet with the doctor. They do these reviews and he just didn't trust me. He didn't feel like I, I was going to be able to be in society and not go to a Starbucks and get kicked out. I said to him, I go, doctor, doctor said, Jay, great guy, not putting them under the bus. I said to him, I promise you, I won't go to Starbucks and get kicked out. And then they, you go back to your room or whatever and they, there's a case worker there and they talk about it and they'll come back to you. And he goes, uh, I, doctor said, Jay, doesn't feel comfortable with releasing you yet. You're going to have to stay around. So that means you're a prisoner. Well, yeah, no internet. No, if you wanted to leave, let's say that you just wanted to leave. I don't think I could. I mean, it wasn't, no, involuntarily. You were being involuntarily held. So you were in this classic position that you see in movies where somebody ends up in an insane asylum and you're telling the doctor, no, I'm not crazy. I could go out and he's like, you're actually, you can't go out. And maybe he was right, Brody. Maybe he did the right thing. It seems like you may have, you probably needed that little space to, to, to, uh, heal a little bit from, from, um, yeah, my body went through a lot. I, I, I, I mean, this is something people, people, this is what's weird about, I think one of the really weird things in Western society and in the world is that you break a bone, like let's say that you just been in a motorcycle accident and you'd snapped your collar bone or something. If you were in the hospital, then it's, it totally makes sense. It's like, it's, it, people understand that. But if you went up with a, if you have a mental breakdown and your psyche cracks a little bit, people don't understand that it's exactly like a bone breaking. Same thing. It's just the same thing. It's just a different organ, you know, which is the organ of the mind. And I think you needed that space. I mean, I hear that. Exactly. You know, it's like you break a, you break a bone, you put on a cast. Regardless, it happened. Yeah. It happened. And then when you got out. Well, I'll tell you what, when I, well, when the doctor said that, that upset me again. And I went on a one day food strike, wouldn't eat. And then I was just kind of like after that, I go, I just accepted it. I go, you know what, I'm drying out. It's like rehab. I'm actually, I feel like these meds they had me on were the right meds. Yeah. I, I didn't feel, you know, I was on a schedule. I up at seven, bed by 11, you know, feeding boom. I'm not doing the arts and crafts. It didn't make me, I'd read the newspaper, watch the news. They really have arts and crafts. Yeah. That sort of stuff, you know. Yeah. That art, you stay at the table or you talk about things. But I, I would talk to those girls. I can passing. I go, and they knew me from like being on Chelsea lately and. Wow. And I would say that, come on, I don't need to be here. And they go, that is a weird thing to end up when you end up in a mental psychiatric ward in Los Angeles, you're probably going to be around celebrities. There's probably an 80% chance that if you get committed in LA, you're going to recognize someone there from Chelsea lately. Right. I, I, I don't think there were any celebrities when I was there, but I know Lindsay Lohan was there at one point, Amanda Bynes after me and some different people. So, but you know what? It was clean. The showers were good. I kind of liked it in a sense that it was rehab. I'm off Twitter. I'm not taking cell phone calls. This is the thing, man. This is something that Ram Dass said in one of his lectures, which I love, which is that in society, it sucks that you, we need places where you can go and have a mental breakdown. Like it should be something that instead of being looked at as like a stigmatized thing, it should be looked at as like a necessary part of human growth or personal evolution. I mean, I was what, 40, 41 at the time. I'd never gone on a vacation. I really have not gone away to Hawaii for two weeks and just, I mean, I've had fun. I had, you're dry. No man, you, you were really hard on yourself. You've draw, you were driving for probably 40 years. You were just like, you know, like in the movies, when the cowboy rides the horse too long, you know, and then just like froths at the mouth and falls over. That's what you were doing to yourself. You needed that. And that thing that you were resisting, you're probably spending a lot of time pushing that shadow thing down. The shadow thing finally got out. Your ego couldn't hold it back anymore. Hulk explodes out of the government laboratory, which is Brody Stevens mind. Rampages through Hollywood for a while, gets taken into a mental asylum. And then the end result now, and I'm, I'm moving forward because we've been on, we, it's an hour and a half. And I want to go a little more. Yes, we can. But I want to, I want to, the thing I don't want to partner. Yeah, maybe, but I don't, this is what I don't want to miss. I don't want to miss the, the process after, after this, after the psychiatric ward, I want to talk about the period that happened after my podcast, because when you were on my podcast, can we, can we talk about what happened after the podcast? Sure, sure. When we smoked weed. Okay, yeah. Remember? I do. So we smoked marijuana and you like started having a little bit of a breakdown again, and your psychologist had to come over to my house and had to sit in my office with you and like have a therapy session with you. So you were in a, you were in a, you were still in a very dark place there. And I want to, I want to hear about the, when you, when you started feeling, when you started feeling okay again, or when you felt yourself really coming back. Um, let's look at my phone while you did that. No, I'm kidding. Thank you. We can edit that part out, right? Okay. Edit what part out? When I just said, I was looking at my phone and it's not thing. Okay. That's not edible. Okay. We can edit it. I'll edit that out. But if you know, I trust you, I trust you. He's going to write it down. You don't have to edit it out. Come on. You know what you're doing. I trust you like, I trust you like the editors on my, on my TV. People that nobody, listen, look, nobody, nobody cares about those kinds of things. Good. Thank you for, and I trust you and I believe you and I feel you. So you, tell me about when you, tell me about when you started feeling, feeling yourself coming back. All right. I'll get, I'm going to give you the condensed version here from me, hospital to wherever. Okay. Okay. You're in the hospital and they basically say, Hey, you're on bipolar. You're, you're, you're bipolar. And the med you were taking, Lexa pro probably helped trigger that. That was a part of one of the triggers. Now we've got you on these meds that will number one stabilize you. And the doctor told me, he said, hopefully within a year, you'll be off meds. That's what I heard. So I always had that in the back of my mind that I, these were not going to be a permanent part of my life. And this was, that conversation happened maybe one or two weeks once I was out. Okay. So I get out of the hospital and I'm on the highest dosage possible that you could have for Sarac will, which is a, uh, it's a anti psychotic. It's a sleep pill. It's street, there's street value on it. People take it to fall to sleep 20, 50, 75. I was on 800 the most. Wow. Then they have depacote, which is like lithium, but less side effects, more, um, I don't know about less, but more updated version of that. I was on 1500 milligrams. That's, that's the highest dose. I was on 800 milligrams of Sarac will 1500 milligrams of depacote. I could drive. I was sleeping 14 hours. My lay, I felt like my body was cement. Oh, some people like that. It was hard to wake up. I was okay. And I, I, I didn't want to exercise at this point. Nevermind me coming back home and having to move. I got, I didn't get evicted from my apartment, but I was asked to leave after what happened. So I had to move once I was out of the hospital. I'm on these meds. Yes. These two beds. Oh God. And I had to move. And I had help. Zach helped me. Oh God. That is so crazy, man. That is so intense. Oh, where, wait, where did you move to? Well, I was a bit, that was a big mistake. I, you know, I had to move. I didn't get evicted, but she goes, you have, you have to go after what happened. All the police coming and all this, this craziness. So we move the stuff into storage. And at that point I start staying with a couple of friends. I actually, I went, stayed with my mom for like five days in the desert. Then I drove out to Arizona and I spent eight days out there. And at that point I was on those meds sleeping a lot, but once I get up, I was okay. And I was chill, mellow, not a zombie, but very chill, very mellow. I think the first week I did try to smoke pot on these, at that dosage of medication, and it really made me paranoid and scary. I had like a panic attack, like I was having a heart attack. Honestly, I'm going to be honest with you. The first night I got out of the hospital, I was home, left alone. And I did have a friend come over later. I, you know, the first night I was alone. Wow. And I, I was alone. I, I, I smoked pot because I hadn't smoked for, say, you know, 17, 18 days, 17 days. I take a hit and I, my heart started racing. I felt, I, I, I, I, I don't want to freak people out, but I felt like hurting myself, like keep, keep a firearm away from me. You felt like killing yourself. Not killing myself, but I felt like I could. Well, I mean, you are lonely. Think about it. 17 days in a mental hospital. 17 days, 17 days, almost a, more than half a month. But I got visited. I, I, I, my friends came by. It's just, you, you, being alone that first night, that's, that's. Well, that was, and there's nobody to blame. There's nobody to blame. And somebody does claim that they did spend time with me. I just know that moment. Nobody was there. Yes. I had time. I said, I'm going to smoke pot and it was the first time and it freaked me out. And my heart was racing and I flashed back to all those tweets that I made. I had time to look at them. I couldn't believe what I said. I deleted, there's one about a gun. That's the one that got everything going when you mentioned gun, even though I didn't have one and I never thought of using one. But when I came back on these meds and I also smoked pot, it kind of triggered scariness and things going through my head. Don't, don't touch a gun. Don't, it was like a gun thing almost. Yes. Not to hurt people, but to hurt me. Yeah. And I said, you know what? I can't smoke pot. I knew right then and there, no pot. So once that died down, I mean, it was freaking scary. My heart was beating. It was a whatever. I thought it was going to have a heart attack and heart disease runs in my family. And that's one reason why I don't want stress. It's in my family. You know, so part of the show, luckily, and part of me talking about all this relieve stress because you got to have your health. I know, I know people talk about it, but you have to be around. So I had that moment happen and I said, I am not smoking pot at all. I know not to. And I was on the Sarac will and I had to find a place to stay and depacote highest dosages feeling pretty good other than just lethargic and, you know, skinny. I started walking a little bit. I actually found a place. I was staying at friends house and then I had, I stayed at like a crappy motel on Sunset Boulevard. Then I stayed one night at a nice place, but I didn't want to ask for money. I had a credit card and I owed. I know that I owed a lot of money. Thank God I insurance, but I owe. There's a big bill which I think Zach helped paid for. And then I had a big bill to continue this therapy that I had to stay with this doctor, which is like 500 bucks an hour. So I have that that I'm dealing with. And I got out of it basically walking flat ground from like my, I found an apartment. I said, I'm going to try and live in Hollywood. I'm going to try. I always kind of wanted to see what it was like living over the hill, maybe living on the west side. Give it a shot. I wanted that. I had to move now. And I said, I got to get a studio or one bedroom. And I looked around brutal and I found one in a couple of comedian friends lived in the building. I moved there on these meds. And I just stopped doing everything I was doing up to that point, which was taking vitamins, being healthy. I was trying my best. I just was not myself. I couldn't exercise. I didn't want to exercise. I was showering. I was doing that sort of thing. But the meds were just mellowed me out. But you know, my comedy, the first few times it was hard. I did like three or five minutes at the comedy store, the laugh factory. Then I started feeling a little bit better. And my comedy actually was okay. I was feeling like crap. My comedy was okay. And the comedians were there for me to feel better. And then I just to make the, I'm going to speed up the story. I eventually adjusted the meds through the help of the doctor. He had to go down, try a different one. And it gave me a little more energy, less zombiness. And I was able to kind of still stay cool, but I wasn't a zombie. Right. But something wasn't right. I didn't feel good. And beyond, I would perform at night and I would cry during the day. Like this is not going to get better. There's dark thoughts. I'm not the same guy. And then I began not taking care of myself, meaning like the shaving and the showering and hiking Runyon Canyon and then coming home and just lying on my air mattress and not washing the sheets. Not my, my diet consisted of apples and bananas from, you know, seven, 11, five hour energy shot to try and stay awake. And I just didn't think it was going to get better. And I tried different meds and I wasn't, I mean, I could get periods when I could get it going, but it was a struggle. And I just didn't feel right. And I shot that show, the HBO version, not feeling good, not feeling right. You know, when I did, you know, I did a national TV spot stand up on the show and I was not feeling good. Yeah. Not beyond having anxiety about doing well on the set, on the comedy set. So what got me out of it was a constant, you know, I had foundation. I started developing a foundation. Comedian friends were there for me. I had to do therapy. Then once I started working a little more and warm up, getting those cobwebs off, not having people, not everybody knew about this. Oh, he had a breakdown and it didn't bother me so much, but I didn't want people knowing other than those who like in the comedy world or followed me on Twitter. You know, I would, I started doing warm up. I worked at Rob Deirdic's Ridiculousness at a small studio in Glendale. Steve Agee got me the gig. And I remember I felt fat, bloated. This medication was just making me feel not good. And I just slowly worked out of it. And for me, it was work, the support of comedians, and then the HBO show coming out, people saying they liked it a lot. Yes. And then it was me podcasting because I started podcasting more and I learned a lot through just talking on a podcast. I mentioned today I'm talking at a one and a half RPM, so I don't break down and talk about my mom. But I learned about how to talk on a podcast. So that helped me feel better. Then I adjusted my meds actively through my doctors, which I had to continue taking. Hollywood made me do it. And then I moved back to the Valley. I brought in more positivity, more structure. I got out of that negative energy of Hollywood that we spoke about. And I started getting things going. When I was on your podcast a year ago, I was at living in Hollywood, miserable, not feeling good, but I looked forward to doing your podcast. And I came here and we talked and it was good. It was at your old place. And after I said, you know what? Why don't I take a hit? And I knew in about two hours, I had an appointment with my psychiatrist. I had to meet with her over in Brentwood, which is way across town. And I said, and I have to do this. You have to follow up with these doctors. You're just super stoned and you got to drive to Brentwood to see your psychiatrist. Well, real quick, I did the episode and then after, hey, you want to... And I don't blame you at all. I knew Sarah Quill was messing me up. At that point, I was on meds, but I was at a smaller dosage a little bit. I mean, a little bit, but still... I think I was pretty hot. Yeah, that is something I think back to and think, man, you shouldn't have smoked weed. I shouldn't have. I know me. I think I shouldn't have. I shouldn't have made it available to you. Maybe don't feel guilty. Don't feel guilty about that. I asked. I said, let's do it. But it was irresponsible of me and I feel bad about that. It's something I'm not... It really did teach me a big lesson. And then all of a sudden, your psychologist is in my office with you and I just felt terrible. It wasn't your fault. I couldn't drive and I had to go to see my doctor and I couldn't drive. I knew it. Again, I did pot a couple times. Not only in my house, I did it one or two times at the comedy store. And I was like a zombie and I felt like, oh, these comedians must think Brody's on drugs and out of it with this guy. But I really was messed up and I was saying like, oh, maybe pot will do this. And it didn't. And I knew to stay away and comedians respected that. You didn't know. I brought it up like, all right, let me try. I'm feeling we had a nice podcast. So I do that and I just, I knew I'm too messed up. There's no way I'm going to make it to my doctor's place. And I had to call her and let her know. Like I couldn't just cancel and I was high and I called her and I said, I like messed up. I can't, I'm sorry. I can't be there. Can we do it over the phone? And it wasn't good. And she can be tough at times. This psychiatrist, which I go to essentially just to check up on my meds. And then, so I felt bad about that. That added stress. And then I was just freaking out, you know, not nauseous. But then I called Dr. Tabori, who's been a trooper checking in on me every day, especially when I was in Hollywood, structured, doing this, getting out of the house, walking. So I called her and she came out to. This is the lab factory psychologist. Yeah. She came out to your apartment, I mean, your house and basically just like talk me down. And I kind of revealed some things to her and I let her know as being honest. And I was out of it. You know, I'm tying in meds, this pot. And I said, Duncan, I'm just, I got to stay here. Yes. And I slept at your house. I slept like 12 hours or something in your bed. You left, you did a show. I think you had something, a concert to go to that you went to. I don't remember. I do. And you went and I just stayed in your bed. I just slept and then slept all the way through the morning. And I'm always going to, and I'm not going to break down in tears. Very grateful for that. And then then, and you said, Brody, you could stay here as long as you want. I just got to go on a show in three days, wherever with Joe Rogan out of town, something like that. And you drove me, we got some food, breakfast. You like took care of me almost for like 24 hours. And before that, you know, I would call you occasionally like a couple, three years ago just to talk about stuff. And, you know, we didn't do it all the time, but there's a few times. And I really, you know, you, just like you did today and what you do, I'm sure on your other podcast, you really have a good calming spiritual wisdom. And you're a good guy. So I felt like I called you and I felt very comfortable staying in your bed. You did take care of me. It wasn't fake or phony. And I didn't know you felt bad about the pot, but maybe you mentioned that, but I was out of it. Well, I just, you know, I felt it wasn't your fault at all. Please don't take blame. I don't, you know, thank you. I don't feel bad. All of these things, you know, what's really beautiful about all these things is, is like scary is they seem or as terrible as they seem. They're all just opportunities to either express love or to receive love. And in that way, it's, that's, it's, it's a very beautiful thing, you know? And I think that's, you know, when I, when my mom died and when I got cancer, it was amazing how just out of the blue, man, everyone just started calling me and emailing me and like loving me and like people I barely had even talked to or sending me emails and like, Did you want a card? Did I want to get a card? Is that better to physically write a card? You'll accept an email. I'm, I'm sorry. Anything, it was just the gestures of kindness. That suddenly when, when you really get down and you really need help and the immune system of the universe suddenly starts coming to you to heal you, it is, it is breathtaking how much love is out there around you that you just don't see all the time. Because unfortunately people feel like they need to wait until there's a really a big disaster, a catastrophe that happens to express that level of love. But when it happens and you realize like, Oh my God, I'm surrounded by love all the time. It's a really beautiful feeling. Yeah, it is. And I'll tell you what, I've been lucky that within two years I've had both ends of that. I had, you know, when I was having my issues and coming back, podcasting, doing shows, the podcasting with Red Band and Death Squad and my own podcast, I felt like I'm just going to double down and talk and let people know and interview and not be, oh, screaming Brody. Because early on when I did podcasts, I'd yell and this and those are maybe early signs. You can see like, this guy may not all be there because he's not thinking professionally. He's doing that. But again, sometimes, you know, Jeff Ross, he told me you got to crack some eggs to make an omelet and maybe I was cracking the eggs and getting the negative feedback. And it just, it calmed me down to talk. So I got that. And then I started doing my own podcast, interviewing, relaxed, felt good talk, gave me confidence, emails coming back. And again, I'm a mood stabilizer. So I'm kind of drifting here. What was the initial question? It's fine. Well, now we're talking. Oh, got it. Okay. Time out. Yes. Sorry to cut you off, but you triggered that. Fine. Your voice, your tone, your pitch triggered that. So I got, yeah, I got tons of support. The comedians were there for me. My friends were there for me. The people making the show with the HBO were there for me. They never pressured me. But getting back on my feet, it was just, it was slow. It was a build up and like one show led to the other, the confidence, the adjusting of the meds, going back home. Again, the young comedians reach, I hate to harp on that or going to coffee, being and talking to comedians every day, just kind of getting on that schedule, getting out of the apartment. And it sucked. I mean, just doing that, I still cried every day. I would call my mom and I have guilt over that. My mom doesn't like me to see me worry. I would cry basically every day thinking that this is not going to get better. I'm on these meds forever. Am I crazy? You know, I don't like this. It doesn't feel right. I mean, I took a whole year off from going to baseball games. I'm afraid to travel. I'm not washing clothes. You know, not taking care of myself. I knew. And then I would just talk to people like I talked to one of my friends' mothers and she says, you got to be an advocate for yourself. Yes. Yes, that's beautiful. That's a great way to put it. And I, again, I got out of that with the help of friends getting out of the valley, physically and mentally and Dr. Tabore. And I got back to the valley and I just kind of adjusted my meds and just started being positive. And, you know, that's where the positivity came out. I just wanted to be positive. And I brought up the positivity because I came out like such a jerk on these early podcasts. So I said, I'm going to be known as the positive energy guy. Yes. You know, so I worked that in and then other things kicked in. And it was that sort of deal. And right now, we'll just fast forward to now today. Yes. Yes, it feels good to have the billboard. Yes, it feels good to get positive feedback on Twitter. Yes, it feels bad to get a few hate tweets, but that comes with the territory. Do I want to be on Twitter the rest of my life? No. Do I want to put up tons of Instagram videos and photos? No, here and there, yeah. Do I want to answer emails? Yeah, maybe. But honestly, I kind of just want to like continue to do stand up. I want to hang out with baseball teams, Major League Baseball. I want to go on some concerts, you know, travel around with the band, maybe open up for a band. Yeah. Play drums. And then eventually, you know, hopefully like maybe find a partner, girl, and have a child. And, you know, that's why I want to stay healthy. I do would like to have that. I don't think I can handle that now. There's things that I think about that I can't handle. You know, my mother's older. She's 82. She fell. You know, it's a tough one for me. Yes. And that's life, but everybody handles it different. Maybe somebody's married and they have kids and they have structure and their mom dies or their dad dies. And they have that and they can, you know, they're going to grieve differently. I don't want to feel like my grief is different or harder or more difficult. And I'm not mourning the living, but you see that. You see your mother getting older when she falls and she hurts her hip. And you see her just not being what she used to be. For me personally, it's hard. And then for it to be happening right now in the middle of this introduction of America to me. Yes. You know, yeah. So I'm not out of the woods yet. I appreciate the billboard. I appreciate the positive tweets and the emails and I enjoy podcasting. But I have six more episodes that are airing. I've released and I'm okay with these first six episodes. I saw the first six. They aired. I'm all right with it. Breathe. You know, it's relaxing. You know, now there's six more episodes and maybe one more little bonus thing. I don't know. They want to shoot six more. No, we've done them. They're locked and loaded. They air episode seven and eight will be airing. This podcast is going to air this week. This Thursday. Okay. This Thursday. So on Friday, Saturday, Sunday night, at midnight, that's what it says. Some people find it earlier. But midnight, you're going to see episode seven and eight on Comedy Central. They've been playing them back to back. I think it's on, luckily, after Tosh. She's got big numbers. Yes. And it's going to cover some of the things we talk about here. My fear and its anxiety and I've controlled stress. Believe me, I fought on this thing. I wasn't pleasant to be around. I brought negative energy at times. I was wrong. How I handled things. But I also feel I was justified with things. I trust my instincts. There could have been better communication and parameters. And I've mentioned this on another podcast. Zach has nothing to do with this. I have nothing but positives and thumbs up. Same thing with Comedy Central. Same thing with Funny or Die. After that, yeah, we had some breakdowns of communication and structure because that's kind of what I'm about. You are doing a story on a guy who may not be stable and things affect him differently. And he has an OCD away of looking at things. And they did their best to accommodate that. And it wasn't a great experience, necessarily, the editing. Producing and editing for TV, it can be brutal, man. I think that's the problem. I know it's normal. I mean, again, I'm cutting you off. I don't want to cut you off. It's normal. I'll give you an example. I had a conversation with Nick Kroll. And I'm on the Nick Kroll show. I'll be on a couple of the episodes. Nick has been very supportive. Nice guy, great energy, gets it. And I talked to him about this. And he goes, it's completely normal. I don't like the way I look on camera. It's normal. Everybody will say that. Johnny Dent doesn't watch his movies or the premiere. And I'm sure there's others like that. Yeah. So my thing is, this is my introduction to America. This is my name. This is, quote, unquote, my life. It's very personal issues. And that being said, I feel there's extra, you know, it's not the same of having your name on a show. I'm not comparing myself to Nick Kroll, but anybody who has or doesn't have their name, it's a me. You know, I'm not, it's not like Brody presents sketches. Oh yeah. No, I know exactly what you mean, man. It's like, so if you get rejected in that way, then you feel like they're rejecting you, as opposed to if you're playing a character on a sitcom. It's just like, well, they didn't like the sitcom. There were other writers. So you've, the burden that you're creating here is one where if you get, if for some reason, the feedback you get isn't good, but it seems like you're getting great feedback. It's been 93% positive. But I see it and I'm, again, we're going back to everything we talked about before and I won't rehash that. Those elements come into play as how I look at this and how I, you know, taken the positive energy from others. But technically in closing, again, where I am right now, I don't know how I'm going to feel about episode seven and eight. I don't know how I'm going to feel about episode nine and 10. I don't know how I'm going to feel about 11 and 12. I have anxiety. My feelings are, wow, you know, you are giving up material, yourself, footage to editors and producers that kind of put their, they're, I'm not, You've got to surrender Brody. You got to let go. Well, yeah, and I've done my best at letting go and it has caused friction. It has left emotional scars on me and I'm sure it's left it on some other guys and that's not healthy. That stress, that's heart. That's what my father went through, my uncles and I can't have that happen. So my feeling is I just want to get through these next six episodes and have them stay in the pocket and just be consistent to what I've done so far because episode one through six, I'm happy. I'll take that. If they said today, Brody, you're done. The ratings were terrible. It's over. I'd walk away fine. Happy. I got a billboard. I did a show. People like it and I'll enjoy the ride. But I still have these six more episodes and I don't know. And it's hard for me and I've watched some of them, but you never know. And again, maybe I'm making it too big. Well, look where you are. Maybe I'm too small. Right now. Let's celebrate the noun. Yes. I'm saying yes, but that's not how I'm wired. I know. None of us are. I know. But here in closing, to let you know, Duncan, that I'm going to be okay. I know you're okay. And I feel that come January 5th, they're going to air 7 and 8 on Sunday. Then they're going to air 9 and 10 the following Sunday. And then 11 and 12 on January 5th, which is a Sunday. Once those are over and done with, I'll say like a day or two after that, whatever happens. Because there's some strange stuff. There's some goofy stuff. There's some stuff that I feel maybe puts me in a weird light. But I felt that way about some of these episodes ahead of time, one through six. And they turned out okay. They did a great job of weaving the story and then tying it into the original HBO footage. This is a clean palette, clean slate, new stuff, we're kind of breaking out of it. But I feel, you know, are we going to stay in the tone? Is it funny? Is it real? Do I look a certain way? You know, these thoughts are going through my head. Because I did evolve. This is not, this is Brody actually after doing Conan. Brody, after having the HBO show go out and have people say, hey, you did a great job. This is after me, you know, when I was shooting this, I was feeling good. I was up. I was Brody, positive energy. I had certain friends around me during the shooting. And I would constantly check in. And I would say to the director and those around me, I don't want to come off too happy because I am feeling good. You know, I'm not stressed about this. This is fun. We're shooting everything I put up on the board. We're doing it. We're getting the angles. You know, that felt good. And then the edit, I backed off and I know let the editors edit. And I saw the stuff, rough cuts kind of freaked me out. Didn't like, didn't feel like that was what I saw happen, not in my head. So I had to constantly, I stay on these guys, get my vision. And that's where I clashed a little bit with, say, producers. Part of the process, man. You got to clash. That's just the way it works. I know. But here's my feeling. I don't want to clash anymore. I feel like, and that's where, in closing, that's where, and I'm not saying, it's not the end all. It's not the be all. This is not my masterpiece. I can't, I can't predict the future, but I can predict one thing. I will hopefully, after these, and I don't want to rest my life on television episodes. But that's where I am right now as a professional and how focused I am on comedy, performance, and that, you know, tightness. All through everything I've done in comedy. And I allow myself to get loose and be off base. And sometimes that throws people off. But that's kind of me. Yeah. So let me get through these. I'm asking you, episode seven through 12. Yes. Keep it in the same ballpark. And I feel, from that point on, I don't want to have arguments with anybody. I don't want to have to fight for comedy. You want to fight for comedy? Thank you. I have, I did a show and hopefully it's successful. I don't know. I don't want to argue with you. See ya. You know, I'm not, I'm going to divorce myself from those situations. If I was to do another television show and I can't say I'm going to, I don't know if I'll have that chance. I mean, I could go on YouTube and make something up if I'm driven like that. And I don't know if I am. So, but that show, it's positive. It's, it's happy. It's Brody. Bring them down a notch. It's Brody. Interview Duncan. It's Brody talking. My mom's funny. So having her on. But I don't want arguments. Number one, not heated, red level, heart racing, stressful arguments. Not helpful. You got to pull yourself into the moment, Brody. You're a way out in the future. And the more you stay out there, the more you're going to have arguments. But okay, all that aside before, just let's just wrap up with one thing. Because I know you won't accept how awesome a person you are, because you're afraid to or you, I don't know why we all can. It's hard to do. But you are a fucking amazing human, man. You're an artist. I feel so proud to know you as a friend. I think you're such a cool person. I beat eczema. I beat acid reflux. But I wasn't solid for two years straight from stress. Brody, family. Listen, right now, there's legions of Brody's out there right now listening to this. People prior to getting the Sandy Shore comedy lessons. People prior to realizing even what they want to do. People working. Maybe there's someone with earbuds net right now listening to this, selling China at Nordstrom's. Tell them, give them some inspiration. What can they do? Give them some courage. Give them like a locker room talk before the big game. Okay, I'll give you a little talk. And I mean, what I feel, maybe I've done this already. I would say to aspiring performers or comedians, it's not about being on TV. This is how I did it. You may be that one in a million guy who goes, I see myself performing in auditoriums, theaters, Madison Square Garden. Maybe that drives you. Maybe you want your own sitcom. You want to be the next Steve Martin. You can go ahead and do that. I'm not going to stop you. My philosophy, and I come from a John Wooden, San Fernando Valley, Consistent Wisdom, Pre-Internet, Division I baseball, structured reality of staying consistent, putting your time in, 10,000 hours, stage time, jokes, be nice, tape your sets. I'm talking comedically, stand up because I get those questions. So stage time, jokes, be patient, let your persona and your voice develop and come out and experience things, live in different cities, travel, put yourself out of the comfort zone, learn to speak in public. I sold t-shirts for the Seattle SuperSonics. I couldn't have done that in high school. I was embarrassed. I got a C plus in public speaking at Arizona State. There's so many things there. Give us one thing. Focus it, ground it. Give us one thing. What's the step that we can all take after this podcast in our lives today, right now? What's the step? I would say the step is, honestly, believe in yourself. Find the goodness in others. Don't focus on their 30% jerkness. Find the 70%. Find the positive out of somebody. Don't hate. I know it sounds simple. Don't compare. Be the best you can be. I know these sounds. I mean, I'm not reinventing the wheel here. Why would you? I'm only, I'm growing though with the, I'm getting it, but I'm not, you're not looking at a guy, by the way, and I hate to go back to negative. You asked for one button. I'm not a guy who has a million followers on Twitter. I don't have a YouTube subscription channel. I see those things and I go, you know, that's got to play with your head. And it's got to play with a guy's head who also has a million followers on Twitter and goes, Hey, I'm not on Comedy Central. So it's kind of weird, but in closing, I want to get through this period, January 5th. And I'm not to say, I'm not going to say there's going to be stressful moments coming up, but creatively and professionally, I'm going to divorce myself from those situations because my health matters. And if I'm going to do something comedy, it's going to be fun. It's going to be my guys and we'll push it, but it ain't going to be unhealthy. And that's the main thing, your health. Because if you're gone, what good are you? Right. You know, your energy may be left on these podcasts, maybe memories, maybe this 3D thing. But when you walk in the room or I drive into the comedy store, that's real palatable energy. And so that's why we need to be healthy as a physical being to bring that. I can't speak for what happens when we're gone, maybe we're in somebody's head and they're going to remember your thoughts and what I say. Who knows? I don't know. Doesn't matter. But in the meantime, we're helping people. Right now, all that matters is embracing yourself and finding a way to be healthy emotionally and physically. And I think you're a great example of somebody who trusts themselves and who is, what we all are getting to enjoy watching is your life like flowering after such hard work. And that is an America that we love that, man. It's the most beautiful thing to see. I do get that and I appreciate it and I want to quote unquote enjoy it in the process. And I am struggling with that. I'm going to be honest. But it's normal. But I'm just being honest, how my mind works and I'm big on dates. I'm big on closure. I'm big on somewhat evenness. But I could be talked out of it. You could say, hey, Brody, you know what? Here's, go to Hawaii. Forget about the show. Don't even tweet about the show. I'll tweet about the show for you. I don't want you to go to Hawaii. But you know what I'm saying? I think that I want us and everyone to be in the moment more. And I think the spiritual practice is your mind is always going to bring you out of the moment. And you always, if you can, pull yourself back in. And that pendulum from going into the future and going into the moment, recognize that that's normal. That's what everyone does. But just start pulling yourself back into the moment, right here. But it's hard, Duncan, when you are on television. When it's recorded. People are watching. I mean, it's not that people are watching. It's hard when you're in the moment. It's hard to be in the moment when that moment happened three months ago. Or that moment was a moment that you would never, ever be involved in unless you were put into that situation due to making a show. And I'm not saying it isn't reality. I had to go to Boston. I had to go to Miami. We did take cameras. These cameras didn't dictate it. This is the way you can really, really love yourself is by like right now, like right here, here, like in this moment, recording the podcast, just be here and like look at your breath, you know, like follow your breath. And Duncan, I like, like I said, I am 100% on board with basically everything you say. I did nitpick and kind of clarify and shift a little bit. That's my mind. I am getting a little hungry. And I can talk like this. I can bring it to this level. But I, but for the sake of this pot and I knew I could get emotional with you. I cried in your house. I was broken down. I mean, there was a chance. I was going to go back to the hospital right there. She goes, do you want me to take you to the hospital? Yeah. So for me to come back and be with you a year later. And you're so much better. Well, I feel better and to come back here. And then if I was to talk about my mom being in the moment, it's difficult for me. I'm adjusting to it. So I have to steep it. That grief. At this. That thing that you're amped just a little. I understand. Listen, nobody's asking anyone to go too fast with this kind of thing. Because you want to slowly do it. But listen, man, you know, my mom died less than a year ago. She did? Yeah. And I still, I know that there is a huge core of grief and sadness that I have to deal with. Like, I have to deal with it. And that's why I do this stuff. This is why I go to meditation retreats. And this is why I try to work on myself. And this is why, like, when I meditate and when I really slow down and I go into my heart and I feel what's there, I'm scared because it's such, there's sadness there and it makes me cry. And that, that is what many people try to avoid. Because they don't understand that on the other side of that is something a million times better than being on TV or getting the great job or all your dreams coming true or finding the right lover or any of that stuff. On the other side of that foggy wall of grief and sadness is true happiness. On the other side of that is love. And you, but to get to it, you got to go through the dark forest and all the mythologies and fairy tales and everything. It's like, you got to go through Mordor. You got to go through that black, thick, gnarly place filled with monsters and beasts. Because on the other side of that man, that waiting for you on the other side of that is just love and embrace and finally finding peace. But it's to get there as a process. It's a process and, you know, not to heart back on my dad and the selfishness and we were talking about health is like, my father was in the hospital and it's like, I didn't visit him like I should. You know, I don't want, again, I don't want to get emotional, but there's things in my life that, you know, I wasn't with my mom when she died. And that's something that I have to deal with. You know, it's something I'm going to, I have to deal with that and I have to forgive myself for that. And I know she would forgive me for it, but I have to look into it and be with it. It's hard. It's, it is a life's work. It's hard. And as a performer, you know, the show must go on and it is therapeutic. And I remember the night my dad died. It was hard. Yeah. Yeah. And that feeling that you start getting when you go into that place and you just let yourself go there for a second, you can feel it right in your heart. And that right there, that feeling, that's the game is always moving from your head down into your heart. And even though it feels like touching an electric fence when you do it and you want to pull your hand away and go back into your head where it's safe and numb and you don't have to deal with it, that's fine. But just know that over time, you start going back down there. Start going back down there. And whenever you can, and the more you do it, the more, the more you're going to, you're going to start opening up and really feeling and really feeling. And have that release and not have it be a pill and not have it be, not to say I'm going off my meds, not to have that. So I know, I have feelings about how I was with my father. I felt, you've heard other comedians say when their parent has passed away, it kind of opened them up a little bit. Like I can say things that my father's not going to judge me about. I'm going to go for it. It's not like I was saying F you dad. It was like saying, see, I can do that. And I do remember you and it's not the negative stuff. And I feel if my dad was around, I'd probably butt heads with them. He'd probably say, do this, do that. Why are you doing that? And I think it, again, I don't want to think hypotheticals. And but what I do is I've taken that, you know, not lack or like that lack of empathy that I had towards my father, because I knew he was in pain, heart problems, money problems, me not being reciprocal in my love, I think. And so I put that into my mom and it's not phony. It's not for show. I actually love being around my mom. She can be, she can be, makes me worry and stresses me out unnecessarily. And then she yells at me and she goes, you know, I'm 82. I've been through a lot. You know, you know what? You got to give your parents a break, but they can stress you out. Again, very normal. And I'm dealing with it. She's getting better. She's happy. She's funny. And I think, you know, again, moving forward, if I was to do something else, wherever it may be, if it's, you know, televised, I like to have my mom on, you know, she's funny. She doesn't like being on TV. But she does. Same thing with my sister. And it's helped bring my sister together. So it's all been, it had the experience, the editing, the communication. There's a lot of stuff that, that eat at me and will physically and spiritually eat at you, but I'm learning from it. And I, and I, and I do appreciate everything and everyone's positive support. Well, I love you and we love you. Congratulations on your show. Everybody watch Brody Stevens. Enjoy it. You got it. On Comedy Central. Tell me again when it's Sunday. It's Sunday nights.

142^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - RAM DASS and ROSHI JOAN HALIFAX!!!!!!! Transcript and Discussion^2013-05-11^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, dear sweet friends, and thank you for tuning in to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. This is a special episode, perhaps the most special episode of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour, because this episode is dedicated to love. And what better way to start an episode dedicated to love off than with a Daniel Johnston song? True love will find you in the end. You'll find out just who with your friend. Don't be sad I know you will. But don't give up until true love will find you in the end. This is a promise with a catch. Only if you're looking can it find you. This true love is searching too. But how can it recognize you unless you step out into the light, the light. Don't be sad I know you will. But don't give up until true love will find you in the end. Isn't that great? That's true love will find you in the end. You can find that on iTunes, Daniel Johnston. So I just returned from a meditation retreat in Maui with Ram Dass and Zinn Roshi, Roshi Joan Halifax. It was an amazing experience, perhaps one of the most incredible experiences of my life. And it was the opposite of what the cynical part of my brain expected a meditation retreat to be like, which was a place filled with sycophantic, flowery, bug-eyed, crystal-gazing, hemp-clad, recently divorced channelers on vacation from their food co-ops. The reality was that I found myself surrounded by a group of people who are all actively working on themselves in an authentic way. And that experience alone was life-changing for me. Because I've spent most of my life with my head buried in books about spirituality. Tig Nhat Hanh, Alan Watts, Terrence McKenna, Ram Dass, the Dalai Lama, the Bible. It's so easy to get just into the thing where you're just reading about this stuff and reading about this stuff and reading about this stuff. And you can be this solitary practitioner for your entire life. It reminds me of a phenomena that happens when people decide they want to start stand-up comedy. And usually what happens when someone decides they want to start stand-up comedy is they spend months and months and months and months and months trying to compose perfect jokes to use before they go on stage. And really all this is a kind of logical procrastination that puts space in between where they are and the inevitable terror of having to get on stage by yourself and tell jokes. The reality of the thing is you should spend your first year of stand-up comedy just getting comfortable on stage and it has nothing to do with what you're saying. You just have to do it. You have to jump in. But in a kind of similar way when it comes to spirituality or working on yourself, you can sort of just get into the language of the thing and get into reading about it and sort of contemplating it and thinking about it. But this is a great thing at first in the sense that it can sort of open your eyes to the idea that there's a spiritual dimension to the world. But if you don't take the leap into getting into some kind of spiritual community or getting around a group of people who are practicing together, then it's kind of like having read sheet music for a very long time and never going to a symphony. Eventually you should go and hear the music and see what it looks like when it's being performed and see what it looks like when a group of people are bringing the music from the page to life. And that's what the spiritual community is and that's what happened at this meditation retreat. In Buddhism, they call the spiritual community the Sangha and I've even heard the spiritual community described as the body of the Buddha. And I think in Christianity in the book of Matthew, there's the Jesus said, where two or more of you are gathered in my name, there I will be. Well, those are just sort of ways of describing this insane, beautiful thing that happens when a group of people get together for reasons other than watching spandex clad football players smash into each other on a putting green or buying 700 pounds of cashews at Costco while completely ignoring each other. When people get together to work on each other together or to practice bonafide spirituality or yoga techniques or Zen techniques or just to evolve themselves when people get together with that purpose something else enters into the picture. And at our current level of human evolution, we describe this ineffable thing as love and which is unfortunate because love is a word that has been hijacked by greeting card companies, cult leaders, sentimentalists, pop singers, false prophets, pedophiles, rom-coms, McDonald's and a million other unsavory types who transform the most incredible thing that humans can experience and do an inflatable, gaudy imitation of itself that they use for their selfish desires and nefarious marketing campaigns. These bastards have made the highest and most intense experience accessible to humans, almost impossible to talk about without feeling embarrassed. You don't want to seem like a sap love you happen about love you don't want to seem like some fairy living in a flower floating on a pond singing to a duck. So many phony freaks out there just use that word to try to get laid and to try to make money. So the word itself is a problematic thing because it points maybe it points to something that isn't really what it is because because what it really is is something with a subjective supernova level of energy. Now this love, the love spirituality or the active pursuit of love is a form of spiritual practice is known as bhakti, bhakti yoga, the yoga of love, the yoga of falling in love with the universe or falling in love with God or falling in love with Krishna or falling in love with the guru or falling in love it's it's the spiritual it's the acknowledgement that all of us want love and it's the thing everyone wants more than anything else it's the most important thing. If you really sit down and think about it and are quite honest with yourself, you can see that all you really want is love. We want to fall in love. We want love from our friends. We want love from the people we work with. We want to be embraced. We love the feeling of being embraced and the opposite of it is is is terrible. You never hear somebody you never hear somebody talking about yeah God I had the greatest day today I walked down the street nobody looked at me. My waiter was a jerk and no one let me through let me in and traffic and when I got to work my boss and coworkers ignored me and I went home and no one called me on my phone. That's not a good day. A good day are those magical days when you go outside and someone you don't know smiles at you and says hello and maybe whoever you encounter when you're buying stuff or when you're at a restaurant is very sweet to you and you're complimented on the work you did in an authentic way and the girl or the guy that you like calls you to tell you that they love you and you get home and you get to hang out with friends who are all very happy to be around you. Why is that a good day? It's a good day because the theme running through the entire day is love. It's the best thing. When you have a pet when you have babies all of these moments these are the moments you remember. More than anything the moments that love bubbles up and emerges into your life so. This phenomena this this this this. This truth which is love is what we all want more than anything is something that was identified by super brilliant advanced beings many many thousands of years ago. And I think their great discovery was that love is not something that we obtain from the external universe but love is something that we are. That radiates out of us and reflects back to us from the screen that is the field of phenomena that we call reality. So that when we say we're falling in love we're not really falling in love we're seeing ourselves. So Bhakti Yoga would be the process of waking up to your true identity which is becoming or transforming into love. The retreat was called love and awareness and I won't go into the details of what Ram Dass and Roshi Halifax talked about because what they said is secondary to what they were both radiating love. These two people have spent at least the last 40 years actively working on themselves in a disciplined way and the end result is that they have transformed themselves into love radiators. This is an inspirational thing because being around it makes you want to be like it. Once you've seen it in action once you've seen what it looks like and not just these two people but all the people surrounding them and all the people who have been following. Who consider them to be teachers when you see the the effect that their teachings that's had on on on these people you think well yeah I want to be like that. I don't I don't want to be some closed hearted cold menacing angry egomaniacal thing anymore. I want to be like this these people these people are. Love fireflies. And it's real it's not phony I'm not talking about this crappy be as drum circle patchouli soak beach love or someone's yapping about love but the only thing that they want to do is get in the sack with a weed dealer. I'm talking about the real this is the real thing. So it was being around these people is amazing but the height of the retreat for me happened when my friend Raghu Marcus who you can listen to on an earlier episode of this podcast or on his own podcast the mind rolling podcast. Took me to Ram Dass's house. Now those of you who know me know that this is identical to a teenage girl being taken to Justin Bieber's house. I felt like I was in some kind of intense fever dream. I actually ended up in a swimming pool hanging out with Ram Dass and Roshi Joan Halifax. Where I was mostly speechless as I watched these two old friends play together in the swimming pool laughing and joking with each other just like kids. No heaviness no self importance no intense spiritual talks just two beings purely in the moment having a great time in a swimming pool. This is what a spiritual practice can give you the ability to actually enjoy existence while melting the brains and expanding the minds of all those around you in the process. We went back into Ram Dass's house and this is where this is sort of the peak of the whole thing. He came up to me I was sitting on the couch and he's in a Ram Dass isn't it for those of you don't know Ram Dass I highly recommend checking out the documentary fierce grace which is available on Netflix which sort of shows how he has been coping with the effects of a stroke that he had which has put him in a wheelchair and has in some ways impaired his ability to speak is sort of slowed down. His language a little bit. And the documentary the documentary is great because it shows you how not only does the spiritual practice make it so that you can have a super great time in a swimming pool but it can also make it when the inevitable collapse of your physical body happens it can make it so that that seems as as small and as. As irrelevant a thing as getting something stuck in your teeth. It doesn't matter that the man is in a wheelchair it doesn't matter that the man is that his language has been slowed down a little bit because he's just blasting love out and you don't notice the wheelchair after a few moments of being around this person. You don't notice any of the weird effects of the stroke after you've been around this person all you notice is Holy God this person is blasting me with love which is what happened he can he rolled up to me in his wheelchair sitting on the couch. And he sat in front of me and he just was smiling and this is all this stuff is really when you when you describe it you're you're limited to language you're strapped in language and languages really can't get a get across. What what this is like. It's very hard to do it will I'll probably never be able to really describe this in a way that they can they can fully get across what it felt like. But it was this beautiful moment with Ram Dass and he's smiling and he's looking at me and it's unconditional love he's giving me unconditional love and I'm looking at him and I start thinking about how I wish my mom could be there and she just if she could have I just kept thinking God if she could if she could see this this happened and so that made me made it made me start crying a little bit and and I told him you know my mom passed away a few weeks ago and I just wish she were here to see this. And he just smiled and beamed at me and said she is here and it was real it felt so real and I felt her there I could feel it he's right she was right there. And we talked a little bit more and he said to me he pointed to his head and he said you his forehead he said you have to move from here and then he pointed to his heart and he said to hear. Now this instruction simple instruction is something that I will think about for the rest of my life. Because I think that really does encapsulate what this is all about the meditation the working on yourself whatever it is that that that you're you're engaged in out there. That's it that's the most that's the movement to get out of the the shrieking howling confusing endless download of the mind and into the heart. And since this meditation retreat I've been working on it and I I have to say that there are there there are moments where it feels as though I've been living in this mansion or temple or house which is my body. And there's this whole other part of the house in fact the actual it's almost as though I've been living on the porch that's the way to put it if you've been living in your head it's like you've been living on on on the porch with the barking dogs. It's like you've been living on a porch in front of a mansion with a bunch of yapping barking dogs and suddenly you realize the doors unlocked and you can walk into this spacious expansive beautiful place that has a feeling of familiarity to you because if you when you were a kid that's where you lived. That's the place you were you hung out all the time. But at some point you decided you'd rather go sit on the porch with yapping dogs that bark and how and and endlessly bark about taxes and money and things you should have done and things you should do and things you didn't do. It's a noisy porch up there in the brain but the heart another overused term it's this other place all together and when you go into that place suddenly you get out of the mind you get out of the endless yapping of the brain and you get into this still place where suddenly there isn't as much to say. Because you're just experiencing what is and that's what Ram Das Ram Das teaches. That's what Roshi Joan Halifax teaches. That's what Ragu Marcus teaches and that's what Ram Das is guru. Neem Kareli Baba was all about just being in the moment or being here now be here now check out the book Ram Das wrote it if you haven't seen it and and if you and if you can. I highly recommend that you come to one of these meditation retreats. You can go to Ram Das.org. There's one coming up in December that I'm going to go to. I cannot recommend this. Enough. I have done. Countless. Doses of LSD and other psychedelics. I've been to the raves. I've hung out with freaks. I've gone to the desert on mushrooms and stared up at the sky. Been to India. Been to Varanasi watch bodies burn on the banks of the Ganges River. Been in love. I've taken long baths. But nothing. Compares to this this thing which is actually happening in Hawaii. So highly recommend that and also if you're if you're drawn more to Buddhism and to Zen you can also go to the upaya meditation center which is was founded by Roshi Joan Halifax and they have meditation retreats all the time there and you can go there and you can meditate. But what I recommend is get your nose out of the books and find a group of people who are meditating out there. You might have to look around a lot. I mean I've gone to group. You know I have ended up around groups of people who are practicing this thing or that thing that I didn't really resonate with and you just don't go back. And don't get yourself hot tied in the basement of some cult leader's house staring at an oil painting of the Virgin Mary while somebody drips hot candle wax on your back. You don't want to do that. But I'm sure that there's where around you there's got to be groups of people who are practicing some form of meditation guaranteed. You can do a Google search and find it. But go and do that. That's my new multiverse freak out challenge. I challenge you to get out of your house and go to some place where people are practicing together. It's out there. You can find it. Go to round us.org. There's a message board there. I'm sure there's people who are who are involved in the love server member foundation around you who are doing this stuff. I think they're everywhere. But I highly recommend it. And anyway, not only did I get to sit down with Ram Dass but I also thanks to Raghu Marcus got to do a podcast with Ram Dass and Roshi Halifax. And so let me just let me just apologize in advance if I seem giddy or weird or tight or shut down or if my voice seems weird. Just understand that this is like for me this is this is like it's like being around a love supernova. So I apologize for any stammering quality to my voice and also the background noise. We were in Ram Dass's house and so what you're hearing is people in the kitchen and just the sounds that's the sound of Ram Dass's house. So sorry for any weird ambient noise in the background. We're not going to do commercials for this episode but I do invite you to go visit Ram Dass.org or go to upaya.org and check out go to one of Roshi's programs. Get involved. Go listen to the mind rolling podcast at mindrollingpodcast.com. I'll have all these links at Duncan Trussell.com. So now everyone please dilate your heart chakras, expand your third eyes and allow your astral bodies to welcome to the Duncan Trussell family hour Ram Dass, Ragu Marcus and Roshi Joan Halifax. This is Duncan Trussell and he's had a podcast for a couple of years. He's been doing podcasting as a comedian. And during his podcasts, because of his love for Ram Dass, he would talk about Ram Dass, talk about some of the books that he had read, be here now. Now this audience is in their 20s and 30s and there's like, I don't know, 40, 50,000 every week are pulling this podcast out. And they all, not all, but it seems like a good part. Obviously they're interested in what you're talking about when you speak about telling stories about Ram Dass. They love it. Well, they love, you know, many of them are using psychedelics. A lot of people have come in contact with psychedelics minus the spirituality. So I am, you guys, I just had, I'm going to say this, I just had the, literally the greatest day of my life. I just went swimming with Ram Dass and Roshi Joan Halifax. And I feel like, I definitely feel like I'm probably going to wake up from a dream any second. I'm here with Ram Dass and Roshi Joan Halifax. Thanks for, thanks for letting me record. Just thanks for letting me put you guys on this podcast. Wait, what about me? Oh, I'm sorry. And of course, Raghu Marcus, my friend who's been on the Duncan Trussell family. I already have a jettisoned you. Got him. Got to the source, screw him. Thank you. What about me? Yeah, what about me? And Roshi? Well, did you ever really use psychedelics, Ram Dass? You? I mean, you should see this guy's face right now. You know, he's red from being out in the sun, but now he's twice as red. So tell us. Drugs. Yeah. And they led me to Maharaji. And they made a transition from psychologist into eastern mysticism. You would never cross that barrier. And psychedelics were the bridge. And, you know, I've been reading after death experiences in William. And I remember one psychedelic trip. I was, Caroline and I were having sex. Who is Caroline? His girlfriend. Was my girlfriend. And that plus, the psychedelic was too much for me. It was too much. And I went and floated up in the ceiling. And I, a luminous cord from me up in the ceiling and down below. And I watched the whole process. And that luminous cord was, because I was thinking the cord was keeping me up there like a balloon. And they're keeping from, but in fact, I was there in my soul with, and I was keeping the body going. That's a very interesting perspective. Wow. Yeah. So then what happened? We never had a baby. Okay. Well, Roshi, may I ask you a question? Sure. How, how do you become a Roshi? Oh, it's a case of mistaken identity. Obviously from dust is laughing with a sense of fundamental agreement. You can't, it's a, it's a kind of accident or something like that. You know, you don't go into your teacher and say, you know, I'd like to be a Roshi. In fact, when I received Inka Shomei, I, When you received, When I was, you know, made a Roshi. Yes. I had this deep sense of bread and I was accurate. What was the, what was the feeling of dread? The responsibility of the role? You know, I mean, you become the recipient for phenomenal projections. Right. And you just wish people would retrieve their enlightenment and enjoy it for themselves and lay it on you. It's something I imagine both of you must encounter all the time, that must be incredibly confusing to have people, because I can't, I mean, after, I can barely look at you, Ramdas, but just because I've, my whole life, I've been influenced, you've influenced me more than anyone in my life. So it's very, it's a real intense thing to be around you. And after, I wish we were filming that. Oh, it's hilarious. But it's an intense thing. That is, but when you say this is a projection, your people are putting their enlightenment on you. Is that your job? Is that what you guys do? Try to point out to people that it's inside of them, that it's not coming from you? That is the role of the guru. Dispel the darkness. Right? Yeah. You know, but I don't, I don't think that people like me, I can't speak for Ramdas, go around thinking of themselves as anything special. Right. You know, we're just, you know, we're just in the weave of things. And this will not happen. And so we're playing with it. You're playing with it. And it is playful. I can feel that from both of you. There's a beautiful playfulness. Yet you can't deny the fact that both of you are having a monumental impact on people's lives. Well, I'm not, but you know, I'm sure Ramdas has. You have. No. Of course you have. Are we going to start bickering again? Anyway, let's not get. In the dying moment. Yeah. You have, you have been the prime movers of that movement. Well, you know, what's really interesting is to look at what you did in the area of dying and also in prison work and in the whole sort of field of service. You're kind of like the grandfather for all of us, even though I'm barely younger than you, she says, honestly. But you opened that door in a major way. That was true, didn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was fairly beyond being. That was, that was caused by psychedelics. Because when I was LSD, all this was, all this was, gave us the Tibetan Book of the Dead. All the taxlee. All the taxlee, yeah. And he, and I had, I had tripped on Saturday and I couldn't, I couldn't say what it was because I couldn't tell anybody because it was all beyond words. And on Tuesday, he gave us the book and I started to read it. And it looked like it was, this book was. Written out of your experience. Yeah. And that, that, that was, that's when I went to, I then, went to India. But that became the dying stuff was formed by psychedelics. Well, that's, that's, you know, when, when I, when Stan Groff and I got married, then one of the things that we did was we did the work at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center with LSD assisted psychotherapy. It was really powerful, you know, being able to work with people who were facing death, you know, in the process of active dying, not, you know, we're all facing death, whether we know we are or not, but these people were in the process of actively dying. And to administer 600 micrograms of LSD, sandos, you know, just those little ampules, I'll never forget, pop those puppies open, put them in. And, you know, to be able to be with somebody who is in that process of actively dying on the journey with LSD, amplifying their experience was really powerful, totally changed their life. Yeah. Can you describe the effect that that has on dying people? Well, Stan and I did a book about it. It's still out there somewhere. But the book is called The Human Encounter with Death. Kind of interesting because it was under the aegis of the National Institute of Mental Health and IMA. So it's, you know, fully sanctioned at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center. And it was done as a research project. So, you know, we had parameters that we would evaluate patients on, pre and post, and all that kind of research stuff. And the outcomes were extraordinarily positive. People went through experiences that showed them about the nature of their mind, which was indestructible. So I'll tell you, we had one guy, his name is Dean. He's dying of colon cancer. And we had this, you know, the session day. He was an Afro-American guy. He was really powerful. He was dying at home. His family was very present and supportive. And then we brought him into the research center and, you know, he had his LSD day. And he had a fantastic experience. And the BBC actually filmed some of it. I saw a little bit of footage from it recently. It was like, oh, wow, that's interesting. I totally forgot about that part. But he ended up going through a near-death experience. His kidneys shut down. And he was hospitalized at this point after the session. And they resuscitated him. And he was so sad. He said, you know, when I was dying, he said to Stan and I afterwards, he said, I had this realization that LSD had completely prepared me for this moment. And then they saved my life. And it was disappointing that they did. Yeah. I mean, he was, you know, he died shortly thereafter. But he was, you know, not happy about being brought out, but back. But he was, you know, he felt like he was having another amazing psychic experience. And, you know, then the medical system ruined it. But never mind. I mean, really, we're all standing around the bed singing, you know, gospel. And then they came with the gurney and popped him on there. And out he went. And then the poor guy. But he was very grateful that he had been given an introduction to what it's like to die, because that's what he was experiencing when he was in the dying process. Both of you have done tremendous work with dying people, hospice work. I read that you actually will lay with people as they are dying. Is that true, Roshi? Well, you know, Ramdas, don't look at me like that. I didn't mean to. You would too, if you could. You know, I think it depends on the role that you're in. But unfortunately, I have the ability, because of my little job to be free of certain constraints that are put on people in other vocations. Yes. So, you know, holding somebody in the dying process is an honor. That is beautiful and powerful, because I, you know, I just, my mother just passed away. And this was three weeks ago. She had cancer. Wow. And I've had this discussion with a few other people. There's this sort of picturesque version of death. You know, you sit around the bed of your dying parent, and it's this beautiful thing. Angels come down, and it's like little house on the prairie, a sort of beautiful... I don't think so. No. Nothing prepared my brother and I for what it was really like. And what it was really like was not pretty. And both of us remark on how we can't, it's very hard for us to get the image of those last moments out of our minds. So the idea of both of you putting yourself in that place again and again and again is mind-blowing to me. That place is truth, is truth, and spirit. And the whole thing is the change in consciousness that we go through and the people go through. And I teach a course in San Francisco with how to sit bedside, and I say a loving rock is the best place. Oh, that's so great. A loving rock, because then they can push against you, and then you're stable, and you're loving. And of course the bedside sitter has worked on himself, herself, so that they can go through the dying process with the dying person. Because in the dying process, they go in as an ego, and they go out as a soul. And they go, and it's just brilliant. They go in with looking backwards, like the doctor had helped me and things like that, and my family and stuff like that. And they go out, like further on, looking ahead, and the light, and the love, and the boy, oh boy, oh boy. But if you're sitting by the bed, if you don't know anything about that soul, you can't go with them to the culmination of the ceremony. Yes, that was, I was disappointed in myself, because I have spent years reading various spiritual texts and studying them and pretending that I knew what any of it was about. Zero practice. This is something that you say, the necessity of a practice. You have to have a practice. My mother had a practice, and her dying was graceful and beautiful, whereas my brother and I were just flailing and floundering around her. It was too much. It was too much. It's too big a thing to understand. It's too big a thing to, we can't wrap our heads around what it is. So, and I think that, you know, clearly if a spiritual practice will help you deal with having your face shoved into oblivion by fate, it obviously will help you deal with everything else. And what spiritual practice could you guys recommend for a person to start now who might be listening? Something that someone can do to begin the process of preparing for this moment, whether it's their own expiration or their parents or their friends? I think that they should go to find a dying person and sit by, sit by the side. That's the most powerful, powerful, powerful thing to get into that environment of truth and spirit and emotion and all of that. And I think maybe, and there are plenty of places that need volunteers, that these places in every city. And I think that there are a lot of spiritual practices. She knows them and I know them. They are minor bhakti. Minor Buddhist. You know, seeing God's name. Ram. Ram. That's what the one I... And that's Ram, Ram, Ram. Ram, Ram, Ram. That was Maharaj's mantra. And the name is synonymous with light, with consciousness, with... with love. These are the things that God makes up God. God isn't a physical being. It is a consciousness, a consciousness. And he... Don't he, it's not a he. Thank you. God is peace, compassion, love, joy, and wisdom. Those are the end products of spiritual work and their end products of dying. You know, when I was in Delhi a few years ago, I went to Gandhi's place. And one of the most powerful stories for me is about when Gandhi was shot and what came out of his mouth was Ram. Ram, Ram, Ram. You know, instead of something that would be less attractive, you know, he uttered the name of God and became that really, really powerful. Yeah, I mean, I feel like, you know, there are structured practices, whether they're bhaktik or mind training that can really help people come into a space where they can be a loving lock. Oh, I love that. It's just so great. I'm going to remember that because I'm doing a big training next week as you know. I'm going to say all these to these doctors and nurses, all you got to do is be a loving rock. I like it a lot. Yeah, so the structure of practices, but the most powerful practice field in Hinduism and Buddhism is practice in the charnel ground. You know, practice in the charnel ground. Oh, yeah. And that means, you know, going into the graveyard, but the graveyard is actually everywhere. Yeah. You know, you don't have to go to Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah to get it or to Mount Kailash to the charnel grounds there. Right. I mean, the charnel ground is right here in this very moment. And so the powerful thing is to practice with what is just this moment as it is. And yet what R.D. is suggesting for me makes the most sense because mostly we're delusional in the midst of this immediate reality. We just don't get it at all. Yes. So we have to put ourselves in a privileged situation and that privileged situation is to enter into the mystery of the dying. Beautiful. That's beautiful. And I just want to say that when you get into spirituality, truth, truth, truth, truth, you talk about truth, you want truth, you want to find truth. And then when you finally get truth in that moment of watching your parent's mouth open and they're going into nothingness, it's not pleasant. The feeling is not the truth. I think in especially in Buddhism and especially in Zen Buddhism, that truth is such a... I'm trying to think of the way to put it. It feels like I've gotten something in my brain that my brain can't digest and it creates this sort of discombobulation that has driven me so crazy that I've ended up at Ram Dass's house. See how lucky you are? You got the booby prize. He's booby Ram Dass. No, sorry. Sorry, RD, I just couldn't help it. So both of you are advising. It sounds like you're both advising volunteering with a hospice or with a... I don't think you have to even volunteer with an institution. Try your neighbor. Try your mother. Dying is all around us. So you don't have to go very far. Read them newspapers. Right. You know what Chandru Tupa Rinpoche said? He's gone, but he said... I said, Rinpoche, why do you watch television? He said, I love watching TV. And I said, why do you love watching TV? And he said, it's the best thing to practice with that I could ever have imagined when I was living in Tibet. I couldn't imagine something like this. The first time I saw TV, I looked around the back because I saw these little people on this screen. Then I realized that it was all fabrication. It was just light dancing. And then I realized, well, that's no different than reality. Wow. Well, that's what I feel like. We are in a kind of pixelated world. It's like sitting in front of your computer screen. You think, oh, this is one model of one reality. That's very interesting. There's another one, equally pixelated. And I think you said nothingness. That is my world. After death is far more than nothingness. It's love. It's spirit. All you do is go to the light. Even our souls, pardon me. Maybe we should explain Duncan. He and I have had a long series of disappointing discussions on the nature of souls. But go ahead, Rambas. The next week's podcast. Well, the soul is light and consciousness, all these things. And it's much bigger. The bigger span of seeing things is bigger than we are. And when you go into this graduate course. This is the graduate course. And we are our souls just going from incarnation to incarnation to incarnation to incarnation. And these are just courses. And so we are all courses in learning how to stay learning from our karma. To stay out from our karma. And we are all in the learning period. That's what physical reality is. You have to learn the soul wants to find out about separateness. Because once you get out into the soul, there's no separateness. There's light, but dying. When you go into the expanded universe, it's a relief. In that learning experience, all kinds of family and economics and all that. But the soul has the learning from this and this and this. And this is only one incarnation. And that's all of the incarnations. And we are souls taking a certain learning experience. And we take ourselves so seriously. What would you call that thing? I'm just not going to get into it. Please stop me if I'm wrong, but obviously in comparison to Hiroshi, my tiny understanding of Buddhism is that there is no permanence in anything in any way at all. The notion that there's some spiritual structure that somehow retains its form perpetually for eternity is an impossible thing. That there's only this wave form that's constantly transforming itself into the various phenomena that we happen to be in this one momentary bit of time. In that moment, the neurology breaks down. We continue on, but not as some personified soul, but rather the slow disintegration of our atomic particles into infinity. Well? You're an incredible Dharma teacher. Guru. We call him Guru. I think it says Rondas' version is a much more pleasant version than many versions that are round. But from my point of view, it's a mystery. I can only say that it's a matter of various forms of speculation. And there are some speculations that I like better than others. And I love Rondas' speculation. I love the notion of having my final exhale carrying me into unmediated, unfiltered brilliance, into vast luminosity. I mean, that's a fantastic vision. And that's not a vision that is actually apart from certain Buddhist schools. It relates very much, for example, to the Tibetan Buddhist school, where the continuity of the subtle mind is projected through various bardos. Right. But, you know, I don't know. And that's where I live, really, in the not knowing. But we don't know. It's all fantasy. Thank you so much. You finally have shared my opinion. After decades of discussion about this very subject, we finally are aligned. I live in my fantasy. And I live in my fantasy. And sometimes our fantasies converge, like right now. I feel so relieved. You know, I think we ought to end this on a high note, because I see the pie. The raw pies are coming. Let's wrap it up. Thank you both. Thank you so much. Not just for this podcast, but for so many other things. You called it a podcast. It's a podcast now. Thank you. And Roshi, thank you so much. Where can people find you? You should come.

Sweet friends, it is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Ducatrussell Family Hour podcast. And I'm not one of those people who talks about the awards they get. If I did, I wouldn't have time to do the podcast, because I'm constantly getting awards. Bulldozers bring huge scoops of awards to my house and just dump them in the front yard. We sift through them. But man, I got to talk about this one. We just got the Frank Lloyd You're All Right Award from the Frank Lloyd Wright Podcast Association. And you guys know what this means to me. I've been dreaming of getting this award for so long. So to the Frank Lloyd Wright Society, I thank you. And most importantly, I thank you for this beautiful note that you wrote for me, and for the listeners of the podcast, and for the entire planet, and for all sentient beings in the known universe. I'm just going to read it to you guys right now. Dear all sentient beings in the known universe, this is just a quick reminder from the Frank Lloyd Wright Society that you are all right, just like you are right now. And if you forget this, you can start feeling a little gloomy. But even worse, you could start treating the people around you like they're not all right. And this makes everything all wrong. So please, as much as you can, whenever you can, remind yourself that you're just a little baby compared to the universe, and that everybody else is a little baby too. And most importantly, that the Frank Lloyd Wright Society loves you. And the only thing left between eternal paradise and what is currently happening is that tiny little block you call your identity. So let go of it, and merge with the universe so that we can enter into the next phase of planetary and cosmic evolution, known as the Age of Aquarius, or the coming of the Metrea. Much love to you and your listeners. Sincerely, Gerald Flonk from the Frank Lloyd Wright Society. Isn't that beautiful? What a cool little note. Thank you so much, Gerald Flonk. And much love to you and to your celestial family. Boy, do we have a great podcast for you today. Kyle Kingsbury is here. Holy shit. And now a word from our sponsors.

You're going to hear this is a long podcast. And part of the reason it's so long is because Kyle started talking about his polyamorous marriage with his wonderful wife, Natasha. And listening to him talk about it sort of stirred some stuff up for me and made me think, whoa, oh my god, it wasn't that long ago that I was doing the same thing. And also sort of like me thinking like, whoa, right now we're monogamous. What's it going to be like if we decide not to be at some point? And then me wondering about that and sort of not quite having the guts that I should have as a podcast host to just say that out loud. So I'm sorry for that. And I'm doing this preface in case you hear some weirdness as I'm chatting with him that sounds like I'm judging him because I certainly was not. He and Natasha are sweethearts. And I fully respect what they're doing. And I fully respect however people want to structure their relationships. It's a very personal thing. And it really is nobody's business anyway. But because I publicly was blowing the polyamory horn for a while, which is a little embarrassing. I mean, you know what it's like when a polyamory horn blasts all over your face publicly. You're just like, damn it. It's nice, but you think, shit, maybe I should have blown the horn privately. Regardless, I didn't follow Robert Anton Wilson's advice when it came to polyamory, which is he didn't say this about polyamory. He said about magic and the occult. But the idea is maintain a certain level of agnosticism. Becoming a true believer can be a pretty embarrassing decision if you don't fully understand that thing which you are claiming to believe. So I didn't do that. That's OK. I'm not going to beat myself up about it. But regardless, I just wanted to do this little preface so that you guys understand that I fully 100% respect anybody who decides to have that kind of relationship. And I also respect anybody who decides not to. It's your business. If you want to dress up like pilgrims and spank each other night and day, that's your business. You get to do that. If you want to take combats with your best friends and as long as everyone's happy with your decision, then do it. And if you feel like having a classical, monogamous relationship, just sitting on the couch and watching TVs and falling asleep on top of each other, that's fine too. Especially if you let me sit in the corner and watch as you sleep. Speaking of sleep, how'd you sleep last night? Did you wake up in the middle of the night with every muscle in your body simultaneously spasming while you projectile vomited and screamed? Are your tear ducts projectile vomiting tears at night as you sleep? Do you wake up in the morning with your hands backwards and your head crooked around like some kind of horrific scare crow, someone perched in a cursed forest? That's because your mattress is too old. You've got a bad mattress. You got conned. There's no reason to hold on to that thing just because you spent $19,000 of it because somebody told you it was stuffed with angel hair. There's no reason to feel ashamed because three months later, the center of the mattress caved in. There's no reason to feel awful because that super expensive mattress that you bought stinks of the belches of some ancient dead thing that an explorer dug up in a forbidden cave. If you're struggling to get a good night's sleep, you got to try a purple mattress. The founders of Purple are two brothers who have been developing cushioning technology for 30 years on things like medical beds and wheelchairs. These wonderful purple mattresses are made from a brand new material that was developed by an actual rocket scientist. This is not like normal memory foam, friends. This stuff was created in a laboratory by a rocket scientist. God knows what he went through to create these mattresses. You know what happens to these scientists? They open portals. They see things. They can't unsee. Many of them go mad, claw their eyeballs out. Some of them jump out of the windows of skyscrapers. They're hair on fire. But fortunately for us, this wonderful scientist managed to bring this material into this dimension from a more comfortable place. And because of that, we now have purple mattresses. The purple material feels very unique because it's both firm and soft at the same time. So it keeps everything supported while still feeling really comfortable. Plus it's breathable, so it sleeps cool. You're not gonna wake up feeling like you're laying on a dog tongue. 100 night risk-free trial. If you're not fully satisfied, you can return your mattress for a full refund. It's backed by a 10-year warranty and there are free shippings and returns. You're gonna love purple. And right now, our listeners will get a free purple pillow with the purchase of a mattress. That's in addition to the great free gifts they're offering site-wide. Just text Duncan to 797979, the only way to get this free pillow is to text Duncan to 797979. That's D-U-N-C-A-N, to 797979. Message and data rates may apply. Why couldn't they have gotten 696969? 7979 works though, guys. Get yourself a new mattress. There's no reason for you to be laying on that thing you stuffed with dead carcasses you found at the beach. It's time to upgrade. Go purple. Much thanks to my Patreon subscribers.

Now, without further ado, today's guest is a mixed martial arts champion. If you are a fan of the UFC, you know him. You've probably seen him on the Ultimate Fighter, but of course, he's not just a fighter. That just happens to be something that he does. He's also a profoundly deep, psychonaut, and philosopher, and it was a real honor to get to have this conversation with him. So without further ado, everybody please extend your astral probisci and blast out that sweet tasting rainbow mucus through the etheric clouds that connect us all. And welcome to the DTFH, today's guest, Kyle Kingsbury. All right, Kyle, thank you so much for being on the DTFH. I have been looking forward to this for a while. I'm honored by your presence here. You are a real glowing sort of person. It's cool to have a person like that in your house. And one of the things, it sounds negative, but I don't mean that in a negative way, but sometimes I feel like, am I doing a podcast or am I just trapping cool people temporarily? You know what I mean? Like as I get to be here. So it's really cool to have you here. Hello. Hello. I wanted to talk to you, and I'm sorry if it seems a little obvious or maybe even hacky to start an interview off like this, but I wanna talk to you about being a warrior. You're a fighter. You have fought in the UFC. You've been in front of the world, crushing people and being crushed. Yes. And so I wanna talk to you about what, these days, everyone seems kind of like they're analyzing masculinity. And it's an important thing to think about masculinity and femininity, because these are the sort of yin and yang, so to speak, of our society, you know? And so people seem to be taking a look at like the fundamental qualities that make us what we are, at least currently. In this time in history. So what is a warrior? That's a great question. I think Aubrey would answer that better than I would. And also, forgive me, is a warrior necessarily, obviously a warrior isn't masculine or feminine? No, not at all. And we, I mean, I think the thing to be mindful of as we talk about masculinity and femininity is, there is the divine masculine and the divine feminine. And that's what we're shooting for. And then there's the unconscious masculine that we see in politics and patriarchal societies and the unconscious feminine, where it's a victim mentality and things of that nature. So there is a difference between the two. I think being a warrior is mostly about constantly working on yourself. And it doesn't matter if you're a warrior poet, like Aubrey, where you're doing the work and then trying to be able to express yourself in a way where it touches people, or if you're literally trying to beat the shit out of somebody, or if you're going into true battle and putting your life on the line in defense of your country or in defense of an ideal, those all those archetypes of warrior come down to self-work and really just getting through the bullshit, weeding through that. So you can come to a place where you have a quiet mind, you're still in your calm in the face of adversity. This description is, that was a great description. And when, you know, having, you know, been friends with Rogan long enough to get to be friends with people like you, I've been around like men who are like dangerous in the real, in a real way, like people who have trained for years and can kill, you could kill me if you wanted to, real fast. You know how to do it, you've trained. And anytime I've been around people like you, the quality is the opposite of what normal, like what gets put out there is like, here's what, you know, like if you're watching some kind of like, I don't know, if you're watching like Predator, you know, the way those kinds of heroes act, they're kind of surly and mean and shit. This stuff will make you a sexual tyrannosaurus. Yeah, dude. That thing, grumpy, kind of like shitty, kind of like cruel, never like that. Always what is always fascinating about it is that it's, if you hang out with like Hari Krishnas, if you hang out with monks, if you hang out with people who have like a renunciate life, they have a similar energy, which is this kind of sweet, calm openness. Can you talk a little bit about what that is and why you have that versus why when you run to someone who's pretending to be dangerous, it seems to be the opposite energy? Yeah, I think, you know, truly for people who do the work and actually get into the sport of mixed martial arts or go deep into Jujitsu, the main difference is between that and somebody who's just trying it out or going to a couple of evening classes a week but has every tap out shirt. The difference would be that you've been tested so many times and you've tapped out so many times that even if you're one of the best black belts in the world in Jujitsu or you've fought in the UFC for 10 years and you have a wealth of experience, you've been humbled time and time again and you realize that at any given point, I can be the guy on top or I can, I can be the hammer or I can be the nail. Right. And so having gone through those experiences, especially like, I mean, it was peaks and valleys when I fought, I had four fight win streak, two fight of the night victories, a 30 second knockout, three 30 second knockouts and under 30 and I finished my last four fights getting my ass kicked. I left with my tail in between my legs and two of those fights were in San Jose in my hometown at the Shark Tank. So incredibly humbling experiences and I think the people that actually do the work, they no longer have a chip on their shoulder. You know, like whatever that thing is, that angst that we have as young men or even young women who feel like we've been wronged or there's something not right with the world today, we can have a chip on our shoulder in life. We can be not quite relaxed in every situation but I think when you put yourself in harms away and you do it purposely and you do it mindfully where you're actually trying to stay calm in the storm, whether that's a cold bath or fighting in front of 20,000 people and millions more on TV, like that mindset actually is a trainable thing. And when you get through that, it allows you just quiet's the noise of life. It turns the volume down on all the other bullshit. Similar to a deep psychedelic journey, somebody cuts you off in traffic after you got back from Peru to an ayahuasca, it's okay, go ahead, you must need to be there sooner than I do. It's no big deal, right? It just turns down the volume on all the bullshit in life. Is it like, is it, is your fear diminished? Do you think it has something to do with a reduction in fear? Is it that, to me, you know, losing a fight or even getting punched, but certainly getting punched publicly and certainly getting punched publicly in your hometown. It's certainly, all of those things, it's a kind of apocalypse almost. It's like, you know, when people put in front of you, like, what do you not wanna have happen, right? That's definitely one of the things you wouldn't wanna have happen. Right under that ice bath. There's a good, I'm glad you bring them both up because they both suck. So is it because, like, I've experienced defeat and I got up after it and I'm okay now. Is that what it is that you realize that winning or losing, is it that it's kind of like a fog? Is it an illusion? Is winning and losing sort of just an illusion? Well, I mean, certainly if you're trying to climb the ladder and that's the thing that you care about the most, it fucking matters. And whatever we put that meaning attached to it, then that really does matter. And some losses were harder than others for me. I think by the time I was willing to transition away from fighting, it was no longer the most important thing in my life. And psychedelics had come in and I was getting new lessons. And I don't think you ever really get rid of fear. And Rogan's talked a bit about this too. Like if you go into a fight and you're not nervous, that means, A, you don't respect your opponent and B, you're probably gonna get your ass kicked. Like you can't go in there sleeping thinking this is just gonna be a little patty cake fucking pillow fight. Like you're gonna get hit in the face. You can get knocked out, you can get hurt. So having a healthy amount of nerves without fighting scared because that stiffens you and without fighting angry is that stiffens you and you wanna be like water. You know, that's Bruce Lee. So as in life where we have Wu Wei and this ever flowing dance, like that's what you try to accomplish in the fight as well. Tell me about that state of consciousness right before you start fighting. Well, you mean like my state of consciousness before I started my fight career or like literally right before I go in the cage door shots? Literally right before. So I never mastered this by the way. There was, I think like maybe two out of 17 or 18 fights where I was in a flow state with a quiet mind and 100% present. Most of the time I had a lot of negative mind chatter. You know, there was, oh, well, this guy's so good at that. And look at, he's probably put 20 pounds on back after the weight cut. He's so yoked and oh, he's so good at this and I'm thinking about his strengths and I'm not, you know, or we get into it. If I have a quiet mind, but if I start losing the fight then in certain fights I've had the negative mind come in and just be like, oh, you're gonna lose this round. You just got taken down again instead of let me just focus on what I need to do right now. Like Paul Selig says, what is the lesson of the day? It's whatever's right in front of you, right? So if I gotta get back to my feet, that's all I need to think about. How do I get back to my feet? I just got taken down, that's it. I don't need to attach, I'm losing this round or any other fucking story to that, you know? Right, that story is, because in such an extreme situation I imagine that any energy that is moving through you needs to be directed at the task at hand. Any energy being directed at telling a story, simulating the possibility of defeat, even if it's a millisecond, that could have been energy that was going into whatever the zillions of processes that must be happening when you're involved in something that is so intense. And so is this as your training to learn how to do this activity, is there a mind training that gets involved in the physical training? Yeah, I had, I mean, experiences is the best teacher for sure and getting used to being punched in the face. Like there's some people that never crossed that barrier. There's a lot of high level wrestlers that come into the sport or high level jujutsu guys that come into the sport and they can't cross that barrier. But once you get comfortable being hit and you start to be able to move, then it allows you to see more. It opens up your visionary field. Why, now this is gonna sound like a really dumb question and it is, but maybe, I don't know. But tell me, why is it so much more intense to get punched in the face than it is to get punched in the arm or the stomach or the kicks? I think it's just jolting, you know? I mean, there's been plenty of times I've been hit in the face in fights. I've had my left eye fractured twice. I've had my jaw broken in two places. My nose has been busted. But every time I've been hit in the face, it didn't hurt. It was just like, whoa, don't let that happen again. Like when the second you get dazed or dizzyed, you realize like that's just a little bit more and I'll be asleep, right? So like we have a, it's, there's a higher degree of shit. Don't let that happen. Is it so, man, again, like you have to understand, man, obviously I'm not a fighter. I'm not Rogan, Rogan, I got lucky. He takes me on the road with him and sometimes I get these insane like emperor level seats at the UFC, you know, and I'd sit there and get to enjoy these fights. But the sad thing about it is I'm watching them from the perspective of a complete non-athlete, right? Like someone who, you know what I mean? Who doesn't know the tech, not that I didn't appreciate it. You know what I mean? And certainly like one thing I learned right away, the difference between watching a fight on TV and watching it right next to the ring, what do you call it? The octagon, Rogan. It's all the frickin' thing. Watching it right next to the octagon. As you watch on TV, you see someone get punched on TV and you're like, whatever, that's just a little like tap. I wish they'd really start fighting. When you're sitting there, you every single one of those punches is, it's the kind of thing that I would wake up at night screaming if someone punched me like that once, you know? It's like, there's so, it's so shockingly violent. It's so shockingly intense. And then on top of that, you realize like, my, these fucking, these are like super athletes or something, like they are every single level of who they are and what they are is somehow trained to not only to do this, but quite often after it's over, they hug each other for real. And that was always shocking to me. But you have to understand, I don't understand it outside of just the way like when I'm watching football and I'm like, well, that's something you can do. And that's crazy the capacity that humans have within them. That's insane to me. So forgive my questions, okay? This isn't like, obviously we're not on ESPN. But there are real questions I have when I watch these fights and I'm excited to ask you about them. And I want to talk about psychedelics. So if you would humor me with letting me ask you a few more questions, thank you, I appreciate that. Okay, so here's the first question that I've been dying to ask you. When you went a fight within 30 seconds and you've been training for how long for that? Eight weeks, 10 weeks. 10 weeks. And you went a fight in 30 seconds. Is there like, I know this sounds like a dumb question, a kind of weird sense of like almost disappointment or something. Bittersweet, 100%. Whoa. There's been, I mean, in anything, in any fight camp, you're working on the strategy of what you're gonna do in that particular fight. So if the guy's really good on the ground, I'm working on takedown defense, keeping it standing, things like that. And then constantly learning new skills. You want to acquire new things and evolve because the sport's evolving rapidly. Right. I remember the first time I won a fight in 26 seconds, I had a new striking coach and we had been working out so much on the jab and so much on leg kicks and body kicks and Muay Thai. And we had like one exchange and I need the guy in the stomach and it was over. And I was like, fuck man, I didn't get to fucking use any of this stuff that we've been working on for the last eight weeks. And he's like, that's all right, it's better. We'll go back to the drawing board, we'll continue to polish those skills and the good news is nobody's seen that advancement yet. They haven't seen your game change. So you'll still have that going forward. People won't be worried about it. But it's funny how the human mind works because it doesn't matter how good you win or how fast you win or how many people see it, there's always more to want and always more to try to gain and achieve when it comes to things like that. Wow, cool. Okay, cool, that, cause I kind of like was tracking that a little bit on fighters, it's like, they seem a little, like there's a little flicker of something and I get it cause you don't get to show off. You don't get to do the dance. You were looking forward to doing this thing and you don't get to. Wow, okay, cool. Okay, now here's my last question about fighting. There's a phenomena that I've heard of. I've never experienced, I've never been on this a night show but I've heard about this thing post tonight show depression or like some comedians spend all, you know, like finally get to do their set on TV and they're like driving home and they've just, you know, now they're home, you gotta brush your teeth, maybe get some, you know, have a little night snack. Your couch is the same couch it was before. Maybe look at your phone, people are texting you but a real sense of like depression can sink in where this great thing that you'd been working towards happened in the moments after were not the victory march. Where there was no confetti, there is no angelic trumpets. You're just yourself still and the finish line that you'd created for yourself is behind you now and now what? Is there something like that that happens with fighting? I think it can, it didn't work out that way for me and there's a couple of reasons that I'll dive into on that. I think, you know, yeah, if someone wins a gold medal and that's their fucking lifelong dream and they accomplish that, there can be like, well, shit, what now? I gotta wait four years till the next Olympics. Do I come back to this? Is this something I wanna continue? Excuse me. For me, I didn't have that. I had that at the end of football. So I finished football at Arizona State and I was, I went through the deepest depression of my life. Attempted suicide, just all bad. And I talk a bit about this on the solo podcast, episode 12 in the human optimization hour so people can dive into that if they wanna hear my walk through that time in my life. Once I got to the end of fighting, I had different tools and thankfully I had a boxing coach who was Native American. He would take me to the reservation in Northern California and we do traditional sweat lodges. Oftentimes with psilocybin. And later on, he introduced ayahuasca into my life and that just changed the scope of things. How did he become, how did this person, what's his name? Huizzi, he's passed away, but most people have seen him. You've probably seen him at the UFC. He was very short, long hair and he had, he had a giant turquoise necklace that he would always wear. He was a cut man for the UFC. How did you end up with him as your teacher? He was a boxing coach at American Kickboxing Academy in San Jose. Did you know when you started working with him that he was also, he had the spiritual, the medicine? Nope, no idea. And it's funny because my dad knew and my dad told him, hey, at some point will you guide my son through his first visionary work? And he said, yeah, for sure. And so I think two years later, we had done a number of sweat lodges without medicine. And I was like, yo coach, when are we gonna use La Medicina? You know, and he just started busting up laughing. And he said, I've just been waiting for you to ask. Let's do it. Wow. And from that point on, we would do ceremonies before the fight camp started, and then at the end of the, after the fight for healing reflection and letting go of the shit that no longer served us. What was the, if like you were forced to put his teachings into chapters of a book, what would the first chapter be? I think a lot of the teachings in the first chapter would be on gratitude for the earth, like a deeper understanding. And that's something that's been shown to me through the plants, especially with ayahuasca, is like this love for our mother. And we're not separate from this thing. You know, like we have this idea in the West that God has dominion over all the plants and animals and we're fucking separate and we're not primates and we're not animals and we're also not in nature. So we can fuck with nature and try to manipulate it to our liking and we can figure it out better than this giant organism that we're a part of, as opposed to like this is a concert and we're one note within the whole thing. And it's not separate. And I think that would be probably one of the first things gone over in a deep way is just this whole different way to look at reality, where we live, what we're on, this giant thing that's alive and conscious. Did he have any kind of stories that he repeated or any kind of sayings that he repeated over time? Mm, none that are coming to mind right now. I mean, he would, I mean, certainly the Tim has called, he would pour sweat similar to the Lakota tradition. We would have four rounds, seven rocks each round and each round represented a different prayer round. What did you call that? You said that something called the Tim has call. How do you, 10 minutes? What is it called? Tim has, Tim has call. Oh, Tim has call. Yeah. Like what does that mean? Like the street, that's a sweat lodge. Oh. Yeah. And there's different forms in Anipi is another type of sweat. Got it. Okay. So the Tim has call is what we would do. And each round you would have a different focus on the prayer round. So one would be on the earth itself. One would be on our ancestors who have passed on. One would be on those people or more anything that is suffering right now that needs help and needs love and needs some direction of consciousness and energy. And then, you know, self reflection. What are the things we wish to call into our life? And the idea basically is that that is one of the highest forms of prayer because you're, you're doing the work here. It's not easy to sit through a sweat lodge. You're physically dumping sweat and tears and breath into this place. Tears. Tears, the womb. Yeah, there are a lot of people. I've cried a lot of times in the sweat lodge, for sure. Did you, was this with the medicine or even before the medicine you had started? Before the medicine, for sure. Talk about, can you tell me what inspired those tears if you feel comfortable talking about it? Of course, you can ask me anything. I think the first time I cried in a sweat lodge it was during the Mother Earth's round and we were really diving in. And I hadn't had any of the downloads from ayahuasca on everything we do to the earth that's not in harmony. But he opened it up to our actual physical mothers. And I had just fucking floodgates open up, thinking about my mom's life, her struggles growing up. And she's fairly open about this, but my grandfather was a molester, just hard, really hard stuff. And then seeing her transition from completely mindless living to getting clean and welcoming in spirituality and doing the healing work and really seeing that whole arch of her life with just complete gratitude and compassion and being blown the fuck away by it. It was a powerful experience to see that whole arch of her life like that. That is amazing that you got to see that happen. That doesn't always happen. No. But it can happen. And if it can happen in that way, do you think it can also happen on the planetary scale in the sense that what you just described in some ways you could say is mirrored in the way that so many people treat the earth right now. And there's a sense of complete disconnect from the planet. People don't even think about it. They don't even think about it. They don't think about the ground. A great many people walk on the earth every single day and they don't think about the way their feet feel touching the ground. It hasn't crossed their mind in years. Just that, the simple connective pull, the sense of being held. So I think probably because of that, since you don't think about it. Oh, we do all these things. Like we go from a box called a house with rubber shoes on to our cars and other box to our office and other box. We're disconnected from the sun. We're disconnected from, we can't see the stars anymore because of lights. And there is a disconnect. I mean, a lot of the messages from the medicine have been to reconnect to nature, to not only to be in nature, but to connect to the seasons, to know what time of year it is, connect to the lunar cycle, to be out on a fucking full moon. Not just to say, oh, hey, tomorrow's a full moon or full moon and I'm gonna be watching Seinfeld all night. It's like, no, let's go outside, let's experience this. Let's go for a walk at night and take our sun out and just really soak in that energy because there is a lot of energy coming through on a full moon. But that connection and also with the walking, like take your fucking shoes off. You gotta get grounded. And walking meditation has been for sure one of the biggest game changers that I've done and implemented it in my life because it's, there's movement there, you know? Like I think, I'm sure you know more about this than I do, but there's in yoga, right? There's four parts to yoga. We only think of yoga in the physical expression. Like, oh, yoga, yeah, I'll go to fucking Bikram and that'll be it. Whereas the idea is that you would go through the physical and then these other pieces and you get to a place where you can meditate and have communion with the divine. Most people that jump into meditation, they haven't done yoga or any other physical form of expression to move that energy and stickiness out of their body. So when they sit, they're like, I can't fucking sit still. Right? I can't sit with this anxiety. I can't sit with this emotion in my fucking quads, right? So I think a beautiful bridge and certainly for me, if I know that I only have 20 minutes, I'm just gonna hit a walking meditation. I might put binaural beats in. I might just listen to nature or listen to cars, whatever that is, just follow my breath and feel each step as I walk. But in that, I feel so much better. Like it is instant gratification, instant quiet mind. Yes. Well, I mean, this is like, you know, it's, I think the problem there's, if there is a problem or the confusion or the distortion is that so many truths have been co-opted by corporations and then used and essentially like they, a lot of big, big businesses take essential truths and they attach their brand to the essential truth in the way like parasites attach themselves to big things in the ocean. And so they'll take a thing like, well, the earth is our mother and they'll put it all over their cups or something. You know, they'll put it all over this or that or all over the place. And suddenly everywhere you're looking, you see the earth is our mother, the earth is our mother. You hear this shit all over the place. And then you could become cynical within that because you look at, you look at maybe someone who's bellowing out the earth as your mother and you're like, well, if the earth is your mother, your mother's an idiot because you seem like an asshole. Yeah, it was fucking quack. Yeah, you quack. I'm not interested anymore. And so then you stop thinking about it when you, even though this is a thing that has been, your teacher taught you in a beautiful way, by like, well, forget the whole earth as your mother thing. What about your mother as your mother? Okay, well, that's for a lot of us is gonna activate a whole nother series of like problems. If you have a difficult relationship with your mother or something like that. So now you're like, great. So the earth is like somebody you wish you wanted me to be like a doctor. Is that it? The earth, well, you know, instead of as a- Never let me follow my dreams. Yeah, yeah. Earth forced me into a desk job, but I hate. Yeah, the earth went through my drawers. Yeah, that's it. Earth went through my drawers looking for marijuana when I was 14 and then call the cops. And they, like, so even there are, because of like, maybe because the time we're in, the relationship with our mothers has become distorted. You know, and with good reason, it's like, if you look at the, you know, current trends, I was just watching morning news and there was a story on how in California they might start giving mothers 12 weeks off work, which is great. 12 weeks off work. You get 12 weeks off work. So that's great, but it ain't that great. That's just 12 weeks. So now you're 12 week old, what happens? He can drive. He'll make his way to the grocery store. He'll be prepping dinner by the time you get home, he'll have a hot meal waiting for you. You better spend six of those weeks teaching him how to use the microwave. And like, you know, so within, and because we're the way things are these days, both parents now have to go to work. And so some of us have broken families in the sense that there aren't, there isn't a bigger, larger family structure to take care of the child. And so now you're in a situation where both parents have to go to work. The baby then gets put in a daycare center. Yeah, you have to outsource who raises your own child. Yes, and the child's encounters with the mother are with someone who is very stressed out because the mother wants to do what mothers do or the father wants to do what fathers do. Both parents love the baby and want the baby to be okay. But the paradox is they can't be around the baby because they want the baby to be okay. And so they're having to work. So we have this distorted sense of connection not just with the earth, but with the feminine, with our mother. And so now we have all these interesting problems that seem to be directly related to this distortion that's happening right now. I mean, I'm just figuring out how dumb I am by... Only now do I realize. Every day with my wife and my child is like, just a dawning. And it sounds like I'm beating myself up, but I don't feel, I'm embarrassed, but I'm not beating myself up. It's a good kind of, it's like, it's not quite getting beat up on TV. But it's still humbling, right? It's very, yeah. Yeah, and also all this, I've been at a podcast for so long and so many times I've emphatically said things based on nothing other than a real demented confidence coming from nothing more than like nothing and judgment and all this stuff. So every single day I get this like lesson in what a mother does, what makes milk, gives milk to... My wife is making milk that the baby is eating. And also the way that she's holding and holding the baby and loving the baby and the way that she's somehow simultaneously loving me, which is pretty impressive in this incident. Like I'm not some tiny little coal of pure love, you know? Pudgy got a beard, I stink most of the time. So what I'm saying is many of us don't even understand what a mother is. And because of that, how can we understand what the earth is? And somewhere in there where we've lost the story. And then from within that, suddenly it's like, you know what, fuck it. Just throw the fucking bag out the window. You know what I mean? Or even worse, fuck it. Let's build a oil tanker that might leak into the, you know what, fuck it. Let's build a nuclear reactor next to the ocean. Let's just do that. A nuclear reactor, we're gonna build nuclear, put nuclear energy right next to the, essentially the one of the, like the juggler vein of the planet. And just hope there isn't a hurricane. Let's hope there's not an earthquake. Let's hope something doesn't go wrong and radioactive material gets in the sea. And so as a species, not all of us, certainly not you, but me to some degree, hopefully not too much. And many more of us to some degree have been abusing our mothers and our mother got sick. And so to hear you talk about your mother and seeing her getting better again, makes me feel a little hopeful. And so forgive that long ramble. My question is, do you think if it happens on the small scale with some mothers and some people, it can happen on the global scale? Is it just a hippie dream that there is the potential for some kind of healing of the planet? I don't think that's a hippie dream. I mean, I think there's, everything starts with the small. It's all, it's all with what's in front of you, like I was saying with the selling quote. One of my favorite quotes from football, and I forget who said it might have been Vince Lombardi, but it goes inch by inch, life's a cinch, but yard by yard, life is hard. Wow, cool. So it is very much about how we inch forward and what are the little things, the little steps we take each day, right? And then how we view the world, it's our perspective, and that's the beauty of psychedelics is that we can see with new eyes and from different angles, right? I think as we look at our mothers in any relationship for that matter that has a deep family history, and I, of course, you know this, but I remember Ram Dass saying, if you think you've become enlightened, spend a week with your family, right? So generally that's because you have such a long-standing history with those people, but if you view it, one of the ways you can have a perspective shift, and I learned this from a woman named Anahata out of Sedona, is to say who is my greatest teacher? And it's not to look at that person as the person who taught you the most good, it's the person who taught you the most period. And oftentimes, there's a lot of bad shit that they did to you that you can learn from, that I learned this is what I'm not gonna do to my son, this is how I'm not going to speak to people, this is how I'm not gonna treat my partner, right? That's the greatest teacher, and when you view it from there, from that lens, it makes a little more sense, because you're like, oh shit, and then you have this idea, this level of compassion, where you realize everybody is doing the best with what they can. And I don't know if this is the case for you, but when I had my son three and a half years ago, I looked at my wife like, I'm a fucking kid raising a kid. I am a child still, raising a child, and I'm 36 now, and we're working on number two, and I, in a lot of ways, still feel like a fucking big kid, right? But what that did for me is it was like, oh shit, my mom was 20. My dad was the same age as me. They were kids. They didn't know any better. They were doing the best. There is no fucking manual, right? Then they just unpacked a lot of the shit, right? Total forgiveness and total compassion for the fear that they lived in and the pain and struggles they had. Wow, that's great. That's great. Yeah, that's good. Wow, I gotta think about that. Huh, it's alchemy. It's some kind of alchemy. It's like, okay, yeah. So many of us have a person in our lives that we have a difficult connection with, and sometimes to the point where we can't talk to them anymore. We can't be around them anymore, and yet we're still connected. There's no way, that's the problem. You know, for example, I think of Sheila Maylux, you know her? Exactly. You never think about her. I just made her up. She never crosses your mind. Your boy Tyler, you were talking about with Daniel Miller, fuck Tyler. That's it. You know, that's how you can understand about connections that you have with people. Cause just think about Sheila Maylux. If there is a Sheila Maylux out there, I'm sorry. She's fucking pissed. She was a huge fan of the show until now. It'd be funny though if she's actually an asshole, and somebody's like, yeah, she's a bitch. She burnt my church down. But the point is like, some people they're like, well, I don't see that person anymore. I don't talk to them anymore. So it's done. No it isn't. Every single day feel the tug of that connection. It's in you still. You feel that weird pull. It's so, it's a lot of energy being put into that connection. And so usually the connection is being empowered by delusion because you think the person is evil. So in your mind, you're like, well, this is a, this is a fucking monster. Like we were just watching this crazy documentary that's now on Netflix about Ted Bundy. Oh, I wanted to see that. We were just touchless flipping through Netflix. And I was like, fuck yeah, we got to see this. It's pretty good, man. And it's like, I was watching it kind of, and suddenly I realized like, oh, Ted Bundy's like an AI in the sense that he's saying things that seem to just be like sentences he's picked up from different places. But it's like, he's like a praying maness or something. There doesn't seem to be anything in there. And yeah, there's a disconnect behind the eyes. Yeah, yeah, just a shell of, I don't know what it is. Like a talking wasper. I don't even want to insult wasps. Just like a, you know, like sometimes someone's walking under a high rise and a piece of ice breaks off and hits the person in the head and they die. It's like if that piece of ice could talk, it would just, you know what I mean? He would say all the nice things. Yeah, it might do just whatever it heard on the street. It might say stuff like, yeah, you know, that was the time in my life where I wanted to continue to be a bachelor. You know, he's saying weird shit that like you're on dating shows or something, but it doesn't feel like there's anything there except these cobbled together personality. And Aaron was like, and I'm like, I don't think there's anything there. And she's like, no, he's, you know, he's evil. He's evil. And I was thinking like it would be easier if you were evil because then we could punish him. And now we have a thing to like attack. And we can, if we can get rid of this evil, then we've gotten rid of a little bit of the evil in the world and we've done something good. But more sinister is like, no, he's not evil or good. He's just the same thing as when there's a mudslide. Just a collision of genetics and bad timing that ended up getting a lot of people killed in a lot of horrific ways, right? That's Ted Bundy. So if I think of the people in my life that I have negative connections with and realize that they're not who I think they are. And I know that because I barely know who I am. If I barely know who I am, how the fuck do I know who anybody else is, right? I have no idea. And if I don't know who anybody else is, then how can I be mad at them? This is the Ramdha story. You know the boat story? Guy's rowing his boat on a foggy morning and another boat smashes into the side of his boat. And he's like, what's wrong with you? Watch where you're going. And the fog clears and there's nobody in the boat. It was just a boat drifting across the river. No one in the boat, you know. So this is good because this produces spaciousness, right? That what you're telling me, it's cool. I'm thinking about, I'm like, oh, I get it. So number one, whoever I'm pissed off at, they're not even who I think they are. But number two, the imaginary sock puppet I made up for the person I'm pissed off at, that's my guru. And it's teaching me how not to be, how not to act. And suddenly I've converted a rotten connection into the most powerfully beautiful connection in my life. So thanks for that. That's pretty cool. I wonder if you could tell me a little bit about your experience with psychedelics and specifically have you made any kind of contact that you're comfortable talking about? Contact with ETs and in the astral. Unfortunately, I have not been gifted with those experiences yet. I have felt the presence of my ancestors. My father's father was at a ceremony we did in Peru. Huizi, the guy who got me into all this, the first medicine man I worked with, my old boxing coach, he's been in a number of ceremonies. They're still guiding, watching and making sure that the space is held. Whoa. And I mean, this slide did a pretty deep ceremony with my father, which was decided upon after this trip to Peru with Aubrey and my wife, where we did Wachuma and then Vilca, this DMT snuff. And I realized there was still more stuff to unpack with my dad and my childhood. So I asked him if he wanted to do a ceremony with me and we'd done ayahuasca in the past together, but at each point he's had difficulty saying yes to more. And ayahuasca is scaled. It's not like you drink a pint of it out of the gate. You have a shot glass by shot glass until you reach where you're supposed to be. And anytime he had the opportunity to have more, if he felt like he was gonna lose control, he would always say no. He wouldn't let himself go. So we used MDMA, pharmaceutical MDMA, with penis envy mushrooms, psilocybin mushrooms, which is, first people don't know this strain. It's for sure the strongest mushroom on the planet. Oh my God. Twice as strong as anything else. And it's likely three times as strong as golden teacher or D plus. It has a very high content of psilocin in it, apparently. And psilocin is what psilocybin gets converted into when you eat it, but somehow it's already there or something or all I know is I know. It's very DMT-like, but I wanted this to be loving. And he said yes to the experience because the fact that he knew you take one dose and it's buckle up. There's no have more later. There's no real draw with that. You mean one dose of that particular strain? Yeah, you have it. You have the dose at the beginning of the evening and you're into a five hour journey and you have to surrender to it. You have to let go. And I'm not even sure why I was bringing up my old man right then. Well, because you know what? What was the question you asked me originally? The question is like, you know, yeah, I've been watching some documentaries about great things that have happened in the world. And I've been a little fascinated with the inspiration specifically and how some great ideas have come into the world through people who unapologetically said that they came from angels or spirits or dreams or things like that. And so that's just where my mind has been. And I know that you're someone who is on the psychedelic path. So I was just curious. I know I brought him up. It was a shared experience. So that's something I read about in The Cosmic Serpent by Jeremy Narby was that you can have, you can share visions with people. My wife, we shared a vision of me holding a child and her holding me and the child. And I didn't know this until we had closing circle and she spoke about this vision. And I was like, sorry, I gotta cut you off at the exact same fucking vision. And a month later, we were doing another ceremony with ayahuasca. And it was the same exact vision, but it was a boy. And it was like, fuck, I'm gonna be a dad. And all this fear came up about being a dad. And then I realized that's what everyone else says needs to happen. And I was able to move that away from my body. And within a month, we were pregnant with our firstborn. So like that type of premonition, that type of seeing the thing come to fruition and then also the shared experience. What does that mean? Because that happens and you've experienced it and I've experienced it. And many other people have experienced, but maybe some people listening have not yet experienced it. Tell me what your theories are on why that happened. How does that work? What does it imply about the nature of the mind? I think that, well, there's two basic camps, right? You have the camp of this is all held within your brain. It's just being unlocked and that whatever vision you have is stored within you. It's not coming from something external. And then there's the belief in animism as opposed to a materialism that all things are conscious. The plants, the rocks, the trees, they all have soul, whatever spark I have igniting me is shared with all things, right? So the plants as master teachers have their own consciousness and I believe that that consciousness is what's communicating to me most often. I brought up my old man because we shared a vision of Huizi, of my coach being there, watching over us. And he was like, and I didn't even mention it to him because we were in the ceremony and noble silence. I'm not going to sit there and chat his ear off about what I'm seeing, but he was like, Huizi's here. And I was like, yeah, he is, you know? And it's like, that's just another little, very small thing of like, well, who gives a shit if Huizi's there? Like, well, it matters to me, you know? And it's really cool to think that this teacher, this maestro, my first maestro will continue to be with me. There is no separation wherever you go and you die. Like he's still very much a part of my life. What do you think he'd be telling you now? These days, like if he could give you any kind of information. I've seen him not in approval when I've guided others. Like I'm doing it right. And that gives me confidence moving forward because in anything in life when it's something that's that powerful, you question yourself, you know, you question, am I doing this right? Right. You know, you do no harm. You don't want to harm others. And certainly in experiences that are that transformative, you know, there's a lot of white belts teaching psychedelic medicine out there. You know, there's a lot of people pouring ayahuasca that get it online, you know? And it's a different, and not that I pour ayahuasca for anybody or any of that stuff. And I'm just saying like it's, there's a different level and a different standard that I hold myself to when I'm with, especially with family and people, anybody that I would, I guess, you know, guide in quotes in that space. Some people have been reporting a consistent message coming from the ayahuasca realm. Have you noticed a consistent message that people are getting from their ayahuasca experiences? Well, one, and I read this on arrowwit.org and I'm sure you're familiar with it. Yeah, arrowwit's a great site. The first one I read was this idea that I'm not my body. So like the death, right? That's a very consistent message, I think. And it's even stronger. Like I believed in God, but I had no idea that it was still an external thing, like this separate bearded man behind golden pearly gates, instead of me understanding that God is love and it is everything. And I'm a part of that thing, you know, just like the ocean, all is of or nothing is. That's one of the great quotes I love from the guides through Paul Selig, as they speak to all is of or nothing is. And I firmly believe that all is of. So I am a part of that loving God consciousness, the non-judgmental form there. I don't know. That's pretty good. I think that that's, and it's fairly early that people get that, that death. And my father experienced that where he realized like it's all fucking infinite. Like he was shaking and I'm like, damn, this guy's having like close to a seizure. It looks like he's holding an electric pole. And I just, we just talked to him, we said, let it move through, you don't hold on to it. And as he was doing that, he was like, oh, okay, okay. And then he could, and then he could slow down and just breathe through it, right? But he felt like he was touching God's power line in that and realizing that that is infinite. And he is a part of that. His body will change in the world of where we're at, the world of 10,000 things, right? This is always changing. This is always, this is transitory. Nothing is gonna stay the same here, but even here it's infinite, it just changes. Right, yeah, that's, that concept is something that definitely emerges in a lot of different philosophies and religions, which is this sense of there being some kind of primary goodness in the world that is uncorruptible and transcendent. And many people contact that and then they forget about it, but they're at this. Yep, yep, and then we forget. And then life happens, you go right back to it. Yeah, and then you go right back to it. And so, can you, if you feel like talking about it, talk about what the individuality, the individuality of the self or the sense of disconnection from your feet touching the earth or from the thing the earth emerges from, you could say, or from what, for lack of, from what I've been taught, you could call fundamental goodness. Or another word which I've heard, which is a little more confusing is emptiness. But this place is, a lot of people, one of the descriptors they give is it's liberating. It's liberating. Contact with that place is liberating. In the sense that like a human gets a cut and we put a bandaid on the cut and the cut heals. But this is a little different in the sense that this is like underneath the cut, underneath the murk and the darkness or whatever you wanna call it, is this eternal, fundamental, transcendent goodness that is instantaneously forgiving in the same way the light is forgiving to the darkness. One description is, imagine a room has been dark for 10,000 years and someone turned on the light, instantaneous light. The darkness wasn't bad. There was no scrubbing. There was, you didn't have to come in and like the light didn't use sponges on the darkness. It just was gone. Similarly, contact with this place isn't even contact with the place. It's more of like remembering who we are. So I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the things that keep you from staying in that place permanently. From trying to go back as often as possible. Do you mean like from continuing to do psychedelics that? What keeps us from the place? If this is a fundamental goodness, if we are an eternal, transcendent, spaciousness, emptiness, if we are a we beyond we's, if we are a kind of unit of consciousness that seems to be being temporarily distracted by phenomena, why do we keep getting distracted? Well, I think we choose fundamentally when we choose to come here and take our bodies, which I think is what happens. We're choosing to be in polarity. We're choosing to be in duality. What distracts you though? I mean, not we, I'm sorry, you. I got you. What distracts you? Yeah, what is keeping you from living in that? Yes. Well, I can tell you, this is gonna lead right into open relationship. I would say the thing that keeps, as a generality, the thing that keeps me from living in that space is fear. And that can come from my job, potentially losing it, or it can come, not that I'm worried I'm gonna lose my job and on it, but there's been times when I wondered that, when I first started there, because the last job I have, I was fired without severance. So like there's things, and then having a family to support, I'm like, fuck man, I can't even afford to buy a U-Haul to move back into my mom's garage, right? So those fear, I think fear is what draws me out of the space of feeling always connected with no separation and only in love and living in love and living the dream and playing, you know? Like that's been so much of the messages that I've had in psychedelics has been to play, to not take it so seriously, to laugh at life and to enjoy it. Tell me about the fear. Like, when you get afraid, what does it feel like? My wife and I started open relationship in October, and the fear that I've had with her having a partner was that she was gonna leave me and that bear would be raised by some other guy, and that fear feels like my chest being squeezed, it feels like my heart is being crushed, and it's hard to breathe, and it feels like I really can't, I can't take a fucking deep breath right now. And I'm happy to say that shit's gone. I kind of figured out how to work through that, and I think psychedelics and fighting have given me those tools, but really it's about facing it, and a good friend of ours, Aubrey and mine and Tosh, his name's Pirangi, he's a fucking amazing musician out of Sedona, highly recommend the ayahuasca album he did for Aubrey and the ayahuasca remixed album, but he talks about buffalo medicine, and this idea from the Lakota of what the buffalo represents is a spirit animal. When the buffalo have a storm coming, they don't try to outrun the storm, they get shoulder to shoulder with their family, and they go head first into it, because they know that's the fastest way to get out of that storm, right? So what is the fucking fear? Let me engage with that, let me fully accept what is, let me surrender to it and move through it, because that's the fastest way. If I try to ignore it or not acknowledge it, or think of ways to outsmart it or outquick it, that never fucking works, it'll always catch me from behind, so I really have to decipher, and that comes with being still, like what emotions am I feeling that I don't like? Oh, I feel anxiety, or I feel fear, I feel this thing pulling me out of alignment with love, and when I see it and I'm willing to look at it, then I can actually begin to have an idea of how to move through that, and oftentimes it's with full acceptance of what is, rather than resisting, right? Resistance to my wife having a partner, even though on paper I wanted to have a partner, and on paper I know all the reasons we choose to do, Polly, to have more than one meaningful relationship, more than one love, and to know that love is infinite, and as you have more children that doesn't take away from your first child's love, that it's still there, right? So as I really decipher these things, I come to the place of it only adds, it takes nothing from me, it only adds to my life, because it enriches hers, it enriches my sons, and it enriches my life in turn. There's a different types of monogamy, you know, and course, and like, well, I mean, so like there's a, in India they have the Brahmachari ashram, as it's called, this is the renunciate ashram, and so this is like hardcore, very rare that you get an incarnation or you could even do that, but some people, according to this particular belief system, they've gone through the melt so many times that they get born into a family of, a conscious family, for lack of a better word, and it's like, it's a really great, for me like I stumbled upon this Ramadas and all this stuff just by good fortune and luck, because my mom stumbled upon it, and there were books around and stuff, and I just got lucky, you know. That's bullshit, there's nothing is chance, nothing is random, right? You fucking called that into being, you're exactly supposed to be. I loved it, yeah, so maybe like coded in where there's some karma to burn off, and then I got lucky, and then I got to meet some great teachers who work with me, and like have like helped me reconnect, feel the earth under my feet, so to speak, and but some people get born into like, like an example, Dildo can see Rinpoche as this. Did you say Dildo? No, I know it sounds like that though, Dildo. That would stink to be like, thank God the Buddha, like thank God the Buddha's name wasn't Dildo, right? Cause there might have been Buddhism might not have happened. Like if Jesus's name had been Dildo, would there still be Christianity? Cause people would be like, well they would just rename him probably, but of course in those days they didn't know what a Dildo. I don't know. Well then maybe a Dildo would be called a Jesus, right? Like maybe Jesus was around long before Dildo, so then that would have been switched, it would have been a name swap. You know what sucks? For sure, for sure, right now, somewhere on the planet, there is a goth who has a Jesus shaped Dildo, maybe like an upside down crucifix and she or he is just, they're fucking themselves with it right now and in their mind they're like, yeah, this show, this will show you God, I'm so dark. That's what's funny, it's like hilarious to imagine that that is, that's happening. Dildo, I could be mispronouncing his name, Dildo Kinsi Rinpoche, very, very great teacher and interesting story about his life, man. And he was born into a family and he went from a very young age, he wanted to be a monk. He wanted to live in India, they would call the Brahmachari life. And his parents didn't want him to, they want a son, not a monk. And so he ended up, they accidentally like spilled, like boiling water on a boiling soup, burn him. And he was like burnt and like, he said something in that state of like, will you please let me wear the robes now? And this is like a very high incarnation because it's like from the moment he was born, it was somehow encoded or written into him. This is the path, this is the path. And so interesting story, man. He went up in the classic thing, he went up into a cave, he was in a cave for a very long time. There are, that stuff you hear about like people being in caves, holding a certain consciousness, that's real. Holding space for the planet. Yes, that's real, that actually happens. And they don't want to come down. Many of them are like, they don't want to deal with it or they're not, that's just not their karma, that's not their thing. I used to think that was both, that is real. And he was one of them. But he, like we got lucky because he came out and because of him, my teacher's teacher took him jump a Rinpoche and a great other, many, many other teachers, they pay him a lot of respect because he was, I think they call it, and I might be messing all this up. So sorry for the people who are more conscious or aware of this than I am. This is with all due respect. I think they called him like a lineage holder, which is that all these people from all these various lineages would come to him and give him the transmission of their lineage and he would hold that within him and then like try to pass that out into the world. So like he was sort of like a repository. And there's all these crazy stories about him, one of them, he was like having darshan as it's called, like people were coming to see him. And in the back of the room, they were just like, offer obeisances, maybe give him a gift. It's a ritualistic, beautiful practice. But there was some just unremarkable, poor looking, just monk in the back of the room, and he looks at him and he's like motions for him to come. And then he privately stays with this guy for like hours because whoever that monk was, we'll never know. But he was like, as they say, don't judge a book by its cover, don't judge a monk by his robes or whatever he's wearing. You don't know who that was or what was going on there. These people show up sometimes. Like when you see a fish, when you're fishing, and you see the big fish flicker under the water for a second, it's like that. They'll just show up for a second. They don't wanna be here, they can't be here. They're not ready, it's not time yet, whatever. But anyway, he spent hours with this person who probably gave him like a lot of data, from the various data streams that are happening around the planet. But anyway, you could say this is an example of a Brahmachari, that being said, he had kids. But some people are actually like celibate, for real. And the reason they're celibate is not because they're afraid to have sex. It's not because they have some neurotic hangup about sex. It's because they understand there's all this complication that happens when you start humping. There's just no way around it, it gets complicated. It makes life, what's more complicated than that? It makes babies, it's a very powerful thing. And so then there's monogamy, right? And my wife and I have had a girlfriend and we right now are being monogamous. I say right now, it's good to say right now we're being monogamous. It's a big relief. If you're in a relationship and you're like, we're monogamous forever! It can feel quite difficult. But if you say, well right now we're doing monogamy, it's good. And then we have a reason for it. Man, we don't have time. It's complex. Yeah, you're not gonna spend the night at your girlfriends right now while you've got a little guy running around. There's so much going on, you know? And it's like so much complexity. Similarly with polyamory. Can't you say right now we're polyamorous? But maybe if you wanted to, if it was causing you all kinds of like emotional turmoil and trauma, or if it was producing all kinds of complexity, or if it was adding turbulence to your life, do you think it's okay? Can't you get it as attached to polyamory as you can to monogamy? Oh, of course. For sure. And you can be dogmatic about it and tell the world, this is how you need to do it. This is what you should eat. Don't eat meat. Don't eat meat. And everyone should fuck everyone. And all is love. Yeah, for sure you can. And there's people that beat the drum in anything in life because they get a hold of something that they have deep transformation and healing and positivity from and they wanna share that with the world. Yes. The first five times I did ayahuasca, I wanted to fucking shout from a mountaintop, everyone needs to do this and try to get all my friends to come and then, no, everyone walks their own path. Everyone gets to do their own work and everyone chooses to call in their own lessons in the way that they see fit. And I think there would answer your question, there's no doubt, could we push pause? For sure we could. I think in these initial stages, this is the first three or four months that we've been doing it. And we spoke about this for five years leading up to it. It's not like we just decided one day, let's fuck other people. There was a long time listening to people like yourself and Dr. Chris Ryan and reading Sex at Dawn and reading Untrue by Wednesday Martin and all these things that factored into it. But really it was about are we willing to do this and does now feel right? And it did feel right and we started and we've brought in people that we care about, that add value to our lives that are in alignment with how we live. And they fit right in like a puzzle piece and add to our family. I mean, they are family. So I think with that, any struggles that I've had from this and there's been plenty, that's my work. You know, there's a great, I've been, it's also lit a fire under my ass to be better, right? So I read Conscious Loving by Gay Hendricks and Kathleen Hendricks, fucking one of the best relationship books I've ever read. And Nonviolent Communication for me with that. No, I've heard about it, but cause it's something the people who, Burning Man, the people who, I don't know what they call themselves. They don't call themselves security for sure. They don't call themselves that, but they train in it because like they don't want anybody to get arrested and they want to avoid having to escalate things to the point where you have to get the authorities involved. So they train in ways to sort of, if someone's freaking out or pissed or some weirdness. Conflict resolution. Yes, through Nonviolent Communication. Talk about that a little bit though. It's beautiful. I mean, we're, I would say three quarters through the book. And right now, one of the things that we've done since starting open is every night after sex, if she's not sleeping at her boyfriend's, we will read a chapter of Mastery of Love or we'll listen to a chapter from a book that is for us. It's for our relationship. It's for enhancement, right? And that draws us together because we can just snuggle on the couch and download this amazing information and press pause to talk about it or stop, put the book down for a second and really unpack some of the stuff as it's coming in. But Nonviolent Communication, it teaches you a way. I mean, he talks about it as more than a, it's more than a template. It's about compassionate giving. And what you're giving is the opportunity for real communication to be heard and to hear the person that's speaking to you. And when you do that, you're communicating a way that it's without blame. It's without judgment. It's without right or wrong. It just is, right? And so so many of the tools that he uses through this are right in alignment with the teachings of the plants, right in alignment with Buddhism, right in alignment with living in a way that's freeing. And so I think, you know, it's, if you're even in fucking monogamy, like you better communicate well with your wife, you're gonna have problems, right? Like communication is critical. It's the- I'm so bad at it. It's the fun. You'll love this book then. And it's short. It's like five hours on Audible. Oh, it's so terrible. So it's not a long book. It's not a long book. I wanna be better at it. It's like, and I've been around people who are actually good at it. I mean, not people who are like fake good at it, which is really, really annoying. But you know, people when you realize like, whoa, you're like talking to me for real and listening to me for real. And that you're vulnerable right now. You're making yourself so vulnerable right now because you're not trying to be right. You just wanna connect to the truth. And I'm wanting to be right. And I don't care what the truth is, which is a big miss, boy, that's a good way to wreck your car if you're driving and you want the road to be somewhere it's not. You're fucked, you're gonna run into a tree. And this is similar in life, you know? And so that's a very big frustrating, for me, a huge frustration is when you end up in a diet, you're talking to somebody and you realize like, they're not, they're in it to win it. Well, it's not like we're scientists in a laboratory trying to determine whether or not some theory that we have is correct. It's like, this person just wants me to say, I'm sorry, you're right. Even if that doesn't seem to be the case. And this is like a plague. How many times have you online? I don't know if you even interact online. You seem like you're too enlightened to engage. There are times where I used to do that. Go down the rabbit hole. You don't do it anymore. I block people or I don't respond. It's not worth my time and energy. But to get into what you're saying, are there still interactions with people in the world that, you know, they haven't read the book. They're not great. They don't do the self-work and they want to be right. Yes, of course, that's fucking life. And there's plenty of unconscious people wandering through the world. So with that, one of the beautiful things about the book is that it teaches you how to decipher their message through their pain, through their anger, through their blame. And as you decipher that, you can come to a place of being heard. And then that comes through their recognizing that you've heard them, even if they don't say it right. And they say it with blame and anger and judgment. If you can unpack that for them, they feel heard. And there's a very essential piece of communication. When we feel fucking heard, like that draws you in to that person. So even if it's like, fuck you, you did this, blah, blah, blah. And there is this level of compassion and understanding and you feel like you've been heard. Then it's like, oh, okay, well, all right. And so you have the, he has four steps. One is the observation. You observe what's actually going on. You don't add to the observation. You know, like I wrecked my car. I wrecked my car because I got in an accident, not because that guy ran a red light and he's a piece of shit and he's texting and he only cares about social media and that's why he hit me. It's like, no, like this happened, right? You don't attach anything after that. Then you have, let's see, the observation, then the feeling. How do I feel right now? And an actual feeling, not, I feel like you should be a better partner. Like that's not a fucking feeling. Like I feel sad when you're not around. That's a real feeling, right? Then you have the need. What is the need based on that feeling? I need you to be around. Yeah, I want, I would like to spend more time with you or that when we do spend time together that we're actually engaged with one another. We're not just watching sitcoms that we actually have a dialogue and we interact with one another because then I feel like the short amount of time that we get to spend together is valuable. And that allows me to not worry about you spending that out at your partners or any other thing. And I'm using that as an example because we're talking about that, but you go through the observation, you go through your feelings, you go through the need and then you have a request. And here's the beautiful part of that. I can make the request, but the difference between a request and a demand is how I react to that response. If I say Duncan, I really wanna podcast with you at noon today and you say, no, I got some other shit going on. We'll do two o'clock. If that's a request, then that's okay. It's like, oh, okay, he has other stuff going on. So we'll do two o'clock. That works for me also, right? But if it's a demand, then I'm mad at you. It's like this motherfucker wants me to come on his time. He doesn't wanna do, you know what I'm saying, right? And so so often we have a request for somebody and when it's not met, that's when the judgment, the blame, they need to be right that you did this. And that's all that shit fucking comes in after that. He's a brilliant man. What's his book called? Nonviolent Communication. Wow, man, like so many times, I make demands that look like requests. That is so fucked up. That's good to know where you're like, I'm gonna request this because it sounds better because nobody wants to be an autocrat. Nobody wants to demand anything. You gotta make requests in this world, not demands unless you're like, unless you've got an army around you or something. This is really cool, man. Wow, that's super cool. It reminds me of this thing, you know who Zizek is? I don't know, I'm not gonna pretend to understand him, but he's like this like communist philosopher who's got a great documentary out that I've enjoyed called The Pervert's Guide to Ideology. And it's just a breakdown of like capitalist memes that are in movies, I guess you could say. I don't know, I always have to apologize to whoever's a genius out there listening. I don't know, it's a great movie, breaks out a lot of stuff in a cool way, but he talks about totalitarianism in the way it rears its head. And he talks about these two types of totalitarianism. One, someone pulls out a gun and is like, dig a hole, asshole, or I'm gonna shoot you. You dig the hole, you have to. They've got a gun on you, right? And then he talks about the other kind, which is really insidious and fucked up. And this is an example of someone making a demand but pretending it's a request. He says, this is what happens when you're with your son or a parent is with their kid and you want the kid to go see their grandparents and you pose a question to the kid. Do you want, you know that your grandmother is getting old and is very, very sick. She's not gonna be around long. Do you want to see her? And the kid's like, no. But then they still have to have been coerced. You're like, but she's very sick, very sick. And so you manipulate the kid. So the gun to the head is not a gun. It's like a gross manipulation, a coercion, so to speak. But it's the identical thing. And I think his point was the second one's way worse. Because at least the first one, you know someone's got a fucking gun to your head and you know that you're digging a ditch because you don't want to get shot. Yeah, that's easier to accept. Yeah, the second one, they're fooling you into thinking you have some autonomy when you don't have any autonomy at all. And it sounds like autonomy is like a fundamental core of nonviolent communication, letting the other person be who they are, right? Yeah, this is exactly what he was talking about as we were driving here. We were listening to it on the drive and he gets into autonomy with that. Because the reason why I would do something for you, it has to be positive. If it's because I have to, that ain't gonna work, right? It can't be because I have to. It has to be because I want to. Right, you gotta set them free, man. You gotta let everyone free from whatever ridiculous imaginary prison you're locking them up in. Because otherwise, who wants to live in that world? Have you seen that Twilight Zone or that little boy? Did you see the Twilight Zone movie? No, the movie? Yeah, they made a movie as cheesy as hell. When was it? It's for like, I think it's late 80s. Okay, I might have seen it. I used to, I've seen a few episodes of the show, it'd come up on Late Night TV. Forgive me, this is just a great, I love talking to you. I think I've held you a little, right now, it's a little late. I'm not sure what time it is. Do you have a little bit more time? I got more time, brother. Okay, cool. I'm really enjoying chatting with you. Morious sponsors. Much thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

Anyway, this Twilight Zone episode, this woman encounters this boy, I think at a gas station or some shit and she gets, I don't remember how it gets her to come back to his house, but there's all these people at his house who are acting real weird. And the reason they're acting weird is cause anything the kid wants happens, right? And they have to do exactly what he says or he's gonna fuck them up. So they're all pretending to like him. So they're like, hello, oh, we're so glad you're home. Who's your new friend? Can I get you some food? But they're all like grimacing cause they know, like he could like blow their head up or turn them into a toaster oven if he wants to. And so it's this bullshit love. It's all fake. It's not real. It's all sweaty, sweaty, bullshit, terrified, coercive love. And it's one of the most horrific things to discover that in some way shape or form people around you are afraid you're gonna disconnect from them or do something to them if they don't act the way you want them to. And that is a really terrible thing to recognize that you've been a little fucking autocrat, a little Mussolini in your life and pretending that you're not, that you're Gandhi. Is there anything worse? At least fucking Mussolini, he knew that he was evil. His office building is a hellscape. Where they were located, the fascists were located was evil looking. He looked evil. He was having brunch with Hitler. There's no question this guy sucks, right? But man, when you get a Mussolini acting like they're Gandhi, oh no, that's a big mess. And when that's you, holy shit, what are you gonna do? Forgive yourself. You always have to forgive yourself. It doesn't matter what the fuck you do. Talk about that. How do you do it? Because it's like, I think you are someone who is waking up. You are a conscious person. You've done a lot of work. You actually followed a pretty classical occult training path. You started off developing yourself physically. Then you are now entering into a more spiritual, metaphysical tradition that has, it's a real lineage that, and you have like authentic teachers who are embodied and also don't have a body. So you, I think, are in an interesting position in the sense that you're someone who is one of the most dangerous people I've ever met, who's studying nonviolent communication. That's balance, Duncan. That's cool. So talk about this forgiveness. How do you forgive yourself in a real way? It's a real difficult thing for people who suddenly start waking up and realize that while they were sleepwalking, they built a prison that they are the jailer and also the jailed. Yeah, you've had the keys the whole fucking time where you're sitting in the cell. Yeah, but it's embarrassing for some people. It's an embarrassment when you realize, wait, I'm not the only one I locked up here. No question. So what do you do in that case? You know, our buddy Aubrey, who's one of my best friends, has really helped illustrate this for me with regard to open, but it translates to everything in that whatever it is you're not willing to look at, whatever it is you're ashamed of or have guilt about, you won't even fucking see it. That's in the blind spot. So if I'm so woke and I've done so much work and I know the books and I've gotten downloads from the plants, I've had visions come through on doing open relationship and polyamory and I actually experienced jealousy, like a fucking regular person. I'm not even gonna acknowledge that, that I'm jealous. I'll finger point, I'll blame, I'll say anything to not have to face that. Right. So truly, and this happened to me very recently, it became an issue of I'm living in fear, I'm living in pain and it's all an illusion. And if I acknowledge the thing that I'm feeling, oh, I do feel jealous about this. Oh, I do wanna have more really cool experiences. My wife and her boyfriend are gonna go to Vegas and have a fun trip out there. I want her to have that experience. If I'm gonna write down all the things I want for her, I want her to fucking do full expression in sex, full experiences, weekends together, really amazing things and I want that for myself. When we, you know, agree to have that trip to Vegas, there's still an initial, ah, fuck man, Vegas is where we met and it's where we, I first started courting her and all these memories are there and it's acknowledging the fact that, oh, I am jealous and it is because we have a history there and it is because that's where you're born and raised and it is because I have so many memories of that place with you, right? So if I can look at it and face it, then it's like the buffalo going face first into the storm, right? I have to be able to see what it is and then from there, forgive myself for that because there was a lot of shame that I had surrounding that, a lot of guilt surrounding my jealousy and my fear because when you live in a space of that kind of fear and this happens, even if you're in monogamy and you fear your wife leaving you or her being attracted to another man, you become very needy and I became needy, like a fucking clingy, you know, like, no, don't go, I love you, do you love me? You know, like that kind of fucking was like, it's like, fuck, you know, and then I feel it as I'm doing it and it's like, oh God, this is not an alignment, this is a sin, this is missing the mark, this is not an alignment with the path and to actually say that's okay, you know, and I've had, I mean, fuck, I mean, having guys like Aubrey around are great because he can say like, oh, he jokingly calls me Odin when we're in Peru and he's like, did you think you were actually Odin? Did you think you were not mortal? Like, you are mortal, you are in form, you are a fucking human being and it's okay to have those feelings, everyone does, right? Well, I'll tell you this, also, if your wife is, if your wife has told you she has not attracted anybody else, you better be afraid, man, that's where you should really start fucking worrying, that's a worrisome thing. If my wife told me she wasn't attracted anybody else, it's like, what are you talking about? Yeah, I know what I'm talking about. You're a fucking human being, you're a human being. That shit doesn't turn off. I know the continuum. It's not like I'm oblivious to the continuum of humans, I certainly know I'm not at the pinnacle of human evolution. I'm not getting calls from GQ magazine, you wanna pose on the front, Sherlock Stonkin, you are such a specimen. You know what I mean? So I think that all game people play in monogamous relationships with each other is here the only one I want. It's just you and you alone. It's like, first of all, no, I don't wanna be the only one you want, because I can't be. That's too much for anyone. That's too much. And two, you are not okay right now if that's what you're thinking. If you're thinking that right now, it's a temporary occurrence, at least admit that. Because certainly, you have to be prepared for the reality of life, which is that you're gonna want other people. And if you don't, my God, my God, I guess I am what I thought I was. Ode in the Lord of Banda. So that's to address that point, understanding the continuum of things. But there's something else I wanna talk about with you related to this, which is it gets summed up like this. A person is in the shade and they think I'm too cold. And so they go into the sun. A person goes into the sun and they think I'm too hot. And then they go back into the shade. Now we have a readjustment of phenomena, a kind of infinite switching positions in an attempt to create or to find or to connect with that situation I mentioned earlier, fundamental goodness. And this produces what's called, as I understand it, samsara, or the never ending cycle of suffering. So a person works their entire life to get on The Tonight Show. They get on The Tonight Show and they realize, wait, now I wanna be in a movie. And so now they're rushing to be in the movie and this cycle of want or desire repeats and repeats and repeats. Similarly, with fucking, with polyamory, with lovers, with that level of connection, is it possible that in monogamy, in polyamory, in anything where you have produced a peak in your mind, which is like I am going within a week to be in one of the most amazing MDMA orgies of all time with some of the most beautiful women, we are gonna be fucking non-stop. I've got an endless supply of amphetamines, MDMA, ketamine, and something to- And Viagra. And Viagra. And something to reverse the cellular damage done to my body from this evil cocktail of ridiculous old man drugs that I'm gonna be slurping back so I could fuck. And so in my mind I've produced this whatever it is, a super hedonistic reality, right? And I'm longing for it now. And now I want it. And then I get to it. And it happens. And it's like, that was the first time I ever had a threesome. I mean, this is a thing that like, as a teenager, you're just like, oh, what would that feel like? What would it be like? Oh my God. And then you're like, I can only feel one body at once, mostly, you know what I mean? It's like a person who has a giant house. You can only be in one room at a time. You know, you can't expand out to the ballroom. You can't go out. You know, you can only be in one room at a time. You can go jogging through the house if you want, maybe, and like, or get, you know, the most ridiculous thing is when people get those things, the cops ride on, they have to get a segway. A segway that they segway through there. Like Paul Blockmark mall cop? Yeah. Can you imagine they're segwaying through their fucking house and no one's there except them and the sound of their segway as they go through the halls. And so, I guess it all goes back to intention, but what I mean is, what about the concept that there is no ordering of phenomena that will take care of the fundamental problem? And that fundamental problem is that no matter where we stand, we're standing on razors. No matter where we go or what we do, as long as we're, as long as I'm an eye, as long as I'm connected to this identity, as long as I am living in my story, as long as I am locked in to this thing that I am, I am going to suffer and there is no fix for that, whether it's monogamy, polyamory, celibacy, cut your dick off, apparently Tesla cut his balls off because he was too distracted by wanting to hump. He wanted to make electricity more than he wanted to make babies. So what about that? What if like the polyamory thing or the monogamy thing or all of it is just another way to trick yourself into thinking that experience is going to, in some way, shape or form, fix the fundamental difficulty of existence? I get what you're getting at here. And I think this, that is a very spiritual and beautiful way of asking, do you do poly to fuck other people for a peak experience or is it for growth? Is it for healing? Is it to shine light on the dark spots that are in our relationship? Is it to put pressure on the relationship that nothing, in a way that nothing else can? And I've done ayahuasca 25 times. My wife's done it a dozen times. We've done mushrooms far more than that. And we've had many heroic doses of plant medicines. And in all those experiences, it never put the same level of pressure on our relationship as open has. But I can say like, if my idea is this is annoying, like obviously if you work with any good shaman, they're gonna tell you the full gamut of the experience, potentials, not what your visions will be, but these things can happen. You can puke, we call it La Perga. You can shit your pants. That's a possibility, right? So if I know the full scope of jealousy can be there, guilt, shame, envy, and a lot of these negative emotions, but I can work through that. And if I am able to do that successfully, there is real growth there, right? And in that real growth, there is real satisfaction. There is real peace because I've learned so many of the lessons that have been taught through spiritual traditions and so many of the lessons that have been taught through plant medicines viscerally to surrender to the fact that my wife likes other dick. The same way that I know I like other pussy, right? It's not, but in that experience, knowing that it doesn't take away from me, knowing that I can trust and have faith and belief as I do in the divine, as I do in knowing I'm not my body and I'll live on after this. I have that level of faith. I have the same level of faith in knowing that all things are connected and I have the same level of faith in knowing that there's no reason for my wife to leave me. And if she did, that would be okay, but to trust in that, to sit in that space of knowing, the comfortability of knowing that we are doing the work together and that the things that we've accomplished in all of our experiences together, whether they were with polyamory or in monogamy and plant medicines, all these things, they're all leading up the mountain. We're traversing this together. We're growing together. And as we do that, like there's a bond that nobody can fuck with. No matter how hot they are, and fucking 10 years younger than me, none of those things, they're a beautiful addition, but they don't take away. It's like you're going up the mountain together, but also there's another aspect to it, which is that you're fundamentally, eternally alone. Have you ever heard that before? Mm-mm. Yeah, like this is like a thing that like, Chokyum Trumper Rinpoche talks about and it sounds like I'm writing a fucking Morrissey song or something, but it's like the, and it's not kind of scary at first, but when he talks about meditation, one of the ways he describes it is it's lonely. When you meditate, you're mere alone. Some people meditate in groups because they want to pick up this like high from other people meditating in groups. And in one of his lectures that I really liked, he said, well, this is like cosmic hitchhiking. You're basically like hitchhiking. You're trying to find another person and get high off of their vibe or whatever. And he's like, we don't have to do this because we all have our own car. It's called our body. And in the state of meditation, we're alone. And there's an alone quality to it. That's very real. And the same way that you were talking about the blind spots, the you don't want to see the jealousy because you've been pretending that you're not jealous or you, it doesn't fit in with a story that you want to tell yourself. There's another blind spot maybe for a lot of people, which is that no matter which way you want to chop it, you're alone and your heart is broken. Now there is a wonderful and somewhat confusing thing called the heart sutra. And though, have you ever read the heart sutra? No. It goes, parts of it that I remember, no mind, no body, no life, no death, no becoming, no not becoming. It's essentially like these binaries that are both negated. And so, and it's really intense because at least from a Buddhist perspective, it says something along the lines of all dharmas are empty, meaning that no, nothing, nothing, emptiness, empty, empty, empty, empty, empty, gone, gone, gone, gone beyond the going, all gone, already broken. And this is lonely. And so sometimes people make contact with that realization and they cry and then their hearts are broken and or they think their hearts broken. Really, they just felt the truth, which is the truth is you're gonna die alone. You might die with people around you, but you're gonna die alone. You're gonna make the transition by yourself. You're gonna do it all alone. And there's no way to escape that. And many of us, and I'm not saying you, because you have a really great vibe and a real solid, powerful, but this is not like maybe you're alone and you're fucking to get rid of the aloneness. I'm not saying that at all. Okay, so there's no passive aggressive thing here, which is why when I was asking you about the fight depression or the, I'm talking about more of a fundamental kind of problem, which is that I have noticed myself, which is no matter what thing may be happening, whatever it may be, no matter how powerful the experience, ketamine, pure dissolution, contact with some kind of hyperdimensional archetypical Ganesh figure, some realization of a miraculous nature of the universe or some deep love connection, there does seem to be running counter to that at all times. It's antithesis and that's true, right? That's true. And we seem to be standing on the edge of these two things, slowly being flayed. And so this is why I like your idea of making contact with the suffering, admitting it's there, that the jealousy is there, the pain is there, admitting it's there, but then what? What are you once you become the pain? What are you once you become the jealousy? What are you once you become the suffering? And most importantly, what is the suffering separating you from? Well, I think that once I acknowledge what's going on and I actually sit with it and feel it and I don't try to move it away and this is similar. I don't know if we still have the wasps behind this. It's still up there. That, you know, and I told you that I had the vision where it was super dark and, you know, it's on mushrooms and a wasps were vomiting more wasps into infinite fractals of wasps, vomiting wasps and it was fucking scary. And but I realized like, oh, I don't, let me sit with this. Let me, the more I resist this, the more it's gonna persist, right? So as I do that, I just acknowledge that it's there. I sit with it and I realize, oh, this is, my visionary field is because I'm in fear right now. I'm in pain right now. And then as I turn to hold my wife, my visionary field turned in this beautiful yellow rose that was fucking glowing and sparkling. And I felt love and I felt whole and I felt no fear. If I can get to that place in life where I don't resist the thing, the fear, the feeling of that fear or my thoughts around it, my shame around having those feelings. If I can actually sit with it and not try to remove it, but just be with it, it dissolves. And as it dissolves, I return to wholeness. I return to no separation. I return to love. Yeah. Okay. I love that. That's great. I definitely want to be around flowers more than I want to be around vomit, wasps. Yeah. But I don't think either of them are real. And that is, that's what I'm interested in. It's just like I... Have you ever heard this? I'm sorry. I just, I'm so enjoying chatting with you, man. So forgive me. Keep it fucking rolling. Let's go. Have you ever heard confusion is a condition of enlightenment? Have you ever heard of that? It's amazing. So it's like, if you want to get enlightened for there to be enlightened, enlightenment, there has to be confusion. If you didn't have confusion, you'd be enlightened. So if you're confused, you're already on the continuum of realization. If you're deeply confused, you're already there. Similarly, what you're talking about when it comes to the emergence of some particular difficult emotion and definitely not ignoring it, which is ignorance or active ignoring, the active ignoring is exhausting. So jealousy comes. I think jealousy is because people are afraid to die. I think jealousy has something to do with the fear of death or something. I think jealousy is the fear of death getting reflected in the person around you or something. Because when you say, I'm afraid, I'm going to lose my wife or my love, you really what it is is you're afraid to die because that fear of, because your life's going to break up with you. We are in a polyamorous relationship with existence, so to speak. Like it's not going to last. It all ends. Yeah. And so the love of life sometimes, in the same way the love of another person appears as jealousy, the love of life appears as the fear of death. And the fear of death and the fear of your wife leaving you or your lover being with someone else is a sense of not admitting the fact that we're all connected or something like that. And the reason we don't want to admit we're all connected is because if we admit that, then we have to deal with the fact that we aren't even a self. And then we're instantly annihilated and something in that is quite terrifying for people. So we produce this love affair with the jealousy. In other words, if I have to deal with jealousy, if I have to deal with suffering, if I have to deal with pain, I have at least that separating me from my own annihilation. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. And what I love about the Buddhism that I've been taught and I'm probably misunderstanding is that it begins to show you well, actually, unfortunately, the suffering itself, it's you. There's no barrier. There's no escape. Whether you want to deal with the jealousy by being at peace with it, whether you want to deal with the jealousy by fighting against it, whether you want to deal with the jealousy by ignoring it, you're still in the unfortunate situation of being eternally and infinitely everything. And there's no way out of it, man. And you know what I'm talking about? The jealousy is like the whole thing, the whole game of it, is just another trick. If I can deal with my jealousy, I don't have to look at, in other words, like if I'm ignoring my jealousy, I'm over here looking at something else. If I'm looking at my jealousy that keeps emerging, what am I ignoring when I'm looking at the jealousy? That, I'm interested in that. Because that, I think the thing that you're ignoring is enlightenment. Yeah, I think, I mean, really for me, the thing that's helped, and you talk about like the other, right? So like her boyfriend, it's not looking him in his competition. It's looking him as like, there is no separation between the two of us. Like in a way, I am him and he is me. And that's true compersion for me, not only to want my wife to have a beautiful experience, a full experience, not, you guys get to fucking missionary the whole night and you never get any other position, you know, like, but a full experience. I also- When we're not monogamous anymore, I'm gonna write position charts that she has to follow. This is what you're allowed to do. This is what I'm okay with, right? And then I'm gonna interrogate her. Did you do anything? Okay, anyway. Yeah, and so, and then when I really think about it, and I come from this open heart space, I want that for him too. I don't want him to get half of my wife. I want him to get all of my wife, right? And I say my wife, I want him to get all of Natasha. Cause she's her own soul and she is fucking awesome. And I don't want to keep that all to myself, right? The world needs that. And whoever she wants to share her love with and touch with, that's a fucking beautiful thing. It should be celebrated. Yeah, well, this is like the, have you ever heard of death poems? Oh my gosh, they're crazy, man. This Zen master I've been reading his book and he apparently died in the meditation position and his last words were a poem. It was like a three-line poem. And essentially, like you said, my life, it's like fuck on the mountain. It was fuck on the mountain, something like that. And then he just died. And similarly, have you ever fallen in love with anyone in a dream? In a dream. Yeah, have you ever, you've fucked in dreams, of course. You've had to fucking dreams, right? And you wake up from the dream and you don't feel like if you're being monogamous, if you told your wife like, man, I fucked someone in this dream, your wife is not going to be like, well, you cheated on me. She's going to be maybe annoyed or something at the worst. I mean, it'd be weird if she was, but usually like weird, okay, cool, right? When you wake up from a dream and you've had the best sex in the dream, you don't mourn the loss of the person who you are having sex with in the dream. You in fact don't really think about them anymore, right? Not a big deal. Similarly, do you ever wonder if that's what we're in right now, that it's just not a big deal? It's fog on the mountain. It's just a passing phenomena. Yeah, that it is transitory. I think there's been quite a few times of this message being rethreaded back into my psyche of play, enjoy it. It's you're only here a short while, you know? And like as I surrender to what is and accept, like I love this and I've said, I know I've said it before in different podcasts and you're familiar with it already, but in a new earth by a cartel, the opposite of resistance is there's three levels. The first is acceptance. Like your tire blows out on the side of the road. You got to change it. It's in the pouring rain. Accept what you have to do and just do it. There's acceptance. Then there's enjoyment. And then there's enthusiasm, which literally translates to be in God. Cool. So that's like the ultimate place we're trying to shoot for, right? And I think if I think about when you're in a flow state or you're just, you're playing and you're fucking fully immersed in that and there's no negative mind chatter or wanting to be somewhere that you're not, you're right there in the moment. The more often we can tap into that, the more often none of that other shit matters. Like us deciphering, you know, is this a dream or all the things that this whole conversation, which is awesome. And I fucking can't love so happy we get to do this today. It's fog. And at the same time, it is fog, right? And it is, it is the, you know, at best a pointer. These are best at best pointers into the right direction. Right? But I think playing, that's when we're, that's when we're fucking fully engaged in life. And then all this other figuring out stuff doesn't fucking matter. You don't need to know. All you need to do is just be in the moment and enjoy. There's a thing I read about how cats catch mice and that they sit at the edge of a mouse hole and wait for the mouse to come out. And they eat it. Similarly, in meditation, there's a thing called Rigpa, which is this moment of like the fundamental goodness that we have felt through psychedelics or whatever that just comes. And the moment you're like, there it is. It's gone. You're the fucking cat catching the mouse. And so, yes, absolutely, man. Absolutely. It's like, who cares? Right now, I'm in the ring and it's just now and this is what's happening right now. And that's it. All the rest, it's just a dream. It's gone. It's not even there. That's the thing. It's literally not there. You don't have a past. You have a neurological series of like, I don't know what they are. I don't know what makes it have little protein chains. Who the fuck knows? In your brain, they don't even write. And you certainly don't have a future. You simulate it in your mind all the time. And so then it's like, well, okay, I don't have a past or a future for real. It's like the weirdest kind of creature. It's like, you don't have a past or a future. It's gone, just this-ness, now-ness. But then, that's where it gets cool because we're starting to get into the now. What is the present moment? If there is only this present moment, what is that? Tell me, Kyle, what is the present fucking moment? How's that for nonviolent communication? It's whatever we're experiencing, you know? And that there is no right or wrong in that. There's no good or bad. If we can get to a place, what was- Who's experiencing? There's a fucking Sufi quote. It's a Sufi quote. They use in nonviolent communication. There is a field outside, just outside of right and wrong, and just outside of good and bad. I'll meet you there. Ooh, I love it. Right, if we can be in that space where we're not judging the experience right now or thinking about the thing we didn't wanna have happen to us that did or the future that we don't want for ourselves, or we can just fucking be here, that is the full expression of experience. Or even the idea is it's like the fuck it, in your mind right now, the worst thing you could imagine, whatever it may be, you know? Your house is on fire and everything's burning and your children or your child is incinerated or the mind produces this. So what? It just comes and goes. That's okay too. Or the mind produces the most insanely amazing, benevolent, incredible thought about how wonderful and advanced you may be. So what? You didn't make those thoughts. They just appeared. You didn't make it, you didn't squeeze it out. There's not some thoughts, there's a lot of thought babies weaving thoughts. I'm gonna make another one where he's watching his wife get fucked by those 700 football players on Mars. Those are good, that really gets us going. Let's set it up, set it up, set it up. Oh yeah, he's freaking out, it worked. You know, because that's what happens is these thought bubbles come up from the sweatshop of our unconscious or whatever where there's a little thought babies are weaving them together and we grab them and then we're looking at them like, oh my God, oh my God, look at this beard, how am I thinking this? And all the while in that we become a self and by becoming a self, okay, now I've got something to hold on to, right? But you know, you see a flock of birds and you're not like, wow, what a cool thought I had, those birds, man, I'm really good at making birds. No way, you'd be some kind of fucking narcissist. And yet the birds in your thoughts are all happening within your mind. They are both out of your control, they both have nothing to do with what you are and they're just another thing that's happening, another field of phenomena that's happening. And so this is what I love about meditation is it, you know, it's like teaching you how to like get the mouse away from the, or the cat away from the mouse hole. But now we have these thoughts that are coming and now we have the birds that are coming and still I wonder, what are we? What am I now? If I'm not my thoughts and I'm not the birds, what am I? What is it? I think I've experienced that in deeper meditation and certainly in psychedelic space and oftentimes with ketamine. And that is like as Eckhart says, to be the observer, right? Like if I'm not my thoughts, I can observe them moving through with no emotional response to them, right? If I truly get to that space where it's like layers back from being here with blinders on and I'm the thing experiencing all of this and this is all real, if I pull back from that far enough that widens my perception, that opens my view and that narrows the blind spot. And there's always a blind spot, but it definitely narrows it. And from that place, I can just be. And that's consciousness, right? How I experience it is up to me. And there's tools that help me experience it better or more enjoyably. But that's up to me to know like, oh, I'm not that thing. Or that thing is like Ted Decker says, fear is a fucking illusion, it's an illusion. And there is no fear in love. If you're truly in love, there's no fear there. No way. It doesn't exist, it can't exist. That's the dark with the light in the room. Like the dark's gone, fear's gone if you're truly in love. Oh yeah. So that's the notion for me is that if I experience some of these negative emotions or I have an idea of whatever experience that's going on, if it's good or bad or right or wrong or any of those things to catch myself, it's the awareness that draws me back to, oh, that's right, that's okay, that's okay. I got caught in the moment again. It's almost like in meditation, like mindfulness meditation, people get so mad at themselves because they went down the rabbit hole thinking for 15 minutes and they had a shitty meditation. It's like, no, you caught yourself. You caught yourself going down the rabbit hole and that's all it is. It's 100% the awareness of that thing. And as you strengthen that, it's a fucking muscle. You can get better. And the more often you do it, the better you get. And then as you get caught off in traffic or any of these other circumstances happen in life, you realize that it's all okay. That's it, man. I think, because it's like, you know, the thing is, look, you motherfucking Nihilus trussell, if we are all nothing or whatever the fuck you're saying, I'm also a something. And it's like this something that I am as a me and the me that I am as Kyle, I'm more tongue in my case. But regardless, I have to honor this. This is happening. This is real. And if I'm going to be like swimming off into these like tantric experiences, which, you know, in your life right now, it's just like polyamory and like experiencing all the like great stuff and the scary stuff with it, you wanna experience it. That's the main thing. It's like, if you're gonna produce a rarefied incarnation for yourself, where you are ascending these peaks that most people are in their entire lives would never even imagine ascending. You know, whether it's polyamory, whether it's fighting, whatever it is that you're going off to do. If you're going to eat rare fruit, make sure you taste it. Make sure you're there when it happens. Put your head in the fucking blast furnace, you know, like make sure that you're able to be there as it happens. Because otherwise, what's the point? Play video games, Red Dead Redemption's fantastic. Yes, it is, it's one of my favorites. The best, play it, which is why I think that this practice that we have is so good because everyone thinks the practice is to like suddenly become some kind of renunciate, like, I don't know what, put on white robes, burn some fucking candles, and be like some celibate, whatever. But what I have heard from some very intelligent people is, for example, stop drinking when you're not mindful of the drinks that you're taking anymore. You want to drink? Go ahead, but be honest with yourself. And the moment you're not tasting every sip, the moment you're not feeling the whiskey or beer go down your throat and into your stomach, the moment you're just drinking, stop. And if you don't stop, why didn't you stop? That's a blind spot. Look at that. Similarly, with any of this stuff that we're talking about, the moment you're doing it and you're not there, you're thinking about telling the story of being there, you're thinking about how you wish you weren't there, or you're thinking about somewhere else you want to be. What's happening? You're not there now. All the work you put in going to Vegas with your lover, all the work you put in letting your lover go to Vegas with a lover, what was the point? There's nothing there. You're just static at that moment. So this is why I think both work very well together, of practice and then acknowledging your incarnation and the fact that we have a very advanced nervous system that gives us orgasms. Thank God. Yeah, well, that just goes back to the point of we have bodies, fucking enjoy them. I'm not going to choose to live my life in a way because of social programming or the way we've been conditioned. And I think the four agreements and in mastery of love, he talks about the domestication of man, right? Like all this history that we're born into and we just say, oh, that's, I go on green, I stop on red, this is how it is, right? We don't question that. These are all fucking ideas, right? Aubrey tells me that all the time, like, hey, just remember everything you guys agree to, everything you guys do that helps frame how this looks, these are all ideas. Just think of it like that, right? And I think if you want to come to understand that, but then you also come to understand that, I'm in a fucking body right now. I've been out of my body plenty of times in psychedelics and I've experienced that bodyless reality, but I'm in a body right now. So celebrate this fucking thing. We can touch, we can feel, we can lick, we can suck, we can kiss, we can talk. And even just the physical touch of massage, like loving on people, my wife and I were at Burning Man, having grips of Molly, we were just massaging everyone. And it was fucking awesome. That was the way we were sharing love without intercourse, to fucking touch people and send them love through our fingertips, right? And that's a beautiful way to have that, but it's always been funny to me to see people who, they focus so much on the spiritual that they negate their own physical vehicle. I don't think you only live once, but I only get Kyle Kingsbury's body once. That's right. So why not fucking tune it up and keep it running to make it the best possible thing I can? That's it. Spiritual fucking bypass is what it's called, man. And it's like very easy to do. And it's like very, very easy to do. And I'm actually teaching a spiritual bypass class this week in an Echo Park. I'm teaching you how to avoid working out by pretending you're enlightened. Ha ha ha ha. It's great, really good idea. Ha ha ha. Give that $150 a month gym membership to me. Exactly, why go to the gym? I can teach you how to not go to the gym, but still feel like you're amazing and in great shape. But yeah, it's called spiritual bypass. And it's like, but similarly, we can do hedonic bypass. You know what I mean? Which is like to get into the other side too and lose track of what we actually might be. And so the idea is like, figure it out now. Be here now, as they say. This is the place right now. And if you could start, and that's why they call it a practice. Because here we are, if we can be in this place now, then when we're parachuting, when we're in whatever the great peak we've created for ourselves is, we can really be there, head in the blast furnace. But it's not that big a deal. And like, this is a thing I've said on the podcast and it might be embarrassing. And later I might think, God, Ducca, that was really dumb. But I keep saying poodle nose, which is when I look at my poodles nose outside and see his connection with reality and see the way his nose is trembling and he's looking at everything and he's so fully in the moment and not in the moment in some pacified, hypnotized, fake way. But in the moment, the way like, that poodle is acting like he's in the trenches in World War II. Like every single sound is like, he's in it for real. That's life. That's the present moment. The present moment is a fucking nuclear blast. It's a blast furnace. It is powerful. And we don't want to be here. Not because we don't want to be here because we're like attached to the past or the future. We're attached to the past and the future because the blast furnace of the present moment is too intense. It's instantly heartbreaking. It's like, you know, Terrence McKenna, five dried grams of mushrooms, you're sitting in front of the plexiglass and the nuclear bomb and it's like you're in front of a nuclear bomb. That's every, that is the moment minus the mushrooms. It's just the mushrooms have dropped your filters for a second so you could see what's happening. And what's happening is we are in the crest of the wave of creation as it expresses itself into time. And that's the sum total of all the volcanoes that ever happened. And if you've ever seen any volcano, you know how powerful that shit is. That's all of them at once. We are Odin, actually. We're Odin, all of us together. We are the infinite God being pushing into time. And that shit hurts. It's heartbreaking and it's also incredible. So the idea is to not avoid it if you can. Yeah, don't resist it, accept it, surrender into what it is. I gotta start working out. You're an inspiring man. Oh, thank you very much. I'm so sorry, I held you, I see you came here and I held you hostage. I don't think you expected, I don't know, I'm sorry, but you're a very inspiring person and I'm really grateful to you for your time. Our conversation today had a big impact on me and I have a lot to process. A lot of like wonderful little spinning rainbow wheels, so to speak, in my mind, that I can't wait to see what results from it. But thank you so much for being so generous with your time and for coming all the way here from Venice to have this conversation with me. I hope we get to keep talking.

Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, friends. It is me, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Spirituality Alert, Spirituality Alert, Spirituality Alert. If you don't like spirituality or love talk or talk about openness or opening your heart or heart chakra talk or Buddhism, you need to not listen to this episode because I just got back from a meditation retreat in Hawaii and it's what I'm gonna talk about because it's all I've been thinking about and it's all I've been feeling. So if you're one of those people, and it's okay if you are, I totally understand, but if you're one of those people who's turned off by spirituality or spiritual talk, this is gonna give you probably 100 ERPMs. That's 100 I-Rolls per minute, at least. You're gonna roll your eyes so many times that you're gonna look like a, you just snorted 500 grams of pharmaceutical grade MDMA in the back of a glow stick delivery van. It's going to bother you. You won't like it. There's plenty of other negative episodes in this podcast and in all these podcasts that I've done. Go back and listen to the Mistress Justine Cross episode where I get flogged by a dominatrix. That's back there somewhere or you can listen to any of the episodes with Tim Heidecker or check out The Craftsman. These are all kind of comedically dark, negative versions of this podcast, but this one, this is way on the Uncle John's band side of the record store here. So, because I've just got a talk, I've got a process that I tell you guys everything and I actually consider you, maybe I won't even talk about the meditation retreat. Maybe I'll just go right into Jack Cornfield who I was lucky enough to interview for this podcast for this episode and I don't know, just talk about how I just got an Xbox One or I don't know. But unfortunately, because this event just happened to me, I can't stop talking about it because my mind is trying to grasp what happened to me and my mind is basically doing the exact same thing that conspiracy theorists have done after the Twin Towers crashed down or it's just like what just happened to this ego structure that we spent so long working. I'm not saying my ego structure's gone, no way, it's there. It's doing great, fine, pumping hard, it's there, but something shifted dramatically at this meditation retreat and it's really cool because I didn't expect that to happen. I, at least consciously, I didn't expect it to happen. I thought it'd be relaxing, I thought I'd get to hang out with really cool people because the last time I went there in spring, I made friends with a lot of amazing people and Raghu would be there and of course, Ramdas was going to be there, is there, and Jack Cornfield is there, but I don't know, it's really weird, somehow I didn't like lay, but I didn't recognize that that equation, this combination of a spiritual community mixed in with Ramdas who is like some kind of love radiator. He's like a love, he's like just a space heater shaped like a person that pours out just love. So you get around him and you can't help, but get shifted at least in some small way. And then the, of course, the community, whenever you get a group of people gathered together who've been spending their entire lives or parts of their lives or the recent part of their lives meditating, that's gonna create a specific type of vibe. And then the yoga teacher, Saraswati was amazing and just getting to do yoga is really amazing. And then, oh, it's Hawaii and Hawaii seems like proof that the universe that we are existing in is some kind of simulation. Like if Planet Earth and the universe was a curtain covering up the workshop that God created things in, then Hawaii would be his elbow accidentally jutting out of a slit in the curtain. It's like proof that there's a God because it's just too much, it's too much. It's like God just left, it's like God's signature on Planet Earth. Maybe it's his final work because it's a brand new thing relative to the other continents. It's maybe like after God figured out that, I don't know, dinosaurs, they're fun, but they end up getting evaporated by meteors and recognize that drab pine forests, they're great and everything, but why not just create a black light painting island that's just a blast of just somebody just squeaking neon paint into the ocean and populating it with beautiful birds and coral reefs and you could go snorkeling and you just float out there in the ocean and Maui staring down at these fish communities. Really fun, really fun. So the combination of all these things creates what the philosopher Hakeem Bay called a temporary autonomous zone, which is sort of in the midst of society or in the midst of a culture, in the midst of all the various patterns and the sort of well-worn patterns that exist in any society from time to time emerging out of these well-worn patterns, a brand new thing will pop up. And when you're in a temporary autonomous zone, you start getting this strange feeling that where you're at is not the dimension that you're used to. You feel very, very different. And I think within those zones is where you can do a lot of inner work and where there can be a lot of healing or a lot of transformation can happen in those zones. I'm trying to think of other examples of a temporary autonomous zone. I have never been there, but it seems like Burning Man could be like that. If you've ever been to a really, really good rave, then that can be like that, where it's just wherever you're at just doesn't feel like Earth anymore. You feel like you've been temporarily zapped into some super advanced civilizations, a spaceship of a super advanced civilization or something. The mind, you know you're in an awesome place when you find yourself stammering or you find your mind sort of stuttering to try to articulate where you're at. Because the place that you're at has actually gotten bigger than your language. And that's a really wonderful place to be. Because language is a very difficult, problematic thing that categorizes, that categorizes reality into these symbols that are so limited. So if you get around something that you don't have the language for, then that means you're around something that is novel and is at the cutting edge of things, as far as I'm concerned. So the retreat was amazing and I had a few really intense experiences there. And it was, it's very weird because it's sort of a, there was a progression to the whole thing. There was a progression. Like when I got there, I was really not in a great place. My, physically I wasn't in a good place. I'd throw my back out. I could barely move my neck. I had this gross cold and it had been spraying yellowy flim everywhere. It was disgusting. And I had just the night before gotten in an actual fight with a friend of mine, like a real fight where I'd yelled, I'd yelled at him and just was like, just being a real, just angry dick. And of course, probably three weeks prior, I guess three weeks, I'm not sure the exact amount of time, two weeks prior, two weeks prior, I'd gotten out of a relationship. So I was really just this tangled knot of unhappiness and I wouldn't even call it unhappiness. Just like, I hadn't started gritting my teeth at night, but I was probably just around the corner from getting to that point where you're so stressed out and miserable that you find yourself gritting your teeth at night. Almost there, but not quite, but close. So I got, you know, I got there and immediately when you step out of the airplane, you know, when you're in Hawaii, when you finally step out of the airport and you get to be in Hawaii and the energy of Hawaii, you just start healing then. It's very difficult to, I'm sure it happens, no doubt, because I know that there's like a, obviously I don't think that there aren't miserable people in Hawaii. I get it, I know there are, but man, I think to be miserable in Hawaii takes like a few more calories than it does here. Like you really have to like, you've got to really squeeze that misery muscle to generate misery there. I don't know though. I imagine any place that you live, you can get used to it and then it just starts sucking. Who knows, it's, who knows? But for someone who isn't accustomed to Hawaii, it's just you're immediately being buffeted by this insane energy, which I think they call prana, which is the term for like shakti or the term for chi energy or the just, it's like, you know, a baby, a brand new baby, just a fresh, sweet, darling baby. When you get around a baby, it really is like the baby is glowing and you feel like you wouldn't be that surprised if you saw tiny little glittery fairies like flying around the baby and singing hymns to the thing because there's just something sacred and beautiful and holy about a baby. That's what Hawaii's like. It's the earth's baby. So it's got that brand new puppy feel to it. Only it's an island. So there's that. But then when you get to the retreat, when I got to the retreat, there's an opening ceremony and it's really quite beautiful and Ram Dass is there and everyone's there and something started happening to me where I immediately just started resisting everything. Like, you know, it's like my, my ego was like really going into like high gear. Not in the, you know, in the sense of like, I just found myself being kind of judgmental and closed off and just sort of like, what if I, man, I hope I didn't, did I fuck up by coming here? Like, do I belong here? I mean, don't get me wrong. I was having an awesome, you know, dinner with friends and hanging out with Ragu's, one of the sweetest people ever. He's been on the podcast a few times and he's on this podcast. So it was sweet, but still, you know, whenever you go to something like that by yourself, PS, you know, I was initially going to bring my ex-girlfriend there. So there was that element of it too, which was just like just this sense of like, fuck, man. I, you know, this is very different from the way that I expected it to be, you know, cause I'm here by myself. And so there was all of that happening going on in my head, just an entire swarm of dark negativity flies zooming around in my brain. Lots of internal eye rolls happening, perhaps, and just a kind of closed down thing going on. So that was the first day. And then the next day, you wake up very early. Well, for me, very early, it's actually not even early because it's, and I think nine o'clock LA time, but to me, it felt early. So you wake up and you go to yoga, which is, if you haven't done yoga for a long time, which I had, and you do it for the first time, it really is like smoking some amazingly great marijuana or it gets you so high. So there was that. And then in that sort of buoyant, opened up state, you go to the teachings. And that's with Jack Cornfield and his wife, Trudy. Now, that's where things started getting really interesting for me because I'm, you know, I'm just sitting there and then Jack Cornfield, you definitely, definitely download an audio book by Jack Cornfield or get one of his books or go on YouTube and listen to one of his lectures. I'm sure they're there. I haven't checked, but just listen to him talk. I have an audio book by him now called A Path With Heart. It's amazing, but he's got the like most call, he has such a calming effect. It's amazing. You feel like you're a baby and you've been crying and your mom is singing to you or something. He just calms you down. And so, you know, he started talking and he's into something called insight meditation and he was a Buddhist monk and he used to work in the Peace Corps. He was in the Peace Corps and then he decided to be a Buddhist monk. I mean, just think about that. Think about that. I mean, I don't know what you do, but you know, probably when I was Jack Cornfield's age, when he joined the Peace Corps, I probably the most selfless thing that I did was maybe, I don't know, let somebody cut into traffic a couple of times a year. I definitely didn't have some calling that I'm gonna go join the Peace Corps to help people and then somewhere in the midst of being in the Peace Corps, I wasn't like, you know what? I think I wanna go join it become a monk and a monastery. It does happen to some people. That's what they call dharma, is that you get drawn into service or helping people and it does happen. It's just really cool to be around somebody who's like authentically dedicated their lives to helping people or they just decided, well, you know what? If I'm gonna do something in this world, it's gonna be helping people instead of making money or selling houses or whatever it is that all the rest of us do. I don't sell houses, but I would. If I had a bunch of houses to sell, I'd definitely sell them. So that's just cool. But then the other thing that's interesting about being around those people is you get to, the first thing you're gonna do if you're me, maybe not you, but if you're me, you're gonna size them up. I can't help it. It's just my ego and the mechanisms of judgment automatically will size people up. Anyone who comes, unfortunately, anybody who comes in front of me gets the terminator treatment. I don't know if you've ever seen the terminator, but he had this thing that's like, the grid pops up and it's like, the phony readout will pop up and the asshole, 90% asshole, 10% phony, all jerk. That kind of thing pops up. That's what the judgment mechanisms do. At a place like this, especially when your ego is starting to act like a cat that's about to get a bath, you go into full judgment mode if you're me, maybe not you. So that's the thing that happens when you get around these teachers and holy shit, man. Jack Cornfield's got the most amazing vibe. So that gets shut down right away because he's just got this, I don't know, it's this thing that happens to you after you've been practicing for a long time is you just put out this crazy, calming energy. He's like, human chamomile tea. You're just suddenly like, ah. See how he's listening to Jack Cornfield and then right away, and I mean, I could try to repeat what he said, but it's not gonna, it's not gonna, I'm sure it won't have the same effect, but the thing that got me all of a sudden is I'm sitting there and he says, he says, if you're lonely, if you're lonely, just let yourself feel lonely. I mean, it sounds so simple. It sounds like, yeah, no duh, but for me, that's not like a thing that I do. That's not a thing that I, you know, a lot of my life has been doing everything I can to avoid feeling lonely. And everything I can to avoid feeling grief and everything I can to avoid feeling anything, really, outside of feeling high or feeling like the higher states, like love or lust or anger, you know, but like to really just let yourself like go into your chest, your heart, as they call it, but I wish they used a different term than heart because I think that's such a confusing thing for us these days. Because, you know, you hear a heart and you just think about that red, bloody muscle that they pull out of your chest in Indiana Jones movies. You don't, it's like an organ, you know, pumps blood through your whole body, but it's that when, I think when they say heart, they really just mean this energy center, your heart chakra, it's where the organ of your heart happens to be. But that's a thing a lot of people avoid and I certainly, certainly have, unless there's like a tsunami event that happens, like my mom died, that created a situation where I couldn't, I couldn't turn my back on the feeling of sorrow and loss. And so after my mom died, I had many, many moments of just breaking down and sobbing and sobbing and sobbing and holding myself and sobbing and just, I couldn't stop it. But, and a lot, I think that's a thing that a lot of us, you know, we put off feeling until our parents die or we put off feeling until some kind of like catastrophic event happens and then we get permission to feel or we just get overcome by it. But there's little, there's like smaller things too. There's always this level of suffering happening that I think that a lot of us are unaware of, you know, because we get taught to ignore it. So something about Jack Cornfield, human chamomile, crooning universal mother force, just saying that all of a sudden I just started like tears just started rolling down my face. Didn't want, did not want that to happen. I didn't want to be the middle-aged guy crying at a meditation retreat by himself. Definitely did not want to be that guy, but I was that guy. And that was day one. And it caught me by surprise. It was like a left hook. Cornfield threw a little love left hook. Cornfield was doing the knockout game, but as a spiritual teacher. And he was doing that to my ego where all of a sudden my ego is caught off guard and now I'm like, Oh God, I'm lonely. Holy shit. I'm lonely. There it is. And so that was the first like really cool experience. So then at this meditation retreat at night, this musician, Krishnadas plays. Now, if you've never heard of Krishnadas, I've played him a few times on this podcast. Krishnadas was a disciple of Neem Kerali Baba, just like Ramdas, just like Raghu. And he sings kirtans, which are these like spiritual chants, sort of like musical mantras basically. And kirtans are, I had forgotten this because I hadn't sung a kirtan a long, long time. I'd forgotten how intensely psychedelic these things were. And you know what else is psychedelic? The marijuana in Hawaii, holy God. Hawaiian marijuana is just, I don't know if it's the marijuana in Hawaii or the marijuana combining with the beautiful energy of Hawaii or what it is, but I just smoked some incredibly powerful marijuana. And I'm walking through, and again, man, I'm very closed off here. These people who've been practicing for meditation or have been really working on themselves for many, many years, they're very open and they're not like trying to be cool. And they're not trying to act like they're at a martini bar or something and they're James Bond. They're all very loving. They'll hug you just out of the blue. They give you authentic, real smiles. And if you end up saying something bad about yourself in front of them in a really sweet way, they won't correct you, but they'll point out like, why are you saying that about yourself? You are wonderful. So these people are very sweet. And when kirtans are happening, they don't have a problem dancing to the kirtans. Now people like me, human icicles, we don't wanna dance or do karaoke or do any of that stuff, because it just doesn't work with who we think we are. And so I'm walking to go sit down in a very, I guess I was gonna in a very formal way listen to ecstatic religious chanting. And I'm passing people who are dancing and one of them says, why don't you dance? And I'm like, I would not miss, I said, not in this incarnation. I'm not gonna dance to kirtans. What I look like, a hacky sack vendor. So I sat down and I'm sitting there. And what I just said to this very sweet person is still kind of reverberating in my head. I'm really high. And I'm sitting there and I started singing these kirtans. And this is when the second sledgehammer blows. Which is I'm sitting there, sort of like singing this kirtan, listening to the echo of what I just said. I had not this incarnation. Suddenly I'm looking at myself from this other place. It's like the kirtans are happening. It's very, very psychedelic. And I suddenly, I don't know what happened, but it was like I got the Google map zoom out for a second. And I saw the, this like, network of rules that I had assembled for myself. And one of them being, I don't, apparently one of them being, I don't dance to kirtans. And, but there are many, many, many, many others. That's just this whole web. I could just see it for a second. This whole framework of like, you know, SNM level rules that were just like wrapped and bound and tightened around this thing that was underneath it. And I looked at that being, and I saw that I didn't, that this being that I was looking at, this role or this ego thing that I had manufactured, when I saw it so clearly, I thought to myself, I would not wanna hang out with that guy. And then I realized that network of rules that I had formed for myself, that personality I was looking at reminded me of everyone I don't like. That was the two big things. And suddenly I realized, oh, holy shit, man. Everyone I don't like is actually just me. I'm, it's my inability to love myself. Because that's the big move, man. That's the move is that, are you gonna be able to cut the bondage straps that you've wrapped around your soul that represent your ego? Are you gonna be able to cut those? I don't know. But you could definitely, you can loosen them. And the way you loosen them is by, instead of rejecting yourself, instead of rejecting the you that doesn't dance to kirtans, rejecting the you that rolls its eyes secretly, rejecting the paranoid, fearful, dark you, the practices you find, you begin to, you start loving it. And that's the practice. I mean, it's not like you're gonna do it all at once. But even just instead of hiding from it, or pretending it's not there or pushing it down, just honestly appraising it and then doing what you can to love it. Because this is the next day, the exercise that they started doing, or I don't remember which day this was on, is they start, you know, it's a compassion exercise. So the exercises you, first you acknowledge how much you as a person have suffered in your life. And you have, you have suffered in your life. Because that is part of what happens when you get torpedoed out of a vagina into this dimension. And the same way that when a dolphin is born, that dolphin is guaranteed to be wet. There's no dry dolphins that are doing great. There's no dry dolphins. I mean, they might be temporarily dry or something, but it's not a great thing. There's no dry dolphins. In the same way, there's no humans, there's no way that you haven't suffered. You just have. And it doesn't, I know, I know you're thinking, oh no, my life's been good, my parents were great. I had everything I needed. I had food on the table, whatever it is, no way, you suffered. You did, you did. You might be hiding from it. By the way, I don't know who you are. Oh, lucky St. Light being with wonderful parents who are always had everything you needed. Lucky you, weirdo. I don't think you're out there, honestly. I think that's a phantom. I think in general, all of us have suffered, all of us have been rejected, all of us have, and some of us in some of the most extreme ways. But for some reason, we don't embrace ourselves and acknowledge the fact that we have suffered and that this ego thing that we have or this hardcore, this prison cell that we've constructed around ourselves, which is keeping us from being vulnerable, is there because we had to build it. Because at some phase in our lives, we had to protect ourselves from whatever was going on around us. It was just too much. We had to construct this safe cage, like in the walking dead, when they go hiding in the prison to stay away from the zombies. And we began confusing the cage with ourselves. And we began to hate the cage ourselves, our ego mechanism, instead of recognizing that it's a natural result of suffering, like a callus. You don't hate calluses on your hands. If you've been working, they're there to protect your hands. In the same way, when your consciousness comes into contact with the turbulent nature of the reality that we've been born into, it can and will produce calluses. And that's the ego, that's part of the ego. So you recognize, you see this whole thing that you've become, this personality, this series of mechanisms and defense mechanisms and habituations. And that's when you say, oh, I don't like myself, because really what you don't like is the cage. No one likes a cage. And then the next step is having compassion on that thing, because it's like, you have to realize, no, that's there for a reason. That happened for a reason. And here's the other fascinating thing. The person that you really dislike, the person that really rubs you the wrong way, the person that really, really annoys you or that you would like to shove out of a boat with an anchor tied to their necks, that person has suffered too. And in the game that I have played, and well, I'm sure I will probably continue to play it, not enlighten, just I realize some stuff at this thing. The game is, okay, you have this person and they suck, whoever it is. So in the equation of judgment, part of the equation of judgment is the person who sucks, and the other part of the equation is the person who's right. You have the right person and the wrong person. So for the whole judgment game to happen, you have this one fill in the blank, you know who it is, you probably just talked shit about them yesterday. Throw that person into the spotlight of your consciousness for a second and look at that person and whatever it is that they did, whatever it is that they did, you know? Maybe they're not as artistic as you, maybe they're not as artistic as you, but they got some success, or maybe they don't work as hard as you do, but they're getting more success than you do, or maybe they were cruel to you, they said something nasty to you, or maybe they ignored you, or maybe they actually stole from you, or stole your girlfriend, or your boyfriend, or whatever, you know? Here's the crazy thing. They have suffered immensely in this world. And you wanna see extreme examples of this, watch Locked Up Raw. And when you see these giant muscular prisoners who are like, you know, just so, so expressionless. And the only way they think they express is rage, or that they're frozen up, what you're seeing there is a being that is really, really suffering and has suffered in the most extreme ways. And when you start recognizing that first you recognize it in yourself, and then you recognize it in other people, the judgment game or the game of really hating people or getting to really get angry at a person, it just ruins the game. Because how can you really be angry at someone, and how can you really, really truly get off, get that nice hit off the anger pipe when you recognize that all you're looking at is a prison surrounding a very sad, hurting being. You might as well, the next time you wanna like really hate somebody, go to the local animal rescue and kick the cages that the puppies are in. Just go and shake a rescued dog's cage. That's what it's like. So that sort of, that happened to me. It was a suddenly I realized like, oh, shit, man. All of us are, of course, all of us are really, really suffering and hurting and lonely and grieving and sad and hiding from ourselves. And then you realize that. And all these things, it starts making this like, sort of ice prison around your consciousness start melting. And then, the final big moment for me, and I thought about not talking about this on the podcast because it feels kind of personal, it's extreme. In fact, it's the most extremely personal thing. I don't think I've, I mean, I've said so many like, weird, like, you know, embarrassing things, sex things, but I've never, I don't know that I've ever like, I've, oh, I'll just tell you guys, I'll just tell you guys, I'm not gonna keep saying that I tell you guys everything because you know I do. But this was like, I guess the final Sledgehammer event, which was at the end of this beautiful retreat, there's this, a Mala ceremony. And what happens is Ram Dass gives you chanting Mala's, which is a, which basically are chanting beads. And these beads sort of have tied in them threads from Maharaji, Ram Dass' guru, Neem Kareli Baba's blanket that he used to wear, which is really cool. So you get this Mala and Ram Dass gives it to you and you, you know, you bow to Ram Dass and or do whatever you wanna do. Everyone does something different. Like you're just gonna do whatever, whatever you do. It's a very curious situation to be in, to be standing and because everyone kind of gets in line, they do this. And it's really weird, man. I mean, at this point, you're like, you've been sort of warmed up and opened up by the retreat, but you're still like, I was still like, kind of locked down a little. And he gives you this, he gave me these beads and then I felt totally fine, just happy. I just felt really happy and fine. And then I walked outside of where the event was happening and I walked it over to sit out in the sun in this like nice manicured lawn and just out of nowhere, I just started sobbing. Like nervous breakdown level, just sobbing, but it wasn't like sick, bad crying. It was just this, it was crazy. It was like all the sadness of this year that I've had, my mom dying, cancer. Like all of this like pain came out really fast. And then not just pain though. Like all of this, it wasn't just pain. This is where it's really weird. It's this crazy intertwined like wave of feelings, like just happiness and like joy and thankfulness and feeling so grateful to exist at all and to be at such a beautiful place combining with like all the sadness that I've been and hurt and sorrow and grief that I've been repressing. Just all of it just came pouring out at once. So there I am at this resort in Hawaii, just crying like a baby, and I would stop and like try to wipe my eyes off because not everyone's at this retreat. So they're just looking over and seeing this weird bearded guy crying. They probably thought that my fiance or my new wife just drowned or got eaten by a shark or something. It was really embarrassing and awesome. And it kept happening. Like I'd stop and I'd wipe the tears away. I'd stop and be smiling and then bam, another wave. And then that happened a couple of more times. That I think was like me experiencing my heart opening up. Probably for the first time in a very long time. When my mom died, it opened up but it shut right back down. I couldn't help it. It just broke when my mom died. This is different. Or maybe not different, I don't know. Maybe opening your heart and heartbreak are just different words for the same thing. So that happened. Now, the other thing I took away from the retreat was, you know, I'm always trying to find like, what do I do? What's the practice? What do I do? And the other thing I took away, it's just so obvious because it's right there in front of you all the time. It's the three things that Neem Karali Baba told Ram Das to do when he came back to the United States. And these three things are love everyone, serve everyone and remember God. And that's why his foundation is called the Love, Serve, Remember Foundation. So the practice here is so very simple and that practice is love yourself first, work on yourself. You are the first being that you come in contact with in this dimension. That ego structure inside of you in your heart, that is a being, a thing that deserves your embrace, not your rejection. And yes, it's not, yes, it's a jerk. You are roommates with a dick probably, but you've got to love that person. You have to love that person that you are, that ego structure that represents the sort of stratification of your life, all the different, you know, like when you look at a cliff face and you could see the different geologic events that happened in the history of the earth. Well, you've got that, that's what your ego is. That's the role you're playing. It's these, it's the rings of a tree that have grown around your soul. And you start loving that, you start loving that as much as you can. And somehow when you start doing that, and I'm telling you, this is like not just, you're not gonna do it, there's no rush, doesn't happen in this lifetime, probably won't happen in several incarnations if you believe in that stuff. But just the, just dipping your toe in the waters of your heart, just playing around with it, just play around with the idea of loving yourself, of seeing yourself and loving yourself, just play around with it, of feeling again, play around with the idea of feeling again, of going into your heart and feeling so many people don't feel. And in fact, that scent, that anger, maybe that feeling of anger is actually just another name for pain. You know, like when your hand goes, falls asleep, and numbs out, it's like, that's, maybe that's what anger is. Or maybe anger is just your like, the collision of love meeting this prison. And that's, and it's that, it's like, maybe it's the feeling of anger is your soul stubbing its toe on the prison of your ego. Does that make sense? I don't know. But there's more feelings than anger, and there's more, and there's more feelings than that, like, than like, kind of the, than lust, or like, that's kind of like, graspy feeling that goes along with looking at porn, or like having, you know, trying to like, find happiness through fucking all the time. Not that you shouldn't, not that any of this is like, not, the whole point of all of this is like, you start loving the whole picture. And behind it, you know, behind all this stuff, there is, I, there is, here's the great hope. I have some childhood memories that I really like. One childhood memory that I have is when I was very, very young, way before the divorces, and way before, you know, the catastrophes of life happened, I can remember, I would walk with my mom to the beach, because we lived on St. Simon's Island in Georgia. And I can remember how good the flowers smelled, and I would, I still remember smelling this one flower, and just like, oh God, it just smelled so good, and life was so beautiful and simple. And you would go to the beach, and I remember looking down at my feet, wearing flip flops, and watching the way that they hit the ground as we walked towards the beach, and just feeling so good, and that went away. That feeling went away, and it got replaced, and it got replaced by the series of brief dopamine hits that happen when you get some success, or when you find a new girlfriend, or when you say something, when you win. Those brief kind of like fever-like jolts of adrenaline replaced this calm, peaceful sense of being happy with just the beauty of the world, which you get, which you have when you're a kid, and which kids have when you watch a child, you can see they have that. Here's the great hope. Underneath that prison, that weird, dark prison that encircles your heart, underneath that, there is the possibility that if you start waking that up, practicing what they call loving kindness for yourself, and for others, you can actually feel like that again. You can get that feeling back as an adult. And now you get that feeling back with all the extra experience and wisdom that you've gained from being in the world, and that's a beautiful, beautiful thing. And this is why there's so many different stories about the prodigal son, or about returning, returning, not even realizing, it's the fantasy when you're really pissed at your parents as a teenager, you might have this fantasy like maybe I was adopted and I'm the child of some billionaire. Yeah, some people have that. It's like that, but it's a million times better, because it's suddenly realizing that you can, after all the just suffering and grief and all being closed down and shut down, you can actually experience bliss again as an adult. And that's why they could always call this rebirth or being reborn, born again, as the Christians call it. That can actually happen, that's real. I'm not saying it happened to me, but definitely my walks have gotten better. I feel like my friendships have already gotten much better. I feel much closer to people and more grateful for my life than I've ever felt. And I imagine in like two weeks, it's gonna completely go away. I'll be gnashing my teeth and watching pornography on my Xbox One, completely having forgotten about all of this, but right now, it's great. And maybe it won't go away, you know, maybe it won't. You know, Rom Doss and the teachers, they do say that there is this kind of wave form to the whole thing, where you go up and down, up and down. Sometimes you're there and sometimes you're lost. So I'm sure that's gonna happen to me. And of course it has, I mean, there are throughout the day, you do have these different mood states and everything, but when you get these tools, or these kinds, these tools, really simple tools too, which is just love yourself. So even when you do fall away and you don't feel like you're Mahatma Gandhi spreading seeds of selfless love to the world, even when you do just feel like a swamp pig that just climbed out of a gutter, you get to practice loving that thing too. And so that's really cool about it. It gives you a practice, which is just to love yourself. And in the process of loving yourself and working on yourself, you will find yourself falling in love with everyone around you. And that is a blast. So that's the story of my meditation retreat. We have got an amazing podcast with Jack Cornfield, but before we jump into that, let's do some business. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Guys, listen, all spiritual talk, all the hummus, breath, talk aside. What's on the horizon? It's Christmas. Christmas is right around the corner. And sure, instead of just giving someone some material thing, you could sit down with them and be in the present moment with them and look them in the eyes and have them look you in the eyes and forget about your past and forget about the future and just be in a place of absolute nerve-onic bliss with them. Or you could buy them a Blu-ray DVD player that you can find on amazon.com. Let's face it, not all of us are ready to dive into the universal hot tub of love and embrace our human brothers and sisters by emotionally opening up our heart chakras so they could experience what it's like to finally be in the presence of non-judgment and understand that underneath their ego mechanisms is a glowing, beautiful, eternal love beam. We're just not there yet. We're not ready. It's not that part of the party for us in our current incarnation. So what can we do instead? We can buy people meaningless, useless chunks of plastic assembled in ways that will distract our nervous systems away from feeling for just a little bit longer. And there's so many wonderful things out there that will do that for us. TVs, computers, iPads, Kindles, you name it. We have got so many wonderful glowing, rectangular distraction mechanisms these days that Satan himself is considering coming back just so he can sit and zone out, staring at Instagram, swiping Tinder and allowing his already blackened heart to be numbed even more by the wonderful technologies that exist around us. It's Christmas. It's coming. The holiday that once designated the celebration of the solstice, the shifting of the seasons or the birth of love into the universe has been converted by the reptilians into a horrific materialistic ritual where we give each other presents. And it doesn't have to be that way. It's the intention behind it. But come on, let's face it. Most of us aren't giving gifts in a spiritual way. We're doing it because we feel like we have to. Bottom line, you can do what my stepdad did and opt out and say you're not gonna do a materialistic Christmas, fine. But the conditioning is so powerful and potent that not everyone's gonna understand. I'm not saying you have to succumb to the materialistic orgy that is upon us this year. Halloween for materialists is what Christmas is. I'm not saying you have to do that, but if you are going to succumb, if you are going to let the cobra of greed, stick its venomous fangs deep into your juggler vein and pollute your nervous system with the terrible guilt that comes because you feel like you didn't buy somebody a thing that was equivalently priced, if you're gonna really fall prey to this idiotic hypnosis machine that has us all by the shorthairs, then why not do it by going to amazon.com and going through our portal at dunkintrustle.com and supporting the Dunkin' Trustle Family Hour podcast. So at least when you are diving into the writhing, eyes-wide, shut level, horrific, horrific, not even horrific, but horrific celebration of lifelessness that is Christmas, you can at least support this podcast. Do it, matter, matter, matter, matter. Go crazy on amazon.com, amazon.com. It's a dispensary of so many different forms of matter. It's all there, any kind of matter conglomeration that you need, you can find it at amazon.com. You wanna find matter formed in the shape of a fancy Vitamix blender, it's there. And that's a great gift. Listen, if you've got an unhealthy friend and you wanna give them something that can really, really make them feel guilty for never using it, get them a Vitamix and let it just sit on their counter and stare at them. Like the Raven and that Edgar Allen Poe poem, mine does, I walk by it every day, you should see it stare at me. If it could shake its head at me, it would sadly shake its head at me, but I've got it. I've made some great shakes with it too and I'm going to revisit it one day, but right now it's not being used at all, nor is my Roomba, is that what it's called? Yeah, Roomba, I was thinking of Zoomba, the dance thing. You can even get somebody as Zoomba's dance DVD if you really wanna piss somebody off for Christmas. Look, if you're gonna engage in this satanic holiday that is disguised as some kind of moment where we're truly loving each other, which you will do and you can do, whether or not you have gifts or not, but if you really wanna just dive into the thing and just admit what it is, maybe get annoying gifts for people. Nothing will give a person, nothing will make a person feel more insecure than if you give them a Zoomba exercise DVD. Just do that. Wrap it up in the editorial section of a newspaper and give it to them. So many great things you can get people on amazon.com and you know what, not all giving has to be terrible. It's the intention behind it and you can give somebody something with love and you don't have to feel as though you've been sucked in by some corporate magnet and convinced that this is the only time of the year that you're supposed to buy things for people. You don't have to feel like you've been tricked or hypnotized. You can actually just ignore that you've been tricked and hypnotized and be in the moment and watch the eyes of your lover light up as you push something across the Christmas tree in her direction that more than likely she'll forget about in two weeks. Amazon.com, we've got a portal located at dunkintrustle.com. If you go through the Amazon portal, you will, Amazon gives us some small percentage of anything that you buy. So it's such an easy thing to do. The next time you find yourself late at night, stoned or drunk about to order that pentagram tapestry or the space heater that looks like a fireplace that seems like such a smart thing to buy. But when it comes, you'll realize what a sucker you are. Go to dunkintrustle.com and slide through our portal. Do it. They give us a small percentage and it's a way for you to support the podcast. We are also sponsored by Sure Design T-shirts. Sure Design T-shirts creates the softest T-shirts on planet Earth. Oh God, these shirts are soft. And I saw so many of them at the meditation retreat that I could only think that our campaign to eventually cover the entire planet in one giant Sure Design T-shirt is going to happen. They're wonderful shirts to wear at a meditation retreat. They've got pictures of Ganesh and they've got Sanskrit and alms and beautiful designs. And you can find them all by going to SureDesignT-shirts.com. And if you put my name in, you get 10% off. My God, these shirts are so soft. When I was snorkeling in Hawaii, one thing I forgot to mention is that I made love with a dolphin. And that was soft. That was very soft, but it still wasn't as soft as the feeling of a Sure Design T-shirt. It just couldn't compare. So go to SureDesignT-shirts.com, put my name in. You get 10% off. Finally, and then we'll get going with this podcast. We are sponsored by Audible.com. Audible is a purveyor of incredible audio books. And if you go to Audible trial, forward slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership, you get one free audio book. And then you can cancel your membership. You get to keep the audio book. What that means is if you wanna quickly get a Jack Cornfield lecture after reading or after listening to the interview with him, you can go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour and sign up and get a free Jack Cornfield book. And if you don't wanna pay a monthly fee to Audible, which you should do, because it's really cool to have an endless access to audio books, then you can cancel your membership. Get to keep the lecture. So, and of course, if you know one of your friends is a fan of the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, if you go to DuncanTressel.com, we've got shirts, we've got posters, and there's even a bonus episode, a Halloween bonus episode, which is completely not going to make any sense at this time of year. But if you just wanna listen to an extra episode and pay for it, it's there. If you don't wanna pay for it, I'm sure somebody's put it on a torrent site by now, or it's probably, who knows, it's probably on YouTube or something by now. And you don't have to pay for it. You can, if with like a couple of Google searches, I'm sure you can find it and listen to it for free. And you don't have to feel guilty about doing that. It's just a way that you could support the podcast. But I'm happy that you just listened to my raspy lesbian voice. And send me an email. Contact information is at DuncanTressel.com. Now this is a special podcast because I did it in conjunction with Raghu Marcus, who is the co-host of the Mind Rolling podcast. And you can find that at mindrollingpodcast.com. He does it with David Silver. And so you're gonna hear him on this podcast, along with me and Jack. And if you feel like maybe you wanna dive in and go to one of these Ram Dass retreats, you can go to ramdass.org. They have them twice a year. There's one coming up in the spring. And I'm going to be going to that one too. Today's guest is a world famous Buddhist teacher. He has written a ton of books, including the path of insight meditation, as well as a path with heart. You can go to his website, which is located at spiritrock.org. He does regular retreats and teachings so if you listen to this interview and you feel like you wanna get more info from him, definitely go to spiritrock.org. I'm gonna have links to all this stuff at dunkintrustle.com. If you can't remember it, it will be in the comments section of this website. Okay everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour, the great Jack Cornfield. We are here. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, we're here to be with you. Welcome to you, wow, wow, wow. It's Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. Four, five, six. So, we are here at the Open Your Heart and Paradise Retreat, Dunkin' Trussell and meet Raghu Marcus. And we've got a joint kind of podcast going on today, you know, Dunkin' and I, and we have Jack Cornfield. And Jack has been, well, we've known each other a very, very, very long time. He's part of our greater family that includes Buddhists as well as our bhakti people. I'm gonna have to start again because I forgot we gotta turn this down, turn this off. What was that? It sounded like an ice machine or something. Yeah, we'll have to live with that, but we got a hug on the, so let's just, can you roll it again? Yeah, we'll just keep rolling. Yeah. Take two. Hi, this is Raghu Marcus with my buddy Dunkin' Trussell. Hello. We're at the Open Your Heart and Paradise Retreat in Maui and boy, oh boy, we're looking out at the ocean and we just invited Jack Cornfield, who's one of the teachers from the retreat alongside of Ram Das and Krishna Das and Jack has his partner, Trudy Goodman here. So we're in pretty good shape, Dunkin'. Yeah, this is amazing. And Jack has been, has one of the three people, Jack is a very old friend. We met in India back in the day. And Jack is one of three people who are instrumental in bringing insight meditation back to the United States. And they started a center in Barry, Massachusetts, insight meditation center. And then you went off to California and in California, Jack runs Spirit Rock and is part of Spirit Rock, an incredible center on the west, so you have it covered on the east and the west side. And Jack has many, many, what's the latest books? I hope you've had up on Ram Das. Bringing Home the Dharma or The Wise Heart, all those are good. So, and you can get these on Amazon and you can go through whatever portal from Ram Das to Dunkin' Trestle family. So many portals to choose from. Yes, you can just swim right through, find the great vast openness with fish swimming and good Dharma for you. Yes, exactly. Now, so at this retreat, we've been, the theme of the retreat has been suffering and grace and how to work with suffering, how to see grace in our lives, how to open our hearts and make friends with the untoward that happens every day. So, Jack has been giving incredible talks with Trudy Goodman every morning. We're just halfway into it. Just tell me a little bit in its most nuts and bolts way, how do we deal with just the day-to-day separation is suffering, untoward things that happen to us is suffering, how do we make friends with suffering? Well, you just said it. You said how do we make friends with suffering. Because the fact is that life is human incarnation, this mysterious life that you find yourself in, you didn't even ask for and then there you find yourself in this human body with the wiggly things at the end, the little patches of fur and a vestigial tail, if you notice, little bits of claws that are left and the whole one end into which you stuff dead plants and animals and grind them up and glove them down through the tube and you ambulate in this human body by falling one direction and catching yourself and you fall the next direction, you catch yourself. It's really bizarre. All right, so here you are and you say, all right, what are the rules of the game? And part of what the rules of the game are is that human incarnation includes joy and sorrow, praise and blame, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, beginnings and endings, birth and death, sweet and sour, and you can't tease them apart. They actually come as a package. You know, if you take the ticket for the human ride, this is what you get. Then people think, well, I'm doing it wrong because somebody got sick or somebody died or, you know, there was some loss, even though there's also insanely beautiful days and great blessings and then you realize there's an unbearable beauty and ocean of tears and they make up human life. Then the question is not so much, what do you do with suffering? Suffering's the first noble truth of the Buddha. It's just included in the dance of humanity. And with that understanding, you can meet the suffering with a compassionate and open heart that says, oh yes, this is what humanity is like. And instead of being afraid or judging yourself and saying, I've done it wrong, which we do very well, you instead you say, ah, here we are. And you take in yourself, you take your seat, or you stand like the Buddha, looking out with a gaze of infinite compassion and say, this is human life. Let me live it in a way that brings sweetness and beauty to the world. When you say looking at something with a gaze of infinite compassion, you make it sound really easy. I'm looking at myself, when I came to this retreat, right before I came to this retreat, I got in a vicious text fight with my ex-girlfriend. I broke up with my ex-girlfriend over this retreat and I was angry and in the text, she's pointed out, it's pretty hilarious that we're fighting over a retreat. And then I thought about it and I thought, well, the reason I am going to a retreat is because I'm getting into these text fights with you. That's not because of you, but because that's where I'm at. So when you say, look through these eyes of compassion, I think of like, when I'm mindful and I see that anger or the fear body as you were calling it, it is not that easy to love that thing. In fact, I can look at it and say to it, I wish I could love you, but you seem like someone I wouldn't want to hang out with and I'm you. You're stuck, aren't you? Yes. I feel for you. Oh, thanks. But the truth is that we all have a personality. You get issued a body, this kind of human form, which is already pretty wild, and you get issued a personality and people think, well, if I do therapy or I do it right, then my personality will change and I'll be Buddha personality. I'll be some, I'll be Dalai Lama personality, but it's more like this. If you can love whoever of your family and friends come through the door, if you can see your neighbors travel to fantastic places without a twinge of jealousy, if you can sleep after a day of running around without a drink or a pill, if you can eat everything that's put on your plate, if you can find contentment just where you are, you are probably a dog. We have all these spiritual ideals and the very first step in meditation or in becoming conscious is to take a step back and make a bow and say, oh, wow, look at this package of neurosis and love and fear and confusion. The mind contains everything and if you think it shouldn't contain that, that's just judgment and then the judging mind comes and you can bow to it and say, oh, thank you for your judgment. You say, I hate judging and you bow to it and say, oh, hating too and I wish I could get better, wishing, wishing and the place of the awakened heart is the place in you that can take a breath and bow and say, oh, look at this, the tears, the text from your ex and then the rage that comes and the fact that the mind has no pride and not only that, it writes, it will sit there in meditation and it will choreograph a text, a killer, an assassin text that she's gonna get and she'll be both devastated and completely in love with you at the same time. That's how grandiose you are and then you say, man, what a magnificent anger that is, what a magnificent fantasy and you laugh and you take a bow and you say, here we are, we're being human. Anybody who's listening to this, who hasn't had trouble with their ex, hasn't had an ex. Right. Anybody who hasn't had trouble with their personality, hasn't looked at their personality, it's just the way it is and when you understand there's a kind of deep softening of the heart that says, yeah, we're in this together, it's not about becoming an ideal, it's actually, the point isn't to perfect yourself, it's to perfect your love. Oh. Now the question you ask is, well, how do you do that when you're trying to love somebody as neurotic, as we Americans and Canadians and Europeans and now it turns out all the new, you know, wealthy Indians and Chinese and modern people, little machine crazy, how do you do that? Mm-hmm. Yeah? So. How? How, how, how, how, how? Well, the first step, oh, you know, we teach loving kindness meditation and I'm not gonna, maybe you'll teach it here if you want, but it turns out that people can't love themselves very well in the West. We had this conversation with the Dalai Lama like 1988 or something, a group of us met with him who are also teachers and said what to do about how much self-hatred and unworthiness and self-judgment comes to people when they just try to sit and innocently sit and meditate. And he said, self-hatred? He didn't understand. He speaks pretty good English and he turned to Tuptenjimba, his translator and they went back and forth, oh, no, no, no, no, in Tibetan, you know, for a while. Cause there's no word in Tibetan for self-hatred. And then he looked up at this circle of us, you know, Sharon Saltzware, Robert Thurman, I forget who was there, a group of teachers. And he said, do you too have this self-hatred judgment? How many of you? Everyone's nodding. He paused for a minute. He said, mm, but this is a mistake. You know, so, why would you do that to yourself? All right, so what do you do is the question. Because you can't start loving kindness with yourself very easily. What you can do is this, even as you listen, picture the person who, a person, not the, a person where it's not so complicated, not like your ex, who loves you. And generally there'll be somebody, even could be your, the Dalai Lama, it could be your dog, you know, you come home and they'll go, they love you when you walk in the door. Picture this being that loves you, you know, and you look at them and you wish them well cause you love them too. You say, may you be well, you know, I hope you to be safe and, you know, healthy and all the things of love that you wish for somebody you care about. Maybe you picture a second person. There they are, these people. May you be well, may you be safe, may you be protected, may you, may you be happy. And then when you feel your heart begin to open a little bit, like the camera dilates open the lens, only when it gets a tiny bit sweet, then you imagine that they look back at you and they see you, they see you as a child. There you were, this little Duncan going around being completely innocent and wacky and cool and wonderful as little kids are. And they see you now grown up forgetting that original innocence. And they look at you and they say, Duncan, just as you would wish me to be well and happy and safe, I want that for you. And you feel from their eyes and their gaze, imagine they put their hand on your heart and they say, listen, man or woman, whoever it is, you're all right, we love you, you're wacky, we all are, we're human. And may you be safe, may you be kind to yourself, may you be well. And gradually you start to take it in and you realize, oh, just as these people who I care about and all for love to look at me, they want the same for me, maybe I could even wish that for myself. And you do a little bit and you realize I can't do it, it's impossible, it feels dead, it feels stupid, it feels mechanical. And then you know what you do with that? You hold the same, all those thoughts with the same kindness and say, wow, today it's a hard day to love myself and you love that. Now the other thing to say is that it's a practice. So a man wrote to the IRS and he said, I haven't been able to sleep because I cheated on my taxes in 2010 and 2011, can't sleep. So I've enclosed an anonymous bank check for $2,000. If I still can't sleep, I'll send the rest. And that's really why we talk about practice. Because it doesn't happen all at once. You say I wanna forgive and you forgive a little bit and you say, yeah, but that SOB, I'll never forgive that person. I can't love that in myself. But you love a little bit and you add a little more and pretty soon you start to feel like, actually feels kind of good to be kind and then your heart shrivels, so yeah, but I hate that person. That doesn't feel that great. You go there, there, it's okay. Not in some superficial way. But in the way that in that moment when somebody has really cared about you, maybe you were little, maybe it was your grandmother or grandfather, maybe it was the gardener or your uncle, somebody saw you, somebody saw how cool you are underneath all the guises and they just appreciate it and love you and you remember, oh yes, and you let it in. Yes. You know, what you're saying, I mean, we have gone through so much as children in the culture that we came from and used to. And His Holiness talks about mother is the most important thing that can happen to anybody in terms of being a whole person. And then, so we weren't that. And then we went to India and I'm the Ramadans, Krishna as myself, whoever. And we met this being who did what was necessary. They loved you just as you are, yeah, yeah. Exactly, so I'm thinking, oh, Jesus, that. You're lucky. Big piece of grace, lucky, whatever. But the beautiful thing is that you don't have to go to India. That actually India has come to you and the amazing thing is now we're getting invitations to go back to India to teach in India or to teach in Burma and places. They say, oh, you guys have figured this out for the modern world, you've got neuroscience, you've got the trainings and compassion. Come and show us. Yes. Now you sit down, you decide, all right, I'm going to try to learn these ancient beautiful arts of love, whether you had your guru in India or what turns out as your guru said, your guru's actually here with you, inside you. And the first thing you encounter is your own mind. My friend, Annie Lamott, the humorist, she writes, my mind is like a bad neighborhood. I try not to go there alone, right? So you sit and you go, oh my God, it's streams of thoughts and plans and memories and judgments and you take a few breaths and you take a seat halfway between heaven and earth and you say, that's the mind, it secretes thoughts the way the salivary glands secrete saliva. It just has a stream of images and thoughts, praise and blame and pleasure and it likes this and doesn't like that. And you say, thank you for your opinion, you kind of bow to it and then you rest in the heart and then the emotions come. And you feel when you get quiet, your grief for the earth, for the global warming and the loss of species and the tears and then the great environmentalist, Gary Snyder said, we said, well, what should we do about this? He said, don't feel guilty, you won't fix it. If you get angry and get guilty, it just adds to it. Greed, hatred, that's what made the problem. He said, if you want to serve the world or save it, do it because you love it. So you sit and you feel your concerns and you realize that you've been put here with the gift of your life and you could do something cool with it. It might be start a, do a startup or it might be start a family or a garden or business, but you take that and you plant beautiful seeds with what you've got. And you know, your soil's a little rocky dude. So what do you do? You know, you clear it a little bit, you put a little. My soil is a rock. Yeah, you put a little fertilizer on that puppy, you plant another seed and you begin to trust that if there is a good seed there, it will grow. Well, I, you know, I love all of this. And, you know, since when I came here, I was completely frozen, definitely thought out in- You look thought. You look thought. Instead of saying you look chilled, you look thought, right? I feel very thought out. But I think about the pragmatic, like how, I think about like this, I'm just using this relationship only because it just ended and it's the most relevant thing to me. And you can't divorce your ex, right? So they're there with you, right? But I think about how as the thing's falling apart and I'm beginning to realize that this relationship is a hope, it's not meant to be. I started meditating really hard. You know, when you start meditating hard- That's desperate. You're really desperate. Yes, yes, yes, exactly. Desperation meditation. So I'm walking up and down the river, chanting, praying. And then I realized that this is just a, I'm actually using this process as a way to procrastinate action. So it seems like everything that you're saying is incredibly beautiful, but at what point are you, do you need to stop loving the part of yourself that has too many beers at night? And at what point do you need to stop loving the part of yourself that yells at people who haven't really done anything to deserve it? Well, when you talk about that, I'll answer that in a second, but the first thing that I hear when you're in a sense distracting yourself is that you're doing it because the grief is too hard to bear. It's not just that, you know, you've got to do something else, but actually you're feeling the loss. I tried to love this person. She was actually pretty cool, but I'm such a slap, I didn't do it right, or she and I, we got in the wrong, or our wavelength, or something happened. And then you feel the tears in your heart, and that's hard to bear sometimes. You think I can't bear it, you know? And my friend, Maladoma Somay, who's a West African shaman and medicine man, he came to America after his initiation, and it says, if his psyche and his third eye, whatever you want to call that magic, where you intuit and see, he said, your streets are full of the ungrieved dead. He said, the homeless people who died without anyone to care for them, the people in the ICU who had good nurses, but no family were there, the people in the old age homes, he said, in our culture, everybody knows someone, we're in a village, and when they're in trouble, the village knows you're in trouble. It's like auntie or uncle, it would be, you know, auntie Condoleezza, and uncle Colin Powell, and right like that, auntie Hillary. Everybody's your relative, but here we don't know that, so we feel so alone. So then the next step is to let, as you sit, to actually let the tears come. They're called the tears of the way, not be afraid to let the tears fall, because those tears water the heart too, and you go, oh, underneath those tears is the steep longing to love and be loved. And then after the tears, flow a little bit, and that's not, you know, oh my gosh, so pity, you know, it doesn't matter. You just let yourself feel it, and you grieve, because you not only carry your grief, you carry the grief of the world in your heart, and you turn on the news, and you could weep. What's happened in Africa, or Asia, or America, it doesn't matter. And after the tears, and the heart softens, then the mind starts to get a little bit quiet. And then you say, all right, let me listen to my heart, not to my mind that says, she said, and I said, and I'm good, and she's not bad, and whatever. And you say, what's my best intention? In the next text that I sent her, I could get even, I could be right, all those things which we like to do, our ego feel like, I gotta show that I've got some. And instead, you quiet yourself when you say, what's my best intention? Or there you are actually in an argument with somebody, and your move is to prove yourself right, and say, here you're wrong, I'm right, here's how it really is. And then if you take two breaths, and just take a pause in yourself for a second, and say, what do I most want, what's the best intention? So, well, underneath it all, it's not just to be right, or prove, I wanna connect, I wanna love this person, I wanna be loved, and then all of a sudden you realize, well, maybe that text I was gonna send, I need to rephrase it a little bit. Maybe that email I was gonna respond to, ah, before I press send, my intention says, oh, it's a little different than that, it's not just to be, you know, this way, I actually wanna connect with this person. And if you listen to the heart, it begins to remind you that that's what matters, and you do it, and you practice it. And Annie, I'm not Annie, and Julia Childs, the French, wonderful French chef, big cooking show on television, she says, it's very simple, if you're in the kitchen, and you drop the lamb, you can just pick it up, who's gonna know, right? And in the same way with spiritual practice, you mess up, you will a thousand times, you say, all right, that text wasn't so cool, let me try another version of it, and you send again, say, you know, when I really listened, what I wanted to say was this, and you practice, and what happens is, anything, if you practice piano, if you practice flying an airplane, you practice coding, after a while, you actually can fly or play music, you can actually practice love. I don't wanna cry. You're invited, you're these teachers, what you guys do is you invite us to dive into this blender, and it's really scary, and we think, you know, you hear meditation, you hear meditation, retreat, you think about a whole different version of what this is, and the thing that you're pointing to is exactly right, but the bull's eye is not, it's not initially pleasant, the thing you're talking about is, I mean, I do wanna cry, I like it when it happens, but it's a very scary thing, it's scary, it's terrifying. So when you stop running, and here, this is, here's a kind of indictment of American culture, a modern culture by Ann Wilson Schaeff, who wrote The Addicted Society, she says, the best adjusted person in our society is the person who's not dead and not alive, just numb, a zombie. When you're dead, you're not able to do any work for the society, so it doesn't want you that way, but if you're fully alive, then you must constantly say no to many of the destructive processes of the society, the racism, the polluted environment, the nuclear threat, the arms race, drinking unsafe water, eating carcinogenic foods. Thus it is in the interest of modern consumer society to promote the things that take the edge off, and keep us busy as worker bees, keep us slightly numbed out and zombie-like. In this way, modern consumer society itself functions as an addict. And so we're kept distracted from ourselves, and then when you stop, like any addict, it's not just your pain, it's like, oh my God, how do I stop? I wanna come back to myself, but then there's fear and judgment and all these tears for the animals that are dying or the fact that, you know, I got wasted so many times in the last month, and I don't wanna live my life that way. Right. So here's the deal, you find your way, and sometimes you can't do it alone. Like Annie Lamott said, you know, your mind is a bad neighborhood, you need to find friends to go with you. You find some place, it can be the local yoga studio, the local sitting group, the people who, like you, realize it's time to wake up together. And maybe in your meditation practice, or your heart practice, together with them. Because otherwise you just run screaming out of the room at first, and then you realize, oh, I can tolerate a little bit, and then it gets worse. You sit there, you think it's gonna be cool. Right. Okay, now I'm sitting, and I'm gonna become this wise young person that likes Buddha on the block. Yes. And your loneliness hits, and you think you're gonna die of loneliness. Or you get insanely bored, I'm so bored. And the instruction is just to become the witness with this loving awareness, to begin to witness and name things, okay, this is loneliness, oh, I hate this loneliness, oh, this is hating. This is boredom, this is restlessness. Because if you don't find a way to sit with your loneliness, to let it cut more deeply, to let it season you, as the poet says, then the minute you get a little bit lonely, or bored, what do you do? You open the refrigerator, you go online, you do anything, you do the addictive thing, which we all do, our society says, distract yourself. But so you can't bear to be with yourself, and you can't actually, so you're doing this amazing and beautiful and great thing. You become the, you know, the yogi that you saw on those images in the saints in India, you become the Zen student in Kyoto, but you do it in your own home, or with your friends, and you realize, I can bear this, I can tolerate this, and I name it lonely, lonely, oh gosh, restlessness, restlessness. I wish this would go away, wishing, wishing. I feel like I'm gonna die, dying, dying. I wonder what I'm gonna do for dinner. Should we get pizza, or should we go out? Because the mind has no pride, we'll do that. Okay, dying, dying again, planning, planning, desire. And you start to see that you become the space of witnessing which can allow this with a gracious heart, and you realize you can trust your awareness, you can trust the capacity to be present for yourself, and then you can be there for the things that you love and care about. It's beautiful, but it's, you know, it's a lot of work. What you're talking about is, reminds me of, not even realizing that you, you know, have you ever seen that show, Hoarders? Oh yeah. So it reminds me of suddenly realizing that you are a hoarder, and that your mind is equivalent to one of these houses. It's great, I love it. Packed with just a piece of paper. Old newspapers, and, and you realize like, kitty litter, and yes, and a clean up. And crap from your third grade class, right? Exactly. And so it's not like, that's something I got out of this retreat. I feel great, but I've realized like, oh God, so much work. It seems like so much work, which is something I'm not really that fond of. Hey, wait, what work? The work is to, exactly what are you saying, which is that instead of avoiding, first of all, it's a real mind-blower when you say, you know, and it's obvious to you, but when you say from chanting and from meditating, you are actually just avoiding grief. That is a real mind-melter. It's real, because that undercut. The little spiritual bypass, trying to use your spiritual practice to not actually feel the, the direct immediate experience. And that's the work I'm talking about, Raghu. That's the, the, the, the having to go back into that place and then soften up. And also, what about the fact that when you go into this numbness, this cultural numbness, and you've been numb for years, what about the fact that you might not be surrounded by Jack cornfields and Raghu marquises and Ramdhases? You know, you might be around other numb people and have nowhere to go and no, no access to these communities. That makes it harder, but actually you're not alone. There are millions of you waking up. There are millions of beings who are not asleep, whose hearts are open, and I see them everywhere. I see them when I go in the hospital. There's this woman cleaning bedpans and, you know, tending to somebody who's sick, who's just beaming. And, you know, maybe she grew up and talked about parents, you know, in some culture where they still held their children and she carries that radiance from Jamaica or the Philippines or someplace where that family was still intact or maybe she grew up here. But I see human goodness in lots of places. Now, it's true, you can be surrounded by that and you think that's the way the world is, but it isn't, actually. There are a thousand, thousand acts of goodness that are also happening from the littlest gesture of people planning their flower gardens to stopping at the red lights so you can go green. I mean, if you begin to look at how people are caring for each other, you can also tune to that. And yes, there's an unconsciousness about it. The thing about the work is it's not like, okay, now I'm gonna make myself a big project and I'm gonna get a bachelor's degree and then a master's degree and a damn PhD in spirituality and I'll be the great master and I'll go to great international conferences and be lauded. There's nothing more sorrowful than international spiritual conferences. You don't need to go to those, right? That's suffering. Instead, the work is to be where you are. It makes it so much simpler and Raghu was sort of pointing to that when you said, well, what's the work? The work isn't to become somebody else or go somewhere. It's to say, all right, here I am. I'm in the slums of the country, you know? Or I'm in the slums of my own heart and there's graffiti and there's, you know, it's tough. And what seeds am I gonna plant in these slums? Am I gonna sweep the doorstep and plant a little garden? And I have seen even in the slums, people with so much dignity. It's just the way Nelson Mandela, who died yesterday, walked out of 27 years of Robin Island prison with so much graciousness and forgiveness and dignity. They can put your body in prison. You can be surrounded by difficult people. No one can take your dignity. No one can take your fundamental nobility. And no one can take your spirit, the spirit of your heart. That is yours to choose in any circumstance. I mean, you realize that that's tremendously empowering and beautiful. Intention, I wanted to talk to Jack about intention and you have brought it up because in talking about, boy, it's a lot of work to hustle myself into an open hearted place or whatever. Whatever you gotta do. There's a basic, and this is what I'd love for you to talk about, there's a basic intention. It's the intention you emailed ramdas.org and said, I'd like to help you out because ramdas has done something for me. And it was your, it's all about intention. And then that's part of, we talked about in this retreat, it's part of grace. I think that there's a big connection with that natural intention or desire to be good to oneself, love oneself and start to love one another. I mean, talk to me about intention. Well, the simplest thing about intention, which we actually started to talk about a little bit before, is to take a pause. I like to call it the mindful pause, the sacred pause. It can be a few breaths when you're in an argument or it can be in the morning or evening or you just sit quietly for a minute or two or three. And when the mind starts to quiet, and you say, all right, here I am, next day of my life, next year of my life. And then you have a little conversation with your heart. Most cultures know you can actually listen to your heart. We're not taught that in school. You're taught to do everything outside, read, write, do math. But nobody teaches emotional and social intelligence, listening to the heart, listening to another. So you quiet yourself and you talk to your heart and you say, what's my best intention for the day? What's my deepest intention? And when I go off to this circumstance, it's hard at work. Or when I go off to try to manage this part of my life, what's my best intention? And when you get in touch with that best intention, it can be very, very simple. I actually want to be kind. I want people to find a way to be caring for one another. I want something good to happen on the earth. And so I want to be contributing to that rather than destruction. When you listen, the heart speaks a good intention. And then through the day, almost like checking the compass. You check your smartphone, but this is like the smart heart phone, right? You turn and you say, okay, what was that intention again? Oh yeah, takes a breath. And then you feel that. Now there's long-term intention. The Dalai Lama wakes up in the morning and he says, the Shanti David prayer, may I be a bridge, a raft, a boat for those to cross the flood? May I be medicine for the sick? May I be food for the hungry? May I be a resting place for the weary? May I be a lamp for those lost in the darkness? May I offer my life for the benefit of all beings? It's his Bodhisattva vow. And of course that sounds like, oh how I could ever do that. But you can do it in the simplest way. All this is incredibly simple. My intention today is to stay in my own body, right? To actually stay here and open to this mysterious life, not be somewhere else. Cause there's that line from James Joyce where he wrote of a character. Mr. Duffy lived a short distance from his body, right? And we do in the addictions. I really like Gonzo, right? But if you don't live here, you don't taste the slice of tangerine. You don't see the eyes of that child. You don't see the lavender light reflected in the rain puddles just as the sun is setting, you know? Or the little buds on the trees poking out, even out of the snow saying that someday spring is gonna come and it always will. It's like the poet Pablo Neruda says, you can pick all the flowers, but you can't stop the spring. There is a life force that pushes grass up through the sidewalks, through the cracks in it. And it will not stop and it's in you. And you get a little quiet and you feel that life force. You're gonna say, what's the sweetest, most important, deepest, most honorable intention? What has dignity in it? And you hear that voice and then you return to it. And you could call it the voice of wisdom, the voice of compassion, the voice of, it has all kinds of names of Jesus and Mary and Maharaji and all the saints. Everybody in the world when they listen deeply can ask this question, what is my best intention? And it changes everything. Is it okay to make up the intention? It's great. Sure, it's all made up. It's absolutely all made up. And you know, it's like doing the loving kindness practice. See, that's why it's called its practice. Sometimes it feels opposite. I hate them, I'm never gonna forgive them. And they say, well, let me pretend. Part of it is you kind of pretend you're enlightened a little bit. And then maybe little by little you start to actually feel it and you're like, hey, not bad to pretend this. And people want mine. The point is that you're not supposed to become a Buddhist. You're supposed to become a Buddha, right? Spare your friends and family from being a Buddhist or a Hindu or any of that stuff. The point is, and to do that, you can pretend a little bit. All right, today I'm gonna pretend that I'm gonna live a more wiser, more gracious life. And sometimes it'll work, sometimes it won't, but that's okay, I'm gonna pretend a little more. And you start to feel that as an experiment. What's it feel like when you actually do it, even for a moment? It's beautiful. Sorry, you guys, we lost that. This is great. Is this good? Thank you so much. We lost audio? I'm just gonna. Oh, battery. I think it's a battery left. This is really good. Really, really good. Did we catch that part about faking it? We have the boom too, so. Perfect, yeah. No, but we don't want to turn it back. Let's go back. We're rolling again. So the question is, coming from the idea of like full numb, 100% pure American numb, deep, deep ice. Yes. So you don't feel an intention, you don't feel anything, you feel like the dentist freezes your mouth. So the question is, is it okay to make up an intention that you think would be a good idea? Absolutely, yeah, I mean, what do they say in 12 step, fake it till you make it? The thing is that it's all made up. And the Buddha begins the Dhammapada, all is created out of the mind, the mind in the heart. It's the same word in Sanskrit. How you live your life, the circumstances change, praise and blame, and gain and loss, but really it comes from how do you navigate this? And so of course it's fine to make it up in practice and fake it and pretend. And then after a little while you say, pretending to be kind to people actually, gets me a little bit further than being an ass. Yes. And you start to realize, there's a little bit of a choice here, or you're completely frozen and numb. And before you even fake it, you ask yourself, well, what would bring a little bit of thought? And you say, well, I wanna, and it's not just an addictive thing. I wanna eat something that's actually nourishing, that feels good, and you do that. It's like, you can take care of yourself. I wanna have a nice, a decent meal. I wanna take a little bit of a walk, just to kind of calm myself down. Maybe I'll read just a little bit this passage from, be here now or from, I'll listen to a podcast from Duncan. I'll do something that kind of reminds me, oh yeah, there's a whole other way to be. Then I'm gonna sit quietly. And now it's like you can feel the ice beginning to soften a little bit, and you notice that inside, they're frozen way deep down there is your heart. And you kinda look at it and say, hey baby, how is it? And they're just, oh god, it's so cold. I've been so busy in so far. Say that's okay, that's okay. You're just being kind and okay, and the heart starts to beat a little bit inside the ice. And that's when your dad says, so you're going to Hawaii and meet your gay guru. That's it. And you say to your dad, that's beautiful. What'd you say to your dad? I thought about it, cause I was gonna get mad. And then I'm like, uh... He's right. You're right. Yeah, I'm going to Hawaii. Not only that it's great, the guru's gay. You notice there's something wrong with that and your point is, you know? He's jealous, that's no problem. He would say, dad, come on, it's really good snorkeling. And you don't even have to be gay to do it. They leave the gay part to him and you could if you want, but come on, my ties, nice snorkeling. Okay, maybe I'm so glad. Aren't you glad your son gets to do this? It's beautiful, what you're saying is so beautiful and I think a misconception that people have is that this is a passive, weak sort of work when it's the opposite. It takes this incredible courage to start thawing out your heart. You know, I'm sure when people have frozen their hands mountain climbing, I bet when their hands start thawing out, it hurts like hell. It's not a great feeling. And so a lot of us are pain adverse, you know? So it's a very courageous thing to do this and your face, I think the thing that you were faced with is not just that challenge, but also the challenge of having all these relationships with other people that involve a communication of biting each other, you know, or of clawing at each other and suddenly you wanna stop clawing and the other person's like, wait a minute, we've been clawing each other for years. I, it doesn't feel right to stop this war. Yeah, in the Dow it says the philosopher is wedded to his opponent. I mean, if you don't have somebody to argue with what kind of relation and it was true and my fact a really painful family situation, what's new, lots of people do. My father was kind of a brilliant biophysicist and taught in medical school and did space medicine and army biological warfare, all kind of weird stuff, but he was violent and paranoid and a wife batterer and all this stuff, you know? And I didn't wanna be like him. So I was gonna be chilled and never get angry. Then I realized when I started to meditate that because I wasn't gonna be like him, I had suppressed everything, it was all done. And I realized there are a lot of things that pissed me off, you know, but I didn't know what to do with it, I didn't know how to handle it. And then I began to realize, oh, okay, these are the forces of humanity. Fear and anger are part of being human, just as love and joy are part of being human. And my teacher said, you take your seat and when fear comes, you name it, fear, fear. And then you say, oh, but this is so terrible. I feel like, you know, I'm gonna panic. And then you name that, oh, panicking, panicking. And you discover that you can stay where you are little by little with some practice. And realize that those are just waves of feelings and who you are is so much bigger than that. Who you are is the loving, the space of awareness that says, wow, what an incarnation. I've come thought, I'm frozen, I'm afraid, I'm not. All those things come and go and you become the space. Now the practice, like on my website and various books, there are these trainings of forgiveness meditation or trainings in loving kindness or training compassion. My teacher said, all right, do this forgiveness practice, forgive yourself, which is a big piece, or forgive other people little by little. And he said, here's a training, it's a five or 10 minute practice of forgiveness. Do it twice a day for the next six months and then come and let me know how it's going. What that meant was do it 300 times. I would do it sometimes, I would hate that person, I'm not gonna forgive that person, never, never, never they did this, you know. And then I remember the story of the two ex-prisoners of war and one says to the other, have you forgiven your captors yet? And the second was after what they did to us and have never and the first man looks at him and says, well then, they still have you in prison, don't they? Wow. Because those people that it's hard to forgive, they could actually be on Hawaii having a nice vacation, right? And there you are in Cleveland freezing you and you're hating or hating him. Well, you know, who's suffering, you are. And then you begin to realize, okay, I don't wanna close my heart, I don't wanna shut myself down, I don't wanna carry the hatred, not for them, you're not forgiving them, but because that's not who you wanna be, that's not who you are. Now it's political too, you talk about it being hard. Everybody who's listening, who's even half awake realizes that the modern world is in trouble and that no amount of science and technology of nanotechnology and biotechnology and computers and internet and smartphones and all of that stuff is gonna stop continuing warfare. It's not gonna stop continuing racism or environmental destruction or destruction of species. The outer developments of the world need to be matched by inner human development. We are a nation of nuclear giants, said one of our generals, and ethical infants. And there's some way in which we as a species now have to develop the inner technologies, which is really what we're talking about. All the modern neuroscience shows greater neuroplasticity, greater emotional resiliency, ability to focus attention, integrative fibers in the brain, faster healing, extended telomeres that keep you from aging. All those things come from the simple practices of training of mindfulness and awareness and compassion. We know it now, we can put it in our schools, we can put it in our education, we can put it in our healing systems as we do. But underneath it, what's called for right now is a change of consciousness. And either you go along and be asleep as a sheep, or you practice, say, okay, we're gonna practice hating other people and greed and so forth, it doesn't really make you happy. Or you say, no, the world needs something different. And you become part of that awakening that you are joining in with 1,000 other beings on your block, you don't even know it. And the block next door, they're all kind of in secret, they're hiding in the closet or whatever, but they're there. And when you show yourself a little bit, you start to see that they're all around you. Wow. We should, first of all, JackCornfield.org. Sure, and there's a whole, if you go on the line, K-O-R-N-F-I-E-L-D, Jack. Call the wings, they'll be at DuncanTrustle.com. And mindrollingbycast.com. But the point is, there are wonderful practices. Many practices, that's what we're talking about. There's one thing, we're getting close to the end, but I do want to talk about, I want to hear from you about, and that when we talk about somebody awakening, we're talking a lot here, we're referring to your basic, who you are, your audience, your confereces, and so on. And when I first heard, I mean, Ramdas, we're at a Ramdas retreat with Jack, when I first heard him, one of the most inviting things was, honesty, he was honest with himself. And it led us to be able to say, shit, we can be honest with ourselves too. We don't have to hide, we don't have to hide the shadow. We can have, and that was a major process alongside awakening, or with our awakening. So, can you talk about, and I said, yeah, yeah, yeah. Truth is the most difficult to pass you, difficult path. So, maybe talking about that. Yeah, there's a part of us, part of us doesn't know ourselves so well, and all you have to do is get quiet a little bit, and other parts show themselves, because we've been numbed out, and then part of us doesn't want to see what we discover, self-knowledge seems like it's bad news, but it's actually just seeing the personality. When I sat first as a young man, and I was in my early 20s in this wild monastery in the border of Laos and Thailand in the jungles, because I'd heard about Zen masters, and I thought, I'm going to go seek out the real deal. Let me see if it's actually there. And it was, which was really fantastic. Took a while to get there and find it, but went through the Peace Corps and did all these things. But I found this great teacher, and I thought, oh, now I'll be happy. And I start to meditate. Now things are going to be good, and things got worse. Things got worse because I had to sit with my loneliness, or my fears, or my boredom, or the things that I didn't like about myself. I'd look in the mirror and go, oh, you know. And then my teacher would smile at me, and sometimes he would even, it's like you, like your guru would sort of read mine and say, oh, unworthiness today, huh? And he would just do it with so much law, where he'd say, oh, a lot of self-judgment isn't there. And it wasn't like you shouldn't have self-judgment or unworthiness, or I got really sick with malaria. And he said, sick, huh? I had this great fever, and they gave me some medicine. And he said, yeah, we've all had it. He said, so sick, it makes you want to run home and cry and be with your mama, right? I said, yeah, he said, yeah, this is called sickness. We've all had it, those of us who live in the jungle. We all had malaria. He said, you can bear it. There's much better medicine now. We've given you some, you'll get over it in a few days. And the moment that he said, you know, you can do this. We've all been there. We've all felt this. We've all felt our fear and our loneliness and our disappointment. It's part of the human heart. And he would say, oh, disappointed today, aren't you? He goes, ah, he knows. And there was so much love in it, because it was truth, it was acceptance. And then I could see in others and not judge them so much. So, so simple. May I ask just one more quick question? Yeah, yeah. So, this is, what is something people listening right now can do in this moment or when they stop listening to this podcast to move them in the direction of learning to love themselves and thawing out the giant black chunk of polluted ice surrounding their heart? I love your description. I mean, I think that's, I think that's artistic. And in part, it's true. In part, it's true. You've got that giant black frozen ice and it's got like, you know, old tires and you know, it's got trash and it's got exactly nuclear stuff. And it's got all the exhaust from buses in there. Yes, exactly. And not only that, it has, you know, it has stuff from your third grade and your fifth grade all buried and twisted. Every nasty text you ever sent is frozen in that ice. Yeah, it is, it is. And then it's, you know, when it starts to thaw out, then you feel the regret from those and you feel that and so forth. So, if you see your task as one of trying to fix yourself, okay, I'm gonna do spiritual practice and it's like a grim duty, okay? I'll go to therapy and I'll do my Pilates and my Qigong and you know, I'll go to yoga and, you know, I'll buff myself up and I'll take some courses and stuff like that. It's like endless, you know, it's like you're gonna go and shovel all that. But the task isn't to perfect yourself. As we said before, it's really to perfect your love. And I think that's a great thing to do. And what you can do today is to begin and take a seat for a little bit and you can do one of two things. Either you can just sit, put your hand on your heart, feel your breath and feel actually how you care for yourself. You must say, I don't, but if you step out off the curb and a car comes careening around the corner, just where you are, your body jumps back because you wanna live, you protect yourself and feel that, that you actually do wanna protect yourself. Put your hands and say, yeah, there's black ice and there's fear and there's confusion like every single human being. And you just hold yourself with that respect. It's almost like you're bowing saying, yeah, here we are, we're in this human incarnation. This is what you're given, you get a body, a mind, you get, your culture is all embedded in there and you can either fight it and be angry and conflict all the time or you can discover that there's a greater power, which is what Nelson Mandela and Aung San Suu Chi walks out of prison 17 years. She said, they never had me in prison because I never hated them. And you realize that you in this moment could switch the channel just a little bit and say, all right, here I am, I've got my suffering, I have my tears, I have my addictions, I have all this. And the first step is to be honest, to say I have all this and it's not who I really am, it's not all of who I am, it's just a part of me. And it's a part of everybody human. You take a breath, you put your hand in your heart and you say to yourself, what if I were just to become a little bit kinder today to myself? What if I were to be a little bit sweeter? Let me try that out. What if I were to be a little bit more compassionate? And all of a sudden you start to realize it's like the army lieutenant, I told this story in there, who got angry a lot and then he started to train in mindfulness and he was in line in the supermarket and this woman was holding a baby and talking and the checkout counter, he got angrier and angrier. You know, like there's a long line, doesn't she see? And he got up there and started to talk to her and she said, did you see that little boy? He's my boy. He said, oh, she said, yeah, my husband was in the army like you, but he was killed in Afghanistan last year. And so now I have to work all the time and my mom takes care of my boy and she just tries to bring him in once a day so I can see him. And all of a sudden all his judgment melted him away and we're so judgmental of one another and his judgment of himself. And he began to realize, oh, we're in it together. This is us, this is family, you know how family is, it's a mess, but also it's beautiful, it produced you, it's gonna produce more life. And you say, all right, baby, I'm gonna be in this and I'm gonna do this from the place of graciousness and wisdom rather than the place of poor me or anger or things like that, they're there, yes, I see all that, self judgment, but that is not your great heart. Who you are is so much bigger than that. So much love and dignity is born in you. It was there when you were a little kid looking out this amazing beauty behind those eyes. Even if people didn't see it, you know it, and I see it. And even you see it. You know what? There's a simple, beautiful message that could be in India formed with your palms to do this to yourself. And not to everybody, it's namaste. Namaste. I honor the divine in you. I see who you really are behind those eyes, behind the trauma, you have your trauma, but you don't wanna be loyal to your suffering. It's okay, you're kinda loyal to it. That's not the end of the story. That's the beginning of the story. You have your sufferings, just where you started Raghu, and that suffering that everybody lives through brings the heart of compassion. If you allow it, you realize, oh, we're all in this together. We're all in it together. And then when somebody's really having a hard time, you hold their hand and say, yeah, I know that. I've been afraid. I've been depressed. I know what that's like. I really know that, you know, Duncan? So you're saying my ex-girlfriend was wrong for breaking up with me? Always. Yeah. A magnificent man like you, on the other hand. On the other hand. Do you know how it is? No, she was right. Well, thank you, Jack. This has been so terrific. Thank you so much. Thank you both. Thank you, Raghu. Thank you, Duncan. Thank you, folks. I appreciate it. And look for a look at Duncan Tressel Family Hour, and you will find all the links to Jack. And look at mindrollingpodcast.com. And look at ramdas.org. Yes. Or look for this, I've got a lot of books, but there in particular is a book, a very simple one, called The Art of Forgiveness, Loving Kindness and Peace, that has 10 different practices of compassion and self-compassion and forgiveness in it. I'm checking that out. Thank you, guys. Thank you very much. Pleasure. Cutting. That was Jack Cornfield. You can visit him at spiritrock.org. And now this is Bonnie Prince-Billy. It's from his album, Blue Lotus Feet, and it's called I Am The Sky. And if you like this podcast, give us a nice rating on iTunes. Hare Krishna. I am the sky, mother. I am the sky.

Hello, dear friends, it is I, Duncan Tressel, the Skrillex of podcasting, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, and I am here to shake my fist at the dark Rupert Murdoch Disciples who are sitting in their evil towers, casting fear spells into the minds of all humanity. I'm so over it, man, I'm so over it. These disgusting bastards like Nancy Grace, Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh, you can go on and on and on with a list of these disgusting fear mongers. You know what they're like? They're like spoiled toddlers who are sitting at the edge of a pool composed of human awareness, and they have pulled their swim shorts down and are spraying fear diarrhea in everyone's brains. That's what they do. They just have fear diarrhea on top of everyone. They infect people. It's a virus. It's a virus that is worse than Ebola in the sense that it is a virus that when people have it, they don't realize they have a virus. In fact, they say, I'm just being a realist, man. Here's the truth. Today, optimism and realism are the same thing because we live in one of the most beautiful, incredible times in all of human history. So much great news is popping up these days. They just cured a man's paralysis using cells from his nose. They are opening human trials on what could potentially be the cure for diabetes, and Lockheed Martin just announced that they may be able to build a fusion reactor within the next 10 years. These are wonderful, wonderful times. Not to mention the fact that marijuana is slowly becoming legal, which is something that I dreamed about way back in the early 40s when I was a teenager. Shout out to all my marijuana trimmers out there. I keep forgetting to give you guys a shout out, and whenever I do live shows, marijuana trimmers will come and say they listen to this podcast while they are trimming weed. So, Hare Krishna, thank you so much for doing that very important job of trimming marijuana, putting your lives on the line, risking, angering the monolithic dragon, and the prison industrial complex, likes to sick on people who are ultimately just farmers. Thanks for listening to my podcast, and thanks for supplying all of California, and Seattle, and Denver, and all the other places where marijuana has been decriminalized or legalized with such wonderful medicinal products. We are very grateful for your hard work. Guys, it ain't easy trimming weed. That's an actual job. People have to sit in weird marijuana rooms with scissors clipping that stuff away. It doesn't come like that. When you get the nice little labeled bags, or the nice little film canisters with marijuana in it, that's the end result of folks getting their hands just covered in sticky marijuana resin, breathing in marijuana pollen, and all the while fending off attacks from hyper-dimensional super-intelligent entities who are desperately trying to dissuade them from their very important job of getting those sweet cannabinoids floating in the bloodstream of our species. Today's guest is Timothy Showalter. He's the lead singer of the amazing band Strand of Oaks, and what better way to introduce him than with the title track from his most recent album, Heal. [""Holland You The Book In A Trellin' Force.""ам halottinos & playoffs & a smoothusäe Lebanese"") puke is the track!

And Timothy Showalter is here with us today, but first some quick business. The Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the new California Barbershop. This is actually a free ad. They're not paying me a goddamn penny. I'm just plugging them because this is my favorite barbershop to go to when I want to get my beard trimmed. This is an Echo Park. If you live in Los Angeles and you're looking for a great barber who gives great haircuts to, go to the new California Barbershop. It's located at 2203 Sunset Boulevard. Oh my God, will He give you the greatest trim on Earth? Yes. They will polish your head. They will sculpt your hair. They will sculpt your beard. You will wander out of there sparkling as though Jesus Christ Himself sneezed in your face. Go to the new California Barbershop and ask Him about the time He was giving me a beard trim and notice that there was a giant piece of egg stuck in my beard and said, why should anyone have to deal with that? It really is my favorite barbershop. Go there. Getting your haircut is an American tradition. You don't want to go to one of these crappy pseudo bullshit barbershops where these people dress like they're extras and fucking Sweeney Todd overcharge you and make you feel like you should feel lucky for sitting in their goddamn stuffy place where you got to wait for nine hours just to get your fucking beard trimmed.

I'm actually in the process, and this is probably a little too soon to announce it, but I'm actually in the process of setting up a subscription service to the podcast. It's a few months away, but basically it's going to be a really low monthly subscription that's going to give you access to extra podcasts, extra content, and I don't know what else. But it's a cool way to support the podcast. We have that happening in the works. And don't worry for those of you who have no interest in subscribing to a podcast or feel that that is the electronic equivalent of the black mass. I will continue to release the same amount of podcasts that I currently do. But this is a way for people who want to support the podcast to get some extra content and get some stuff back. Let me know what you think. Post your comments on the idea of having a subscription service for this podcast at DuncanTrustle.com. I really am interested in your ideas about the thing, and I'm curious about the best ways to implement it. If you have any ideas, let me know. Speaking of the forum, also there's a great thread happening there. People are working on building my Virtual Christ, which is basically the Virtual Christ experience. I want to have the ability to be crucified in VR space, to experience the POV of Jesus Christ as he stares out over the Roman soldiers who are so cruelly torturing him and just get that feeling because there's so many different works of art depicting the crucifixion but as far as I'm aware, no one has built a virtual reality Christ simulator yet, which means that if you team up with the people at DuncanTrustle.com and collaborate with them and give us your skills and talents, whatever they may be, and help bring this thing into existence, then you will be one of the first people on planet Earth to build a virtual reality Jesus experience. That's making history. So go there, go to DuncanTrustle.com, pitch in, help us build this VR Christ. I have no idea how to do it, and I'm not really convinced that anybody in that thread knows how to do it. So we need programmers, we need money people. Do you have a million dollars injected into this project? Let's make a VR Christ. Let's experience what it would have been like to be crucified, and then you can modify it. The idea of the thing is that it starts off as kind of just a basic Jesus Christ virtual reality crucifixion experience, but you can modify it just like you can with Skyrim. You can modify it so that instead of Jesus being on a cross made of wood, he could be on a cross made of sausages or he could be on a cross made of tiny little crucifixes or whatever you want to do. You're only limited by your own imagination. Jesus could be being crucified on a bigger Jesus, for example, whatever you want. And instead of Roman soldiers, it could be cats, Jesus could be a goldfish, and he could be surrounded by cats who are crucifying a goldfish. Any of these things are possible, but they're not going to happen unless you, the software designer out there who actually knows how to do this stuff and somehow has a little bit of time to pitch in on this project, goes to DuncanTrustle.com, join the thread about the Christ Simulator, get in on that thread, help us build this thing. It really will be a historic moment when we can finally put on VR goggles and experience what it is to be crucified. So dive in, and even if you don't know anything about how to program or how to design virtual reality stuff, you can see that a lot of people there are throwing in ideas who don't know this stuff either. We need idea people too. We want all of you to join together, fuse your minds, and bring out of the nothingness a virtual reality Christ experience. I need your help, guys. I threw an idea out there not long ago about the Podriff project, and a lot of people teamed up and joined in, and the BBC just did a story on it. So this can happen. All you guys have to do is work together and build something that I can enjoy later, because I don't know how to program, and the odds are really good that I'm not going to do more than ramble about the virtual Christ on this podcast. But let me tell you, if somebody builds a good Christ simulator, you better believe I'm going to be raving about it on several episodes of this show. Great. All right, let's get this podcast going. Today's guest is a musician and singer. He is in a band called Strand of Oaks. His name is Timothy Shoalalter, and I was really excited because he contacted me a few months ago because he listened to the podcast. And up until that point, I hadn't had a chance to listen to his music, and I was thrilled to find that his music is incredible and is right up my alley. It's exactly the kind of, I don't know what the word, I'm sure that audio files out there know the word for this kind of music. I don't know what you call it. It's like, I think I heard the, now forgive me, Timothy, whoever's listening if I say that this is the wrong type. Why are we trying to put his music in any kind of goddamn box anyway? It's great music. That's the point. It's beautiful, cool, soulful, beautiful, confessional, revealing music that is coming from somebody who is in the process of waking up. And I think it's a really amazing thing to know that this kind of music is getting out there into the world. Check out his new album, Heal. It's available on iTunes. I'll have links to the Strand of Oaks website and to Timothy's Twitter and all the stuff you need to connect with Mr. Showalter. Now, everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, Timothy Showalter. It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Tim Showalter, welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Duncan, it's good to be here. Man, I gotta tell you. I've gotten so into Strand of Oaks, and I feel like it's like a gift from the universe that you reached out to me because you know how wonderful it is to be introduced to music that you like. That doesn't happen all the time. Well, I think it's a mutual thing. I paid all this money to put out a record to have like a PR, whatever it's called, company. And the one goal I had was, how can I use this limited power to talk to one of my heroes? And I decided to weld that power into saying like, well, I will do all these crazy radio interview things as long as I can talk to Duncan Trussell. And that was because I mean, I, you know, just to jump into it right away, like your words and like listening to you are part of this record. I would, I mean, I would listen to your advice. And I mean, you're like my sage and like my spirit guide, I feel like, because it was in the midst of such craziness, I would have, you know, an hour or two hours to listen to you. And I just was, I know it's selfish, but I was like, I need to talk to him. I don't know if I'm big enough to do that yet, but I just want to speak to this man. No, man. Oh my God, that's incredible to hear because I, as I've been listening to your music specifically to heal. I have, I've almost started crying several times listening to it because I feel so connected to the lyrics into the specific emotional state that whatever you're resonating with. I think we're both resonating with the same thing. Yeah, man. This, this album heal, it is, you created a very special thing here, man. I, we have so much to talk about, but I just want to, I just, hold on one second. God, we have, we have so much to talk about, but yeah, I just want to talk about the, the, the, this album feels like you had some kind of spiritual awakening or something. Yeah. I mean, I think, and this is what I was like, I was very excited to talk to you about because I feel like in listening to you and listening to your approach to life. I have always been fascinated by your, like, you're able to reference things and you're able to reference actual, you know, you could actually pull something from be here now or, you know, like a Buddhist, you know, theory. And for me, I don't have that kind of knowledge. And I think it's just impulsive that I feel that way. And, you know, I always felt like I did go through something, but I'm still, even after hundreds of interviews, trying to understand what happened in my life to get me to the point to make this album. And, you know, I'm, I'm slowly, but surely learning where I, where my subconscious kind of took over my normal daily thought to write these songs. You think it's the subconscious? That's the, that term subconscious, you know, I, the more, it's kind of, that term is like the same, isn't that for psychology, the way they say God kind of? Yeah, exactly. It feels like this is kind of like, you know, it's, it's catch all of things that, and it works for someone like me who doesn't have the vocabulary to go deeper than what it is. I think subconscious for me feels like something that I don't understand, but can feel. And I think it was this matter of going through these, you know, this record came about for so many different reasons. And when you're a musician or you're a comedian or a writer, like your art form or your career is so intertwined with who you are as a person, that when I wrote Heal, it was essentially me writing my own narrative and perhaps where I was wanting to go instead of where I was. And, you know, I think it was, you know, I, it was the matter of being honest. And I wasn't honest. I went through these years in my life where I wrote records that I kind of liked, but I didn't like. And, you know, like the record previous to Heal was a record based around like astronaut farmers getting a divorce. And like, why, why the fuck couldn't I just say like, my marriage is suffering, my, my personal soul is hurting every day, and I couldn't acknowledge the truth. And when it came time to heal, I just was, you know, it's so cliche to name your record Heal, it's kind of bullshit because you can't avoid the fact of saying heal 100 times when you're, you're trying to do that. But it truly is what I've, my goal was since, you know, really last year at this exact time, you know, I'm, I'm sitting in the same room, I'm talking in the same table that I wrote this record on, you know, literally like a year ago to the day. And it's actually, I just realized it's kind of emotionally overwhelming to think about, but you know, I just didn't want to go through patterns anymore. I had these patterns in my life where I would, I would just keep recreating this life that I had invented instead of what I wanted to live. And I thought that's what was most comfortable and what was not easiest, but what was available to me. And I just had this, there was this breakdown and I don't know how to pinpoint the breakdown. I don't know if it was 10 years of breaking down or one specific night. And I've been trying to understand which one it is really for the past year to think like, how the fuck did this record get made? And I don't, I don't remember how it started now. And I kind of remember, but then I don't at the same time. Yeah, yeah, that, that is a funny thing the mind wants to do is to find the place where it, where, wherever, where something started, the mind always wants, is always trying to do that. And pinpoint, oh, well, you know, this is where I became an alcoholic or pinpoint, like this is the, you know, you'll hear like cheesy things, like, and that's the moment that I fell in love. But yeah, nothing really ever works like that. Does it usually? It's so much more complicated than that. And I, you know, I do remember though, like I was, I was on this tour that lasted forever, like, you know, playing shows and traveling around and, you know, which is awesome on the books. Like, oh, this dude gets to like, get paid money to play in, you know, across the world. But I remember I was playing a show in Sweden. And it was like in Malmo, Sweden. And I, I was playing this one song called Sister of Angeline. And I think the song is about like me looking at my ex fiance as a nun, who I wanted to fuck, but wouldn't let me fuck her or something. You know, it was like this, it was this horrible circumstance, you know, of like, you know, wanting this wanting to like fulfill whatever I felt about this person. And I hadn't played the song in a while and I played it. And my tour manager came up to me afterwards. And he was like this Dutch guy that was very straightforward and didn't didn't like put a lot of flowery language. And he was like, you added three new verses tonight. And I was like, I didn't add three verses. And he's like, yeah, you screamed into the microphone for five minutes and then kicked your pedal board across the stage. I don't, I don't remember doing that. And I truly don't, I wasn't like over, I drank before shows, but I wasn't, you know, any more drunk than I was before the other concert. You know, following that night, like I sat at this table with these amazing random Swedish people. And we were just talking about normal stuff, but I realized in the midst of talking to them that I had never like I had been so lonely for years. I just didn't know, I didn't know how lonely I was until I actually spoke with people and felt some sort of human connection. And I think, I think the breakdown came with, I think the breakdown came with a good thing instead of a bad thing. And usually people are like, oh, this happened negatively and it made me lose my mind. But I think I lost my mind for a short while because I realized something positive. And I was holding on, I was holding on for something positive and I finally found it. And then that only showed a mirror to like how, you know, and depressed and all these losing my mind and going insane. I use these words too much because that's just, just like subconscious. It's a cheap word for a bigger feeling. But, you know, I just, I was filled with the fact that like I need to be more connected to myself and people and goals and all that. Yeah, and you can feel that in Heal. You can feel, it seems like what you're, a lot of people, when you were saying that Heal is like to name an album that, I think naming an album Heal in some circumstances would be a lazy, cheap thing if the album didn't reflect true healing. And what I really love, I think Heal is the exact right word for that album. And what I really love when I listen to it is that it's reflecting the actual pain that comes from healing. And I don't know, maybe not everybody thinks this, but I know for the longest time I always associated healing with like in video games where there's like a bell sound and your hip points go back up. And it's just a nice experience. And I don't think a lot of people realize or fully understand that healing means going crazy. Yeah. Acknowledging your pain, being able to finally have the guts to look into yourself and understand that that thorn that's been stuck inside of you for your entire life isn't going away no matter how much you smile and no matter how much you pretend to be something you're not. It won't get, that thorn does not go away through lying. Yeah. And I think lying is such a perfect word to the idea of the worst thing to do. It's easy to lie to other people. I think we all do it every day. But when you lie to yourself and you're conscious of you lying to yourself, like when you tell yourself that it's, you know, I have this shit together. I have got this life under control. And when you finally realize that you don't, it's all completely out of your control. And oftentimes in my life, I've tried to, I don't know if I'm, if I like pain or if I enjoy being sad or whatever. I would, I think when it came to this record, I decided that to look at the most horrific dungeon of my life, you know, like what is the worst thing I can imagine and what are the worst feelings and the ugliest feelings. And I actually used to put myself to sleep at night when I was younger, because I would think about the thing that I was most afraid of. And it was probably the fucking clowns and Pewe's movie or whatever. Like when they, because I love bikes and they destroyed his bike. And I was like, the clowns turned into demons and just I was probably like, I was probably like eight when I saw that. And it was the most horrifying thing. And, you know, but then the difference between being eight and being 32 is the most horrifying thing is like your marriage, not being what you thought it was and you being an alcoholic and a drug addict. And, you know, like, it's a little different than Pewe, but it's still the same idea of like, I felt safety and being honest with my fears. And I looked at it and I wrote and the record is not just about like, I've done all these interviews where people just try and pick out like, oh, your wife cheated on you. I was like, yeah, that's like 5% of the record. Like it's it's not just that it's it's easy to sensationalize that. But, you know, that's it's really like, I think there's just as sad a lines is, you know, of course, I had problems with my, you know, marriage. And we both had problems. But I think the saddest line of the record is I say like, I stopped listening to music. And, you know, like, when you stop, when you stop doing something that is the core DNA of your existence, like, for me, it's music and records. And I remember like five years ago, I just stopped pursuing new music. Like, I didn't even know like bands like Arcade Fire happened, you know, I went into this whole of like, not appreciating what was my lifeblood. And, you know, that was, it was such a, it was such an essential role for to write this record. Like, I remember, I listened to, have you heard the newest national record? No, trouble will find me. No, it's, it's, it's like, it's beyond it's Mozart for someone of my age and it's just like, he says lines in it that are the absolute, like it encapsulate what it means to be an American male in like these strange times of like, whatever, you know, 2014. But it took one record to make me realize like, and that again, just like talking to the Swedish people, when I listened to that record, it had the same effect of like, I haven't actually listened to a record in five years. And this is what like, kept me from the brink of my teens and twenties of like, not, you know, disappearing, like I had records to do that for me. And I just became this like, really boring person that like didn't choose to do that. And I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just the fact that like, that is the status line of the record, like I stopped doing what I love. I stopped listening to music. Well, you were going into, what do they call it, a pupil, pupil phase when the, and it's part of that. That's, I mean, you just melt down and you, and in those periods, I see this is the thing I really love about the, your album, because it's this kind of, and by the way, I'm not, I hope it, I don't want to put out there that there is a point in your life or anyone's life where everything is resolved and you wake up in the morning and feel like you're floating on clouds. I think that the first noble truth of Buddhism, life equals suffering. I think that just means it's like for us suffering is like the way fish have to deal with always being wet. It's the same thing. So, but I do think that there is evolution and growth that happens and, and what I love about hearing you talk about this and listening to your album as it shows the end result of this weird puke, this phase that we all will go into and come out of and then probably go into again. You can just feel the explosion of, of, you know, flowers growing up out of like soil in the beginning of spring or that awesome, the Vishnu principle or that rather the, the creative force, you know, the, after the destruction comes the growth. Man, you really captured that in that album. And, and, and I love the idea that, and that when you are, when you do find yourself not listening to music and frozen and whatever particular seemingly endless cocoon that you're in, if you don't have to resist that, if you understand that it could be leading to some greater understanding. It just, that's what I love about the Ram Dass teaching is like no matter where you're at, it's perfect and start, start, start there. Oh, that's, I mean, I, I think it was very healthy for me to realize, you know, and I have like family that are, you know, and I've flirted with, you know, like Christianity and things like that before. I think it was mostly just because I wanted something bigger than, I think I just wanted to live in the Hobbit, essentially, by the time I read it. And I was like, how do I get closer to Gandalf in my life? Oh, that's great. That's a great question. Every, everyone should ask that. When you wake up in the morning, you should ask yourself that. Exactly. Like, how do I, you know, like, and for a second Jesus and Sunday school was that and then it was drugs and it probably still is drugs to a certain extent. But, you know, I, I think it was really important for me and maybe other people to realize that there's no safety net. Like, there's no end to the abyss. Like you have like, we have this existence that we're born into. And there's no like, the only person to stop you from falling all the way into whatever you're going to fall into is yourself. And you have, because I think I've, there's been a few moments in my life and, you know, one of them was, you know, many of them happened in the past year of just like, what is the point of doing this? Why, why do I have to do this? There's, there's no like, life manager telling me I need to get up tomorrow or continue to, you know, be a person or talk to people or have friends or be a husband. And I still don't know the answer to that. You know, I think I'm prone to looking at the, you know, I, like, my mom has always joked, like there's this video of me, like, when she took like, they must have gotten like a beta max video recorder or whatever, when I was young and there's a picture and underneath it, they have the time, the time clock of like, you know, Tuesday at 4pm or whatever. And like, I'm sitting on, I'm like five years old and sitting in the sandbox on my backyard. And it's like one o'clock in the afternoon. And then my mom films me just sitting at the edge of my sandbox looking at, and then there's a cut in the camera. And then I like, it cuts back to like 345 and I'm still sitting at the same sandbox. Just like, what was I doing at four? Like, you're supposed to be playing Burton Ernie or something. And I'm just looking at the fucking endless abyss of my sandbox. Like, what is, what's the point? Do I build a building and then it goes away? Like, it's going to rain tonight. Oh, man, you got to stare into the sandbox. And this is, this is the one, this is, you know, it's so interesting when you look into the way society teaches you to be, and you realize that almost everything that people have been conditioned to do, is just based on industrial revolution ethics. And it generally just involves your identity, identity is somehow equated with your production. And man, that is such a lie. And it's such a satanic lie, really. And whenever I get caught up in that, it's always just the, that is when if I, if you want a recipe to be an asshole, get caught up in production, get caught up in how much you're producing or how much your friends are producing, or how much your wife or girlfriend is producing versus what you're producing. And forget it, man, you will find yourself deep in the valley of cunts, right? That's a quick way to get there. And the other, the, the coverse of that is the moment you give up the idea that production is meaningful at all. And you just let go of the idea that you are defined by the things you produce, and you stare into the sandbox, as you say, which is a beautiful way to a beautiful story. That's when you start connecting with what I think is the thing we call the subconscious. I think that's when you start connecting with that thing that makes you not remember kicking something across the stage or writing new verses or that thing where you're like, well, I wasn't drunk, but I wasn't there. That, that, that, you don't get to that place by printing out cubes of whatever your product happens to be. Yeah. And the whole thing is like, I, I'm constantly at odds with my upbringing. Like I grew up in Indiana. And like my, my grandpa was like, essentially like that Don Draper guy. Like I think he killed people. He was like, he was totally like an orphan from a farm in the depression and arose into like some kind of like successful business person to whatever degree. And, you know, my dad is a product of him. And then I was, I was brought out and, you know, I have, you know, I have a very normal family in which I love. And it's so amazing to rise as you get older, how much I act like the people that I thought I was not like at all. Yes. And I, you know, I have like, I look like a extra from fucking Breaking Bad or something when I walk around the streets. And but I, you know, but inherently I am the same way as them. Like I want to like, there is this undying need for validation. And, you know, like I've been a band for a long time. And this, this tour that I just got off of like three days ago, like I was selling out shows and I never brought anybody to my concerts. Like nobody gave a shit about my band for years. And, you know, I sold the most tickets I've ever sold in Seattle. And after the show is done, I sat back in the green room and was completely empty. Like I didn't feel any good out of it. I was, I, because I felt like the, what was the purpose? Was it the purpose of being like the fact that it was this community of amazing people, like getting like cathartic together? Or was it my desire to sell out a show? And my band just looked at me like bewildered, like what's the matter with you? Like you just sold. I was like, it doesn't mean anything. Like, like it happened. I did it. And it's, you know, and in music and maybe like with what you do, like if you sell out a show, it's like, it should be this like drug of like, I just did it. Like I, there's no one, there's no room left for people in this space. Like I've, I've filled it all with whatever I've done. It's a crack pipe, man. You can get a temporary little rush when you base your life on numbers, but it really is a crack pipe. You know, I've never been on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno and I never will be because it doesn't. Thank God. But some comedians that for them, that is a, that is considered to be like a peak for them or like it's, they think when they're kids, they want to do that. And when they're, they just, they are getting on the Tonight Show is a big deal. I missed that conditioning. But for some comics, it was really a big deal. It is a big deal. And there's a thing I've heard several comics talk about, which is a specific depression. That overcomes you when you're, when you've performed on the Tonight Show for the first time, because when it's all said and done, you realize just like what you're saying, that there is no pleasure in the fruits of our action. This is the Bhagavad Gita. You have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. So when you get caught up in the fruits, the tickets, the Tonight Show, the numbers in your bank account, you will begin to become empty. I don't know if you've ever played the game Dark Souls. I'm sorry to nerd out on you. My little brother plays it and I get stoned and I watch him. I don't play video games. I just like to like be a witness to them. It's so cool. Well, those characters in Dark Souls, the more you die, you get hollow is what it's called. Oh my God. And the more you base your life on these ticket sales and numbers, the more hollow you'll become. And this is why I love Meister Eckhart, the Christian mystic, who says that the primary and only relationship is the relationship, and he uses the word God because he's a Christian, is the relationship you have with God, and that you could almost pretend to be a servant to God, the most supreme point where all beauty originates from. And if you were, imagine if there was a being like that. I don't know if there is, but let's say there were, and you were that being servant. And imagine how ridiculous it would be if you were caught up in whatever little trinkets that that being was giving you from time to time. Instead of being completely absorbed and amazed by the fact that you get to be in the presence of this thing that is creating all life. You know, it's just a shift. As Timothy Leary says, it's picking up that record needle and moving it over one grid. You know, one notch. What do you call those goddamn things on records? Groove. Yeah, man, you gotta do get a new groove, brother. Yeah, and I think too, like, it's the idea of like, what is our own personal God, you know, and I think even like people who are religious, I just got really deep there, shit. Like, like they find their own, like, is their God the God of guilt? Or is it the God of like, you know, like self serving or trying to validate yourselves? And like, I have to ask, like, I'm not religious, but is my God the God of ambition? Like, is it the God of like, am I trying to, you know, like, I, you know, like with this record, I had a little bit more exposure and like I got to be on like a late night show. I was on like a Seth Meyers. And, you know, because of that, I felt like I felt like a finally like my parents and my grandma, they don't look at the internet. They don't know what the internet is, like, but they know what like TV is and their friends know. And like, I was able to do this and like, and to prove that like, you know, like I was the weird kid. I was the, you know, my, my older brother is like a pediatric cardiologist. So I'm, and I'm trying to write existential space folk records or whatever. But it's, you know, it like, and that was another thing, like I did it, you know, like they were able to watch this and experience and have like proof that their sons, like it has something, you know, that he's doing. And it was beautiful and amazing, but it was also like, what, I mean, I did it. And that, and the promise once you do it, it is like crack. Like you said, it's a crack bite because you do it and it's over. You then have to go and like take a shit or like smoke a cigarette or something. Like it's over. Like I shook the hand. I got to, like, even this now, like even you are a part of this story. Like, you know, you're the, you were the dialogue of like, I don't know if you realize this, but bands that tour, I hate listening to records. I hate like listening to music, especially when you have like an eight hour drive, because it marks time so much. Like when I listen to, you know, if I listen to like Bruce Springsteen, I know every word, every drum part and it almost makes time go slower. So like, I did this one tour that was like a complete disaster a few years ago. And the only thing, it was just me and my friend, like in a small Honda and we probably listened to your voice probably 30 or I don't even know how many me. I mean, that's why I listened to, you know, probably, you know, like 50 hours of your voice. And, you know, for me, talking to you now, it's like, is this yet another accomplishment? Like, I get to speak to someone that I really admire and look up to. And then the talk will be over. And like, is this a check mark in my life? No, we get to be friends. I mean, that's what's cool. That's what's cool about the internet. And that's what's cool about podcasts. And that's what's cool about the way things are going is that, you know, you're with Seth Meyers, you know, that's just this weird kind of fact. Like, you feel like you're just in a factory or something and they've got to get somebody on stage and get them off stage and keep the show going. But that, you know, that it's kind of dehumanizing in a really weird way. It feels kind of strange and glossy. But yeah, man, I think that it's these, the moments that we, you'll quickly realize that in any moment where you're getting that crack pipe hit, you have to ask yourself, what's the, what is the hit? Like, what is the, what is the, is it the moment that has within it some kind of potency that I'm milking and out of this, like, is there, is there like a quantum of energy that I'm like, suckling out of it like a bee out of a flower? And I don't think that could possibly be the case. It seems to be a very subjective thing. And more than likely in those little moments, you're getting, you're allowing yourself to experience something, which I think is, is actually the, the, once you realize that things, and everything in matter is a thing. Once you realize that things are just a, the droplets coming out of a fountain that is so potent and alive, that, that you can actually follow those things back to the fountain head. And people have a lot of names for that thing and connect to that. And that is the idea that you can experience what is called nirvana or the notion that these crack pipe hits, you quickly realize are actually moments that your heart is opening and you're feeling what you actually are. And then those moments don't go away. They just get concealed again by your either fear or your distraction or confusion or delusion. And then they open up again in these weird little moments and they say you can open it up forever and just feel that forever. Feel that feeling of awe and beauty and holy shit. This is happening forever. That's what they say. I don't know. And, and I feel like I, I think it's, you know, and not to downgrade or speak badly about, you know, I think it's, you know, I'm very proud of everybody, you know, like that I work with and the fact that I wrote songs that people are connecting with, like that's insane to me. And I think it's a matter of like reconstituting what my, what my intentions are. Like it's amazing to play on television and the fact that all of those people can see this song that I wrote that I truly felt and, you know, and to have my parents be proud. And, you know, I, I love my parents and the fact that they were proud. It's amazing. And I think it's actually not on the television show or my parents or anyone else. It's on me to, to like re rearrange like what my goals are. Like my goals should have been like, man, my mom was probably smiling so big when that happened. Like she probably felt like here's this kid that I gave birth to. And I was so nervous that he would be in jail or like in like a boy. Correctional home. And he did this. Like, you know, like, and the fact that like, you know, the idea of getting a guitar when you're 10 and that guitar can then lead to somehow playing shows. And, you know, like I leave on Thursday to be, I'm going to be in Europe for six weeks. And I'm like, how the hell did me picking up a guitar at 12 or whatever after hearing disarmed by smashing pumpkins and, you know, wanting to learn what an E minor chord was. Like how did that then lead me to my job is traveling across the world playing for people and getting to like experience people's lives with them and their towns and, you know, like that's, that should be the goal. Like I'm giving myself advice right now. But like that should be the goal. It should be that moment of like, you know, like I sold out that show in Seattle and but it wasn't about the sellout was about the fact of like, I opened my eyes for like a few seconds during one guitar solo and I looked and people were losing their shit. And like, not there was no cell phones up in the air, like people were just legitimately like, you know, enjoying what we all were doing and that should have been my goal. And you know, if I wish I could have realized that then to be like I could have walked off stage and like, man, I looked at that one dude in the baseball cap and he had like a legitimate smile on his face like, and he was unironically putting up the devil horns. And you know, like, it wasn't for any fucking hip shit. It was like he was actually feeling it enough, you know, on a Wednesday and whatever his day was to do that and I should have, I should have felt that and I do now but you know, I should have walked. That's the mind. Listen to what the mind's doing. Now the mind's tormenting you in a different way. It's crazy because the mind's like, Oh, if only I'd done this or that or regret. Now my God is turning from ambition to regret. Now you're worshipping. Now it's regret. And you know, that's what the mind does. And the, you know, when you get those moments of feeling great because of some success, then that comes through you and then it goes away. And then when the moments you feel regret, it comes through, then it goes away. And the, you know, man, when I go on tour and I just did this stand up tour and every show sold out and that was one of the most insane things for me to see that that was happening. But I, it's like, I don't know if it's because I'm a bit of a coward. I just try not to think about it. I'm so dreadfully afraid of, of stumbling or something or that as much as I can, I just try to get out, get out of, get out of my own way and try to, and try to just accept it. And I said, okay, well, this is a particular formation in my life that's happening right now. And I try to just leave it there because Jesus, if you let your mind go too much, it's, you know, this is that, what's the, that movie, The Razor's Edge that is based on a quote I believe from the Dhamma Potter, it's a Buddhist quote which says, treading the spiritual path is like walking on the edge of a razor. And, you know, it really is kind of like that, where you, you just want to, this is why I look, I don't mean to keep going back to Meister Eckhart. And, you know, I know you were saying you flirted with Christianity. Yeah. And I still, I still flirt with Christianity. I flirt with all religions. Exactly. And, but I do love, it seems like the, the real quick fix, whether you want to be a chaos magician and just imagine that this is a mental construct that you're using to achieve some kind of emotional or psychological state, or whether you believe that there is in fact a intelligent source of all creation in the universe, there is a, the idea of abandoning things and saying my reward and paycheck has nothing to do with whatever the world gives me, which as our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ said, why store up things that, that moth and mold will decay? Why store the, why are you hoarding these things? They're, they're not alive. They're, they're dead things and they're, they're, they're just things of the world. Why do that? And I think that verse is right next to the amazing verse, which is look at the lilies of the field. They know, they neither do they toil nor spin, but see how my father in heaven clothed them. How much more do you think he'll clothe you? So I love those ideas, man, it doesn't matter if there's a God or a Jesus or a, or a Buddha or whatever. But I love just playing around mentally with a thought experiment of imagining that's for whatever weird reason. I am a servant to a super intelligent consciousness. And that's my only job and the podcast and stand up and friendships and relationships and everything else is just a kind of byproduct of this connection or dance that I'm getting to do in this dimension with the thing that makes flowers and birds and tigers and music. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. And I think, I mean, you just, you basically summed up what I love the most about you is that, and what I dislike the most than others is the, like you have a lack of cynicism. And I think that's such a beautiful thing that I try and do because I unfortunately when you're in like music or whatever, you have these people that cynicism is some kind of shield or it's a super, it's actually is like a super defense. It's like I have this ultimate force field to resist any emotions because I'm cynical or I'm ironic or something like that. And for me, like the fact is like, and I've taken this from listening to you, like, you know, I do find myself like I'm a guy who doesn't acknowledge religion that often, but I find myself praying sometimes. I don't know if it's the amount of drugs that I've done that day or the beautiful hike that I've done, but I find myself reaching out and it's not Jesus. I don't know what it is, but I, I've done so many hikes from just like I, I'm connected with something right now. You know, when you, when you, when you're hiking, I always, I always gauge my hikes like in miles and like the first few miles you might have your headphones on or you might have like a, you might be talking on your phone or something. But then like, and your, your thoughts are cycling so fast over and regenerating and anxieties. But then you get like a few miles in, and then you're like, Holy shit, there's like sounds going on out in the woods. Like there's, there's a crack over there. And like you, and then you know, like what direction that crack just happened, or if there's a, if there's like a woodpecker and you then can realize like that woodpecker is like, like to my left, like a little bit above my left. And then all of that bullshit goes away. And that's where like the prayer comes in and, you know, and that's what's so much more. You know, I was going to ask you that when you're talking like, because I have to ask myself that, like, when was the last time like you felt that feeling of like achieving closer to Nirvana? Like when was like, what in your life connected those pieces to get to that place? Oh man, I get it. It's, I get it from jogging. It's weird, you know, jogging, does it? I don't know, jogging. And just like what you're saying, it's like a few miles suck. And all of a sudden all this, all the ridiculous bullshit falls away and then suddenly you're just like breathing air and feeling your body running. And then that's when the spontaneous gratitude prayers will come out where you're just like, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for giving me this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you're not thanking this source for whatever prosperity you have or what you're literally just so happy that you get to feel air on your body. Yeah. Yeah. And the fact that like we're, my God, now I'm quoting you. I'm quoting you for your old jokes, but you blew my fucking mind once because I had like a, I was listening to you and you said something about the feeling of being immortal. And this might have been before your surgery or whatever, like, you know, the idea of, of what it means to be an immortal. And, you know, like I, I had that same feeling. Like, you know, I've, I went through like this insane car crash and Christmas. Like, yeah, I read about that. You broke all your ribs. Yeah, insane to the point where I, it took me three weeks that I was denying to myself that I was alive. Like, I didn't know, like, because I got in this wreck and like two semis hit my wife and I and like, I was unconscious for a while. You know, I went to the impound lot and the impound guy was like, oh, do you know the people in this car? And I was like, well, I'm this person. And he's like, no, you're not. And I was like, what do you, what, I am that person. That's my car. And he was like, no, the police officer said both people died. Whoa. Whoa. I was like, no, I am that person. But then I found myself arguing my own existence with this random impound lot guy from Indiana. And I, and then I just thought like, man, am I gone? Like, is this another like, is this like another fold in existence? And, you know, and I've and people say like, when you get to like, you know, a near death experience, you're supposed to have this like charge of life. But my charge is like this charge of confusion. I was like, is this even what it was before? Because I don't remember, like I had a head injury and I don't, I have, I still have problems like I have lapses of memories. And I don't like, I don't know if this is who I was before. And physically or mentally or spiritually, I, I, I, and that's part of the reason why like, I, I do, I just dove into substance abuse. After the accident, like I just was like, I would put on, I, because I didn't, I didn't know if this was me anymore. And I, you know, and the idea, like going back to you when you said about being immortal, like I truly thought up until that point, like I was fresh, you know, I was like, I could always regenerate, like whatever happens, I could break a bone or a girl could break my heart, like I'm going to be there tomorrow. But after this, I still have that question. Like I, even on this past tour, like I had like, I must have drank too much whiskey, but like, I had this huge argument with my band and my van. And like, I was, we were driving after a show, which again, was another sold out amazing show. And I had this total breakdown of person. And I started yelling at my drummer about like something. And then like, my mind instantly went to like, I'm not here. Like I'm not even supposed to be here. Like I'm full of shit. Like I'm not supposed to be here. Like I'm gone. Yeah, it's like a dream. Exactly. It's like when you're in a dream and you start realizing you're dreaming. Yeah. And then I'm wondering if I'm dreaming right now, like if this whole experience, you know, and again, like I'm not a subtle person, like I have fucking survived tattooed down my full, my whole forearm that I got like three weeks before I got in his car accident. Wow. And I did it simply because like, I had like problems with like cutting when I was younger and like self, like whenever I get sad, like self destruction is my first instinct to like destroy myself. And I would do it to my arm, my, my right arm. So I got this tattoo, the sensor, it sounds kind of like metal cliche, you know, I was like, Oh, this is what I did. But you're like, I wrote survive over this arm that I've just wrecked since I've been 10. Simply because like, if I get drunk, I'm not going to want to cut it because there's a really nice tattoo on my arm. Like, I don't want to like, I don't want to fuck up my tattoos. So I was like, I'm just going to like have my friend tattoo my arm. And, you know, I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just really heavy, like thinking about you. I'm trying to think who you're talking about at that point, but like the idea of being immortal. Well, yeah, I mean, what you're talking about, and especially with cutting and everything is the identification with the body and the kind of tenuous relationship we have with our bodies. If there's sometimes this sense of our transcendent nature will subconsciously come into us. And it's almost like, especially for kids, I think the, you know, the cutting and the all of these things that seem to be these rejections of the body are kind of trying to in a, in a almost in the way that like turtles, when they dig out when they catch out of their eggs and the sand and go out into the ocean, they don't know exactly what they're doing. They're just sort of going in that direction. It's this weird, I think, instinctual thing that happens when you're like a young godling in the larval phase and you're sensing this like that your body is not what you are. And so the rudimentary way to do that in the West, you know, is because no one, you don't get that lesson generally. You don't know what he tells you. Hey, guess what? You're not your body. You're having a dream. You're the attention of the universe focused on this one meaty little vessel. And the more you let go and relax and release, the more you will find yourself expanding and dilating into your true identity. No one tells you that. You're just, so you're just like, fuck, this is me, this fucking meaty, fleshy, fucking pain tower. And then I think that's why, why some people start cutting themselves. And the, the drugs that you were doing, when you were saying you started doing drugs, you know, it reminded me of when I was after your car wreck, it reminded me when I was talking to Jack Cornfield about how I was chanting. I was telling him I was chanting Hare Krishna when I was in this failing relationship. And he is like, you were just trying to avoid pain. You were trying to avoid what was really going on there inside of you. And I think anytime you come in face to face with impermanence, that induces a specific kind of pain. And so then that whatever you can do to numb it is what you do, drugs, cutting, chanting, whatever. And, but man, this is, this actually kind of, this brings us to something I wanted to talk to you about, which is that your, your music is so real and authentic and so connected to, I think what appears to be to me, your becoming more and more courageous and allowing yourself to experience this pain, honestly. Dude, is it, is it dangerous? You know how like they say that I remember, I remember when I was a kid in high school, they were talking about butchers and how, and I never, for some reason, I never thought about it, but they're like, you know, a lot of butchers are missing fingers. And in the same way, I think a lot of people who are making the kind of art that you're making, don't a lot of them, for example, Jason Molina, Elliot Smith, do you feel a little, not to be a complete bummer here, man, but how do you, is it a dangerous thing? Is it like working at a, is it like working at a place with radiation? Is it a dangerous thing to be channeling this energy? Well, I think, you know, and this isn't, this is not comparing my art to Elliot's or Jason's or, you know, like Jeff Buckley's or people like that. But like, I think there's certain artists who like, if you, if you do it in like a military example, like, I look at certain bands who are like rich kids who go to officers training school, and like, so they'll learn how to become officers, they'll go to college, and then they can make this, like they can make decisions from a removed standpoint, like they're, they're all the way, they don't have, they're up in the, like on the mountain tops looking down the valley, whereas like Elliot Smith and Jason Molina and like some of these other artists are in the like infantry, and they have to deal with the shit as it comes, and they're, they're like in the midst of the actual, like suffering that's going on, and they're tapped into that. And I think like, what my favorite artists have always been, you know, I'm not, I don't, I don't have a fetish for sad people, but I just have always tried to look for people that are real. You know, like, I remember when I heard Nick Drake's Pink Moon, you know, I didn't, I didn't even know the story behind Nick Drake. I was young, and I just heard someone who tapped into whatever faucet that had turned on in my life from an early age. And, you know, it's probably all, we can all, we can blame all this from like me reading like Catcher in the Rye and just being like, oh, these people are phonies. Like this is not, this is phony, this is something that's not me. And hearing, you know, like hearing Nick Drake or hearing Elliot Smith or Jason Molina, like those are the people who are right on the front lines of like emotion. Why do you think you're not like that? Because when I listen to your music, it makes me feel the exact same way. There was no like, when I was listening to Heel, it was just this, I was stoned and I started listening and then started listening more. And it reminded me of the first time I heard Nick Drake when I, and it wasn't Pink Moon, it was the first Nick, I can't remember the first Nick Drake song, but I, I, I photographically remember my dorm room. I remember sitting at my desk. I remember looking down and listening and then I remember like tearing up and because I had no immune system for that kind of music at that time. Yeah. Why do you think you're separate from that, from that crew? Because it feels to me that you're tuned in to that frequency in a beautiful way. I don't think I'm separate. I just have a hard time putting myself in the league of people that I respect. I, you know, I think I, you know, I might have that same feeling to people the same way that, you know, when I first heard Jason Molina, you know, however many years ago, I just, I think it's just a weird humble Indiana thing that I have, right? I have a hard time. Yeah, I get it. Yeah, maybe you better stay the fuck out of that league because all those people are pushing up daisies right now. PS. Exactly. You know, and I think it's, you know, but it is the idea of what, like, some of the most powerful things for me on this, you know, I made the record and the record was such a solitary endeavor. You know, I don't have a band to record with. I just played most of the instruments and just stayed like, I was in literally a place where my producer and I said, like, if zombies or some kind of ghouls come into Akron, Ohio, we're totally safe. Like this is a, it was an old post office warehouse or something. So there's no windows. So we're, we're stuck into this like, like bunker and just, you know, clouds of marijuana and whatever else was just, you know, like, fueling our passion. And, you know, like, making this record was such a quiet, contemplative, amazing place that was like, people weren't allowed into this record when I was writing it. Like, I didn't, I didn't make this a community effort. But then shifting to playing shows, it, you know, I never, I doubt that, you know, I have, I have a bad self image of myself. I don't think people, like, I'm like, why the fuck would people listen to this song? Like, there's no reason for them to listen to it. But then playing these shows, and the first thing people do, like before, like, before we even go on, even if it's a show to like a 50 people in Phoenix, there's always like one or two people that come up to me. If I'm like outside, hang outside the venue, and they, like, without any hesitation, tell me the most personal shit in their life. Like, they, and I've never met them before. And, you know, like, they tell me something about, you know, their marriage or like their children or like their problems with like mental, you know, issues and stuff. And my only reaction is then to say exactly what I went through. And it turns into this like, you know, it's not corny, like it's real stuff. There's no cynicism there. Like, then, you know, some of these guys look like they should be like going to a limp biscuit concert, you know, and, and they're coming to my shows and like losing their mind, like the opposite of casual, the opposite of like trends or anything. And that's, I guess, you know, I need to stop doing these knee jerk reactions of like not allowing myself to be considered with my people that I look up to. Sure. Yeah, but maybe, yeah, I know what you mean. It is a weird thing to even think about that. And maybe there's no need to think about it, man. But there is, there's a great term I just heard on these Michael Beck with audio books that I've gotten addicted to. He's so good. He's so, so very cheesy, but so good. That's the best sometimes when people are so cheesy that it's like, ah, I totally feel this right now. That's the best, man. And he talks about this thing called the tyranny of trends is what he calls it. And it's the, it's such a great way to put it because it is tyrannical and you will, if you allow yourself to get caught up and not being sincere and cheesy and open, then you will not make an album like Heel. Then you'll make something that just maybe people will like because it's manipulative, but, but it's, it won't, it, what it won't do is it's not going to heal people who desperately, desperately need that kind of music in their lives. I mean, I, that song, JM on Heel, which is about Jason Molina, that song is you singing about the importance of having that person's music in your life. And you're doing the exact same thing for people, man. And that is such a valuable, valuable, that is that to me, that is being a servant. I think that in, in, in, I think musicians and stuff feel weird admitting that that's what you're doing, but God damn it, man. If I didn't have Nick Drake, or if I didn't have Daniel Johnston, or if I didn't have Lou Barlow, I don't know what would have happened to me. Yeah. And that's, and that's the whole thing of like, my wife is much more eloquent than I am. And she always says that my music is meta, but I don't, I don't really know what meta means, so I can't, I can't really, I just have to believe her. But there is a certain quality to that where it's, you know, I'm writing a song about someone who was my hero. And like, I, like we just played a show in Philly where I live. And the guy who played guitar and lap steel on Jason Molina's record played with us on JM. Wow. And my wife was like, that's so Kubrick, like that's meta. Like if you're doing it like, you know, Can I, can I read you something really quick? Because now that you know what your wife is saying, but she, here's where it gets even weirder. She doesn't even know. She's, you know, the other definition of meta, right? No. The Buddhist definition. Hello. I'm here. I'm, I'm ready. Okay. Check this out. Metta is indeed a universal unselfish and all embracing love. Metta makes one a pure font of well-being and safety for others, just as a mother gives her own life to protect her child. So meta only gives and never wants anything in return to promote one's own interest is a private. Anyway, you get the idea. Metta, isn't that wild? And the thing is, it's like this record probably was, it's based on such selfish motivations. Like I just wanted to release whatever tension I had built up in my life into lyrics and not build it around symbolism or metaphors or all that other shit that I've worked so much. And that was my biggest fear when I wrote some of these songs. I'm like, no. And this is, you know, I thought no one would care about what I did when I was 15 or like no one would care of the fact that like, you know, Sharon Von Etten was on my headphones and her song Give Out was on when I had my realization of being lonely or Jason Molina was on my speakers, you know, and all of this stuff was so present and so real to me that I was worried that like no one was going to relate to it. And to my surprise, like people relate to it a lot more than songs that I'd written before. And it was, you know, it is this validating point that like, you know, you talked about sincerity, like I think people are longing for that and they're longing for some kind of connection. And that's, that's why I have this like, I believe in the beauty of the internet and connectivity and the fact that, you know, we can talk and all this stuff can happen. But there's nothing like meeting someone fresh, like there's not a screen, there's not a keyboard, like, and you just speak to them. And they tell me something that like, they probably haven't even told their spouse or their children. And we sit on some fucking curb in Pittsburgh and talk about this together. And, you know, I'm supposed to play a show, but I don't want to play a show because I want to catch whatever truth is coming back at me from this person. You know, and it's, it is just, again, it goes back to calling a record heal and, you know, the idea of like, it's still, I'm not even close to being better. But the process is happening right now. Like the process is meeting these people and, you know, like I, I'm filled with almost this responsibility now of knowing these people's stories. And I, and I don't want to be an asshole, like I'm trying to go get a beer or smoke a cigarette or play my tune my guitar or something. But I want to like give, I want to just listen to people because they took the time to listen to my selfish words. And, you know, then they're giving it back to me. It's, it's, it's, it's overwhelming to the point where like we played our last show of a five week tour on Saturday. And usually I'm out in the crowd, like I'm talking to everybody and like I'm a gregarious person, but I couldn't like I had to go in the green room and I just couldn't speak to anybody. All I want to do is pack my gear up and have something tangible because I was like, I was so overwhelmed by them. Like those voices don't go away. The stories are still in my head. And I didn't, I think I, I couldn't deal with them at that point. And, you know, my band thought I was pissed off, but I was like, I'm not pissed off. Like I'm just, I'm like, I'm feeling all the feelings right now and I can't escape them. Yeah, you can't. And, and they'll keep coming too. You know, it's like the idea of prayer, you know, there's so many different ways to pray. And a lot of people have been taught like when you're a kid, you get taught this weird thing where you put your hands together in this kind of like arrow pointing up like an antenna. And you say, now I lay me down to sleep. I pray the Lord my soul to keep, it's really a weird thing. You know, as you've been saying, like when, whenever you find yourself tuning into a negative mood state, it's like you're worshiping a specific demigod. And I think that when you're producing art and music, that's the real prayer. And it's the, when you send that prayer out into the universe, it's the delightful thing about it is it's like being in an echo chamber where you yell, hello, hello, hello. And instead of just hello coming back, it's like, I love you, I love you, I love you. You know, it comes bouncing back in all these different expressions of love. And that to me is, is so beautiful to know that what you're doing when you're producing music or art or anything that is based on authenticity or heightened connection. What you're doing is throwing this metaphysical boomerang out into the world and it always comes back with stuff on it. Little love notes from the universe. Exactly. And like, I, and it boils down to even like beyond the lyrics, which are hyper personal, like the way that I play guitar is not, it's not, it is skilled, but it's, I don't want to like dis myself. Like it's, it's not, it's not a conventional way of playing the guitar. Like, especially live, like I just kind of destroy my guitar for a reason. And when you hit notes, like when you're in a practice space, you're just hitting them like you're just playing the guitar and playing chords or whatever. But like when I do these things live, like even if I hit the wrong, wrong notes, like I see like there is like this, it's like a laser beam of like this is all this is what my fingers can do. It's as fast as they can play or as hard as they can hit the strings. And I see that reflecting back at me. And at that point, like, I just want to like, I'm not a violent person, but I see bands and performers who are obviously doing it for themselves. And they're not, they don't give a shit about any of that reflection. Like they just are, they're, they're, they're just creating to create for themselves in this place where it's like they, you know, like they could have their backs turned to people and that doesn't matter. And, you know, for me, like I, I absolutely need people. Like I, and I, I'm kind of an introspective person naturally, but you know, being in these unbelievably extroverted places of performing, you know, it's the only reason I'm doing it is the fact that like, I know this person could be watching a fucking Netflix series or something, but they're here on a Wednesday, like in Vancouver, like, what are you doing here? Why are you here? But then I realized, like, you know, I have to get over that forced modesty of like my Midwestern stuff, like they're here because we're going to do this together right now. And it's, you know, I, I, I just want, I want people to know that come to these shows, like I, I'm doing this because I need you and I need to do this. Like this is my survival mode right now. And it's, you know, like I leave, I leave on Thursday for a bunch of more shows, as I was saying, and like, I have to like mentally prepare myself to be like, man, now I got to figure out how people in Amsterdam react to this record. And, you know, because it's not, it's not an album of like, there's bands that I love that are like, you know, I listen to the newest Daft Punk record. I'm like, man, these are sexy songs that like, I would love to like comb my hair to or something. Like it's, it feels so nice to like, you know, just have like these songs on when I'm, you know, in a barbecue. But I don't think my record is, I think my record is, I, you know, people can still barbecue to my fucking record and comb their hair. But it seems like people are hearing it and taking something out of it the same way that I took out of Elliot Smith or Nick Drake. Like, and that's a scary, it's a scary responsibility, but it's still exciting to be like, shit, why I have a purpose? Like I can keep making these records. Yeah. Yeah, man. You, yes, that's, and I think as long as you stay right there, just stay right in the place where it's coming out of you and forget all the other stuff. I think that's the, that's the safe place. You know, anytime I let my mind go to any of the other places, quite either I'll just start feeling like I've gone insane or I'll start feeling like, you know, I was imagining one of these show, a show that I did. And I was imagining, what if you really do this thing is a simulation and you have just plugged in this incarnation into some kind of like futuristic, super computer style video game. Like, I want to feel what it's like to be a comedian. I want to feel it's like to have a podcast and to have real connections with people who come to the shows. And I was sitting there thinking that and realizing that that is probably what it is. Not that it's not that I'm the only thing, but that we are all connected to the one thing. And the one thing is having all these experiences at the same time and the, all these experiences or the subjective realities are as Robert Anton Wilson puts it, the reality tunnels of every human being on planet Earth. And that you, your consciousness is just a river rolling through the, the life of somebody named Tim Showalter. And maybe that river runs through Tim over and over and over and over again, just like every time somebody plays a song. The song plays again and again, but each time the river runs through your life, the river that is you or the river that is the part of the universe that's sort of separated or is focused its attention on you, it gets another chance to fully embody perfection. You know what I mean? It's like another chance. And who knows, maybe all kinds of different consciousnesses have run through the being that is you. And maybe sometimes the car that it does crash into the semis in a way where you don't climb out, you know? But this time you climbed out. And isn't that badass? You, we all have climbed out, you know, and it's, it's super cool because here we are right now in this crest of the wave of time. And every second you're giving, you're giving a chance to not just be in the, in the company of the great ancestors that have given you your gift or have inspired you like Elliot Smith, like Sebado for me. But you have a chance to not just like be at that level, but you have a chance to goddamn quadruple it, you know? You can exponentially increase what they did because I have a feeling that, you know, whoever your heroes are, if they are gazing out from eternity watching you, what they would want more than anything is for you to not just be as good as them, but to carry forward into the future that ball of energy that they got rolling every time they released an album or sang for a show, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I think it's, I just think it's so amazing to think of how it is like the idea of what it is to be inspired by something. And, you know, it's just me continuing that, you know, I wish more artists would admit to the fact that they're fans of things. I always get, I always get mad at people when they view like their art comes out of nowhere. You know, it comes from somewhere and it comes from, you know, we all were 12 and we all heard like the first like Richard Pryor stand up thing and it changed our lives or, you know, we heard the Beatles or something. And it's, you know, even for me, like talking with you, like I remember this specific point, like it was this rough tour and we were, where were we driving? Like we were driving from Northern California to San Francisco and we took like the Google Maps sent us on the fucking weirdest way. We were over the Redwoods and this rainy night and we were listening to like one of yours podcasts with Dan Harmon. And it was this point where we were so deep into this tour and kind of feeling numb from the lack of success and, you know, rough times. And we just like, it must have been, I felt like the podcast was like eight hours long. I don't think it was, but you know, it was like, we both lived in it and we lived in this thing and we didn't talk about it, but we just felt like we were inspired by it and it helped us, it helped us, you know, get to the next place and go to sleep and get up for the next show. And, you know, I have this ability now, like part of the goodwill of getting a little bit more successful in this world is I have the ability to like communicate with people who have inspired me, you know, and I can meet them and talk to them. And, you know, because I think it's, I wish, you know, I didn't know Jason Molina and I, and I'm now like I've, I've befriended all these people that are in his life, but, you know, I wish I could have been at this point now to speak to him when he was having rough times. And, you know, to be able to return something in that look, like I don't know who you are, but you have no idea how much you've defined me as a person and defined so many others. And, you know, I feel the same way for you. Thank you. You know, it's, it's, it's always strange to, you know, to be at a level to speak. I guess it goes back to the uncomfortableness of feeling on the same, like being able to have communications with people here whom you respect. But it is just, you know, there's, there's people in this life where you just look for like, oh man, like, I truly believe that JD Salinger would be happy for your podcast. I think you would hear it and be like, like this, this guy, like I would come out of my New Hampshire bunker to speak to this guy because it's, it's like, it's not the drone speaking, you know, and you're waiting for that with people. Man, I appreciate that, man. And, and I, you know, I, what I think is that we are all different expressions of a technologically enhanced awakening that's happening around the planet. And that the, the, the imperative right now is as much as possible in whatever way that you have your instincts are telling you to, to go is to accelerate that, that awakening, you know, because I think that's what it is. I think that's what, that's what every single person is, is that once you really, because you can dabble with the ideas presented in Buddhism and you can dabble with the ideas presented in Christianity. There are all the bonafide scriptures that are, and all the writings of the mystics. And, and, and at first, as you hear them, it will only go as far as your, is your whatever callous is surrounding your heart. But when, when you really give yourself just a second to imagine that when the, every single intelligent mystic, every G, every fucking mystic and every enlightened being keeps saying again and again and again, in some version of the idea that we are all one, I am, you know, and I am that the burning bush, I am that I am or the all one or the, these things keep coming. So if you pretend, if you imagine that these super smart people, when they were saying that, they weren't just stoned, trying to, trying to like seem eloquent. No, but they had actually connected to a greater universal consciousness and had realized that they were that thing just like everybody else was. If you play around with that, you will start tripping out because you'll begin to realize it's true and that you're a window and I'm a window and everyone you run into is a window. And some people, the windows shut and some people, the windows open and some people are trying to get the window open and they don't know how. And I think the more you can be part of the universe that's like, hey, I'm going to help you open this window if I can, even though mine shuts all the fucking time on my fingers sometimes. What he stubs the fingers after. Yeah, man, I am so grateful to you for reaching out to me and I'm so excited to now have your music in my life because it's just beautiful. And I really hope you'll come on the podcast again and I'm starting to do these live podcast tours. And if there is some way by the grace of God that we could like get together and do like a show or something, a live show, I would sure love that. And I think it also is manifesting friendships and I know it sounds, I don't want to make it sound manipulative, but I heard you and I was like, I think I could connect with this guy. There's something that I feel very true about you and I've done that with certain artists that I love. I've become friends out of whatever circumstance. I'm speaking with John Darnell from Mountain Goats and we're talking back and forth. I'm speaking with my heroes, but I think they're my heroes because they're actually a lot like me. Yeah, it's so funny, right? It's not heroes, it's just you hear something like, oh shit, I'd be friends with that person. And now we're talking and we're like, oh yeah, you're right because now we're friends and that's just how it works. And it's so cool. And I think that's one of the gifts of the internet. Most of my friends these days, I have met through this podcast, so god damn it, this is a great day. And I can't wait, where is your tour? Where are you headed? Well, we're starting our tour in somewhere, I think Amsterdam. And then we're touring across Europe until November 1st, but then we come back for like a few shows in Philly and New York. But I know you're in Los Angeles, but we need to just make it like, I will do whatever I can to make this friendship foster. Yeah, well let's just keep talking, man, and come on the podcast soon. Definitely for those of you listening, forgive the budding bromance and forgive me for using the term bromance, it is called it. But that's just what you felt and that's what I feel right now. I feel like I truly found someone that I could love. Yeah man, well that's badass because your music is insanely good and even if we never talk again, I'm going to listen to it for a long time. And I hope that people listening will download your album, your most recent album, Heal, or all the albums for that matter, and come see you on tour if you're out there in Europe listening to this. Thank you so much for coming on the show, Tim. It's been a real blast chatting with you. Thank you, Duncan. It's been amazing. I love you, man. I really do. Love you too. That was Timothy Showalter from Strand of Oaks. Why not download their album? It's available on iTunes. Get the new album, Heal, or any of their albums. Thanks for listening, you guys.

Thank you for tuning in. Welcome. This is your first time listening, and your encounter with my voice is you're kind of like, oh, I don't know. I don't like this voice. Give it a second. Wrapped up in my voice is an actual acoustic healing tone that has been placed there by audio engineers from NASA. It's a healing tone. It is, right now, healing. Your shocker is expanding your third eye, and invigorating your brown eye, it is making you whole. But seriously, thank you for listening to this podcast. I've been thinking a lot lately. We talk about it a little bit in this episode with Makad Brooks. I've been thinking a lot about data diets, the kind of information that I've been letting myself take in, and the sort of progressive disintegration of that information, the weird quality of gaining a kind of tolerance to bad news that reminds me completely of other chemicals that I've been addicted to. You know what I mean? It's like, OK, sure, great. Maybe you found some horrible story about Toddler finding his dad's gun and killing his dad, or maybe you found some beautiful article about the impending disintegration of the planet's climate, or maybe you found some kind of deep dive into the possibility of World War III breaking out because of something happening on the global stage. But that's just not quite enough. It's kind of the same thing that can happen with porn. If you're somebody out there who likes to watch porn, it's like, you'll get into a porn spiral. You know what I'm talking about? The foot job videos, they're not doing it for you anymore. Now there needs to be four feet, 10 feet, 30 feet. The next thing you know, you're watching an animated porn clip of a centipede giving a foot job to Darth Vader. And then whoever you happen to be following on Twitter or Instagram, they impact you in some way that you might not even notice. Just little droplets of their life always flowing into your feet. It's not like they're necessarily bad or anything like that. It's just they're seniorly obsessed with maybe some political tribalism or some aspect of the news or an incessant exposure of something that they think people need to hear about that has a kind of insanely dramatic horseman of the apocalypse blowing a horn made out of devil skulls' tone to it, if you know what I mean. It's sort of like super emphatic, frightening, freaked out way of saying things on their social media that can gradually start affecting you. And you don't realize it's affecting you until you find yourself suddenly regurgitating it to someone who doesn't watch the news. When you're like, hey, did you hear what happened in New York? And they're like, no, I didn't. And you realize you were about to tell them the most horrific thing that you picked up on whatever fucking news feed you were on? I only bring it up because in this podcast you're about to listen to, MacCod Brooks talks about what it's like to have a parasite and it just got me thinking about all the memetic parasites that I probably have crawling around inside of me. And they're there not because someone poisoned my well. They're there because I, from time to time, like to take big, deep sips of some of the most horrifying information that you can find out there. And you don't have to go on the fucking dark web for that. You just turn on the news and there it is. These charismatic data sorcerers just offering you bubbling bowls of memetic parasite-ridden information. All kinds of crazy shit in there that's designed to sort of grow inside of you and come flying out of your mouth when you find yourself lacking things to say. Did you hear about that guy you got his dick chopped off by the guy wearing the headband made of dismembered dicks? Why would you pass that information on to anybody? I mean, it doesn't really help anyone. I mean, the only reason you should be talking about a guy chopping off dicks, wearing a headband of dicks, is if you were talking to the cops or if you just encountered that person in your neighborhood. There's no reason to continue to spread that, but it's kind of amazing. To hear the story, it's kind of interesting. You wanna know more. That's where Dateline or Forensic Files kicks in. I mean, look at Keith Morrison. Does he look okay? He's awesome, by the way. I'd love to have him on the show, but Jesus Christ. That guy, it's like somebody who visits metaphysical, radioactive wastelands, like environmental disaster sites, places where the worst fucking thing has happened and he just soaks in all that energy and you kind of see it in him. It's like he's almost transparent or something. He's been essentially evaporated, but I have the same reaction to Keith Morrison's voice from Dateline that might get to have to the Coco Mellon theme song. Anyway, I'm not gonna keep going on and on here. I just wanna say thank you for trusting me enough to listen to my beautiful, powerful, deep voice. And hopefully from this podcast, you will not get some kind of memetic parasite, but a little bit of joy, because it is the holidays. I love you guys. We're gonna jump into this awesome podcast with McCod Brooks, but first this. I wanna thank Amazon Music for supporting this episode of the DTFH. This might seem like a completely obvious thing to say, but there was a time in human history when people didn't have electricity. You wanted to have light in your house. You had to find some kind of flame or wait for the sun to come up or you were screwed. This is why people had chamber pots. They had not just because they didn't have a toilet, because what are you gonna do, go wandering in the complete utter abysmal, lovecraftian darkness in your pre-technological home to use the bathroom, you would probably fall. And if you got a cutback, then there was like a 30% chance you would die of an infection. I only mentioned this during this Amazon commercial because sometimes I feel like somebody who lived before electricity, only in my case, it wasn't electricity. It was whatever insane technology Amazon uses with their Alexa, where I could be standing in the kitchen making grits for my child and say, hey, Alexa, play music by John Prine. If you have an Alexa nearby, it's probably playing John Prine right now. Maybe you've been tied up by your dominatrix. And what are you gonna do? Ask your dominatrix to go put on a different song. Are you insane? No, you can just push the ball gag out of your mouth and say, hey, Alexa, play music by coil. All this is possible thanks to Amazon Music.

So everybody, please welcome back to the D-T-F-H, McCodbrooks. [""Welcome Back To The D-T-F-H""] [""Welcome Back To The D-T-F-H""] It's the Duckatrussell video. Duckatrussell, Duckatrussell, Duckatrussell, Duckatrussell. McCod, welcome back to the D-T-F-H. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks for having me, brother. I appreciate it. It's great. Man, it was so fun hanging out with you in Vegas. It was. We had such a great time. Yeah. And we got to do that more, maybe more often. Are you kidding? It was so cool hanging out with you in Aubrey and listening to you all talk about your many experiences with ayahuasca. And I was wondering, can we just talk about that a little bit? Are you comfortable talking about that? Absolutely. Absolutely. OK, so first of all, how did you meet Aubrey Marcus? Funny enough, we met in high school because we grew up in the same city. So we met in high school playing basketball against each other. So we knew of each other. I knew who he was. He knew who I was. But we didn't actually become friends until about 2010. And I met him at a friend of mine. I was shooting a television series in Austin. And a friend of mine, an acquaintance of mine, I should say, took me over to his house. And she's like, OK, let me just preface this by saying where I'm taking you. This guy's awesome, but he's fucking weird. I was like, I love weird. Let's go. And so we get there. And it's a Christmas party. And he's dressed like some sort of, if I recall correctly, I think he's dressed like the Grinch. And there's a bunch of other people dressed like reindeer and elves. And it was going off. It was crazy. I was like, OK, these are my kind of people. This is kind of interesting. Yeah, that's cool. Right. And so at what point was this? Had you already experienced ayahuasca at that point? Or was it? No. OK. Yeah, May 20, 2012 was my first journey. And you remember the date. That says a lot. Can't forget that, bro. You can't forget that. It's your birthday. You cannot forget the moment in which you passed to that portal. You just can't forget that date. And it was this. Did Aubrey introduce you to the shaman and everything? Or was this? No. So I had those near-death experiences. I had the coma. I had all these situations that actually happened on May 20. Which, by the way, y'all, please go back. Listen to the last episode. It's the most incredible story. I think about that story from time to time, just like I sort of contemplate pieces of the story and like how, I don't know how to put it, how logical it seemed as a sort of metaphysics behind death, you know? Yeah, I mean, I guess so. I think there's a lot of logic to it all. I think that there's a divine orchestration to it all. And I'm happy that I was able to sort of bring my mind with me in that situation and bring back the story. But yeah, if you guys haven't heard that, please listen to it. I mean, I should go back and listen to it, frankly. No, I actually got introduced to ayahuasca because I was trying to heal the remnants of the parasite that was left to my body because it's an antiparasitic medication. So a parasite is a tropical disease. So you have to use tropical medicine, you know, indigenous medicine to get rid of indigenous ailments. Yes. And I would have had to take years and years and years of pills and treatments to get rid of all the parasites or just let them flush out of the body, you know, sort of naturally through cleanses. But that would have taken years. And somebody who cared about me deeply was like, you know, man, you got to try this. You got to try this. It gets rid of parasites. It does this. It does this. So he told me all these physiological things. I didn't know that it was spiritual as well. And so it was kind of a Trojan horse for me in that I was willing to try anything that would heal my body at that point and sort of help me reclaim my wellness. Right. Right. And like just the psychological element of reclaiming your wellness is big. It's what we call the placebo effect. But it's really you. It's really you sort of taking control of the fact that your body consciousness is one thing. And so that's what I was doing. And then I saw myself and I saw, you know, a glimpse of God and I saw some past lives and I saw some beings. I had incarnated as before. And I was like, whoa, this is not just for the parasite I see. Yeah. Right. So it's been it's been a journey. It's been a journey. Do you think that the parasite that parasites, maybe they function on more than just the physical level too? Oh, absolutely. So you're encountering them at different levels. When you shift your consciousness, you sort of experience like the energy body of the parasite or something like that. So I mean, I think you and I briefly discussed this in Vegas like like COVID. We both had COVID. Yes. And I had it back in the day when people were actually calling it Wuhan, right? It was January 2020. There's nothing. There was nothing, you know, xenophobic about that. That's just what it was called. Right. So and we didn't know you couldn't really test for it. But I knew later when people were talking about the symptoms and how sick you got and describing it, I was like, oh, that's what I had. Right. And we both agreed that it felt sentient. Yes. It was like scanning the body and like going like, oh, what do we have here? Yeah. You know, it had his own little consciousness and like, you are aware of the consciousness and you are aware. It's affecting you in a physical plane, but it's also affecting you in an energetic plane and a spiritual plane in some ways, right? Yes. Or maybe everything but spirit, right? And I certainly believe that these things have consciousness as well. And I think that a parasite's consciousness is just, it's a low vibrational sort of frequency. And, you know, it can, it can, yeah, you can drink the wrong water. You can eat the wrong food. But I think that it's able to where I was in my life. I was vibrating much lower, right? And I think that it had such an effect on me because of that. And then I think ayahuasca, you know, resets that rhythm for you. It allows you to see that you can have a different frequency. It allows you to see that you can have a different rhythm. You can vibrate differently. And I think that it's harder for things that are vibrating on that low frequency to glom onto you in the quantum, right? Right. Once you're aware. Yeah. I think, I think it heals you in several different ways, you know, like physically, metaphysically, rhythmically, if that's a thing, right? And I think it also like sort of places you out of the danger zone of certain things, right? Energetically. Wow. Like a kind of protection, field of protection or something. I wouldn't even say that. I would say it's more like, like Donkey Kong where like there's certain, there's barrels on certain levels. And you're like, I'm above that level. Okay. Okay. Yeah. And I see the barrels, but they're like, they're not, I'm not even on the same rhythm as the barrel. No, I, no, I got you. It's like, you know, there's this, this types of seed that are designed to get stuck in the fur of animals. Right. And if you're living a certain way, then metaphysically, you're going to get stuck in a lot of shit that you're not going to get stuck in. If you have raised your frequency a little bit, you know, like, you know, like you're not going to get as jealous. You're not going to get as like player hater. You're not going to like, you know, do that thing. I'm whenever I'm doing it, I know I'm fucked up. Like you're monitoring other people. And if they're doing great, you're feeling bad. If they're doing bad, you're feeling better. And that's, you're like, oh, fuck, I'm like sick right now. That's, that's not the vibration you are. No, no, it is not. Now this idea of like, do you know where you got the parasite from? Africa. But just drinking water. The best bet that we can come up with is that I was shooting a movie in Morocco and then, you know, obviously, like we're in Marrakesh where, you know, that's a pretty big city. And obviously, you don't, you don't drink the water. I never drank the water. But what they don't tell you is you can't brush your teeth with the water. You can't shower. You can't put your face in the shower. Like eyes, nose, ears, nothing, right? Also, like if you got a cut in the body like this, you know, there's certain parasites that can, they'll figure it out. You know, they're billions of years old. They'll figure the shit out. And so, you know, you have to sort of be very careful if you're coming into a country that I want to say, you know, particularly for me, like, you know, I was, I was, I was in a great place in my life, but I was also vibrating fairly low. Like I was looking at people and going, oh, they're doing better than me. Yeah. Fuck that person. Or they're doing worse than me. Hell yeah. You know, I was, I was, I was kind of in that space. I was 27 or whatever the case is, like, you know, you're an asshole at 27. Yeah. And you don't know it. And, you know, I was, I was, I was estranged from my sister who was, I met her one time when she was a baby. I hadn't seen her in, geez, maybe 20 some odd years, but I wouldn't found, I wouldn't found her like a, like a private investigator in Germany by myself. What? Right after that. Yeah. And before Facebook, before all that shit. And I was probably 26. This is after you shot the movie. After you were in Africa, you went to find your sister. Yeah. I'm skipping ahead a little bit. I guess what I'm saying was like, I was searching for so many things in life at that point. Yeah. Like my own identity, my family, just so, so many things about who I was, were unfulfilled. And I was searching. I was in this, this rhythm and this vibration and this frequency of searching. And, you know, those who are, those who are searching are not always lost, but I was lost. Right. You both can be true. Yeah. And so I was, I was susceptible to certain energetic parasites, you know, including people and relationships and situations and also actual parasites. Yeah. And so, you know, I did the hippie thing and went up to a sweater. This place is placed in Northern Morocco, which is full of X pads. It's beautiful. It's on the coastline. It's got all these Venetian castles. It looks like Othello should be walking around. It's crazy. It's beautiful. If you ever have a chance to go, go. Just don't go to the spa. So I went to the spa. Yeah. And we did like a, you know, this whole, you know, like Sultan bath thing. And I was like, yeah, I was Sultan in my head. It was great. And then, but I got deathly ill like a couple of weeks later while I was in Germany. And I was like, what the fuck is this? I thought maybe it was like I had bad schnitzel. And turned out like, you know, it was, it was years of gastrointestinal issues, years of sickness. And I was like, what's, what's going on? I want to go to these Western doctors and, you know, they give me some vitamin and they give me some stomach stuff and like it never really, it never got to the root of the issue. Right. Western medicine is always like, oh, what are your symptoms? Let's get rid of those and see how you feel. Yeah. And two and a half years later, I was in the fucking hospital. And most people who have this amoebic antimicrobial parasite, which is a fancy way of saying the worst roommate ever. Yeah. They die in six months if they don't get treated. Because it seems like basically like taking shit inside your body, right? That's, that's what's happening. It's just. But worse because the shit's turning the babies and the babies, like it's, it's basically building, it's trying to, it's, it's, its purpose is it's trying to build a colony of parasites inside of you. So it's trying to use you as a subdivision more or less. Wow. And then, and then it gentrifies your body into, into a way that it is susceptible for it to create more of itself. And then it takes over organ. It moves from organ to organ. And normally within six months, it can go from the stomach to the liver to the kidney up to the heart. And it goes in the heart. You're fucked. You're done. You're fucked. Somehow after two and a half years, my shit was just on the liver. Like, and they were like, that's impossible. There's no fucking way that, you know, like your liver is fucked. Like you have a hole in it. You have an abscess. Right. Oh my God. But the good news is the liver is the one thing in the body that can heal itself. Thank God. Thank God. Yeah. You know, I'm now, I'm drinking, I'm drinking Japanese whiskey again. It's all good. Yes. So you're, okay, your liver is healed up since. It's all, it's all good. Yeah, we can go to Vegas for good. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by feels CBD CBD is incredible.

This is making me think and I you know of and I want to get get to the Iowa's department. This is making me think of something. My wife and I we started watching sarcastically watching Fox News. Right. So you sarcastically hate watching. I've done it. Yeah. I get it. Okay. So we start doing that and then we start realizing we're like sarcastically watching this shit every day. And you know what I mean like and then it's like we're like are we sarcastically watching this anymore like are we just not watching fucking Fox News. You know what I mean. And then like suddenly we we started freaking out because we realized like it's it's getting in us like worse. We're starting to talk. We're starting to kind of agree with some of the shit they're saying so we stop watching and since I turned that shit off my happiness level has increased by like 20 20 percent or something like that. So it makes me think of that because I wonder if right now we are at a place where we just aren't advanced enough to recognize that things can be parasitic that don't have a body that you can look at under a microscope that energy forms can exist or that or maybe another way to put it would be that these pools of data these reservoirs of data they can be like bad water and that and within swimming around inside of Fox News is for lack of a better word all these memetic parasitic things that just that literally are doing the thing you were saying that that parasite is doing inside your body literally encouraging colonization gentrification like sort of like and only just trying to propagate itself with no I mean that's kind of the creepiest thing about the it is it's so singular in its motivation. It's you know as far as we're obviously it's efficient. It's efficient. Yes. Yeah. It's efficient. We're almost robotic or something like that. And do you ever think about that like you know if we're just not we don't understand some people understand it but we have yet to realize that many of us are crawling with fucking parasites. It's just they're not organisms. They're ideas. You know. Yeah. And that's that's brilliantly put like I mean like a pair of parasitic energy is a parasitic energy. Yeah. And that so like if you look at how our ancestors looked at parasites or pathogens they looked at them as evil spirits. Right. It's shit you couldn't see that was somewhere in the ether or somewhere in the molecular structure of something that you could intake into the body and it would make you sick and grow in you. And until you succumb to what what the what the efficiency of that bad idea or that evil spirit was. Right. So in that yeah I mean it's it's the delivery in Fox News it's the the fact that they're sort of you know to borrow a phrase from from a hate book. I mean sorry Facebook they are playing on that hate algorithm right yeah they're taking your anger and and they're expanding upon your anger and using it as soil right. And so there's something kind of interesting about the fact that like yeah diet is everything that you take in yeah it's the music you listen to it's what you watch it's who you talk to on a regular basis it's what you're listening to what podcast are you consuming what are you consuming what are you putting into the body whether it's you know a substance or a frequency. And so yeah you can listen I think most of America needs a parasite cleanse yeah you know like if like I used to watch my television turned into a Donald Trump machine for about five years. Right. You know what I mean right and and as much as I hated the fact that my television turned into a Donald Trump machine I could not look away right. I wanted to see what this motherfucker had to say every day I said yeah what is what crazy shit is he gonna sensational crazy ridiculous shit is he gonna say today even if it was offensive or whatever the case was I was glued. And I found myself sort of going well he's making sense on that one wait what yes that's right yeah hold on hold on hold on right and I think it's repetition right yeah and I think if you keep drinking dirty water you keep drinking bad water you keep listening to aggressive violent music there's something inside the body that goes or your body consciousness that goes well how do I how do I digest this you start to figure out how to digest you know junk food and cheeseburgers out of the dumpster if you keep eating them eventually you're gonna find some tasty garbage holy shit you're right you know no yeah I just read this thing about how certain you know bugs or some kind of microorganism was figuring out how to eat plastic like it's like so okay so yeah it's like so you're gonna start mutating to adapt to the the data stream you you and I and that is subtle that shift is very very and subtle insidious you don't even like we're like ah let's watch let's watch Fox News let's listen to these fucking fascist assholes go on and on and then very slowly you're shifting a little bit and yeah wow that's a really cool crazy spooky idea that you're you're mutating to digest it and also if you look at how human beings interface with with each other right we we are call and response creatures right so if someone is speaking to you in an angry way yeah it stokes the anger in you and then the then you're trying to find something that you can call and respond to it so even if they're saying something ridiculous and that you don't believe it it's the anger in you know blah blah blah's voice I don't want to get I don't want to give me the letters here it's the anger and blah blah blah's voice yeah that makes you go well I can I can I'm angry yeah there's parts of me that are angry and I can connect with that even if I disagree with you there's someone out here expressing anger and I'm happy somebody's expressing right I'm happy somebody's expressing some of the fears that I may have and there's even a tone of voice or the delivery and how they're doing it which eventually can indoctrinate you into their ideas right and be just because that they found something that the parasite found something to to glam on wow and like that's that's what we got to be careful of it's like like for me so for me diet is everything that you consume so I find myself playing like you like so at the end of the year when Spotify shows you how many like you know what's your favorite songs are and so forth minor all my top ten are always so fed your frequencies you know yeah like I just play them in the house all day if I'm working or I'm doing something or I'm like it's playing right now wow it's like a low frequency of just peace and serenity and then if I wanted to get involved in the craziness of the world I hop on YouTube or you know turn on the news or but then I find myself instantaneously within five or ten minutes changing my mood changes my my my pulse rises like it's everything changes the physiological reaction to the to the anger algorithm that they're they're using to keep you engaged and their delivery system is part of that anger algorithm right yeah and it what do you think is the is do you think there's other than like just selling phones or prescription medication in between the hypnotic angry wizards batting their bile in your living room do you think there's any other motive that you know do you think there's something like look you know I'm gonna say I know I can talk with you like this but I feel like it's a way that demonic entities are trying to keep the planet in some kind of you know for like destructive cycle and and that you know it's like the you know you see these certain parasites they they want you to have diarrhea because they want it they want it you want you they want you to shit all their eggs out and they don't want you to do it in the fucking toilet they want it like on the ground they want it they want a mess you know what I mean and so it's like this this never-ending sort of flow of energy that's making people have these kinds of bouts of explosive not actual diarrhea energetic diarrhea yeah energetic diarrhea because it's because you know it's contagious you'll get a phone call from someone being like did you hear what blah blah blah did or whatever and then you know and then it continues its existence do you ever play around with the idea that that is actually what's happening and that the energy source is the human attention span that the the medium it's existing within is human sentient attention the moment enough of us turn our attention away from it it will perish it will collapse it will the world will will move on past it which is why the more we start waking up to this idea don't watch that shit don't this is food to don't eat bad food the more extreme it seems to become the more it seems to double down on itself to become the world becomes that much more dangerous so the more we turn away the more it tries to grab us and with with increasingly terrifying stories of how rotten the planet is and how awful you know some group of humans is living on the planet yeah I mean you don't even have to go you know and into the esoteric of it right you can you can really just say plainly put I'm sure you've met plenty of people in your life who had parasite parasitic energy yes so where my wife has a saying where attention where attention goes energy flows right right so the human attention span the the our focused intention and attention is our power right if your intention and attention is put on to your inner growth and your spiritual growth and your wellness and your your financial and energetic and spiritual aggrandizement that's what's going that's what's going the energy's gonna flow there and you're gonna see results if your attention is going to the anger algorithm that's what's gonna that's what's gonna grow so I don't even think it's that that complicated are you hidden I think that yeah listen you know we talked about this too last time I think but you know we have we have pulses of consciousness and last pulse of consciousness we had was the was the printing press and the printing press the printing press was was a was a new technology a new delivery system in the 1500s and we use old software or old consciousness and we inputted it into a new delivery system and then what happened we whatever that dark force was that was contained in an area geographically and within the minds of a few it got spread out in that delivery system and so whatever that was I think people like you people like me people like Aubrey like the several people like that Joe Rogan we want our fucking planet back from whatever that was right let's not give it a name I don't know it's dark we know that it's it's it's it's it's going off of the East Indian is that what they're called the well the the the the the the Dutch West Indian company the Dutch East Indian company but but but not just that not just the company the consciousness behind the company whatever that was okay whatever that was we have the ability to look at that and go nah nah fam it's not going to happen for another 500 years like we have we have a second opportunity our new printing press is social media so the printing press was the first time that you were able to to take the esoteric knowledge that was kept in these extremely you know insular circles and you know maybe 20 scribes knew the information kept the wisdom and then divvied it out to to monarchs and people that that it made sense for their for their own purposes and then sometimes the the peasants got the got the idea right if it if it helped if it helped the the political process and that was the first so the the printing press was the first time you could actually tell the truth or lie to 5000 people right at once well that was the bit that was the beginning of widespread and industrialized disinformation right fake news started there that at that point yes so now we have an opportunity again to use a new delivery system a new technology but we this time we have to understand where we are in this inflection point in human history and infiltrate that delivery system with a new set of consciousness new ideas of connectivity and not the hate algorithm but like and not the parasitic sort of energy but but what's what's the opposite the compassion energy that the giving energy that the the gnostic understanding of other people's experiences something bad happens in Iran five minutes ago you and I can find out in 30 minutes right okay wow what are we gonna do with that right you know what are we gonna do with that so to answer your question yeah of course these motherfuckers know they they know and who are they I don't know but they know that they can deliver they can use technology as a delivery system for whatever the consciousness they want to put through it right and we've been operating on a very low level of consciousness a zero sum game trying to trying to and successfully industrializing commerce and capitalism to a point of where avarice has run amok I listen I'm a capitalist I love it I got capitalism has been great to me it's the intention behind capitalism it's the problem right it's not the system it's can I can I incentivize you financially to be kind right now we reward people for being pieces of shit that's right we reward people for being narcissists we reward Americans for engaging in this collective narcissistic personality disorder that I think we have as a country right and proven by the fact that we elected somebody who who exhibits those traits right uh several people who exhibit those traits yeah and and I think that it's up to people with I'm not gonna say like oh it's up to people with platforms I'm just saying it's up to all of us to understand the inflection point in which we're in that never in human history the last 285 thousand fucking years have we been able to talk to 10 000 people at once or 20 000 people at once never never happened it's never happened and what do we do we try to sell each other a fucking self-tenor and shoes and sex toys and fucking hate and all and then we're like whoa man hold on you got the average person who who who you know picks up on a frequency at a certain space time can maybe reach 20 000 30 000 40 000 people and what are you doing like you're selling butt plugs chill okay okay what's wrong with butt plugs people are selling a lot of other worse things than butt plugs I don't know why that was the first we don't need to come down on the butt plug industry and people are selling assault rifles you know what fair point absolutely a fair point I was looking at it I was looking at a statue that reminded me about plug right before we talked so you are it's probably it's a very common shape in nature it's a very common shape in nature you know if you have a big enough ass you can make anything a butt plug I guess nice hey nice butt plug that's the stool get the fuck out of here man I love that we have transitioned from the power of of technology in like magnifying various energetic states to you know if your ass is big enough anything's a butt plug which is which is true you know and that's a very positive way of looking at things like like what would the butt plug for Shrek be like it would be like a fucking mini cooper whatever the fuck Shrek wanted it to be or the butt plug for King Kong or Godzilla any of these things I mean that would be almost a little more horrifying if the thing instead of like wrecking buildings was just trying to put them in its ass that's a much more horrifying kind of monster like oh my god it's disgusting what's it saying about me or that I'd watch that I would watch that twice I would yeah I would watch that I would watch that over and I would turn that I would hope that would be like the next squid game or something look you know you're that what you told me in the last podcast it freaked me out and and I I we I think we exchanged some texts about the the East Indian Trading Company because the shit you were telling that if all the things that I've talked about in the podcast that has been one of the more chilling things that I've ever heard I wonder if you could like maybe summarize it for folks who maybe missed the first episode sure sure sure sure sure and I've done a lot of research on it since then brother so like I know more now it's pretty crazy I'm writing a television series that takes place in 1690 in New Amsterdam it's kind of a Western and so and what I've discovered about the origins of this country and how they and like that kind of that kind of started with a text exchange that we had after where you were telling me about like the similarities in the flag of the Dutch the Dutch West Indian Company and the American flag so I started doing some research on that shit and it's crazy so like so here's the backstory so I'm probably gonna fuck some of these dates up but you know fact check me I'll do do do what you gotta do guys so there was a couple companies called the Dutch West Indian Company Dutch East Indian Company they were in in Holland and I think I'm gonna I'm probably gonna butcher this but I want to say late 1500s early 1600s when they opened the doors they did very well so well in fact that they were the companies that created the international stock market right right the stock exchange right so this was the first public these were the first publicly traded companies and what were they trading they were trading spices and sugars and silks and humans African things African things is what they were trading and so the average person who was kidnapped from Africa was about 15 years old right and so what you have was a child sex forced labor ring child sex forced labor trafficking ring that people were engaging in for a good decade or a little longer and then you had a bunch of the privateers the pirates the soldiers the whatever you want to call them the sailors from these boats these slaver boats that were jumping ship and committing awful crimes in the streets of of Amsterdam committing suicide home invasions whatever like it was it was shell shock they were they had PTSD severe PTSD centuries centuries before it was labeled because of what they were doing in Africa yeah maybe they couldn't get around it um and so this obviously did really you know this was not good for the company it was not good for the bottom line not good for the shareholders so the company closed this store and got a hold of a printing press right and what they did was they they gathered groups of academics and doctors and philosophers and they created a narrative about the prevailing wisdom of race at the time was that Africa was was satan's last stronghold on the planet and that we weren't kidnapping these people well actually what we're doing is we're removing them from a circumstance in which they're they are insured eternal damnation so now what we're doing is we're taking them from the from the dark jungles of Africa where satan can get a grip on them and the younger the better right because I mean like we should save the children and and and well but they're they're they're they're too demonic to bring here to Europe so we've got to put them in the new world and so like let's give them purpose let's give them Jesus let's give them all these different things and some and something to do with their hands in life right because they're not smart enough to actually you know to be a philosopher or statesman or a lawyer or a barrister we have like you know they're meant for manual labor and they're they're they're barely human and these are doctors these are the academics who are creating the prevailing wisdom of the time in in northwest Europe and they put out a pamphlet I always spoke up the name of the pamphlet but I think in French it's afric the abalique which is like the you know the diabolical Africans or something like that and it talks about how they're subhuman and lazy and all of the all of the all of the pre-judicial you know sort of doctrine that we have now about black people throughout the world was more or less created in this think tank to try to make you know 16th century pirates feel better about what the fuck they were doing and shareholders feel better about what they're doing right so yeah then then these became intersubjective myths and if you were the average Dutch person or the average German or the average English person at the time and you didn't know this then you were stupid or you were some you were some sort of oh you're you're a dreamer of these aren't these aren't people like come on right this the same way the same way we know there's no life in outer space right we just know there's no right right right right right oh yeah I see it right I got you I've never I've never met a brilliant African you've never met an African there was there was a university in Simbuktu that you guys that that that the kings in Europe would send there when sending their children to first century so like this is not you know this is this was a lie and we know this was the the spreading of fake news from a private company who was in jeopardy of losing their stockholders and so what they did was they created this myth that people started to buy into and spread and with this myth they reopened their doors and people didn't feel so bad about investing in a company that was kidnapping people and taking them to the new world quote and you know force forcing centuries to labor upon them because of these indoctrinated myths and you know it was the beginning of the industrialization of of commerce and the industrialization of capitalism and so it's not only did it the transatlantic slave trade build the new world but it also was the building blocks for America I'll tell you why in embryonic America you know we're talking about like late 1600s right but you know long before George Washington was was even looking at a cherry tree yeah it was like you have all these instances of you know the the colonialists wanting independence from the crown right so what did that what did that even mean well that was government overreach because the the colonies were privately held uh plantations and cities that the dutch east indian company or the dutch west indian company or the massachusetts colony company or the blah blah blah blah or the virginia company they created these were private companies they were quasi-governmental they had government contracts they had armies but these weren't the king's armies these were private mercenary armies that were paid by slave trading companies so the first colonies were all privately held slave trade companies they were they were the they were the property of private companies they were doing so well the kings came in and go oh no I need I need some of that I mean I gotta I gotta give me some of that right so that the king came in was like no no fam I'm gonna just gangsta your shit yeah and so there was a lot of rebellions a lot of fights it wasn't about oh I you know no taxation without representation meant you can't take my stocks without giving me something back that's kind of what it was it was like yeah you know like hey I get people go oh well it was about like not having representation in the parliament yeah but it was really about the fact that the king was confiscating your private property yes private property being land humans you know so and so forth at the time right and so what you had was a cut was was the like so for instance stuyvesant who was the governor of uh of new york the first governor and the longest running one I think at the time was a was an employee of the dutch west indian company all these names in New York that we have you go down these streets and these neighborhoods and these areas and these dutch names and these english names particularly from 1690 1700 1717 1720 these are people who were employed by a private slaver company fuck and people go to school in those buildings oh fuck that's so spooky you know what I mean so the systems the systems of punishment were taken from the colonies the charters of the colonies those charters were written by the dutch west indian company the system of governance was written was taken from the dutch west indian company all the the foundation of america was taken from a private company whose business was to kidnap children jesus christ and we built we built our country on that foundation in fact we wouldn't even have a country if the king had not gotten involved and say yeah you guys can just have your slaver nation right yeah and so and so um one of one of the one of the one of the final um you know well I don't want to get into that because it's the 20 minute story but you can look at you can look at like the father of america was truly this private company and then those employees generations later who were kind of quasi-governmental who were in the private sector who but who are also kind of having to you know tithe to the king um because they were they were doing so well financially um they basically were like nah we don't want to pay this 30 40 percent to him anymore we just want to take our winnings from the slave trade so we got to basically create our own country and like that's really what it was holy and like and until we deal with why we founded our own country we're never going to be able to move forward but we're just never going to be able to do it like like you you even pointed out to me but the flags are alike the creeds are alike yeah no yeah the the structure of the military is like like every like we we didn't come from england we came from the dutch west indian company from a corporation from a corporation a vampiric maricidic corporation right lying that was lying a propagandizing parasite that's the that's where it came from oh oh and this is this is this is a boy you're fucking mine when did the dutch west indian company close its doors i don't know no idea the year the year that america was founded oh fuck it no it no longer needed to be in existence because it just transferred over it mutated it it it climbed out of its chrysalis and became a country it like you need money to win a war who paid for it wow who paid for it where the fucking pirates well the the rich the the rich stockholders who wanted more of their money um to to be to be protected from kings in europe yeah and they were like okay well we have this opportunity now to have a plantation the size of of europe wow let's do this that's what it was man and how creepy that now we've got facebook trying to create another universe you know trying to expand into some god knows what space that fear that you know as technology advances we will be able to you know become increasingly immersed in and you know and again you know right now especially with like the tech companies um you know for better or for worse you do see an interesting i mean obviously the tech companies are not like vile demonic beings that are like well most of them are not well i guess some of them are kind of involved in human trafficking how fucking weird i'll put a t like this so i'm i'm creating a technology as well and the one thing i've learned in the last three years of working with coders you know shoulder to shoulder is that um a code is it's merely just it's just the expression of an idea right yes and so yes and so whatever indoctrination whatever um traumas or or or belief systems that the coder is bringing to the conversation and expressing his eyes his or her idea that way well the code is going to be indoctrinated the code is going to be sexist the code is not going to be anti-racist the code is going to be xenophobic the code is going to be whatever the person who's writing the code is so it doesn't mean that social media is evil or this person is this it just means that we have to have a lot of inclusivity and diversity when it comes to coding because we're going to we're in 10 years we're going to be in a place where algorithms are creating algorithms right we're going to be in a place that machine learning is going to machine learning will be machine learning and these are going to be the things that run our society and if those things if those expressions of those ideas are not steeped in human equity consciousness then we're fucked then we we're going to spend the next 500 years trying to clean up the space of the multiverse to make it to make it more equitable oh my god okay okay so here okay so here we have when you're so fucking smart man here we have way back when and this kind of like volcanic eruption of um the most vile thing of all time and it looked like a corporation that by the way the reason after I talked to you I was like looking them up and like then I realized on one of one of their flags is literally the demiurge and gnosticism literally on the fucking flag is the thing that is considered to be the imprisoning you know hypnotic force they just put it right on their fucking flag it's like a they knew exactly what they were doing it's a serpent head with a fish body you know yes it's a dragon serpent fish thing that yes that that that is about capturing human souls and feeding off of human energy and souls yes that's what the fuck was on their flag that was they put it on their fucking flag and by the way you know this is the this is the um this is the first rule of vampires is they only go where they're invited they're meaning like you know that that's a fucking vampire and you let him in that's the rule so a corporation that is literally literally vampiric like capturing humans turning their energy into money has on their flag this the the mystical symbol of you know self-induced you know like you know vampirism like you know it's like you look at the the tarot card of the devil and depending on which tarot card you're looking at the the chains that are supposedly holding them are definitely big enough for them to get out of but they like you know they're imagining that they're they're stuck when they're not which is like you know it's somehow even worse than being you know if they were actually chained then you could thank god that horrible devil or it's like what does uh c.s. lewis say the gates of hell are locked from the inside you know so it's like the ultimate humiliation is like oh no no no you're not even trapped you're just pretending to be trapped you know while you're sitting at the foot of this awful fucking beast we had to take a restroom break now back to the conversation hey brother hey so small correction um are you recording yes okay small correction i just looked it up so the dutch west indian company closed these doors the same year george washington was inaugurated oh god jesus christ the dude wearing wearing kidnapped people's fucking teeth is dentures um which you know by the way if you say that now people get mad now if you say that out loud be like oh really mr. woke over here oh yeah no the fucking asshole had like human teeth of people he captured in his mouth but i you said something about the code that i want to focus on um because i i think there's like this and like we're we're talking about this like once you like get get into the waters that you're you're you're into and that you're educating lavison you you realize like okay what is it okay what is it the there's a in the bible you will know the father by the sun right and so here we here we have the uh father i guess you could say of america being a parasitic vampiric corporation or conglomeration of corporations that were making most of their money from human trafficking from kidnapping that thing to mutates transforms now just calling itself a country the flag kind of looks the same the people who are running the country are either working for the corp or associated with the corp or descending from people who made a shit ton of money a lot of the wealth in the country is moving down family lines that that's where it started off at is in that corporation now i think what you were kind of getting at is that now that very same thing is starting to get into the code into the tech into the it's like fractalizing itself down into the very algorithms that are acting as the connective tissue socially but you know that that's connecting all of us together within those codes are these very same things that if that are just echoing from whatever this fucking company was is that what you're saying i i'm i'm saying that there was i don't know the inception of of that dark idea like i don't know like i have a i have an idea but um i'm gonna formulate that idea for probably another few years then we can talk about it then cool okay i don't want to speak out of i don't want to speak during the process of of incubation of an idea but um um yeah well it's it's undeniable that whatever that was uh found um a way to express itself in the most dynamic way that the human beings have ever interfaced with the printing press yeah sure absolutely you know like right you know yeah yeah we had the inquisition we had all these different things but but that was a religious thing that was a that was a territorial thing it wasn't particularly race right that was created from a private company that races were different that right being closer to god meant that your skin was lighter and like that's that's that that comes from that and because we have in question that indoctrination to the point of so for instance like here's a problem like we have we have this whole conversation it's fake conversation in this country about crt critical race theory yes problem is we already have crt it's confederate race theory and what what's happened is the daughters you probably know this like the the daughters of the confederacy which were actual it's it's it's an organization but it's also who started it was the daughters of the confederate generals and colonels and sergeants and soldiers who wanted to make their fathers and grandfathers look better after the war so they they got enough lobbying power to um uh more or less edit the textbooks in america that made civil that made the civil war looked like it was a states rights issue okay well what was the state right okay you can say you can say yeah well you know i i am i am pro life well you're for forced pregnancies there's two ways to right right right right right right two ways to express that idea okay cool yeah those are you might be for life but then why aren't you for the the person who's on death row who didn't do it all right you know you also another way to put it would be you support rapists who want to have a lot of kids you know that there's there's several ways to skin that you support the rights of rapists who want who don't want to you want to like keep making more you support the rights of incestuous uncles good for you so like there's several ways to to say the same thing and i think that what happened was um you know in in particularly in this country we've we've i went to a school made robert ealy elementary what yeah man i got in trouble my brother and i got in trouble one day because we're doing this this um i'm fucking 10 11 years old i know who robert really was but no one really else did like i mean all the black kids in our school was three of us we knew who he was we knew he was a spiteful disgusting you know anarchist treasonous treacherous motherfucker that's what he was he was a genocidal and or he either wanted my ancestors dead or enslaved that's right and there's no argument about that not a good man period but i had to go to a school named after this motherfucker in texas who had nothing to do with robert ealy he's from virginia and we had to sing a song talking about i still remember the song robert ealy was courageous he was generous and kind robert ealy was thunder and spirit and in mind and it goes on and on and on and on and then my brother and i we made up our own lyrics we're making fun of them and we got in trouble really yeah we got in trouble and then my mom goes comes to school she goes what they do she goes well they they were she used to sing the song and then i she said what's the song and they show her the song and she goes they are not in trouble if you put them back in class right now and if you guys don't know who robert ealy was let me get you some books on who he was wow right you're fucking lucky that you know this is this is all that's going to happen in this situation now think about that the indoctrination of trying to make a black child sing a song of positivity about a man who would have had him enslaved at 11 years old right we don't ask jewish kids to sing songs about himler or right luger or anyone else right we don't ask that we don't ask that of german jewish kids we don't we don't ask we don't ask you know armanian children to sing them sing about the ottoman empire right we we don't do that right we don't ask the indigenous children to to to on their land to sing about you know andrew jackson we don't do that right and so the fact that and that would even that would even make more sense because at least andrew jackson was part of the fucking union right right so it you have to look at the fact that we've already had crt confederates there we've already had this these these lies that were have been indoctrinated into our educational system so the problem is not the coders the problem is not you know um what they're expressing through through the the the current indoctrination of spacetime the problem is the fact that america is too fucking cowardly to look at its own shadow work right america has shadow work man yeah yeah and that shadow work is inequality and i think that like it's soon and like if my wife can look can do her shadow work i can do my shadow work if you can do your shadow work right i understand that young is not one of its own philosophers but he's he's got some good points yeah in america she stopped being so xenophobic about their own philosophers and and who they who they listen to and america has the ability to turn this around and look at its shadow work look at its shadow legacy and create a light legacy into the future right and i think that you know that's a fucking awesome opportunity and the delivery system and the technology is there yes you know what what you're talking about is the thing that makes a lot of people stop meditating because you know you're generally lured into some kind of meditative practice by the idea that you're gonna like you know i don't know some some kind of focus or peace or but you know or it's also the thing that makes me never want to go to fucking therapy you know it's like right because you it's not you have to like you have to go through the truth of what happened to you yep you can't skip over and it sucks people hate the truth it hurts it's brutal and and i i think when it was particularly when it comes to uh what you're talking about um i think it's so daunting and so like like really really like hard to wrap your head around the reality like look you were taught something that was propaganda plain and simple and not like you know not propaganda like uh it's kind of like you know whatever normal kind you know like you know bullshit like pep club at school you know like yay let's go falcons or whatever but propaganda like orwellian sort of propaganda like we are going to tell you something that is verifiably fundamentally incorrect or we're just gonna leave shit out like when when we tell you about like one of the this is from our last conversation this is another thing you told me that blew my fucking mind is just how when they're explaining slavery to kids in school at least especially when i was in school they they kind of like somewhere in the conversation they make it kind of seem weirdly normal you know what i mean like they don't use the term human trafficking they don't use the term kidnapping and god knows they're not saying and by the way it's not just like they're making some of these people do like forced like labor they were also raping them too and guess who is one of the people doing that well that was george fucking washington the guy that that we've been celebrating for so long that was one of the things that happened over there and probably happened while he was wearing their teeth no one's saying that you know what i mean because you're right you're absolutely right yeah no no i'm just i'm just i'm just i think it's uh i don't i don't mean to laugh but i just think i think the way you put it is is ironically realistic right like it's it's it there's an there's an irony to that like i'm going to i like i'm going to take everything that you have including your teeth and your dignity yeah and you can't be shit about it and i'm in here and i'm going to be here yeah and yeah guess what i'm going to be a fucking hero i'm going to be such an incredible hero there's going to be all kinds of like statues made of of me all over the fucking place and at some point when people talk about what i actually did they're going to be looked at is like some kind of like you know assholes for even even saying it out loud and you know that's that i do think in any human life the shadow work you do get a chance to pretend you do get a chance to like make sense of of in the worst way possible of the awful shit that happened to you or stuff you regret doing you do have the ability to trick yourself into thinking you know what when he hurt me like that he didn't mean to hurt me like that like that yeah yeah because it's easier and i he they he equated love with anger and violence so that community really was showing me love you know and i mean like you want to you want to get deep because i know you i know you i know you like that kind of shit so george washington right gw the dutch west indian company's name was in in in in uh in dutch was geo three year day west indian which is their initials their abbreviation was g wc are you kidding they initially called washington caesar so he was g wc now is it a coincidence no the company is it a coincidence that people who are who wanted private companies to have their own country elected someone or appointed someone that had the initials of the company or is that code to say like you it's you can close your doors now come on over here dude you fade it out right there hold on one second you'll come back this is annoying this okay wait you're back hold on so what's the last thing you stopped at code you were talking about like you can what was it was it so when so you have these colonies that are privately held or quasi quasi you know private sector and the government overreach is happening through the monarchy at the time and then you have these these these uh colonial slavers who are you know loyal to themselves and loyal to the private company more than they are through king obviously as we saw because of the revolution and then you see these people appoint someone who probably isn't qualified for the job but his initials are g wc george washington the caesar george washington's you know ceo george washington caesar and the the abbreviation for the dutch west indian company was g wc right so is that some sort of 17th century or 16th century code sorry seven yeah 16th century or 17th century code that um you know you're telling the company it's okay to close your doors now right we got to come on come on over here come play over here yeah yeah yeah it's okay it's not i mean people can believe in coincidence if they like but the world is is full of um really really diabolical sort of orchestrations that prove that coincidences are few and far between yeah come i mean and again it's like that that i think is always like the weird creepy game vampires like to play is it's like they like to hang out in that liminal place right in the open yeah they love doing this shit right in the open g wc g wc we told you it was right there in front of you the whole time it's kind of your fucking fault would you like look at the look at the money look at the fucking dollar bill what do you think we were take a look at the money like swampy green occult symbols all over the fucking thing new order of the ages oh no it's like what did you think that was did that look like happy paper to you happy paper oh man if the shit was like so happy we would like use it we would wallpaper those symbols all over the place but it's like it has a witchy quality to it you know it has a quality to it it's got a kind of like sulfuric sort of aura around it that is but also you know you've seen it for your whole life so you're like i don't know you know similarly like robert e lee school george why all these names you've seen them your whole fucking life you know so it's like they've been in front of your whole life so you don't you know in like if you're you're like average white dude you're not thinking about this stuff you know you're not contemplating what it really means or anything like that even if you're the if you're the average insert race doesn't even matter man like like i didn't think about this shit like until i was old enough to sort of educate myself on the subject like i didn't i didn't know there was anything wrong with going to a school named robert lee when i was 10 i didn't know like i just was like okay you know white people run shit and like they want to put it in our face i just thought it was fucked up but i didn't i didn't realize how insidious it was right until i got older and they've changed they've since changed the name i know thank god what's it called now barbara lee or something like that i it's against my parole to be within 500 feet um it's a what are you serious oh no they don't call it barbara lee do they like they left the lee i think so yeah they left the lee because they had like plaques that they didn't want to change they would save money i guess they had station i guess they had stationary i don't know we've already we've already ordered the stationary we gotta keep the lee look it's either we keep the robber or the fucking lee one or the other yeah which one do you want a budget won't cover completely redoing designs that's so fucking weird did they like yeah wait what you mentioned earlier you're so wait what is the new technology you're creating or do you work man yeah i've been working on something for a while man it's been um it's pretty spectacular man i i got if i could say so myself uh uh it's kind of my life's work honestly um the um idea started when i was working in the obama campaign in 2008 i i left hollywood for a little bit and i felt like my civic duty was to was to was to change the face of of who was in the white house you know and um you know give a little try to try to add a little hopey changey you know to my life and and and america at the time and so i was like 27 and i left uh i left hollywood for a few months and moved to pennsylvania and i was a surrogate for the obama campaign and if you know anything about pennsylvania you know that there's there's two cities in pennsylvania there's there's uh philadelphia and it's pittsburgh and everything in between is 1958 alabama basically yeah right and uh i spent a lot of time in all three of those places and i remember i was in a and i was in a place called moon township pennsylvania and i met a guy named mike at the sunglasses kiosk he's working at the mall there trying to get him to to register and you can't uh part of the federal laws that as as a surrogate you can't you can't push a candidate on people you can just register them okay like you can give them the pamphlets you can give them the information on both candidates but you cannot push a candidate on someone mike didn't want to register so i registered some other people came back to mike didn't want to register again uh i registered some other people came back to mike i said hey man i'm about to leave it's time i think it's time you know i think you should register to vote yeah he looked at me and he goes look me dead in my eye he goes i ain't voting for no nigger holy shit right yeah and i go well mind you i had been in 1958 alabama for a few weeks now so i'd heard that before jesus yeah brother so this is the 28th time i heard that and so like i i reacted less and less and less every time and so by this time i was like well why can't you vote for a nigger mike right and then so we so i took him to lunch i took him to sparrows and i don't need that so he ate it and uh we talked and i said mike tell me what's important to you and he goes uh he starts going on this long diatribe of foreign policy and this and i go mike you work at a sunglasses kiosk in muntashev pennsylvania you don't even know where aran is come on yeah talk to me talk to me talk to me for real you can't spell sara i'm who's saying right i don't think i could spell sara i'm what's saying so like let's let's really talk what's important to you mike like what it's what's what's important to your family on a day-to-day basis and he didn't really have any answers so i started kind of going through lists for him and then i said bucket so i tore the the cover sheet off of obama's pamphlet i tore the cover sheet off the canyons pamphlet and i put them both in front of unless i gave them a mark i said check off what's check off what's uh uh what what what what applies to you what's important to you yeah and he did and lo and behold he was a 70 percent match to rock obama wow because i know if i see a guy working at a sunglass kiosk in the mall in muntashev pennsylvania i know he's a democrat but he doesn't know he's a democrat right so wait wait wait oh you oh i got you okay no no no i got you i'm sorry my dumbass was like what does sunglasses have to do with no but i see it if you're if you're if you're a low-wage earner yeah i got you it's not like you're like you're like mega rich from selling sunglasses at a kiosk yeah even if he owned it like voting right you're like you're likely voting against your interests you know why you're voting against your church's tradition values you know what religion and racism is that important enough to hurt your family right truly is religion and racism enough to to go out and support a candidate who's going to hurt your family right and i asked him that question he couldn't really answer it and you know so we kept in touch and on election day he he emailed me and he said he voted for obama holy shit that's cool he got his parents to vote for obama got his friends and family and wife and you know his neighbors everybody like got 50 people to vote for him uh he said when it's right there in black and white you can't really deny it right he had the pamphlets right in front of him and he did the same thing to these people and i was like well that's got to be scalable i think you know people um people moving past the indoctrination of our forefathers and looking at a world that they can structure and help co-create in the way that serves them and i think that people can do that once they get past the idea that their tradition or their patterns are more important than their well-being right and that that's not only a political um endeavor that's also conscious consumerism for instance if i were to i after BLM i realized i needed to know which which which corporations uh supported the world that i wanted to see and it's not that i want to cancel a corporation i just want to support the ones that would support me right and so i figured out a way uh with some really brilliant coders to um crowdsource kindness uh and incentivize that through financial gain to the user so people get paid all the time and they get clicks based on the algorithms that we have now in social media um for uh division and uh disinformation right and hate clicks and you know uh anger mongering and fear mongering and all these and all these different things and these people fucking get paid they're getting paid sure do and i think there's something wrong with that and so like what's the answer to that and so i can't get i can't get into great detail about it now but i'd love to talk to you about it in a few months but we you know we'll have something clickable and uh a user experience in about a month and we're raising money for it and q1 q2 but um it's going to be a social media platform in which people are drawn there and magnetized there uh in a fact-driven community that's hold that the foundation that holds those people together is their morals values and principles and how they can interface with with each other by becoming better allies um better uh intersection analysts uh intersectionality cysts yeah i don't know and and kindness monger is basically like we have we we're devising a system with a basically a kindness credit score where you get paid in crypto for your level of engagement and kindness uh an allyship to other people um instead of having influences who are dancing on tiktok making six figures a year by yeah i mean your viewers can't see or your your listeners can't see what i'm doing but i'm doing a bad it was incredible thank you but instead of having those influences there's nothing wrong with those influences but i don't think that they're adding to where we're going i think that i would much rather have the young lady who worked at starbucks who was really energized by the by the by the by the power and the rhythm and the vibration and the frequency of 2020 but doesn't know how to organize now there's no tools for that right and there's no solutions for that and maybe she can leave her job and she can make six figures by being kind to people and by caring and by by being a professional philanthropist something that we're going to call a social impact or not a social influencer and um you know we're just structuring a community around that um why don't you have a kindness credit score why isn't why isn't kindness something that we can measure uh financially uh if you're putting good out into the world why does that just have to feel good why can't you make money off of it and um i think that you know i i hope my hope and my intention is that this is how we we we move um very old problems um into a new delivery system with new solutions that is cool you know because it's like there's a common notion in the world is nobody wants good news like you're not selling ad space with good news like and and um that's not what grabs the human attention it's that that doesn't that it's the fear porn that we're into it's the um it and so what you're saying is like that you think that there is a way to so i know really i know i know this way because we're we're our our our monetization model is not selling ads we are going to be the first app that actually so instead of so facebook facebook does now is they take your information they take your data they create nodes out of your data anytime that you click on anything it's becomes a node like let's say a node is a blossoming point in which all these directions can be ascertained and how you move on the internet how you move in cyberspace right yeah and so instantaneously whenever you are on facebook for one minute and you click on shit they are instantaneously turning your data you're the product they're turning your data into money for them right right yeah we're going we're going to bank your data for you and give it back to you and crypto wow that's cool so the longer you stay on our app you'll make money wow the the more engagement you have in kindness you'll make money kindness being measured by like what websites you're hanging out on or what output you're no so so so by the way if i'm asking too many questions because it's that's fine it's fine what is this podcast coming up uh this podcast will come out next week if that works for you okay i will not talk about exactly what the kindness metric is but it's but it's a reasonable standard of engagement in which someone can actually quit their job and be a kindness influencer or a social impactor or whatever you want to call it a professional ally and you can do it from home or you can do it from your phone i can't i can't give you the secret sauce yet but i'm happy to talk to you about it when uh when it's when it's too late to not not you but when it's too late for someone else to hate or too late to steal okay i never talk yeah yeah so i got you yep thank you but but trust me brother i've i've it's been percolating in my mind for since 2008 and it's it's been it's been in the forefront of my consciousness and with coders for the last three years and we i think we figured out something that's really fucking cool you're really fucking cool you're really fucking cool bro no every time man every time we

Johnny Pemberton, welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast. Is that what this is? Oh, wait, shit, hold on, before we do that, I gotta do the, okay, I'm not used to it. I'm doing the intro with Johnny here this time, guys, has to mix things up a little bit. Hey, everybody, it's me, Dunkin' Trussell, the Skrillex of podcasting. Oh, hey, I fucked up Skrillex. You did? I said Skrillex. Well, say that. You're the Skrillex. Yo, I'm the Skrillex of podcasting, I write it down. Hey, everybody, it's me, Dunkin' Trussell, the Skrillex of podcasting, and you have tuned into the Dunkin' Trussell family hour podcast, which just got elected by the UN and is going to be played in the beginning of the next UN meeting and in the hotel. Are you serious? The whole one or just a piece of it? Just the beginning part, like when they're coming in to sit down, they're gonna play the podcast. Is it just playing with music or just gonna play? No music, they just play the podcast and the ambassadors and world folks. I'm not even sure who is at the UN, but a lot of them, Kofi Anon will be there. Well, he passed away, but he left a good legacy, at least. That's right, well, they say that his spirit is always sitting in the UN. I love it, I don't can't do a Kofi Anon accent. There's no way to do a Kofi Anon accent without being kind or racist. So what do we do at the intro? You introduce, your name's Dunkin' Trussell. I've already said that. Oh yeah, so hey. It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. You're listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, which will be played at the UN. I already said that, let me go down this list. The Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by the wonderful humans over there at amazon.com. Yee-haw! These people are great, it's a hive of humans. It's a meat hive filled with just a buzzing of. Pack boys. Pack boys running up and down the. And hunting cats. Now a lot of people think that it's unethical that they have those honey cats there. Yeah, I mean, I'm on the fence. I'm not at all, I totally get it. Oh, you get it, okay. Yeah, because it's the same as when they put the cats in prison with the convicts and the convicts. Yeah, but they don't have to use honey cats. They could have used a different kind of cat, but. Well, the honey cats. I'm a prime member, I'm still doing prime, so. I'm a prime. I'm prime, so. So support the honey cats and use the honey cats. They spray venom, they keep everything moving. And they're sweet. And they're sweet. They're literally sweet. But they're hurting the people, right? They hurt some, I mean, it's undocumented. I don't want to speak out of turn here. I'm fairly certain that they have used and continue to use the honey cats to spray venom at the workers who are taking. Well, it's because they take too long on the security lines. Right. It's as you're coming through the security lines to get to work. Right. If you've doddle there, then. You're gonna get honey herded. You're gonna get herded by honey cat. You're gonna get that sweet slice. So anyway, I don't want to get into the deep corporate politics of Amazon or the reveal some of the stuff that I saw when they gave me the big tour they gave me, but. Must have been interesting. I love cats, man. And they're everywhere, all over Amazon. They are. Crawling everywhere. They actually had a problem apparently with, during the summer, a bunch of those cats got stuck down in one of those air conditioning vats. Oh, they got HVAC sucked. Yeah. They got stuck in the sucker, huh? Yeah. Was it the return vent? It was the outgoing air vent. Yeah. Outgoing air vent, okay. But by the time they got workers down there because the vents at Amazon go, I think, half a mile under the earth. Right, because it's so deep. Yeah. And the factory is built on top of a giant ice crystal, a methane crystal. Yeah. Well, it's a methane vent. Yeah. But it's so cold, it's an ice methane. Reverse methane. It's vapor. It's methane vapor. Blue meth, as they call it. Yeah, blue meth. Oh, Breaking Bad. Breaking Bad, man. It's so stupid. Have you seen Breaking Bad? What? Yeah, I just, I realized I was saying that. Anyway, I guess Breaking Bad was influenced by Amazon. You've got to see Breaking Bad. The meth shot. I know, yeah. It was blue. Yeah, blue meth. It was candy blue. I'm just kidding. They didn't have blue meth? No, I'm just kidding about. Have you seen it? I know you've seen it and like. Oh, I never finished it. They didn't? I didn't finish it. Anyway, we're brought to you by Amazon and there's a portal. If you go to dunkandtrustle.com in the comments section, if you go through that portal, the next time you're gonna buy something from Amazon, then I get a very small percentage of it. You click on it, not go through, you click on it. You click on the portal, Amazon pops up and you do whatever it is that you buy there. I continue to recommend bidets. Okay, I saw your bidet. It looks nice. It looks like it's. That's a lot. You think the bidet looks good? Well, I'll tell you what, it's definitely unobtrusive. It's not something, it's not a big hulking apparatus. It looks all right. It looks pretty good for what it is. I gotta say, I like the way it looks. Is it Japanese? That's very kind of you. Is it Japanese? You really are a nice friend. Hi, is that Japanese? It looks like something at a geriatric ward. I suppose, but what a nice place that would be to bidet. To bidet at a geriatric ward when you're getting that sweet geriatric ward volume pumped into you every few moments and your asshole being sprayed with a special high tech bidet. Mr. Robinson. Let me tell you. Mr. Robinson. Mr. Robinson, your son is here. Mr. Robinson. Let me tell you something, Johnny. There's a lot of things that you could do to change your life. And the easiest one is to get up a day. It's the easiest, there's another thing you can do if you don't wanna get up a day, is you can go buy all new socks. You empty your sock drawer out and you go and buy all new socks. I just shouldn't even think about that. Got that off Reddit. Wow. That's like a cheap and easy life hack sort of, huh? Yeah, new socks. New socks, because you have this, you open up your drawer and there is this multi-colored, glowing, fresh drawer of delightful socks. And you know the feeling when you put on a new pair of socks. It feels great. Nothing like it. Especially if it starts to become your favorite pair of socks. You look forward to those socks, you don't wanna get them dirty. I've got these red wool socks. Ooh, baby. Smart wool socks, you can probably buy them on Amazon through your portal. Yes. Or you can go to the Twisting the Wind on the same. Did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, did, the Farrell Audio Network. Did, did, did, did, did. And you could do the same thing. Don't monger your portals in my cash. I'm just returning the favor, Duncan. You're right. Guys, I don't care what portal you go through. Go through my portal, go through the Farrell portal, but go through somebody's portal when you're going to Amazon because it's a great way for you to support the phenomena of podcasting without actually having to donate wants and money or buy anything. It's just a cool thing that they do. So do it. Also, if you go to DuncanTrustle.com, we have brand new mugs. Let's clink them. Oh God, these are, guys, I really honestly was a little trepidatious when it came to getting into the mug game. I didn't think that I was gonna dive into those waters and swim around in the, in the mug. And get into the mug wars. The mug muck. Yeah, a lot of competition when it comes to the mug market. And a lot of folks are out there mongering, selling their mugs. So it's just a weird feeling. I didn't know if it looked good, but I gotta say I'm very proud of this mug. Looks real great, looks real. I like it because it's got that matte finish. It's smooth. It's got almost like a black wholeness to it to where you look in there and it's all, it's like the coffee is, there's an infinite amount of coffee. Oh God, guys, these mugs are going down. Even as we do this, I'm watching the numbers drop. Johnny, can you tell me what the price that, what else they get if they order these mugs? I'll tell you right now, you get a shipping is not included, but it does come shipped. It will be shipped. It will be shipped. You do not have to pick it up. Yes. It is a double-sided print. So you can look at it while you drink if you're left-handed or right-handed and you can show the person you're drinking with that same thing you're looking at. That's right. So you're not gonna get those mug blind spots. There's a lot. Right, none of that. How many times have you quietly laughed at somebody because they thought that you could see the design on their mug, but they were holding it the wrong way? Because they're lefty. This is not a lefty, righty, discriminant mug, which is a big thing in our society now because I hear that left-handed people are about to make a big push for rights. That's exactly the, yes. These mugs are not just a great way for you to enjoy a nice cup of tea. They're also a way for you to show people that you support left-handed and right people. Well, you're a leftist. Left, right. You're a leftist. The rights of the left. I'm a leftist. I'm a leftist. Yes, I'm a leftist too. No, I think that the left-handed people, their rights have been taken away for... They're left... See, the very language is rooted in this whole discrimination. But if you said rights, I mean, what does that say? That's like saying, oh, look at how dark and black and evil that is. That's right. You're totally right, man. You're totally right. So you're saying it again. You just said I'm right, see? Duncan, the language has to change. I gotta say this. I'm correct. You're left. You're totally left. Yes, thank you. Everything that you're saying is completely 100% left. That's what I left you there. And if you guys wanna do the left thing, then... Do the left thing, baby. If you wanna do the left thing, right now, go to dugitrosil.com, order one of these wonderful mugs, and if you order right now, we will include with every single carton a guaranteed dead baby ghost. They're in there. How awesome is that? Are they unique? These are you, whoa. I mean, the dead baby ghost, or is it like a spawn of the same one? No, we do not do that. Oh, you don't spawn? I don't really appreciate you insinuating that I would do that. You know what, Duncan? I've been burned in the past. Yeah, well, there's nothing worse than when you get your baby ghost, and then your friend brings his baby ghost out. Oh, it's the same baby ghost. Same baby ghost. And they're talking in unison. It's like, this is hardly scary. No, these are unique, 100% baby ghost shipped in directly from Afghanistan. Oh, wow. The one I got's from Guatemala. Yeah, those are okay, but you know, you want the ones that are like... Yeah. I like a spicy ghost. Yeah. I like a little... Like a little curry on that ghost. Yes, I do. I want the thing to be a little not happy. I like a... A little surly. A little surly. Every once in a while, I like something non-breakable to fall off a shelf. Those kinds of ghosts are great. And those are the kind of ghosts you're gonna get when you order one of these mugs within the next 25 minutes. You're gonna get a ghost. You're gonna get an invisible flag that has the DMT written on it. Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, DMT, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun. So go get a mug. Oh, finally. And then we're gonna get in this podcast. Sorry, I've never done this before. And Johnny, I didn't know what it would be. You would add so much to it. Well, you know, that's what I do. They fly me all around, and that's what they fly me around for. Thank you so much for coming in and spicing up this cast, my friend. If you go to duckatrustle.com, you're gonna see a bunch of new dates there at the end of January. I'm coming to Texas, Dallas, Houston, and Austin. And then if you look in March, there's many, many dates in the Midwest that are coming up. And in April, there's gonna be many dates that are happening in the East Coast. And hopefully, I can- Are these live podcasts? Are these live podcasts? And I hope I can convince you to come to one or two of them, Johnny, as a guest. I will send my ghost. No, I need your real body there. I don't want your ghost. You want my ghost? Yeah, so that's it. Johnny, I'm just starting. I'm just looking at the computer. Everything's different now, guys. That's what I was afraid of. Uh-oh. Let's see if that recorded. And now, everyone, please welcome to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour Podcast, America's favorite man, Johnny Pemberton. Man, I'm glad you're here, Johnny. Can we just get- Yeah. Dissidents. Christmas is here. It's upon us. The holidays are here, as they say. It's not just Christmas. For a lot of people, it's Hanukkah. It's Hanukkah, or it's other holidays that actually have nothing to do with this time of year. Just sort of a weird, shitty coincidence. The Seinfeld holiday. Oh, what is that? Christmaca. Yeah, something like that. Warned by fifth grade teachers far and wide. Far and wide. That's such a teacher's shirt to wear. Hey, I'm cool. Yeah. It's also, but isn't it kind of like, you know, like that flying spaghetti monster? I don't believe in nothing. You know, isn't it kind of like a, it's like one of those people who still feel like they're rebelling by resisting Christmas? Like Christmas is just a corporate holiday. Yeah, that thing. Yeah, it's also a pagan holiday too. It's also the best pagan holiday ever. It's a lot of things. Yeah, do you know about the Krampus? It's the demon Santa, right? Yeah, I've only seen images of him, but what's his deal? Some old Germanic tradition, but he's a, he's, you know how there's the part of Santa where he leaves coal? Yes. Well, imagine if Santa, that part of Santa had like a, if Santa's the white part and the Krampus is the dark, evil, black part, he comes and he, some myths has him stealing away bad children and drowning them in a bathtub. I don't know. Some of them he comes by with a stick and he beats the children. And some of them he just leaves them. It's, he's just, he's like, he's has like a goat face, I think. There's gotta be a movie with Krampus in it, right? I don't think there is a full on Krampus movie, but if there is, it's probably German or something. There should be. There was some, I was reading about this recently, there's some like, I think the government of Switzerland or something put an edict saying, the Krampus is not real. Do not talk about the Krampus. Cause they wanted people to not talk about it cause they thought it was so evil. Cause it really is, it's the most evil thing you can think of. It looks like Baphomet, but it looks, it's a Baphomet, but it's a story you tell to kids. I mean, it looks exactly like Baphomet, right? What is, who is Baphomet? Baphomet is the video. So Baphomet has a goat's head. Right, okay. Hand pointing up, hand pointing down, hermaphrodite, penis and boobs. Wow. I didn't know that. Yes, hermaphrodite. That's right. Wow. Represents, it's like the, it's like the occult yin-yang. Cause it's like, cause there's neutrality in it, right? Is that the idea? Well, it's, or balance. Balance, okay. It's nothing worse than balance. And also he's got this little, Little joint? Grin on it. He's got a little joint thing. He's got like a little, a little pinner he's puffing on. Little hash pinner. Hey man, it's all the same. Take me to your dealer, man. It's actually pronounced Baphomet, but I don't give a shit. Hey, can I get a ride? Yeah, on Tuesdays I don't drive. I'm trying to do my part. If it's yellow, let it mellow, dude. Yeah. If it's brown, shit. You don't have to flush it. If it's brown, dive into it, because it's a portal into the ether where the Inokian angels live. Do you ever just look at your shit? Do you ever just look at your shit? Baphomet is, I like, one really cool thing is a lot of times if you look closely, you'll see that there's a grin on his face. There's grinning, okay. It's not quite a grin, but he seems to think something's funny and somebody who knows about this stuff, who actually, I record an episode with, it's gonna come up. I would have put it on today, but I've had like three spiritual podcasts in a row. So I'm trying to like break it up a little bit, but this guy is what is called, shit, I can't even remember his title, but he is a Thelomite who is- Thelomite, that sounds like a crystal. It's an Alistar Crowley disciple. So he was telling me all about the meaning of the symbol, Baphomet, and how it represents the weird, ridiculous absurdity of nature that here is a thing with a goat head, with a penis and boobs. It's a person, but it's not. It's like a ridiculous stuff together thing which represents the kind of chaotic nature of- Of nature. Nature. Wow. I didn't even think I'd like it as that much, but I guess I do. It's so cool. I love that stuff because hidden underneath, all those symbols, it's so cool because at first, they generally will scare you away, and then after you get over your fear of the thing and start studying it, they'll start teaching you, and then as the more that they teach you, the more you realize, of course they don't represent some malefic entity that comes springing out at you to devour you or take your soul, but it just is sort of a mandala to represent the functioning of a specific, the way that the universe works through a specific lens, which is- Like a swastika. Like a swastika. I actually heard some story about that, and how I guess the swastika is one of the most ancient symbols that exists. Yes. And how they found it. Some place, some very, some very, very old piece of, or some archaeologists found some piece of, I think ivory or something that was, that was whittled into something, a shape with swastikas emblazoned in like the pattern. They look at the elephant tusk in a microscope, and you actually see that swastika pattern in the grain of the ivory. Whoa. It's this naturally occurring symbol, basically. Yeah. Yeah, isn't that crazy? It's crazy. Isn't that crazy? Yeah, you see, if you look at sand dollars. They have a pentagram. They have pentagrams. They have vivid pentagrams, and also a friend of mine had a plant that had a pentagram in the center of it, and so that's just one of the many hilarious things that terrified theists tend to do in the world. They take a symbol that grows from nature, they apply their own darkness on it. And then it becomes like this thing you can scare the shit out of people with, or put on someone's garage door to make them feel pain. You must understand that these symbols represent Satan. Don't let them fool you with their new age talk. They're gonna say, no, no, no, these symbols occur in nature. Well, that's exactly what they've been taught to say by their dark lord. Well, because they love nature, you see. Now, at first you might hear me say, I love nature and I do love nature. I love a good salad. I love a good salad, and I like an ice walk in a forest. I'm not against it, I'm not opposed. Here's why I love it. I don't love it because it is of the natural world. I love it because it comes from my father in heaven, who is the creator of the natural world. And these people will teach you to worship nature, worship the trees, worship the rivers, worship the kitty cats, worship the doggies, worship the piggies, and the next thing you know, you've forgotten the creator, you see. The Lord will provide. The Lord will provide for Christmas Lodge. The Lord will get us married when we're ready to be married. That's right. I don't know if I'm ready to be married to you yet, Mary, but I wanna get married to you. This, by the way, for those of you who aren't aware of one of the great movies of all time. One of the great movies. This is truly, if you're somebody who listened to this before Christmas, this is the night before Christmas or the night before the night before Christmas or Christmas itself. And you wanna do yourself a favor. What you do is you watch Christmas Lodge with your family. It's available for $2.99 and pretty much across the board streaming services in SD. You don't need an HD.

And it is just, and then you wanna just pack up whatever sort of blowpipe you have there. Yes. Whatever sort of brain blasters you've got. Whatever you got. Whatever concoction. If you wanna whip up a cocktail with rum and mint leaves. Strong. Uh-oh. It's still, if you wanna, I'm sorry, we had a bit of a garage band problem. You want a strong drink. A strong drink. A nice thick pinner. Maybe like a micro dose of mushrooms or like a micro dose of LSD. Something like that. Some very, a very mild, mild amount of some psychedelic. A double espresso. Double espresso. Maybe with a little bit of chocolate in there. Yeah. A fine stout. A hearty, sturdy stout. I'm gonna say Chame. Chame is a good one. That's a Belgian territory, but it's not gonna do you wrong. It's not gonna do you wrong. A Belgian, maybe like any type of anything with some balls to it. And get some like, get one of those like, if you have a musty old snuggie. Oh yeah. Yeah, also if you've got some of your dad's old running shoes. Oh yeah. If he like kept in the garage, he couldn't throw away. That's great. Get those near. Get those, put them on or just tie them up and hang them on the tree. Put them on the table just in front of you so that they can watch too. Let them watch. Your dad's old tennis shoes, watch this too. If you've got a crucifix necklace. Wear it. Put it on somewhere. Put it on. Put it on, hang it on if you have a crucifix, even ankle it. If you've got some hair gel, gel your hair back. In your nipples. Put, do a little bit, a little bit, be as good on the nipples as peppermint oil. Little peppermint oil on the nipples. Gel the hair back, dad's running shoes, double espresso, Chame, and a big old bong rip or a nice pinner from somebody. There's some kind of edible marijuana. Something, but you gotta do this about, if it's gonna do at least an hour before you start the Christmas Lodge. Also, if you have a idol, like a Kali idol, like the goddess Kali or a poster, like a black light poster depicting Pele or Kali or any sort of ferocious feminine goddess energies. Yeah, this is a feminine movie. Yeah, put that near, like put out the poster. Some put a shrine to Kali or Pele in the same. I'm getting horny thinking about that. Yeah. Actress. Oh, she's beautiful. Yeah. I'm just gonna get a little horny here. It is. Oops, got a little horny. You are going to get your second chakra. Get a friend too. It's gonna get so wet. Oh my God, is that where the wetness comes from? Is that what you see? I think so, yeah. First chakra is survival. Second chakra is sex. Yeah, number two. What's the third chakra? I believe that third chakra is either. I don't know shit from chakra. I don't know shit from chakra. I believe that third chakra. I don't know shit from chakra. I came in here, I tell you what, I can tell you how to get the turbid spell, but I don't know shit from chakra. First chakra is survival. Second chakra, sex. Third chakra, heart, food, cuisine. Okay, which is food, right? We all know that. Neck, fifth, forehead, sixth. No, I think I'm missing a fucking chakra. That's what you're gonna have. Is there a chakra hotline? That'd be a great, there's gotta be a chakra hotline. 1-800-SHOCK-IT-TO-YAH. Hello. Hi, welcome to the chakra hotline. This is Mindy. Hey Mindy, listen, I'm not positive, but I think I'm missing one of my chakras. Okay, are you on our mailing list? Yes, I am. Okay, what's your name? Darren Tonton. Okay, is that your email address? Cause we have, we searched everything by email. Yeah, Darren Tonton at chakramail.edu. Okay, nothing's coming up. Are you sure that's correct? It's okay. It's okay if you haven't read it yet. It's three hours in Darren. Oh, okay. What a weird, what a fun name. Wow, no wonder you're calling. Okay. It's kind of like a purr in the middle. Let me just type this in. Okay, I've got you in the computer now. Oh, right, Darren. Now you're in the computer at chakra at 1-800-SHOCK-IT-TO-YAH. What can I help you with? Well, so I just... Shock-IT-TO-YAH, just let it fly. I was doing my morning chakra meditations. Oh, really? In toning the sacred names, I had just unfolded myself from lavender flower and... Wow, you're very small. That's good, though. We have big lavender flowers up here in Alaska. Oh, you do? Oh, Alaska. I love Alaska. Yeah, you won't believe how big they get out there. I was there with my sister 12 years ago. What's her name? Her name? Well, I don't speak it anymore, but I can talk to you about it later if we want to meet in person. Well, just because your voice sounds familiar, so... Well, like I said, I don't speak her name anymore. It's a testament to her. Many of us do not speak her name if she's who I think she is. Maybe you could give me a little drop of a hint there, Darren. A drop of a hint? A drop of a hint, you know, a hint of a drop. The gargantuan of the mountains. Well, I think we're on the same page here. The crushing of the Dover orphanage. The liquefaction of Father Danson. That's the reason we don't speak her name, yes. We don't like to talk... The incineration of the heart of... Look, Darren, we don't like to talk about the liquefaction of Father Danson, okay? We don't like to talk about that here because it means a lot to us. We took us six months to get realigned after that. I wake up screaming every night because of your sister. She's not my sister. She is our sister. She's no one's sister. Her name shall not be uttered. And the fact that you still connect yourself with her in any way, mentally, verbally, all of these are forbidden. You called me. I'd left Alaska for... I called because I think I missed it, Darren. You called me, Darren. No, Chakra! I did not call to get indoctrinated by you. What kind of asshole calls up a Chakra hotline asking these kind of questions and accuses you? What kind of asshole tries to spread their awful sister cult over a Chakra hotline, especially someone who... I'm not spreading shit, God damn it. You shouldn't be even living in Alaska. It's too close to the Tiger Forest where that shit happened when that meteor would knock those trees down, OK? The Tiger Forest is a sacred place. To the Tiber, whatever it called. I don't give a fruit what it's called, OK? God, you got me angry. I haven't been angry in 12 years. You little bitch. You little piece of shit. I want to call up somebody so I can... There's got to be a line you can call to be berated, right? Berated by a hippie. Well, you know, they've got that. Remember the Brent Weimbox, call it angry black dude thing? What was that? Something about calling out someone for being a bitch or something like that. You call this number and thugs talk to a thug and they're like hard thugs. That's awesome. There should be a variety of spectrum of these lines. I would call... I want to be berated by a very strong, feminine hippie who's just like, piece of shit, you fucking idiot. Why would you park there? Why would you even drive? God damn it. You know that Morgan's not going to be here tomorrow. Excuse me. Is this yours? Is this yours? Did you drop this? It's a cigarette. Did you drop this? I think this is yours. Did you drop this cigarette? I think it's yours. Is this yours? Is this yours? Oh, I'm sorry. Is this yours? Hi. Is this yours? I think you dropped this. You know, when I was in high school, one of my friends went up to a rainbow gathering. You know what the rainbow gatherings are? I do not know. So the rainbow gatherings are... I don't know if these even still happen, but this sort of nomadic group of Burning Man style mountain hippies wanders through the countryside, gathering deep in national forests where they reside for a week or so. It's the rainbow tribe. It's a tribe of hippies. They do a nomadic tribe of hippies. I don't know if they still exist. I bet they do. But whenever they came to, they would come to like Pisgah National Forest when I was in high school. And that is what you would go up there and you could trade them sandwiches for acid. Oh my God. And so like, yeah. This sounds great. You have to hike deep, deep into the forest. Sandwiches for acid. Deep in the forest to find them. Right. But one of my friends was up there and I guess he dropped a cigarette on the ground, which you shouldn't do. It's rude. You shouldn't do that. But he dropped the cigarette on the ground and was walking and a hippie started following him, this hippie girl. And like, you drop something, you drop something. And he wouldn't take the cigarette from her. He was being a dick. So he just kept walking to see how far she would follow him. He said she followed him for like two miles. You drop something, you drop something. Well, what else has she got to do? Yeah. I mean, he didn't have a sandwich, so I just read this great book about the Appalachian Trail, Speaking of Forest. You read this book called The Walk on the Woods by Bill Bryson. Yeah, I ever did that. Oh my God. It's the best thing I've ever read. I think I read that book. It's awesome. This is the- It's an old book. 1997. This is the guy- He's like a real sarcastic, whip smart essayist. But he's not just talking about him on the Appalachian. He's with a guy named, it was a buddy named Steven Katz. They hike most of the Appalachian Trail. I don't think I read it. Oh, it is the best. Talk about commentary on National Forest. Oh, it is funny. Like what? Just this guy, he's like a blend of Dave Sideris and James Kuntzler, but he's just super, it's just hilarious, but he also talks a lot about National Forest and just the politics of it and just all about nature and trees. So it's like this perfect blend of stuff that, I don't know, for me, for me it was like the perfect book ever because it's the perfect blend of trees and like nature knowledge mixed with sort of sarcastic commentary on sort of these people now who like, he's making fun of people who are like gear obsessed, day hikers or people who are kind of doing things for a sort of, not the wrong reason, but just, you know what I mean? Like the sort of holier than the owl people who are out in nature. It's a form of self-flagellation or something? Yeah, sort of, well, not so much self-flagellation but people who are just sort of how, well, he talks about a lot of stuff. He talks about how there's so much, so many people who go to these national parks who are sort of just there for just this real brief experience when the whole point of it and the whole beauty of it is that is sort of this, the massive, just the effect it has on you when you really submerge yourself in it as opposed to just sort of dipping your toe in it, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's all bound up with all this stuff. But that thing that you're talking about, that feeling of expansiveness that comes when you're in nature. It's terrifying. Yes, it is so terrifying. And, you know, this feeling is identical to the feeling that the Buddhists are teaching you as possible through meditation, that the two are identical when you go into the, any place deep in nature and you're being buffeted by the life energy of planet Earth. And you're being, you're looking around and seeing just this soaring expanse. And you get that feeling of like, my God, things are so big. I had no idea how big things are. And it gives you a sense of relief. It does. It's like, ah, it's scary, but it gives you a, it's both, like a big sense that your whole body feels like for a second, it's putting down just a terrible suitcase filled with just bricks for a second as it's out there. You're, and that's the feeling of being healed. You're being healed by nature. You're being, you're returning to what is possible. And then it'll, then you get hammered with this nostalgic feeling of like, what have we lost? What have we lost? Oh God, what have we lost? And then, yeah, so that's a great, incredible, beautiful, trippy feeling, but it's the same damn feeling you get from meditating, minus the what have we lost sense because you realize that that feeling is possible regardless of your surroundings or your environment. Yeah, it may, you could say the meditation happens in all kinds of things, not just, because if you're, this guy's talking about walking about almost 20 miles a day sometimes, when you do that, you're just so exhausted that your brain switches into this weird zone where you're basically, you're waking, you're meditating while you're awake. You're just this, you're in that zone where you're just, it's, everything is the same. You're just walking through this thing where all you see is trees and it's nothing, something really dynamic about it and that's what makes it special, is that it's this vastness that affects you in a subtle way. It's not like a fucking, wow man, it's like hitting a jump on a snowboard, it's the opposite, it's this thing where, it's like you're in a kaleidoscope. Yeah, you're in this, you're just in this never ending, weird shifting of this repeating variable, which is the plant life that's just like, you're just sort of constantly moving through that and then the more you do that, the more you start losing yourself. Right, you lose yourself, that's the whole thing. Yeah, and that- If you can't have it, there's no room for it. Yeah, right, but now here's where it gets- There's no energy for it. This is where it's quite interesting. What you're saying is in Buddhism, like it's really hilarious. Atheists are constantly attacking the idea of God. There's no God, there's no God, there's no God. They're really into like talking about there's no God, they love it. Buddhism takes it one step down and they say, wait a second, not only is there no God, there's no self, there's no fucking self. Your whole thing that you are thinking that you have discovered about God, you need to take it a one step deeper and realize that in fact, the idea that you have a self and essential nature and lasting quality is that's your God. The self is the God of the Atheists. Yeah, you're praying to yourself. Yes, you're praying to yourself. And then- You never thought about that way, that makes sense, because that's why people, that's why atheists are so fucking annoying is because of that it's a very self-centered person, I guess I never thought about that. They're worshiping because they're still upholding this one, they've managed to get out which is a great feat for a lot of people who have brainwashed their whole life into thinking about this one idea, this ridiculous idea of the personified God being the Jehovah force. But if you go down to that one step below that and then you start playing around with that, like wait a minute, do I have a self? If I do have a self, what are its qualities? What is it? And then you start searching for yourself using yourself. And then the more that you do that, you begin to like realize that you're sort of not there. And that's why when you're in the forest or in deep in nature, what's really happening is not that you're getting hypnotized or that not that some abnormal thing is happening. What's happening is that you're beginning to tune in and to resonate with the truth, with the, as true as true as you can get, which is what's springing up out of the earth with no intention behind it, other than just this explosion of creation. You get into that shit. Whew, you start resonating with that. And now it's like, where am I? I've walked for four hours and I forgot that I existed. I just became- And guess where I ended up? At the Christmas Lodge. That's how you get to the Christmas Lodge. How do you get there? There are no directions at the Christmas Lodge. Just start walking. And once you lose yourself and submit to the Lord. When I was watching that, I was thinking about all the overarching Christian messages in there. But for some reason, that doesn't really bother me because if you think about it, everything you're saying is kind of, if you look at Christianity sometimes that way, it almost, if you look at it through the lens of Buddhism, it almost makes sense. How so? Because they're talking about stuff like, oh, don't worry about, the Lord will provide. Yes. And it's like, that's, you could just, if we'll take the word Lord out and it's the same as anything else where it's saying, don't worry about something you have no control over, something will, you're not gonna die as long as you strive to do good and help others. I mean, I guess I just- They don't say that you're not gonna die. They don't, but I don't think Christians say that either, do they? Well, Christians say the idea, it's like, if you go with a fundamentalist version of Christianity, then you have- Well, that's different. That's totally different, yeah. I'm trying to think of the idea is, you have this being, Jesus Christ. The Son of God. So this is a deity. God has to show how much God loves the world or to cleanse the, so it's like, in Buddhism, you have the underlying first principle of Buddhism which is life is suffering, right? Not sense of suffering that everybody feels underneath it all. That feeling that if you really like, suddenly I give you everything you want, everything that you dream of, you still are not happy, that's called in Buddhism, fundamental dissatisfaction. So, fundamental dissatisfaction in Buddhism is, I think, could be compared to what the Christians call original sin, which is this sense of being kind of- You're tainted from birth with nothing you can do about it. You are, yeah. That's it. Christianity's answer to that is what you would call bhakti yoga, which is that I will fall in love with Jesus Christ. I will open my heart to Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the personification of all love. I will spend my days thinking of this being, praying to this being, spreading it, spreading the message of this being. I will fully recognize that the only connection that I can ever have with God is through this being. There's no other path. In other words, it's a complete 100% absorption into this entity that you have brought into your heart and which is guiding your every move. So, somewhere in there you lose yourself to the Lord. You've given yourself up for Christ. You are now a true, pure servant of God, and the you that you thought you were no longer exists, and that's called being born again. It's like Flannery O'Connor. Yeah, what do you mean? I think all of her, I think I'm not misspeaking here, but all of her, I think I'm probably not Flannery O'Connor, but a lot of her writing, she was, she feared that she wasn't writing, she wasn't good enough for a writer to, her gift was not being used wisely enough. Wow, what is it? I think it's something she apologized to God for not using her gift for him as much as she could have. Something like that. Yeah, well, that's the sense of like the, the more you start being honest in the world, then you do start realizing, before you get to that beautiful merging state, generally, as you begin to like really meditate and contemplate who you are and where you are and what you are and how you act, and you start practicing mindfulness and really watching the way you act. It ain't pretty, man. There's a lot of layers- Turbulence. There are parts of yourself that you don't wanna admit are there. You can't even fucking believe how the more you open yourself up to who you really are, it's a lot of shocking aspects of yourself. Selfish, perhaps, greedy, perhaps you, just things that you've done in the past that you- You can't reckon or you can't come to, to be, what's it called when you come to terms with something? Is it reconciled? Reconciled, yeah, you can't reconcile the things you've done. Yeah, the hard drive is fragmented. You know, there's like just things in it that are just so, and a lot of people, you're spending your entire life trying to not, to avoid dealing with those parts of yourself and looking the other way. So you're always looking towards distraction to escape from this fundamental, these like- Let's say you burned down a Christmas lodge. And when you were a kid. Oh, God. And then you barbecued an entire Christmas lodge. And it was filled with infants. And in old people. And cats. Cats, honey cats. Honey cats, the sweetest, most golden brown sweet, the lavender smell and fur. Infants feeding off one of the honey cat and the elderly feeding off the other. And yeah, the elderly, and you burned it down. You burned it down as a seven-year-old. You had just enough knowledge, no, it was wrong. You couldn't bear the sight of looking through that stained glass window and seeing those children enjoying and suckling the honey cats. So you burned down the Christmas lodge. And now for the rest of your life, you deal with this constant feeling of disease. You feel like you don't fit in. You feel like you could never forgive yourself. You could never tell people that. Well, interestingly enough, every single reaction people are having to that darkness is a completely healthy reaction. If it's to try to escape dealing with your own darkness by getting into video games or sex or drugs or TV or your job or money or whatever the thing it is, that's fine, man. That's a form of meditation in its own right. You've just constructed a God that looks like a video game or you've constructed a God that looks like a vagina or you've constructed a God that looks like money and you're worshiping, worshiping, worshiping that God. And you're doing this because you're trying to deal with the pain of this- Of living. Of living. So, but when you start meditating, you start turning around, looking into that shit. And that is what they call it. That is a fucking mess, man. That's a mess that can be. Looking at the shit. Yeah, the inner shit. But you start learning to sit with it a little bit longer than you normally would. In Buddhism, you're learning to begin to like, Buddhism is like a very, it can be a very surgical, technical series of mental exercises that begin to dissolve the illusion of the self. And without a self, all that other stuff kind of becomes dissolved as well. It falls away. Yes. Yeah, so it's a different practice. Whereas you're doing the same thing in Christianity by falling in love with Jesus Christ and trying to, in serving him. Now you have like lost yourself in the love of the Lord. Right. That's when I watched that. I kept thinking about that. I'm laughing at it and I'm making fun of it, at the same time. All that stuff makes a lot of sense because I'm a firm believer in providence and things. Like, if you have everything set up for something and you really think about it a lot, if you're thinking on it and really something will come your way to provide for you in some sense, the providence of the Lord will pull. The Lord will provide. And maybe not exactly what you wanted, but something, there'll be some little thing, some little thing that will help out in some weird little way. Yeah, sure. And that's the same. That's like a very Christian idea that you have the providence of the Lord being provided by the Lord. Grace. Are you talking about the term grace? Grace, yeah. Grace, yeah. That is, I think that that. It seems like a universal idea. Yeah, man. It's just, yeah, universal idea. I think, I believe that too. If you're working hard, if you're, it's like, if you're doing the magical ritual of your life right and you have the necessary components for whatever spell it is you're trying to cast and you have gone through the necessary purification rituals, whatever that may be, whether it's cutting down on dope because you want to focus more, whether it's jogging. Something. Exercising. Right, anything like that. When you start getting those things going, then. Little things help out. Little birds like swoop by and pick up a string of your balloon chair and help fly. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, and it's true. You do, that synchronicity will start happening more. And you're all. Wow, you need help with this? Well, guess what? I got a hundred pounds of logs here. Yeah. You trying to have a hundred pound log fire? That's it. Hold on, I'm trying to get rid of a hundred pounds of logs. That's it. Wait a minute. It's kind of like, you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of some scene in Star Wars when the Jedi's, I think they went under the ocean, but every single thing in the universe was kind of opening up for them in this very, like, Taoist way to let them through. And it's like that, it's because you sort of, if you're in opposition to the rest of the universe, which you are, or as our Lord Jesus Christ says, a house divided upon itself cannot stand. So if you're opposed to the universe, which is your house, you are the house of the universe, and you are residing within the house of the universe at the same time. You will not win. You can't win. You can't win because you're thinking you can win it all. You can't, yeah, if you can't play it, it's not a game, it's not a game to win. No, it's a game to lose, actually. This is why they call it surrender. That term gets used all the time because what you get from winning the game, for a lot of people, means not feeling love. Winning the game means not expressing love. Winning the games mean, the game generally means being a complete psychic iceberg that feels nothing. You're like, yeah, you're a fucking lunatic. You're just this psychic iceberg is a great way to describe it. Like some sort of a ninja surgeon of ice, ice laser. Ice laser, you haven't felt in so long, and when you do start feeling, yeah, that's it. Ice laser, try to get in my house. Try to go ahead, try to take my stuff. Go ahead, try to pass me. Yeah, ice laser. Yeah, that's it, yeah. Ultimate selfishness, and anytime you start feeling at all, then you experience, I think, what this kind of existential nausea. Anytime you start feeling just the slightest little bit, you start, you feel this swooning, like oh, oh, oh, oh. And the tears will start coming because you're feeling for one quick second. If something gets you, like in a movie, you're watching a movie and suddenly you start crying and your heart opens up, you're like, oh, oh, oh, oh. Here it comes. It's fucked up and you try to stop it. Everything inside of you tries to stop it. So that's the war. And the moment you give up trying to stop that rush of beautiful love feelings coming out of you, even in the slightest way, the moment you stop doing that, man, that is when you lose the war. You lost, but it's great, though. Yeah, nothing feels better. Nothing feels better, because lose the war against God and that is how you receive the Lord's providence. If you wanna receive the- It's like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It's almost like the world is replete with examples of that sort of thing. Yes, it is. Of just the thing like, okay, you lost and you didn't die, well, guess what? You just won! There you go. I had this guy on my podcast, he's a clown. He studied with a French clown for years. What is that called, that kind of clown? I don't know what it's called. There's a certain name to it, but it's a real clown, like clowning in the sense of a very old tradition, not like putting a red nose on and stuff. Yeah. He talked about how it's hard because they berate you so much. They just, they belittle you because the whole idea is a clown. Well, clown's a very old idea. It's one of the oldest ideas in drama, which you could say that drama is life because the drama is invented by the Greeks is something used to describe the way we live. It's the story. It's the beginning and the middle and end and that's life. And the clown, he said, the clown lives in the kingdom of the bad. So the clown is basically physical embodiment of failure. Wow. And I just like, when he told me that, it made so much sense because that's what it is. It's just your, the clown is, he, he's, that's why you laugh at him. That's why, because he's, he's constantly failing. He's, he's so in the moment that he exists in this kingdom where everything he does is the wrong thing and the bad thing. So it's this thing where in a way, it's the most elevated person in any environment because I make, I mean, I try, it's hard to make sense of like with words, but something about that, the kingdom of the bad makes so much sense because you're living in that failure. Like, you know, when you do stand up, the first time you bombed, but it felt, we were okay with bombing. It's like that thing where you're like, oh, I'm, I'm, I'm not dying right now, even though everything terrible in the world is happening to my face. So that's, that's what you're doing when a cloning, that idea of cloning is that when you exist in that kingdom of bad, when you're failing, and you're just cause you're, you're failing because you're, it's not so much that you're failing is that you're putting yourself out there to fail. You have to be okay with failure. And when you're okay with failure, that's when great things happen is because you're living in the moment and you're being honest because you're, it doesn't matter what happens cause you're not, you're living in the kingdom of the bad. You're bad. You're terrible. So if you're terrible, that's why, I think it's why all those people who are like, who like terrible people who've reformed, they're, they're such, they're so good at being humanitarians cause they've already done like, oh my God, I'm such a terrible person. I've done the worst things you can possibly do. And so now I don't like care about anything. So all I can do is, is try to make amends and do good. Right. There, yeah, there's been some kind of like a redemption that has come to them through just surrendering to what they, what they are. It's like when you get dirty. Like you can't, I can't get any dirtier. So it might as well just keep getting dirty. Yeah. I think, yeah, right. I got it. Yeah. That's like a, that's a very mystical archetype that being doing that. And the, the, anything that you're doing that helps you start understanding the, what you really like, the kingdom of the bad as they call it. It's like, there's a, the idea is that the kingdom of the bad and the kingdom of the good, if there was a, if there, there must be that thing and then it's opposite, right? The kingdom of the bad and the kingdom of the good. All of these kingdoms are dependent on one thing. That is human attention. They can't exist without human attention. They can't exist without the eyes of a person looking out into the world. And so bad and good, concepts, light and dark, all of these are dependent on human attention. Without your attention on any of these concepts, we have nothing. So it's neutrality. Neutrality. So the clown can only exist in a state of being opposed, right? A clown must always be in opposition. The universe must be opposing the clown, right? I think so. Clowns, it's a fool. It's a person who is the, they're doing things in the- Wrong way. The wrong way or they just, they don't care. But the perfectly wrong way. Right. So that's kind of cool. And that's an interesting concept is like doing, cause then the moment you start doing something perfectly wrong, isn't the thing instantaneously transformed into something right? Exactly. Yeah, that's it. That's super cool, man. But it's one of those things where you can't really, it's hard to explain really. You can't, it's like a feeling almost. Yeah, yeah, it's a, it's a, is it confusion? Is the clown confused? Does the clown have some kind of clarity or is the clown represent people who are constantly just sort of mixed up? I think it's, I think all it represents is being in the moment. Like living in the moment without fear. Because you are, you're a failure. You're an absolute failure. So all you can do is be yourself, right? Cause there's nothing else. Like, look, you've already, you've already lost. You've lost your piece of shit. You're, you're nothing. You're nothing at all. So all you can do is do whatever you want to do, which is be yourself. Cause nothing, you're going to fail no matter what. So I think that's the idea. And then the moment that you like sink backwards into that, which sounds so like, so dismal. But the moment you sink back into that, then somehow in just sinking into it and just being like, this is what I'm like. Here I am. You just sit in it. You sit in it. And then when you sit in it, there, you do, there is redemption. There is this, you're no longer shit. It's a perplexing thing. You immediately will switch into, you will go from being these profane to the sacred. The moment you stop resisting exactly as you are. And that, that, that's kind of surrender takes a lot of courage. Oh yeah. It also, it takes, it's hard to do that constantly too. That's the thing. You got to be real honest. Yeah. You got to be very honest. It happens to me very infrequently. And when it does, it's like, ooh, that's like a drug. That's the best drug right there. That's the absolute best drug. I think that Neem Karoli Baba said something on the lines of, if you tell, if you, if you always tell the truth, nothing bad can ever happen to you. Now, that doesn't mean like you're not gonna get your head cut off or whatever, but it is like, when you do start getting into the, when you start experimenting with the fucking truth and start telling yourself the truth, just to yourself. Yeah. And meet the truth without judgment or without fear, then you do, your life starts changing very quickly. Yeah. I was making fun of judgment lately because I do so much of that. I realized all the fucking time whenever I'm driving, it's like I'm like a fucking judgment death ray. That's why I hate driving so much because it puts me in this weird thing where I'm just like, ugh, it's gross. So that, I hate that. What you do is, as a practice, is that don't change it. The next time it happens, just watch it. That's the idea. The idea is not to like hear, you know, whatever, the morbidly, Don't suppress it. Don't suppress it. Yeah, that's like, Christian, don't think about sex. Yeah. Here's a hammer, here's an ale, load of work. Yeah, yeah, because you can't. It's like, there's no way you're gonna stop the emergence of these thought patterns. And so what you do is, the difference is when the thought patterns come, you become aware of when you have been swept away in them. You become like, when you come out of being swept away, which will happen. So you're like, driving down the road, asshole cuts you off, classic example of just stupid shit. Asshole cuts you off. And suddenly you're thinking, man, what the fuck is going on with the goddamn world? Fucking all these goddamn cars, and so many people, it's so fucking overpopulated. Selfishness, true. How dare, how dare, goddamn it. Look at this asshole, look at this piece of shit. Oh, oh, oh, a woman, oh, a guy. Not even there for a second, right? It's like you have, you know those sheep where you can, it's so funny, and like it's a weird evolutionary trait. You spin the umbrella in front of them and they all fall asleep. So it's hilarious, cause they can't stop it. They have this form of narcolepsy and they can't stop it, just asleep. In the same way, the moment that you've lost yourself in the rage, you have fallen asleep in the same way those sheep fall asleep. You're not there anymore. You're just a convulsive, habitual reaction. What the fuck, it's stupid goddamn mother fucker. You might be hammering the roof. You might be hammering the steering wheel. You're gone. Right. And then suddenly you come back, right? Suddenly you come back, you're aware all of a sudden, you're like, whoa, I just lost myself in anger for a second. That was crazy, I was lost. That's mindfulness and the practice of mindfulness, the more that you do that, the more that you, even in the state of being angry, you're there. Cause you're aware of it. Yes. You're like, oh, I'm being angry right now. Yeah, you're watching. Yeah. Yeah. And that definitely helps. It's nuts. That or getting in a car accident. That is something where when you're in a car accident, that's a great way to meet somebody and have a real authentic experience. Not like a bad one, just a little, like if you ever just having a problem with like having a problem with life and you just can't seem to get in the moment, small car accident, that'll really bring you right down. Earthquake. You're gonna find out who you are. Earthquake too. Earthquake, yeah. I always think about that because it's one of those things where instantly everyone's, are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? And it's like, it's kind of great in a way it feels really good. Even if it is something bad. Well, it feels, cause it's like when those kinds of things happen and all of a sudden people are coming out of their houses, do you need water? Can I help you? So what has happened in that moment is the great illusion of separation. The artifice. The great artifice of society. If there were, for example, some kind of invisible drone that was being pumped out of government speakers into the entire world that kept everyone functioning in a selfish state of illusion and separation from everybody else that kept people thinking they were black and white and that there were good people and bad people and right people and wrong people and there's this, ooh. It does happen. Let's just say there were. That's what marketing is. When there was an earthquake or if there's a disaster, it's almost as though that speaker, that hypnotic drone. It breaks it. For a second it turns off. And everyone's like, ah, can I help you? What do you need, dude? Oh, come in, I've got blankets. How do I? You're cold. I'm hot. Come here. Yeah. Right. Car wrecks and natural disasters disrupt the Illuminati drone and allow us to experience what is possible on this planet. Yeah, you're right. It's such an interesting thing. I think that's kind of why people hate L.A. so much is because there's such a lack of severe weather. There's something about severe weather in places that just does that. That's crazy. It's this thing where, oh, you know what? No one can, it doesn't matter how much money you have, you can't get down that road because there's three fours. No, you're stuck. Right. This is it. You have some overwhelming force that is basically reminding you that you are small and helpless and are dependent upon other people to survive and it's like the longer that kind of shit is, the more you feel that like, oh, I'm just, you know, I'm just, I'm just another fucking asshole who likes to paint pictures and does this. You're not special. What a great feeling. But you're special, you're both, you're like, it's like double. Well, yeah, but I think the notion of special that a lot of people, I'm special. Right. That notion is actually, I'm selfish. Yeah. They don't really mean I'm special. They mean like, I have carefully crafted a synthetic personality designed to draw as much attention from the environment as possible. What about me? Yeah, yeah. Well, well, well, well, what do you mean you're out of them? What do you mean you're out? Yeah. What do you mean you're out of marshmallows? I don't know. You checking the back? You checking the back? Yeah, we checked the back when we brought out all the ones we had. Sure. Cause I pulled in special. I'm gonna park in preferred parking. Let me talk to your manager. I've been coming here for 15 years. I haven't gotten here for 15 years. I'm gonna call you. You're telling me I've been buying marshmallows here every week for 15 fucking years. You're telling me that Kroger's out of marshmallows. Barking, I call that barking. It's just no different than when your dog starts barking. It's just like people start barking. Anytime you succumb to that, you are no different than your Chihuahua barking at the door. Anytime you lose yourself in some kind of self-righteous, angry tirade against a goddamn clerk or your boyfriend or girlfriend or father or mother or anything, anytime you've lost that, all that's happened is you've turned into an animal. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, that's it, you're no different, you're gone. Just accept that, because the moment you start realizing that there is a you, there is a you in the sense that there is a totality of existence of which you are apart, but the more you realize that these barking fits are keeping you from experiencing what it is like to- The bliss. Yeah. Yeah, it's like a bliss. It extracts the bliss. Yeah. And when the bliss builds up to a certain point, when it overflows the beaker, it pours out and it's like, oh, fuck, I'm coming, but I'm not coming. You know what it means? Like a brain come. Yeah. Like listening to slow down tears for fears in the morning. I have not done, that sounds awesome. It's like that, it's like a little bliss wave. Ah, yeah, you can have that, that's a real thing. Those bees. What? Base. What do you mean? You know, just base, like the idea of base. Or it's the fucking bliss base. Bliss, it's the, it's the shit. I wish I could play this. I could play it for you actually. Maybe I could just overlay it, but listen to this crazy shit. This is just on YouTube. And this is, found this on recently. Now, as I've mentioned before, if I ever talk about taking psychedelics or using any kind of illegal substance. It's purely just a- It's part of the character I've created for this podcast. What's the word they say? It's a, God, there's some great word for it. It's, I don't know. It's, it's just a gag, man. Oh, it's a gag, yeah. But recently on a pretty powerful psychedelic, I spent some time. Gag your life? Watching this. Now, BangBus. Oh, BangBus? You're just kidding. I love Gag your life. Listen to this, man. I'm a big fan of this kind of shit. This is on YouTube. It's called, hold on. I'm gonna get nice little advertisement first. Oh. I saw it. Let him go for a f- Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. Come on. Oh, please. Oh, please. Oh, please. There's so many more tones in that. It's ridiculous. But that sound is as close to a verbal articulation of the feeling of expansiveness that you get from being in nature, from opening yourself up. It's that- Being in the moment, meditating. Yeah. Anything where you're like, you're just, yourself is blasted away. Yeah. Yeah. You're blasted away with that high-pressure hose. There's always crazy overtones that just sort of, like just, it's like a bomb going off. Yeah. Like a music bomb, a bass bomb. Yeah. A bass bomb. A bass bomb. There's just 12 overtones. They're all in this weird circular harmony. John Coltrane's penis just comes out like a snake and shoots down your nostrils with a bifurcated brain fuck. John Coltrane's penis. I love supreme. Whoa. His penis has been shown by researchers to have a bifurcated tip, like a snake's tongue. It looks like a snake's. A snake's tongue. And it goes, and it shoots up your nostrils, and then his balls go in your mouth, and they blast open like fucking juiceful candy, like they have candy packs. They are, and all of his hell of a hot juice, it turns into nanobots that consume your entire skull and coach you like some sort of a weird fungal overgrowth on your skull becomes this weird, white, shape-shifting thrum that can, it's all the frequencies at the same time, and then you just blast off into infinity and become a rainbow. Yeah. That is possible. That is truly possible. He'll be sweet, man. It can happen to you. It can happen to you. All you got to do is go to dunkatrustle.com and order one of these mugs, and you will truly be opened, transformed, liquid-dated, liquefied, and rotated, and ameliorated. Ameliorate, well, that's a good word. Yeah, you'll be ameliorated into the deep tissue of the neural structure of the Lord Jehovah. Oh, God, is this here ameliorated? No, no, no, no. Someone is ameliorated by God, Brian. Oh, God, is it no parking here? It took me 100 years to get that brain out of that God. Now it's being ameliorated by these goddamn nanobots. God damn it, it took us fucking 100 years to get that brain out of the ground. What do you tell me that's death called architecture that belongs to the state? I got something belongs to the state. It's my fucking shotgun. And my foot, and I'll put it right in the state's greasy ass if they send another of these nanobots, swarms, to try to ameliorate my God brain. That motherfucker is powerful, man. Do you know how hard we worked digging how long we got all dirt trying to get this skull out of the ground? We went down into the tombs of Darthnon, into the dark dark that cannot be named or felt to get that brain. That's some people say that might be a fucking terrestrial black hole under there. We went close enough to smell it. I'll tell you what, people say nothing comes out of a black hole, but I'll tell you what do come out of it is the smell of unholy proportion. It smells like a fucking foot exploded when down in my mountain. You can't imagine the smell of that because that is the smell of Satan's foot. It is the stinkiest. Yeah, you tell me here, tell me taking away when I've been out, you can't even imagine it because you can't imagine this, you smell it. Why, you won't come on down there with me? My child was carried away by gargoyles. And I will never forget that moment, right as we uncovered the final sarcophagus, the fifth one in a series of doomed sarcophagi, all of them sprang cyanide out of tiny little fleshy portals into the eyes of all who were not wearing protective gear. And my child was dragged away by gargoyles and I guarantee those damn things through him right into that black hole. Oh, he threw them in there stinky and all. I can't even eat soft food anymore. I can't even take a bite of a cheeseburger. I got liquefied all because that goddamn stink hole sprayed in my mouth. All I've got left is the God brain on my shelf. That's all we got is that God brain. And if I can't keep that without the government coming to try to ameliorate the motherfucker, to transform it from a glowing neural giz blast. It's what I subside of. It's what I live off of that energy. It's the only thing keeping me going every morning when I come out and doing the ritual of Enoch in front of that thing. It's the home of things sustaining me. You're going to take your way. Hell, there you, hell, there you, hell, there you. Hell, there you. That was Johnny Pemberton, everybody. Johnny, where can people find you? Hey, you can find me on Twitter. You can find me at my podcast, Twisting the Wind on the Feral Audio Network. That's Twisting the Wind. It's on feralaudio.com.

From inside a hermetically sealed chamber, in the belly of a great white shark swimming somewhere underneath the Pacific Ocean, good morning, good evening, wherever you may be, across the nation and around the world, you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, and I'm the host, Duncan Trussell. And today's guest is one of my favorite people ever, I'm so lucky that he agreed to chat with me. Today we have George Norrie, host of Coast to Coast AM, one of the coolest radio shows on planet Earth and possibly the entire universe, or the multiverse. For those of you who maybe aren't familiar with the joys of Coast to Coast AM, who have never experienced that amazing sense of happiness when you finally manage to tune in to Coast to Coast, when you're on some long road trip and George Norrie's booming voice comes through the crackling AM radio station that you know you're only going to be picking up for a small window of time, here is a typical clip from Coast to Coast. Let's go to Marie in Camden, Pencil, Tennessee, welcome to the show. Hi Marie. Camden, Tennessee. Hi George. Hi Linda. Hi. I'm a first time caller, and I want to tell you why the animals are being mutilated, and I also want to tell you what's going to happen to the human race. Alright, let's get your take on folks. My take is, I was abducted and also the gray aliens have been into my life since I was eight years old. Alright, here's why they're mutilating the animals. They showed me, they told me what they were doing and everything. They can't go to you George and say, can I have your sperm? They can't go to you Linda and say, can I have your egg? That's why we are being abducted, because you would say no. Also, here's why they're doing it honey, they're doing it because they have mastered it, they have really mastered it, honest to God they have. They took me from this planet to Mars and they took me underground and they showed me their base station where they have this lab and they have three, well they're two to three foot square glass cubicles, and each one of these cubicles has a fetus in it, and they're mutilating the animals or taking the protein from the animals, and inside these cubicles is this amber like liquid. On top was a grate, and on the grate there was this bubbling, and this bubbling was like a cream, and I touched the bubbling, this liquid, and it was real tacky, and at the bottom of this cubicle is like a two inch hose that goes downward, where it goes I do not know, but anyway, there's rows and rows of these, so here's what they did. They went from a peachy dish, now they don't need the mama no more, they don't need her, because now they have mastered the master of all. They have figured out how to make a human being in this cubicle. So there were babies, little babies, born into these cubicles, and there was rows and rows of them, and they were mutilating these animals to take the protein, that's what they were doing, and I can tell you what's going to happen to the human race. What's going to happen to us? Okay, I'm trying to talk fast George, and I'm nervous as hell, I'm going to tell you that right now, because I'm a first time caller. Okay, here's what's going to happen to the human race, and I don't mean to be alone, I mean I don't want to upset nobody, but here's what they told me. Lay it out for us. Okay, here's what they told me honey, they told me that bad things are going to happen to this planet, that in fact I saw, it was like watching a movie, and all I could do was just stand there and let the tears run down my face, and cry because it was nothing I could do, and I saw people running, and I saw the twisted anger, and fear, and tragedy that was happening, I saw flooding fires, I saw earthquakes, I saw all kinds of bad things happening. Was there any specific event Marie that started all this? What do you mean started all this? I mean was there an asteroid strike that created all the problems? No, no, no George. It starts out where we're going to have like one thing, just build up, build up, build up, one thing on top of another, you know just constantly building up of different things, and then all of a sudden, bam, here's what's going to happen, here's what they told me. They told me, and they showed me George, they took me there, in the spaceship, they would come at night to get me and take me, there is a replica of Earth. Okay, listen to me now, there is a replica of Earth. Alright, I'm giving you about 40 seconds left, okay? Please, please listen, on the outskirts of our universe is a replica of Earth, and what they're going to do, they're going to come by the thousands, they're going to take people off of this planet, take them to this replica of Earth. Earth is not going to be destroyed, it's going to be made anew. Then they're going to bring the people from the replica of Earth back to this Earth, and we will be happy in everything. Alright, Linda, your reaction to all of that? Friends, what you're hearing there is the work of a profoundly skilled interviewer, because there's so many times in that story, where just a simple half laugh into the microphone at the wrong place, just a stammer, any attempt to apply logic to what that woman is saying, or any kind of indication that you're not buying this woman's incredible story could shut her down and keep this little miniature mythology from emerging from this lady's reality tunnel out into the world. Is there some second artificial Earth that people are going to be taken to by aliens? Who knows? The likelihood is that that's not the case, but the whole point of coast to coast, and what to me is so tremendous about George Norrie's interview style, is that he doesn't try to put the clamp on these incredible fountains of entertainment. He lets them tell their story, and the other side is he doesn't let them tell it in a condescending way. He doesn't patronize them. He doesn't let them tell their story under the sense that he knows the truth, or he doesn't believe them. There's a lot of empathy and compassion in the way he lets these people talk about the experiences that they've had, and the byproduct of that compassionate listening is some of the greatest radio existing today. It's amazing. They shut people down just because whatever reality they're experiencing doesn't harmonize with your understanding of how reality should work. You can just let people tell their story. That's beautiful in its own way. A person is part of the universe. A person is an extrusion, an expression, a manifestation of universal consciousness, and experiences that they've had and their articulation of those experiences are miracles in their own right. Whether or not these stories match consensus reality, are provable, are measurable, or something that if you brought to a scientist, the scientist would say was an accurate depiction of the current understandings that make up the body of science. It doesn't matter. What matters is the story itself, because in that story you can see a keyhole into the psyche of the subjective consciousness of the person telling the story. That subjective consciousness is the subjective consciousness of all humanity. It's one little piece in the incredible net, the net of the web of Indra, as it's called, the connection that we all share with not just members of our species, but with every single thing that exists in the universe. To hear a sentient piece of the universe relating its own personal mythology and doing that under the magnifying glass of an empathetic person like George Norrie is lots of fun, really interesting, and who knows? Sometimes, maybe sometimes there's a fragment of the truth in what they're saying, or more than just a fragment of the truth in what they're saying. When you're driving at night and you're listening to these conversations, sometimes you really feel as though you've put a stethoscope to the heart of some invisible dragon that lives in the world. I've gotten goosebumps from listening to coast to coast, driving through Texas at night, really freaked out from listening to some of these interviews, because here's the truth. There is stuff going on in this world that we cannot currently explain. Here's another truth. There are secrets out there. There are things we know that for sure. That's why there's the term. That's why Hillary Clinton just got in trouble for emailing top secret information on her private servers. We do have something that is called top secret, confidential. The government does have troves and troves of information that they cannot release to the public. This is true. This is why we have organizations like WikiLeaks. This is why people like Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning have become either incarcerated or fugitives, fugitives living in other parts of the world to escape the grasp of the powers that be. Even if you're somebody who doesn't believe in conspiracy theories, you have to be somebody who believes in secrets. Secrets are innately conspiratorial in the sense that a group of people has made the decision to not allow some information to make its way into their work, into their social network, into their relationships, and that's a conspiracy. There's no way to not believe in conspiracy theories because conspiracy is a day-to-day part of running a business. It's a day-to-day part in running a government, and sadly, it's often a part of being in a relationship. Actually, the word conspire is really interesting because what it translates into is breathing in unison, to breathe in unison. The etymology of the word seems to point in the direction of a kind of organic harmonization of intention, which is in line with a lot of the ideas of how magic works, how a coven works. A coven is a group of people who use metaphysics, some magical system to try to transform or change or manifest things into the world. That's a coven, very similar to a corporation in the sense that a corporation is a group of people who are not necessarily breathing in unison, but who have certainly adapted and adopted a life pattern that has as its number one goal whatever the particular goals of that corporation happen to be. So conspiracy is just a group of people who've gotten together to secretly create some kind of change in the pattern of society or to manifest something in society and to do it without anyone knowing that they have done this thing. You hear the people who are conspiracy theory skeptics, they'll often say, I just can't believe that anyone could be organized enough to do this thing or that thing without ever getting caught for it. And I think that's incredible. I think that that is an interesting way to look at human beings. Human beings are so smart. We're such a smart animal. We're capable of doing so many incredible things when we work together. I mean, just look around you, look at the house that you're living in or apartment that you're living in or car that you're riding in or plane that you're flying in or train that you're in or hot air balloon or wherever you happen to be as you're listening to this podcast and whatever the thing is that you're in, including the chair that you're sitting in, the floor that you're sitting on unless you're out in nature or whatever it may be is the end result of a group of people attuning their attention in the direction of creating something in the universe. Humans are powerful. Your chair that you're sitting on is a combination of so many different things. If you're sitting in a leather chair, then you're sitting in the flesh of a domesticated animal that over the course of a period of time was taken care of and then killed by a group of people who then sold the flesh to another group of people who adhered the flesh to the structure of whatever chair that you happen to be sitting in and every single component of that chair more than likely was sourced from some other place where it was created by other groups of people who all had the intention of creating this thing or that thing to think that people are capable every single day of doing things like creating chairs, cars, iPads, iPods, phones, sunglasses to think that people can create these wonderful things, couldn't also if they wanted to create things without people knowing that they had created them, that to me seems like just a really small way to look at the potency of human beings. There's such a serious advantage in being secret. There's a serious advantage in working on things without people knowing that you're working on them. One of the most important aspects of running a corporation, you can guarantee that right now at Apple, there is some ridiculous, incredibly awesome gadget or device or component in a device that is currently being developed in some top secret laboratory where every single person there has signed nondisclosure agreements where every single person there is being constantly monitored to make sure they don't take secret pictures or leak that information. That's not a conspiracy, that's a corporation and to think that that very identical modality doesn't happen inside governments or inside secret groups or cobbles of people who are attempting to gain power over their fellow human beings is ridiculous. Of course, it happens. It happens all the time. It's happening right now. You can be certain that somewhere in some part of this country, in some part of the world, there are groups of people who are secretly working together to create change in society that goes against the laws of the land. That's real. I don't think that makes you a paranoid, insane person. That must actually happen because it happens in more mundane places like corporations. I'm sure it happens at summer camps. I'm sure it happens everywhere. I think conspiracy theories in general, though they might not always be correct, I think they are informed correct in the sense that we are part of a very advanced species of super monkeys who, if they can keep camouflaged and secret, have a very specific advantage over other members of their species who operate in the light. That's why I really love shows like Coast to Coast because they allow some of these theories to leak out into the world and you get to decide whether they're real or not. Even if they're not real, there's something miraculous about them that is exciting and ultimately incredibly entertaining. I'm so happy to have gotten to chat with George Noy. Unfortunately, he only had 30 minutes so forgive me if this interview seems a little rushed but I wanted to cover a lot of ground with him. I do feel a little weird putting this interview out because it's heavy, man. This is a heavy, you could say a dark interview. We get into some pretty deep waters and we get there really fast and currently with all the stuff going on in the world, a part of me would rather be putting out some kind of Rom Dost style spiritual podcast to send some light out into such a dark terrain that we're currently moving through in the history of the United States. On the other hand, I find it really interesting that during this interview, when I asked George Noy what are the things we should be paying attention to, in a certain way, he kind of prognosticated what we're experiencing, what's going on right now with the assassination of those police officers in Dallas and the completely unlawful execution style murder of the two men who were recently shot by police officers. He kind of predicted this in this interview that we did before any of this stuff actually started happening. Maybe not specifically talking about these events but pointing towards a kind of MO that what he calls the elites seem to have in their approach to controlling and dominating the world. It's a little, this is a spooky episode. If you don't want to get spooked out right now because you're already spooked out by the news, go back and listen to one of the Rom Dost interviews or an interview with Jack Cornfield or Roshi Joan Halifax. But if you're prepared to get the creeps, then strap in friends because this conversation with George Noy, it's a classic goose bumper. We're going to jump right into it, but first some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the Technolords over at Squarespace.com.

The Illuminati laugh at your shit website as they gather together in the dark titanium pyramids that sit beneath the various government and royal buildings of the world plotting their awful schemes. When they're not planning on detonating bombs in cities or releasing incurable venereal disease into the water supplies of the towns and provinces of the world, they're sitting on the internet looking at your crappy website and laughing as they tap their elongated reptilian fingers together, gleefully celebrating the fact that in an age when we have the most advanced technology available to us to connect us all together in some glorious community based on the concepts of empathy, love, and trust, we are not using that technology but instead continue to allow our antiquated, musty old, mildewing, moldering websites to continue to jut from the internet and remind all of our friends and clients that we are lazy perhaps from the fluoridated water, perhaps from a general lack of ambition.

He's listened to by millions of people every single week and coast to coast airs on more than 600 stations in North America. He's also got a great new novel coming out called night talk and you can find out everything that you need to find out about him by going to coast to coast AM.com. Now everyone, please send as much light, happiness and love in the direction of today's esteemed guest, George Norrie. Thank you so much. You know, I got to tell you, one of my favorite things on earth is when I'm on a, a night drive somewhere and I pick up a station that has coast to coast and hear your voice. It is so cool and some of my favorite driving memories are riding down the highway at night and listening to the incredible stories that your listeners tell and getting authentically creeped out. And you know, Duncan, we're on 615 radio stations, so no matter where you drive at night, you're bound to find the program and you're absolutely right. The callers make this show. It really drives the program from what they talk about, whether it's conspiracies, paranormal things or just day to day things that happen in our life. The callers make coast to coast and I'm really excited about talking to them. Open lines are very different on this program because I don't try to judge people or put them down. We have fun, make no mistake about that, but they get a chance to talk and I think they feel very comfortable doing that. Well, yeah, I think that's, that's one of your talents as an interviewer is that you're able to bring so much out of people that normally they're probably not going to talk about because they're constantly being judged or shut down by skeptics or people are just afraid to hear whatever it is they have to say. You have no idea how many people call the program, Duncan, and they're nervous. They're shaking on the other end of the line because, because of those very things. They don't know what the host is going to do to them. Then they start thinking, Oh my God, millions of people are listening to me. So what I try to do is just make them feel at ease and I tell them, I said, Look, you're just talking to me. So you know, let's just chat and you know, tell me what's going on and what happened to you or what did you see? And then they calm down and then it turns out to be a pretty good conversation. Well, I just, we've got 30 minutes, so I just want to dive right into the heart of everything. Sure. Great quote in an interview you did for the Atlantic and you said, I believe there are groups on this planet far above governments who control governments who are so wealthy and so powerful that the game for them is control and manipulation and they make presidents and they make kings and queens and they make leaders of nations. Who are they specifically? I'm not going to give the names. I never do on the air, but we all suspect who they may be. And those are the ones that you have to be careful of. Do you feel like you have to be careful because you are opening up a conduit for people who may have really had authentic experiences with true conspiracies. You're allowing these people to have a voice. There are times, Duncan, that I look over my shoulder at the end of a broadcast, wherever I might be, wherever I'm going, because you just never know. That started that way for me 13 years ago when I started doing coast to coast. Now I've evolved to a point where because we're so visible and so vocal and so big, they don't want to cast an eye to what I say and what I do. Their philosophy now is let's ignore him and he won't go away, but at least the people who listen to him, we can contain them in their own environment. If we do something to try to shut him up, then the world starts to know about it, so we better just let him do his thing. I think that's what's happening right now. You look at history and I think right now things are like that, but one of the spookiest things anyone ever told me on a podcast was I went to this place Singularity University in San Francisco. Have you ever been there? No. I have not. Tell me about that. You would love it. It's basically, it was started by Ray Kurzweil and I can't remember the other fellow's name, but it's a place where they try to understand what's going to happen when machine intelligence exceeds human intelligence and try to predict what direction the world's going to go in. No one can predict it. That's why it's called a Singularity, but they said that one concern is that because everything's being recorded, everything's being filmed, that we could be breaking laws right now that don't exist, but will exist in a few years. People like you, and I hope I don't sound, I don't mean to seem like I'm trying to frighten you or anything, but people like you put yourself out there in a serious way and maybe right now they're not so interested in taking people out, who they feel are dangerous, but who's to say five years from now, 10 years from now, people with public voices like yourself aren't going to be in some kind of danger? Well, that's true. That's always that possibility, but I'm not going to live my life that way, Duncan. I'm going to continue to try to get the truth out to people, no matter what it might be, and keep doing what I'm doing, and that's what I'm going to do. I mean, that's my mission. That's what I decided when I got into broadcasting, when I was 19 years old, that I wanted to unravel these kinds of stories, whatever they may be, whether it's a John F. Kennedy assassination, or whether the Roswell UFO crash, and that's what I'm doing, and I am not going to let anything get in the way of that, and with a little help from God and everything else, a little luck, I'm going to keep forging ahead. Can you say God? Do you mean, are you a Christian? I was raised a Catholic. I don't go to the Catholic Church much at all anymore, but I'm a believer and a divine creator and a power that I cannot explain. I know for a fact that this wasn't a fluke. You, me, everything we have in this universe, and the multiverses, it's not a fluke, but I don't know what it is, honestly. I mean, I continue to look for those answers. That might be one of the reasons why I keep doing this program, because I'm searching for the answers of who are we, what are we, why are we here. I just know in my heart there's a bigger picture here. I just don't know what it is yet. Well, this is with, when you, and you're as deep into this stuff as maybe anyone that I'm aware of, it's some point. It seems like this slippery slope must happen where truth becomes something really hard to hold on to. If you are at the point from all these thousands of conversations you've had with people, if you're at the point now where you believe that there is some vast conspiracy at work on this planet with the intention of controlling populations in subversive ways, what can you believe in? Where can you find any kind of place to stand in a world like that? You have to find that within yourself. I mean, let's look at ISIS for an example. They are out there doing these dastardly things. Yet they can control Iraqi and Libyan oil fields. They have bank accounts with hundreds of millions of dollars in it. Somebody is arming them to the T and they're continuing to do what they do. Now what is going on here? Why can't that be stopped? You would think governments would get together and realize where the oil fields that they're pumping, who's coming, what tankers are picking up the oil, who's paying for it, what banks are they using, who's arming them and shut them all down. That's not happening. They are allowed to do what they're doing. They're flourishing like an ongoing business. It makes no sense to me. But why? So why? Why are they? What's the answer? The answer, of course, is chaos. Governments and these groups that I've been talking about, that you've been talking about, exist only when things are chaotic. They do not exist in a peaceful world. So it is their best interest that these things continue to flourish, that there becomes and continues to be terrorism, that there's always murder and mayhem. They want an unpeaceful planet because that's how they survive. They want the population to come running to them and say, protect us. Do whatever you have to do to make this go away. Take away some of our rights. Do this, do that, but save us. And the more these things happen, Duncan, the more you have shootings and nightclubs and bombings in restaurants and things like that, there's going to come a time where people are going to just simply give up and say, do whatever you have to do to protect us. And that's when we become robots. That's when we become captured people. Wow. That is such a sinister perspective. And how do you, if this is happening, you're talking about a kind of cold war between the people and some kind of invisible group. How do you find hope in a landscape like that? It's not easy. It's not easy to find hope in a situation like that, except you have to forge ahead. You have to be able to keep going forward, fighting the good fight, and never giving up because I truly believe in the long run that the masses are going to win because they just can't control all of us. That's not to say it's going to be an easy task to get to where we want to go. But I think we're going to win in the long run. And I keep driving ahead because I care about people. I care about my family and my children and my grandchildren and my friends. And I've always told people that when I go, what I want to be read on my tombstone, my epitaph would be, he made a difference. And that's what I'm going to do. And I'm going to continue to do it. And I'm going to continue to sound the alarm that there are groups out there that are trying to take advantage of all of us, of all of us, and I'm not going to give up. This new book that you have coming out, Night Talk, is this an encoded message kind of? You're very shrewd, Mr. Duncan. You're very shrewd indeed. It's my first novel about a talk show host named Greg Noel who is channeled to cover stories much like I do on Coast to Coast. Go figure. But it is intertwined. It is weaving around a situation where a hacker is murdered and the talk show host is on the run. And it's an amazing story, one that one day may become a TV show or a movie. I don't know. But it's basically my show with a certain message done in a very fictional way. Right. Yeah. That's what I was as I'm reading this, that's what I keep thinking is like, oh, in this quote you say, I'm not going to give the names. So there is something that you are not putting out into the world, apparently you want to protect yourself. And so it does seem like you've encoded that in this book here in some way. His nickname's the Night Hawk. That's your nickname. That's my nickname. That's what I had in St. Louis when I was doing my local show. I created that at night so people would have some kind of identifier. Of course, I want them always to know it's George Norrie. But when you think of the Night Hawk, it's easier. And that grew for me in St. Louis, by the way. In reality, that drove us up to a number one rated show. I always remember my general manager of the station years ago, Duncan, on the first night I said, you're listening to the Night Hawk. He sent me a memo, it was in my box, waiting for me the next morning. And I went and got it when I came into work. And it says, George, nobody's going to remember the word Night Hawk. What are you doing? And I looked at that and I went in and talked to him and I said, trust me, in six months everybody will know this name. And so we use that in the book as well, Night Talk with the Night Hawk. Now, I want to go through, I've written down some of the top conspiracy theories. All right. Very quickly, I just want to go through some of them. And on a scale of one to 10, one being complete bullshit and 10 being probably true, can you just give me a number for each of these? Sure. And some of them may have the same number. OK. Bigfoot. On a one to 10, with 10 being the real deal. Yeah. I would give Bigfoot or a creature about an eight. OK. All right. Sandy Hook being a false flag operation. Zero. Michelle Obama is a man. Zero. Michelle Obama is Bigfoot. Zero. The Illuminati. Ten. UFOs. Ten. Project Bluebeam, the upcoming UFO invasion that they keep talking about. Eight. And what about the emergence of some kind of anti-Christ? 8.5. Wow, that's spooky. Who is that? George, who? We don't know. They say he's on the planet already. It's a very strange story. They said that there will be, according to Nostradamus, that there are and will be three anti-Christs. And Napoleon was supposed to be one. Hitler was the second. And the third is here now. And it's going to, he's going to lead us into the apocalypse. Could be a she too. You never know. Right. Yeah, could be a machine. Could be an artificial intelligence. It could be anything. The sign of the beast, 666, where they talk about you must have this number in order to buy goods and things like that. That's uncanny, because now they're talking about wanting to chip everybody. So instead of carrying credit cards around, you merely just wave your hand over the register and the reader, and you're ready to roll. Well, I mean, that's essentially what Apple Pay is, I guess. I mean, our phones are our chips. We are chipped. Yeah, we are chipped people. They don't need to implant them. They just give us technology that has become a necessity to live. I thought years ago, the social security numbers that we all got in order to work, that was it. I'm still not sure about that, but I think there's something bigger afoot. But so these people, whoever they may be, do you have any idea of their numbers? How many of them are there? How many? There's not too many, Duncan. Not too many at all. And the reason why we don't name names on the air is because it's difficult to prove, and it's very easy for them to sue my network or me and simply say, look, you just libeled me. You just said that, you know, I'm so-and-so and I do this. Prove it. It's very difficult to prove because they insulate themselves. They're shielded from a lot of this. But it's quite obvious when you hear stories of who goes to the Bilderberg meetings, who is part of the Council on Forward Relations, who are the people who control the destiny of so many other people. And then you look at the kind of money they have. It's not too difficult to begin to realize that these folks are the puppet masters and we're the puppets. And there's probably, I would say, no more than a dozen of them out there with that kind of wealth, with that kind of power. But again, it leads back to why are they doing this? Because they are bored. They have nothing else to do. When you have billions of dollars, all the houses you need, anything you want, the next thing for you is the game. And the game is control. The game is manipulation. The game is to try to create wars, to end wars, to do things that just get you going. They excite you. And that's what they're doing right now. Do you don't think that they have their own religion? Some of them might. Remember the movie Eyes Wide Shut by Stanley Kubrick? Yes. These folks would get together at these wealthy parties and do these bizarre things. I think that's very possible in many cases that they do things like that, creating their own religion or their own belief system. No doubt. These people want to live forever, Duncan. They want to have implanted chips. They want to clone their bodies and download their memory into the new body so they can live forever. They're just obsessed with this. Well, do you think that's bad, wanting to live forever? Yeah, I think that there's something else afoot. I think there's the hereafter. That's what we were made for. We were made to evolve. And in the spirit world, I believe, is this important part of living. And to delay it beyond the inevitable is, I don't know. It may be sinful to be able to live that long. Who wants to be 1,000 years old when you've got a lifetime of eternity in heaven? Well, OK. So one thing that I'm curious of what you think about this is, first of all, these people, would you call them the Illuminanti? Yes, or the elitists or the globalists. Whatever you want to give them as a phrase or nickname, that's who they are. So if these people exist, because it seems that there is a real benefit in not being out front. And it seems like over time, imperialism must have evolved, just like everything else evolves. And so imperialism evolved to the point of recognizing it's better to camouflage as a democracy or hide behind presidents, because people who are out front tend to get killed by the people eventually. So is it possible that in the same way, if there's some sinister secret group of people, do you think there could be the opposite? A group of people who are well-intended, trying to shape society in a positive way, but who recognize that if they come to the forefront, they put themselves in danger, like a secret school or a hidden society of good people. It's not that organized, unfortunately. I wish that there were big groups of individuals that get together and try to do better for the planet. But I don't think that they exist. I think that they're very small in numbers. They're taking care of the people they care about. They may try to, you know, they may be mayors of cities and they may be well-intentioned, but they're not as wealthy or put together as the Illuminati-type groups that really wanna control and manipulate. I wish I could give you a better answer to that, but I just don't think good has that kind of organization at this point. So this group of people, I'm interested in, because you are somebody who believes in UFOs. You've spent, it seems like most of your life, researching these experiences that people have had. What is the connection? Is there an extraterrestrial connection to these people? Do they have some kind of relationship? People like David Icke would say that these people, the Illuminati folks, are reptilians that they have come from and they have evolved from an extraterrestrial race that are reptilian in form and that they're somewhat evil. Well, that's a possibility. There's no doubt in my mind that in the vastness of this universe that we exist in, that there's life out there like ours. We are not that unique. The chemistry of the primordial soup out there in the universe is the same everywhere. So once you get a planet close enough to its sun, to its star, and that you've got liquid water, that formula is gonna happen and it's going to evolve. Look what has happened here in four and a half billion years. So I think this universe is teeming with intelligent life that is out there, they're everywhere, and they have propulsion systems where they have learned how to travel through space and time. They cannot nor would they be able to get here under our conventional ways, but they've learned how to bend space and time. They're out there and I don't think it's just a figment of our imagination anymore. I think it's a reality. Now in terms of are these elitists in cahoots with them doing sinister things, I can't rule that out. I don't think it's probable, but I can't rule that out. I mean, the alien abduction phenomenon is real. The question is, are governments secretly in cahoots with the ETs saying, do what you have to do, abduct the people you want, experiment on them, just give us a little technology, give us this, give us that, that's possible, I can't rule that out. It's far-fetched, but it is very conceivable that some governments and some elitists are in cahoots with certain races of extraterrestrials. One very spooky thing I heard, or it was spooky to me, I'm sure you've heard of ayahuasca, I'm sure. Yes, I have never drank it, but I've heard about it. Well, once someone told me that these elites, they drink ayahuasca, that they're actually taking psychedelics to make some connection to the universe or some of these interdimensional beings that appear when people have ingested dimethyltryptamine, which is in ayahuasca. But have you had much experience with psychedelics? You mean personally? Yes. I was kind of a nerd kid in college, Duncan. Tried a little pot, but gave that up when my girlfriend, high school sweetheart, to become wife at that time, threatened to go to my parents. So I gave that up. But I never tried anything else. Never tried hard drugs, never tried methamphetamines or Coke or anything like that. And primarily because I'm a health nut, I really believe that ingesting drugs will kill you eventually. And so I just stayed away from it. And thank God I never had to, had to use it. Well, I'm sure you're following some of the studies that they're doing right now with psilocybin and LSD, particularly with psilocybin. They're finding out that it doesn't really have too many negative effects, if any, especially compared to some other substances. I'm curious, George, would you ever be open to taking a psychedelic if it was administered in the appropriate way by researchers? It seems like this would be right up your alley because so many people who take psilocybin or DMT report contact with extra dimensional beings. I would not, Duncan. I really am so obsessed with health issues and supplements and doing things that try to keep you healthy. I just have always felt that they will hurt me somehow, even though it might be administered. I don't want to be in that altered state. I'll use the mind I've got right now to get me to where I have to go. And have you ever, when you were a child, it seems like this journey for you started with an out of body experience. You had a fever, you came out of your body. Have you replicated that experience throughout your life? I have become extremely intuitive, somewhat psychic, because of all these things that I've learned and tried over the years. I have not been able to replicate my out of body experience that I had when I was an 11-year-old kid, bouncing against the ceiling, looking down at my body, realizing, oh my God, what's going on, going to the library and stumbling across books on astral projection, which helped steer me in the direction that I've gone now, looking for these answers, but have not been able to replicate it. But in so trying, it has really tuned up these precognitive abilities that we all have in me to a point where it's very, very powerful. George, one last question. We have a couple more minutes. What is something in the news or something in the world that we should all be paying attention to that maybe we're not quite aware of? What do you intuit is emerging right now as we look at the political race happening? What do you think, what should we be looking at that's being hidden from us? I think we should be aware of everything. I think we should be aware of efforts to confiscate our guns. People kill people. The guns are just there. You pull guns away from law abiding citizens who have the right to bear arms. The criminals are gonna be the only ones with the guns. Trust me, that's gonna happen. So I think we need to be aware of every aspect of life that would erode our rights and to take advantage of us and just try to fight back whichever way we can in order to not get manipulated and controlled. Beautiful. George, I just can't thank you enough for spending this time with me. It really is an honor to just get to chat with you at all and I'm really enjoying your book, Night Talk. It's so fun to read and I hope that you're safe. I hope they don't come for you eventually. Well, me too, Duncan, thinking, how are you feeling these days? You tackling your issues? Yeah, oh yeah, I'm feeling great. I mean, luckily if you're talking about the testicular cancer I had, that is the most curable. If you gotta pick a form of cancer. That's the one you want. Yeah, that's the one you want. Well, take turmeric, all right? I'm a strong believer in that and it's a spice. Curcumin is in it, but I take it every day. You take it every day, how many milligrams? Every day in a capsule form, that's about 500 milligrams. Dr. Norrie, I'm adding that to my diet. Go to this website, myheartbook.com. Okay. All right, that's one of our guests. He developed a formula that I swear by. I'll check it out. And is there anything, you're headed to Asheville, is there, how can people see you? How can they find you?

Today on the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast we will be speaking in a strange rhythmic way while playing dramatic soundbeds underneath our voice in an attempt to illustrate just how powerful the brainwashing mechanisms of corporate media actually are. Imagine if you had just slurped back three Xanax and a Vicodin and were listening to this in your arm chair at the age of 80. You would have no way to resist whatever was about to be vomited into your poor withered alcohol shriveled brain. Let's get going with the podcast starting now! Man that shit is intense. Fox News soundbeds are crazy. I don't know if you've ever gone through YouTube and just looked at the different jingles for the news but wow they really think they're important with soundbeds like that. Like whatever the fuck they're saying if you're going to play a soundbed like that you better be revealing some heavy duty shit man. It can't just be some normal bullshit about the healthcare. You better be revealing some kind of incoming UFO invasion if you're playing that kind of music. Just listen to this shit. Listen to what they're doing to manipulate us into thinking that what they're saying is important. Here's some more news soundbeds. Here we go. This is CNN. Here it comes. Get ready. What do you think? Here it comes. Yes! Fuck! Oh god that's the sound every time Anderson Cooper ejaculates that's the sound it makes. That's heavy duty man. That is some serious fucking shit. That is a serious blast there. You gotta to play that in front of your programming you think you're so fucking important. It's kind of like a western theme but they all have the same kind of terrible orc drum slave drum beat to it. Let's listen to one more. It's like they've got dudes with those leather X's on their chests beating giant drums in the BBC office. That's what they should have to do. If they're gonna play music like that they should have a live band playing that shit. A live band of people in leather suits and gimp masks beating cow hide drums and throwing stars at bells. Friends we truly have a spectacular DTFH coming your way right after this break. According to a recent study by the Heimler James Institute the number one thing that angels tell people who are dying is that they should have had a better website. It's true if you have a shitty website or no website at all when you die then you will leave either a terrible record of your existence here in this very temporary dimension that we're all currently inhabiting or no record at all and in the future when artificial intelligence engines are able to sift through the data on the worldwide web those who have shitty websites or no websites at all will not be resurrected by the angelic techno machines that will bring us all back to life and allow us to exist in a never ending orgasmic paradise of beauty, bliss and truth.

red eye on Fox News with a Greg Gutfeld show I really enjoyed this conversation he is a super smart guy and I'm really glad we got a chance to talk so everybody please welcome to the DuncanTrestle family our podcast Dave Smith sure Dave welcome to the DuncanTrestle family our podcast thanks for coming over man thanks so much for having me so it's pretty intense you grew up in this neighborhood I so randomly grew up on this block I lived I went I lived when I went to high school like three doors over and where you're recording how many years I think I lived there from like seventh to 12th grade a good a good long stretch on this block I consider that my childhood yeah that's when that's the formative years yeah for sure it's the ones you really look back on yeah the ones that still it's the ones that still buggy the most about a girl cheating on you the ones you still jerk off to crazy experiences then crazy experiences really grow oh god the first time you had sex yep all here on this block really on this block on this very block in your parents home yeah they weren't there they were gone god man you know I've got I still remember one of my like dark memories and I wonder about it all the time like how differently my life would have gone there was a cheerleader at the school that I went to and I don't know why but one Sunday she came over man and she was like we went upstairs my parents were there and she lay in my bed and was like Duncan come lay here I remember this it's like the beginning of the ultimate fantasy mm-hmm kind of a crush on her and my mom was downstairs she's like Duncan Duncan you have chores to do and so she had to leave like and so like in that like it's brutal never hated your mom so much I always think about it like if I had had sex with the cheerleader that day and experienced that you know like a fulfillment of a fantasy the realization that things can go right in the universe at that young and age that there are miracles well even I think right I mean I'm I don't really understand it but right like the butterfly effect and things like that wouldn't kind of back up the idea that if something that drastically changed your life would be drastically different right I mean who knows for better or worse but it would probably be drastically worse worse I think it'd be worse I think that like I wouldn't instead of having like more of an underdog mentality you would be like holy fuck if I could do this yeah I could I don't why not get into the stock market Duncan Trussell that asshole senator who champions the war on drugs I hate that guy the worst yeah it's yeah well yeah man I you know for some reason it was kind of caught me off guard I had Abbey Martin on the podcast and you know some people liked it some people were outraged but the outraged people wanted you to come on the podcast is some kind of palate cleanser and I'm sure the other people who loved it will be outraged that I'm here already all right and to me that's a good sign that there's already outrage where already some snark someone snarked me on Twitter like god my one of my least favorite kinds of fucking a sigh tweet where they say whatever they're gonna do and then the right sigh after it like the most condescending thing we're like really you're gonna have another libertarian on the podcast I love you Duncan but sigh yeah that's um I feel that we uh we libertarians or just people who support free markets at all I feel like get that a lot very like a dismissed as if uh I don't know like this is so ridiculous that it doesn't like my position is so crazy because I'm like anti-war pro-free market that uh it doesn't even need to be refuted it's just like oh get out of here yeah this is crazy and I don't know I'm like I try to and I know that you know some people are like this some people aren't but I try like I was a left-wing guy and I'm now a libertarian anarchist like I have an open mind about that I can I'm capable of changing my mind if you've got a great point that I haven't like thought of I'll take it but you you understand where and this is true for any perspective right like this is what you try to tell the anti-milo people if your attitude to someone is like I'm just gonna dismiss what you say I don't even have to refute you or I don't want you on the show I want you silent like you shouldn't even be there you're just empowering that person like that just kind of convinces me I'm right okay well but before we get into that sure let's get into the terms because honestly I'm kind of foggy on both my dad is a libertarian right that's still I'm still a little fought and some of my friends are libertarians but I'm foggy on the term and I'm probably a different type of libertarian than a lot of other because there are differences so for me personally like I I like the word libertarian I'm like an anarchist libertarian if anyone wants to like where I got to that conclusion I was very influenced by uh like Ron Paul Murray Rothbard Tom Woods a lot of people like the Mises Institute just for if anyone wants to look further into it okay but we're basically the philosophy centers around the non-aggression principle which is basically the idea that at you it is morally wrong to initiate violence against peaceful people so violence is something that should be uh is morally used in self-defense you own yourself you own your body you you own the fruits of your labor things like that but uh the idea that you shouldn't initiate force against peaceful people and most people on the surface will kind of agree with that I mean it's a fairly however uh what I think libertarian anarchists do is actually take that to its logical conclusion which is basically ends up being rejecting government which in it in it's the state I would say which in itself is an institution that is basically funded uh on the premise of hey you fund us or you go to fucking jail this is how we raise our money okay you fund us or you go to jail right and I I just take the radical position that we don't need to run civilization that way you're talking about the the the force field like I think of it as the force field which is when there's a certain if you do a certain thing there's like triggers and if you do a certain thing in the society the guys in the Darth Vader outfit show up so and and we don't really it's always there like everything with the government everything with the state is there's always this loose implication of like we'll fucking throw you in jail it might be like behind the scenes a little bit it's like oh you gotta find you know like what happens if you don't pay that fine eventually it gets bigger it gets bigger and then they'll throw you in jail and you know that's right yeah okay so why then do people take issue with anything you just said I guess it's the anarchist part it's we we don't believe it's it is it that okay okay so everything you just said to me makes perfect sense except we've got a lot of people man we've got a lot of people and there has to be some way to create the rhythm of sissa we need we need to stop if we have cars we need traffic lights sure if we have you know we need flight patterns we need all the things that make an infrastructure happen yes and and it's very hard to say what exactly is the right amount of roads or too many roads are not enough I mean like you know there's a you know certainly when you have a government it works in a very different way I just think that ebb and flow will work better under a market I think it does demonstrably always but so you may have the federal government come in and say we're gonna we're gonna give you free highways which are you know basically free because they were all deficit financed you know so we're gonna have these interstate highway program but then you have urban sprawl and pollution and all these other problems I mean maybe maybe that wasn't the right move to have that you know you don't actually know what the right move is I would and I don't want to ramble too much but there's this really great essay that Milton Friedman wrote and lots of different free market people have used this in different examples but I believe it's called my pencil and basically he talks he just talks about a pencil and I thought this was so trippy and interesting but he goes if you take one pencil there is no human being who's ever existed who has the knowledge to make this happen no not even close there hasn't even been a hundred like if you actually take the knowledge that has to go into making this pencil I mean if I just left you in the woods and was like make a pencil yeah how first off and he goes through it he's like okay so this tip is is graphite but not lead they think it's lead but it's graphite this comes from the ground in order for that you need metal machines in order for this you need you need trucks in order for a truck you need a tire with rubber there are like all of these different amounts of knowledge and people and different interests who have never met each other and they all come together and if you were just explaining this to some economist who's a government economist you know on paper you'd be like okay all of these people all of these resources come together um how much do you think that's going to cost well it costs like nothing it literally comes down to like less than a penny for this one pencil and there's no department of pencils there's no czar of pencils there's not some congress passing laws and legislating yet we don't go like oh my god how will poor people get pencils they they're literally laying on the ground broke it there are miracles of the market all around us and we never seem to focus on them because we get we go to government schools and it's like uh you know the important lesson is like how a bill becomes a law and how george washington never told a lot and all this bullshit that's just pro-government bullshit so you never question the fucking killers that are ruling over so anyway we were just to answer what you're saying about like the the um the kind of harmony that of people working together i think this does happen all the time around us without violence let's talk about the initiatory violence so i'm i'm curious about the markets themselves okay so the markets like when did the again i'm if you could just explain this to me like i've been eating marijuana for the last 15 years because it's one of those things that i don't i i mean my focus has always been on a on your focusing it's interesting because what you're describing with a pencil is what is known as the web of indra have you ever heard that term before no so it's the idea that like every single sentient being exists in this uh network like a spider web so that uh every it's also um i believe in buddhism they call it something like the law of interdependence but it's the idea that every single thing that exists is the result of this matrix of activity that manifests is that thing so no one thing has any primary identity outside of the connection it has with the other things that make it what it is so you see a pencil you know and we're in the in a narrative time space continue in past present future right and you see this fucking or pen which i'm looking at right now you see that the a state of matter that has been assembled and will disassemble but is like if you could see it like outside of time and space it would be this like sort of weaving together of all these disparate parts coming to form this fucking thing that's then going to disintegrate yes and and there's from in and you know i guess the economic term would be the division of labor but it's really exactly what you're describing that everybody kind of breaks up into playing this role and it's not that they want to play a role in this bigger thing it's not even about that like nobody the guy who drives the truck isn't like i'm making a pencil happen like it's not about that it's just he's collecting his paycheck and he's doing that but yeah i think there's something look there's always to me something really fascinating about and i looked at it more by the way i've always loved your stuff like i've been a fan of yours when when louis said you were coming on Legion of Skanks i was like really excited thank you and it's interesting when you say like we kind of focus on different things and you're right and that's why i could listen to you talk about some like transhumanism thing when i'm like oh wow i've never read about that that's really interesting but to me what i look at it a lot from an economic point of view and i just find it really fascinating like how we live this way i feel like nobody seems to find it like why is there poverty is a very interesting quest a very easy question i should say so why is there poverty is like obviously i mean you're born into poverty central africa central africa because that's what the world gives us it gives us nature right which is poverty essentially why is there wealth is a really interesting conversation that never happens and we live in this like world we live at such a higher standard of living and i think most of us don't really know why well and most of us don't know i mean if the one thing people don't like to think about is how if you have a house or if you're staying in a place that has electricity and clean water compared to the majority of planet earth you are kicking ass i can remember when i was in college we went to uh we went to uh to bet or to india to darmsala and we made friends with these uh i don't know they basically to bet and refugees who've been driven out by the chinese and we saw their house they had this little like apartment tiny tiny little place above like a restaurant in darmsala and two of them slept in the same bed that was so small the way they slept in the bed is the guys would spoon each other they would hold one guy would hold the other guy in so he wouldn't fall out of the bed poverty breeds some beautiful shit sometimes but but they didn't see themselves as it being in poverty like they weren't like they weren't walking around every day like god this is a hell life they were kind of glowing and happy and funny and interesting but you never you never got the sense of like poverty and so interesting and it is it is fascinating because so it's like but so that all that being said it's like to get back to the fundamental question the marketplace right one of my teachers ramdas he actually refers to this part of the world as the market and like how you've got to like you have to deal with the market like there's no way around it spiritual people some people want to ignore the fact that you have to like come up with a way to sustain yourself here in this marketplace that we're in the whole thing is a marketplace the whole fucking thing is a marketplace so this is what i want to talk about when is the marketplace always been here is it a product of population growth i think of like some degree of a market is anytime you have to me at least anytime you have people voluntarily exchanging you've got somewhat of a market so you've probably had somewhat of a market you know it might be a very very small limited one but probably since about the the beginning of time and i think probably you've had um conquest and violence and people's robbing other people from the market in fact i think probably there was far if you look at the big scale of of human history and you were like how much of uh say what for lack of better term property uh how much of property was uh acquired through markets and peaceful transactions and how much was acquired through conquest and violence i think humanity would start with the vast majority being conquest and violence and that's going down and down and down and down and where we are now is probably more broad brush speaking throughout the world there's probably more wealth and freedom right now than there's ever been and recorded yeah there's a i think uh there's a book by peter diamandas do you know that is he's anyway he wrote a book called abundance and he just shows the statistics of like how great relatively things are great now again relatively we're talking about a time when people are like choking on their own plague sure sure but and if you're talking about you know like but as you were kind of getting at before with going to tebet you get a little bit more of the perspective you know we we could talk about how the rust belt has been deindustrialized in the last few decades and there's a lot of truth to that but if you look at the big picture of the world those people you're talking about there were something in the last 25 years there's something i don't have the numbers in front of me but it's close to a billion people who have escaped what the un or what the world bank considers extreme poverty yeah like a dollar 25 a day or under and about a billion people have riven from that to like the next level up which still sucks compared to us but is a very big big and this is because of stuff that's gone on in china and india where these dirt poor countries have started to liberalize their markets a little bit and let people have businesses so yeah okay so it's a you have an optimistic perspective things on planet earth not not well it's interesting because it's like i think of the i don't know it's a good verse evil i don't know if i have an optimistic perspective i think we're in this force right now i think what you see of of like the rise of technology which you you know know a lot more about than i do but i think what you're seeing right now which is really fascinating is it's like the um the totalitarians have this force but then the good guys also have this force so so you have uh you know the cia can spy on people the nsa can spy on people they can drone bomb people they can do all this shit better than they ever could but also one edward snowden can go fucking release all their shit and show everybody what's going on or one little leak or one you know julien assange can go bring down the clinton's from where so there's this weird i don't actually know if i'm optimistic or not i think we need to get the control away from the authoritarians how it's impossible such a foolish optimism thing yes this system that's existed for basically as far back as we can remember which has been at the center of society yeah if you were to say arranged marriage is going to go away or some of the i mean there there are things that were fundum and and look just to make this about the libertarian thing both of those issues right slavery arranged marriage they were fundamental to how society operated they were institutions predicated on force this is why we look back at them as horribly immoral because the people didn't have a choice right to be entered or not they were denied their self ownership right it is it is the same to me government is kind of a parallel that it'll be this thing kind of like slavery that we get rid of and eventually look back and go oh this is so ridiculous that we thought hey we should have we should take care of poor people's health care how should we raise that money let's threaten to throw people in cages unless they send it into a bunch of criminals in washington dc who murder children and don't care about that but we'll trust them to make the right decisions unlike our retirement benefits okay so the idea of slavery being gone it seems to me that it's more that it's sort of evolved right like if i've got a because you like can you imagine just what a pain in the fucking ass it would be to have a slave like you got it you you you have to i don't think anyone ever looks at that part of the picture like i you know and again i guess it's gonna probably offend people obviously i think slavery is wrong and but it's good to think like what would it have been like to have a slave to be as typical sure because like my fucking like just owning a two chihuahua and a poodle and a cat is a pain in the ass yes i agree it's a pain in the ass now obviously these these things aren't doing any kind of production work for me so there's nothing coming in but what i mean to say is slavery evolved because if you can the idea is all right what is a way for me to get my slaves to pay for their own fucking housing what's a way to do that well that's to give them a minimum wage so i'm gonna pay you just the amount of money you need to function from a month to month basis and you're gonna work for me you don't have to by the way yes don't work for me don't work for me i don't care i run a fucking mcdonald's corporation they're people lining up every day coming in here filling out applications with trembling hands because they desperately need this fucking job so i don't care and if you go away don't have a job see what happens to you what are you gonna do okay but i don't look i kind of i half agree with what you're saying and maybe i i have disagree so i would say in one part yes slavery in a sense did evolve and and what you and look i could look at things like the war on drugs and say that is a form of slavery you could look at the military draft say that we were talking about this the other day i think maybe even a worse form of slavery to to enslave someone with the job of killing i mean it's military slaves gladiators so there there's there's lots of horrible but i'm just making the point that this one if you want to just call it overt cotton picking slavery which was i mean just blatant accepted a part of life like this institution did essentially it did get accepted by people that this is morally wrong and then after we got rid of that we found far better ways of of picking cotton and running an economy and things like that now in terms of what you're talking about i do i would disagree with or reject that the idea that if you don't have a job if you don't work you're gonna basically be in a bad situation where you have to depend on charity i mean i guess nowadays you could depend on government but what i'm advocating is you'd have to depend on someone voluntarily giving it to you yes that is bad but i i hesitate to compare that to slavery i mean that's more like a beef with biology existence nature look if we're left on a desert island and you say i just want to lay on my ass all day and i don't want to go collect food you don't have food at the end of the day and and i don't think that justifies you uh going and robbing someone who did go work all day now if you want to ask them for some that's fine but i so that's where i'd kind of you know it's not offering someone an option to me isn't the same thing as enslaving them well it's it here's where it gets weird so like yeah sure the the old like let's go to the archaic time and who the fuck knows if it's true but like you know chris ryan who write on the podcast a few times he describes this sort of eden right it wasn't really you could there was enough for eat there weren't as many people so like what time are we talking about like just after humans grew a neocortex okay so 150 000 years ago or something like that hunter gathers preagrarian revolution human there's not as many of us on the planet number one so we're wandering around eating grubs like and sure in that situation if you decide that you're not going to work which would be gathering food well you're dead you're going to get fired from the universe in the form of starving to death so that's what firing used to be is you would starve to death because you weren't adept to survive in the universe and so you would just die you had a tribe of people around you who would sort of support you uh and and if and theoretically you know if you were a fuck up in the tribe and did something fucked up they would banish you right now this is interesting because there appears to be a biological corollary for rejection which is you know look this up I didn't fact check but apparently the part of the brain that experiences rejection the pain of rejection is in a different part of the brain it's the part of the brain that experiences physical pain because that's very interesting to be rejected by the tribe is death you know I don't know if you've ever seen meerkat manor but those little bastards will they're cute little guys and they like if you've seen them they're weird looking but like they will kick out a meerkat if it fucks up and it's dead and then it's just gonna get eaten it's dead and I think I've seen in um like apes well if they commit rape they'll be ostracized by the community at times like there's really interesting little things like that yeah it's a it's a bad thing for whatever your particular biomass to kick you out you're fucked but it's it very much goes in line with what you were saying before talking about kind of like the harmony of things working together and it's almost like if there's a little bit of corruption or a little thing where this is not harmoniously working like you're just taking and not contributing or you're hurting somebody else or you're breaking the rules we have a way to bring it back to the harmony kind of clear out the corruption I mean it seems you know it seems kind of cold obviously when you're talking nature is very harsh but it's it's interesting that things do kind of move in the state of nature harmony is just uh I think universally preferable to corruption so things tend to yeah try to move in that direction yeah and and you even if you got like blasted out into the fucking like forest or whatever I guess theoretically you could figure out a way to go naked and afraid style build your own little hermit shack be a cunt out in the wilderness by yourself mushrooms or whatever but now to get back to this idea of there being a kind of unspoken police force that is always at the perimeter of acceptable behavior right and that if you fail to live in an acceptable way uh in in this society or in most societies uh which is to in some way or you need a place to stay like if I go out into the if like I get if I don't know if suddenly I ended up just deciding like you know what I'm not gonna fucking podcast anymore not that I ever would it's my favorite thing right but if I'm like I'm not gonna do anything anymore I don't want to do anything anymore I'm done with doing things it's illegal to not do shit here because what'll happen is I won't get the money to pay rent right and then because I'm not working now and then and then then when I don't have the money to pay rent I'm gonna have to get on some lower rent housing or something like that but even then there's all these forms I gotta fill out I don't want to fill out fucking forms anyway the long and short of it is or maybe I'm crazy you know maybe like my like a lot of these people are like fucking insane you walked out dude I remember we are my core and I went to see a movie or walking back and we heard the most piercing shriek it was amazing like it was the sound of somebody getting disemboweled like it was terrible so bad that we're like we gotta see where that shrieks coming from so we go towards the shriek and and uh it's go it stops and it's like everything seems fine everyone's looking around and then this like completely innocuous woman at the top of her lungs just belts out this blood curdling shriek and she's doing it intermittently and it's echoing off the buildings so you can't really see who's doing it but anyway she's out of her fucking mind yes surrounded by a group of people who are just trying to live in a harmonious way yet here is a malfunctioning uh member of our species the fucking operating system's not running the right thing the wheels the rainbow wheels spinning up there and it's coming out in shrieks right what do we do we ignore her just completely fucking ignore the shrieking freak right because what are you gonna do what am I gonna do what's anyone gonna do we gotta freak we gotta freak shriek freak here so like I looked around for a cop getting you know what's weird is me we're walking next to her because I'm like fuck maybe we can get her help and then she starts screaming and then like I realized people are thinking we're the ones who are inducing the shriek anyway the to summarize what I'm trying to say here is this the problem is we don't have a forest to banish people to anymore there's no way to people like that are gonna grow food there's no no we have to find a more humane way to deal with that and I I'm not sitting here you know a lot of times when um critics or what of libertarianism will say oh it you guys treat the market like a religion like all these problems will just be solved and I'm not saying that at all I think like I don't know how exactly we solve that problem particularly like the crazy person shrieking in the street by the way I think honestly I think this is more of a New York City problem where I think small towns do handle it maybe a little bit better than like hey who's the crazy person and we do kind of get together whereas in New York you're like dude there's so many people here it's just not there's no sense of community I'm just making the point that look we have I mean the United States if we're talking government versus markets and how they would handle these problems the United States federal government is the biggest government in the history of humanity it spends four trillion dollars a year spies on every person and says drone bombs were in seven countries right now we have military bases all throughout it's the biggest government in the history of the world New York uh state on top of that big federal government is one of the biggest state governments I mean we spend all this money have some of the highest state federal taxes you have the cops and that woman is still standing in the street so it's not as if I don't know if the market or government has it's like people have to come up with what we're gonna do for people like that and I don't again I just don't I don't jump to authoritarianism as the solution ever go that and that's that's what I want to like kind of talk about universal I want to talk about that universal authoritarianism because we're earlier we're talking about a person in a tribe who is parasitic right whatever in whatever way like where I'm going fucking hunting and this guy is like no I'm gonna stay back at the village in hump right whatever it's like no man you gotta help you have to help so this person isn't helping and so at some point you know I think it has to be very extreme you're like you gotta get the fuck out of here maybe you murdered somebody whatever maybe so then we're looking at a different kind of invisible police force which is the police force of nature that will devour the but okay here's the only thing that I would uh where I would I just think it's important to make a distinction between volunteerism and aggression and and even if it's something where the volunteerism leaves you in a situation where it's like you're fucked it's there still to me is a distinction between it's kind of like saying um let me try to think about this way like um if you try to um try to think of an example of this but like so if I I live in um a community where we all have an agreement to work together and the other nine people go uh you're not holding up your end we don't want to work with you anymore you can call that a culture police I just don't want to like equate that to a cop who comes in and says oh you're you you're smoking a joint I'm gonna grab you and throw you in a cage there's nothing voluntary about that like if a girl if you're dating someone and she decides to break up with you it's like um it may suck it may lead you it leave you in the same position of basically not having a girlfriend but that's her right to not want to be with you that's their right to not want to work with you if you're not contributing as much and I think you want to judge that situation they're they're always very nuanced like it's like what happened was this guy used to be a good worker and something happened to him and he's not a good worker anymore has he always been a lazy bum is he you know what I mean like there you almost want a smaller community to make that decision it seems like it has that's the problem and some kind of what the communities are too expansive right now but it's the we're dealing with like a what I'm getting at is the grinder of nature yes used to be the police force it was just the that's what I'm getting at it's like okay I see I see what you're saying and there is that I get what you say there is that like kind of self-policing thing it's like culture does that to all of us it makes you not step out of line here there's these things you can't say these things that are kind of frowned upon like like with a police force for gazelle is lions right and it is illegal for gazelle to be too slow that's good okay yes I like gazelle breaks that law it is given the death penalty by a lion that's it nature and then what ends up happening and again like but here's the slippery slope of this path when we go into nature and gaze upon the mock of valiant cruelty of the evolutionary process and witness the way nature deals with crime in the sense of crime for nature is being unhealthy crime for nature is just not being able to be in tune with whatever the rhythms are whatever particular biomass you happen to have incarnated as you break that law you don't go to jail there's no cops you just die yes no look I agree with you and that is I mean I don't even think I agree with you I think that's just objectively true and I so is that the marketplace no I think to me the marketplace is actually something very different I mean what to me that's almost more similar to government like that's an example of like look the reality is there's something bigger and stronger here and you can feel however you like to feel about it but you cross this thing it will crush you and these are the rules and and to me that's that it's gravity or you could just describe that as like the you know the police like as you said like that's the it is a force that you're not going to beat if you go up against it to me the the whole existence of of humanity is kind of like we go from the state of nature which is what you're talking about which is just kind of like who can impose their will on who who's stronger and more dominant that one wins and eventually human being started trying in these little experiments of actually organizing society at least in some degree around philosophy logic reason and not just this kind of crazy state of nature and we came up with what I would say in from literally from the period of where um there's the golden age in the muslim world from literally greco roman shit to the golden age in the muslim world to the enlightenment uh the best values that have come out of humanity so far have kind of been I guess what you would trace from like the from the magna carta through kind of like the you know like everything about natural rights the idea of human beings having natural rights and this is almost where humans have started to in some little way transcend the rules of nature and go to okay we're actually going to maybe organize society around the idea that people there there's morality involved here it's not just the force of who wins and who loses there's something moral there's something about owning yourself as a human being whatever this existence is we don't really know what it is but we do know that human beings very in particular from other uh uh animals self identify self understand and and use their own bodies for the future there's something immoral look I think if we would say morality even back let's say me and you as modern people are looking back even to something in the state of nature it's like 200 000 years ago or something like that and we just saw you know we're just we get a bird's eye view and we're looking down and some guy uh like rapes a woman you know like it some hunter comes up to some other villages gatherer and she screams no and he holds her down and rapes her I think me and you even if there's no government there's no law there's no jails there's nothing I think me and you would still feel like that's immoral on some level we would go he he took something from her that was kind of wrong I think morality has always existed eventually human beings started to find themselves there and to me what the markets are is quite the opposite the market is people coming together and saying okay we're going to respect private property respect your ownership and voluntarily exchange through that so I don't look at it all the same thing I look at it as actually quite different so you don't see the market as being some natural projection of the the fundamental laws of the universe that the markets aren't isn't that like I guess I think it's what I was saying before I think it's moving toward universally preferable behavior I think it's moving toward harmony and and I think look it's not just government right I think it's why I said at the beginning like the non-aggression principle it's anyone initiating force I think if you're going out and like asking a girl out and trying to go on a date with her and you're you're within the harmony now because you're trying to make this work she may not like it then you got to adjust and she's got just yeah if you go out and bash her over the head and drag her home now you're corrupting something now you're a member of the Mongol horde right do you know about the Mongols do you know I've heard a little bit not much so the way that it's a very interesting man you know Genghis Khan was one I've read a little bit about him fascinating fascinating but his mother so his mother was getting married and the way it used to work and for the Mongols was you would have to like if you wanted to marry someone you basically became an indentured servant to their family for like six years so you would go so you have a girl you like you go hang out with their family for six years carry water like will scrub their mom's fucking feet whatever it is and then you're granted the right to marry the girl oh tinder has made things so much easier I know man but then so but so that's a problem because you know there's this temporal investment when it comes to getting reproductive rights so the other way that you would get a wife is just a kidnapper and so the way that it worked was Genghis Khan's mom was heading back with her dad who just spent six fucking years working so that he could like have reproductive rights to Genghis Khan's mom they're going through some snowy past bandits appear she whispers in his ear like you've got to go or they're gonna kill you and he's like fuck he leaves Genghis Khan's wife or Genghis Khan's mom is now like kidnapped they she's just like yeah I'm kidnapped so I guess I'm your wife now and then they like that's where Genghis Khan came from the one of the great conquerors and we're actually interested enough one of the great unifiers that's crazy because literally genetically he unified them right like I mean he he fucked so many chicks that like what was it something like there was like a third of the people had his like DNA and that's right yeah but not just that I mean he was like what's interesting is he was um uh he was uh I mean I think it's as a libertarian you might actually like Genghis Khan in some way because he was if you look at the time period that he was in and if the idea is that like we're talking about a continuous readjustment of some kind of moral compass based on like more harmonized complexity and human interaction if you look at the time period he's in fuck you know this was a time where if you were living in Europe and you were like no I don't you know I don't really believe the whole Jesus thing you're fucking ten you are tender they're gonna set you on fire it's very hard to go back to any of these time periods and apply anything like moral you you know modern what we think of as modern moral standards because it really is as I was saying before just so everything's based on conquest at that time but you can see the growing the way that it becomes more and more refined because Genghis Khan was shocked by the fact that people in Europe weren't allowed to worship whoever they wanted he was a multicultural person so he thought he liked Christians because they drank he liked Buddhists he liked every religion he came into contact with he didn't fucking care he was just trying to harvest this I mean I guess I'd I'd be you know opposed to um you know imposing that on other people even if you have a superior belief I don't think you should go violently impose it on other towns which is basically what he did um but but yes I would like that stuff I mean he yeah I guess he was cooler on religion than certainly the other Europeans were he was cooler on religion the other European the way everybody was doing shit back then was was like violent and terrible and and he was like just responding to primitivism because he was like he since he wasn't locked into I don't know if you ever seen what the letter that Genghis Khan's one of his sons one of his descendants when they were still the Mongol Empire wrote to the Pope have you ever seen that no I don't think so oh my god it's the most amazing Smackdown because the Pope writes this letter to the cons being like listen because the way you know there's lots of ways to dominate and one of them is psychologically through religion so the Pope writes this letter to the cons like listen you've got to understand you're breaking the laws of Jesus Christ and the con writes back and he's like I've read your letter but I don't understand if your god is so powerful why do we conquer and control everything under the sky that's not a bad argument and he ends he ends the letter with saying I want you to come and bow before me or god knows what will happen to you she's saying like come and give me come and submit to the Empire so um anyway the the point I'm trying to make here is that when we when you witness uh that from our perspective we think god barbarism barbarism but now just like you were saying we look at what we're doing is like oh this is a very sophisticated modality that we're in here it's sophisticated you know and it is it's more sophisticated sure and yet when I go to a fucking McDonald's which I don't do that much and I gaze across the counter at a dude who's at the fucking cashier's desk for like or let's see I don't go to McDonald's I call it a cashier's desk whatever the fuck it is and I see the look on their faces right and they're and I gotta be like I have to get into a game with them right I go into a game which is you're the guy who fucking takes the green paper and gives me the fucking hamburger and I'm the guy who gives you the green paper yeah and I'm gonna talk to you like in a certain way and you're gonna talk to me in a certain way and that's called an inner a transaction and it's interesting very formal hey how are you today welcome to McDonald's what can I get you oh I'll take the number three would you like uh what size big fries small fries small fries then this is interesting if you watch the way that you do the transaction your body goes an autopilot you reach into your pocket pull out your wallet yeah it's very strange we all get into these roles you don't mean you were talking about the other day that uh that stanford experiment with the prisons the stanford prison experiment it's like everyone just gets into their role that's just how we are and you go right you know I you know it's like people who put on a suit they get into this I'm a suit guy role and people who don't do it and we get into this I'm a comedian role and we all we all assume the shit but I will say this that I don't you know I think there's a lot of disparaging of of you know capitalism for for lack of better term and I get it I get what you're saying and there's these struggles of just living in a first world country in the modern world where it's like we whether you're talking about the mcdonald's guy or just a guy in a cubicle I mean it's the reason why office space is such a great movie because it kind of spoke to that kind of like what the fuck are we doing yeah with our existence and we are evolved to live in a different world than we live in yeah there are all these issues however I also look at it on the other side and I see that you know even like a minimum wage worker in America is living a higher standard of life than than the vast majority of the like my grandfather was a a holocaust survivor from Nazi Germany who you know like it's like these guys have such better lives and I'll tell you what I look at of capitalism in the marketplace is a fact that I could come out of the stand comedy club like like drunk at one in the morning and I a Jew I walk into the street put my hand up and a Muslim stops for me and takes me back to my door and at the end of it he goes God bless and I go thank you brother have a good night now if you were to get into every belief he has about Jews or every belief I have about muslim there probably some shit that yeah but at the end of the day I want the ride he wants the cash we're all in this together he just wants to get home to his family so I think it also has this amazing unifying like thing where where we all kind of come together and literally we're making each other wealthier you are giving me a ride home that I needed and you're getting money that I need I it's this amazing voluntary thing where I go in my mind a ride home is worth more than 20 dollars listen I like it man don't get me wrong do you I like the fact that right now I can walk a block away and a person playing the role of the man who makes coffee will make me a coffee and I'll be able to I just did it he would do the great job he nailed it I love it but and but also I'm a meat eater so when I eat meat I have to there's two things you could do when you eat meat you could think about the fact that this motherfucker that you're eating suffered in the most severe way it's gonna make it a less palatable steak like you see that which is why I hate the steak houses that put pictures of cows on the wall oh yeah that's a little rough I don't get it man and I went to a steakhouse once in Vegas and they had pictures of cows on the wall and I swear to God I was super high but I swear it's like they started playing the sounds of like mooing at some point it was really fucked up man cows are very sweet creatures I don't know no I I yes I've seen some of the videos and that shit is hard to watch and it's hard it's hard to get through that there is look it may not be like a human level of of awareness or something but there is some level of awareness that is experiencing like a shit ton of pain right in order for us to eat that yeah so you know we look at our phones and we see these fucking beautiful devices sleek incredible filled with components and like some of the components constructed using conflict minerals and emerging from these factories in now China that where people they have to put nets under the windows and they have to keep sharp and that's that's yeah that's certainly terrible but you know I also do have a little bit of like sometimes I think we demonize what are like considered like sweatshops or things like that in in third world countries and we don't quite get what the comparative options are like I know this one because people will always I make this point a lot and people have really jumped down my throat for making in fact I I was debating libertarianism versus liberalism with this guy Sam Cedar who's like a progressive guy who's been out for a long time okay radio show and he was he really jumped on me when I said this because I said you know we had a large experiment in free markets in America and I basically made the point that from the end of the civil war until the beginning of the first world war you had a period in time in American history where you had a really large experiment in free markets like there was no income tax there was no central bank the federal government spent like two three percent of of the federal of the national income it was like very very small government and what was created in this time is the the the building block for the richest country that's ever been created in the history of yeah I think it's a really good case study and right away people start jumping on me like oh you're worshiping the gilded age there was child labor there was you know like pollution there were these dirty factories and I'm like okay first off there was child labor in that generation and every single generation that proceeded it child labor was not a new thing to that it was actually the generation where it went out there's this period in time where we as people we've been here forever right modern humans for like a long long time and all of a sudden like like six thousand years ago we start with civilization or maybe it's older than that but we about a couple you know around this time at the gilded age we abolished realization the the yes we industrialized and abolished slavery at least overt slavery as we've said before pretty fucking huge advance in human history and um so anyway I got a little bit lost over here saying but basically so when you go back there and they'll go like there were these dirty conditions and children were working but the more you look into it you go yeah but it was a substantial increase from the previous generation so that's only my point that I'm making with this china thing I know that Chinese kids are making our phones and making clothes and that does sound very icky to me but I also look at China and go like there's been this mass improvement in China in terms of of wealth so yeah I think you're the thing about it is that you know the past has been vile yeah and probably continues to the present continues in probably a lot of ways to be vile I just read we are homo sapiens homo sapiens there used to be all these different sapiens and we wiped out all the other sapiens except us we killed them all yeah so I there's I went to liberal arts school and one of my professors sam scoble brilliant man and we used to get in this conversation about what happens if like a cell and a tiger becomes sentient and suddenly realizes that it and it wants to be a vegetarian but it's in a fucking tiger right it's in a tiger and when you think about this web of connectivity that we all are existing in because we are like in a in a meat ocean basically we're all connected through economies through the pulsation of law in this like kind of like undulating title and we and it's amazing that we need each other I mean what you were talking about before being like ostracized I mean that's it that's really you know like you said yeah you could go live alone in the woods or whatever but we need each other so much right we're locked in yeah we're locked in but when you look at this network here you and me have a cool life and and but I know for sure that a few steps down I don't have to go that far there is connected to this network of me and again man I'm not making like oh and because of that we need to do this I'm just saying an analysis of the current situation is that huge swaths of the net that we are part of are experiencing fundamentally incarnation yes yes you're right and I'll tell you there's something about that that's so true and very well said and I think there's something about that that drives so much of the um what is modern progressives social justice warriors all that stuff we're talking about white privilege or this or who's oppressed and who's not it's this uncomfortable thing that we have to deal with which is that we just locked out essentially from what we know in this genetic lottery where we're born in a first world country and me and you are like you're talking about the McDonald's guy we're doing good even for a first world we are like amongst the top of all humanity like the top little percentage and it's really there's a very weird thing to feel like that got some guy who's like a Mexican you know immigrant who's like running over the border right now with like nothing but the the clothes on his back he's just like you said he's just a meat pile like I am and he got that draw and I got this one and I'm like so happy on this instead of that it does bring up these feelings like guilt and who you owe what to I just think if you look at it like I used to think I remember it's funny because we're here on my block where I grew up in high school I remember thinking this when I was a kid I uh I had a job at a bagel store real nice Jewish summer job and uh there there were like these Mexican guys who worked in the back and I remember just thinking to myself as a fairly liberal left-wing kid I was like uh this is so fucked up like they're getting way under they're under the table they're getting way under minimum wage they're fucking you know and I was like they should get minimum wage like I really felt passionately like there should be a law that make sure these guys and of course there already was a minimum wage law but they they were being illegal and you know hiring them off the books but I remember thinking to myself man that's so fucked up and um like the older I got and the more I kind of reflected on that and started learning about how markets work and things I realized like okay if you were to find a way to enforce the minimum wage law like if you were to find a way to say like you cannot we found a way to enforce it we won't let you hire these guys you have to pay them a minimum yeah there's nothing else you could do more to fuck over those Mexicans what you would literally do would be to take away the only weapon they have which is that they're willing to undercut people if you forced her to pay the minimum wage right away she would have been like okay well I'm gonna hire people who speak English who are legal who are here like I'm the whole reason I'm hiring you is because you're under I would be condemning them to stay in Mexico like it sucks it sucks that this is the process and that there's no easy fix but if you look at it the reason we're here like the reason I'm here is because my grandfather came over with nothing but the clothes on his back from that country worked in a fucking factory worked a shitty job gave my mother the opportunity to go to school she gave me a better life and now I have a and kind of for these Mexican people as much as it sucks that's the best path that's the best path to get them actually in the game do you know the um there's a to get back to the initial sure sure uh and to address your point there and it is it's the point I do I think about it you know and I think about how uh well what can what what there are things that we must be able to do right there must be something but the the so the initial point is we violence when you're not defending yourself is unethical right and there's a group you know the weather underground yes sure bring the bill airs yeah bring the war back home that was their idea but what one of the I think it was they were saying is uh to ignore violence is violence so if we see violence happening and don't do anything about it if we have the ability to stop it I would reject the idea that that is violence I mean I'm not saying you could argue over whether it's a moral or something like that but I wouldn't equate it to violence like I don't think if someone if someone punches you in the face and runs off I don't think I've also punched you in the face because I didn't like you know break it up if like let's say I'm sitting here and like let's say I don't know I'm just trying to think of the most like grotesque so let's say there's like a woman being like raped and you come by in the middle take a look at it and go hmm and keep walking off I mean that's pretty morally horrible yeah but it's not rape I don't think you should be convicted of rape so I wouldn't equate it to violence if that makes sense but you should the idea is you should do something if you can I think so and this is so this is the problem but what if a guy's got a gun I'm sorry just to push this a little bit further right so if a guy's got a gun and he's raping a woman at gunpoint and I go hey stop and then he points the gun at me and I go well then you're an idiot it's more effective to like if you see a guy with a gun raping somebody probably your best bet is to call the fucking cops no I'm with you so my whole point is just that if there's something like if you're talking about state violence like look there's something to be said for like we just murdered people by the hundreds of thousands in Iraq and we're all sending our money into it are we somehow you know there's a real interesting moral question there like are we doing anything to actually stop these people being murdered but then you also look at the reason I use the analogy of the gun is because it's like you get to this point like what the fuck am I gonna do if I stop sending my money they'll just throw me in jail and the war goes on you know but this is so this is where we enter into the realm of the extremist and this is where you enter into the realm of like all right I now again like I like my I have a lazy what I'm saying is we must to really like feel okay there's a huge thing we have to no matter who you are no matter how what your most most of most of you there's a thing we almost ignore which is if especially if you're American we are in a dragon that rampages around the planet and just slaughters people and it's a crazy dragon because like you know like when ISIS kills people there's some kind of rationalization behind it usually like when ISIS kills someone it's like well they were gay whatever you know there's like at least there's a reason like when I'm getting killed by ISIS if I'm a gay man and I'm getting killed by it shoved off a building top by fucking ISIS I know there's some weird meaning to it which is and I know as I'm falling to my death that I died for love I was murdered by a fucking fundamentalist piece of shit and I died because I loved and that's a cool way to die I'm not gonna I'm not trying to think that until the afterlife which hopefully there is a beautiful paradise or I could laugh it off and not just some infinite darkness or whatever but what I'm saying is the way the dragon of the conquering dragon of the United States kills people is you're just walking to go check out your sheep yep there's a fucking flash of light and you're turned into hamburger meat and it's an accident where like you know where we will say we'll we will just come out and say Obama said it was you know it's an unfortunate what do they call it they call it a collateral damage collateral damage yeah you don't even get to think that you died for anything at all you were an accident you're like in a hit well I try to I try to refer to war as mass murder as often as I can because that's really all it is but it's and because we don't we're not like oh we're not icky we don't like behead you with a sword you know it's like a drone but it's like there's this technology and then this terminology and it's like well it was a military operation and it was a blah blah blah you know it's all that yeah collateral damage and yeah it's um yeah no there's no question we remove ourselves from what what is actually going on if you just bought a fucking mcdonald's hamburger or if you bought some nice coffee or if you paid your taxes this year or if you have done any transaction inside the united states you are part of a web of violence that is responsible for murder so well okay yeah you're yes you're part of the web I mean you can't but I guess by that logic even people outside the country could be part of the web I mean if you're like doing any business with an American or doing business with someone who's doing business with an American right like the whole web is all of us in a sense but I don't I think one of the things that governments do which which I I try to fight back on because I think there's kind of like this religion of the state that they get people believing is it's this thing where they go they always go it's government of the people you know like we are the people the people are the government the state is the which is all kind of bullshit it's like no we're not really you like you're right we are all in this web of humanity together but it's like no there's a few hundred fucking killers who send over this killing force and then we're the ones who get robbed and forced to pay for it because the truth is the fact that then this is where I get to the thing between volunteerism and aggression let's say tomorrow they just went oh you know what uh taxes are voluntary who wants to keep funding this war effort well the reason they don't do that is because they know what would fucking happen if they did right so I don't know if I can completely indict the entire you know like yes we have some moral responsibility but at the same time we are being forced into it it's like if a woman's being like uh like kidnapped and raped you don't sit there and go uh well I mean you kept blowing this guy it's like no well she doesn't have a fucking choice and if she was given a choice I'm pretty sure she would choose to leave oh I see so you know like there's some relief yeah the moral responsibility a little bit we're being forced into it yeah and yet when you consider heroes like okay let's imagine here let me create a really ridiculous really ridiculous picture let's imagine that there's this terrible machine it's a scale right and on one side of this so marbles land on one side of the scale it's like this weird like uh it's a trap it's a it's a it's a machine it's the worst machine ever made and it's a scale and marbles land on top of the scale right every time someone drinks water of tiny little marble lands on the scale when the scale goes down a door opens up allowing a sociopathic pedophile to walk into a room filled with children do you keep drinking water knowing that eventually because you're one of the people drinking water you're gonna release a fucking pedophile into a room where he's gonna rampage through children and or do you die do you just die a hero yes would die we would certainly find that heroic in any movie if we saw it in that guy and the guy died he sacrificed himself but but and so in other words if it was like you and me if it's you and me in the room and there's a water fountain you know you're gonna be looking at me I'm gonna be looking at you or like one amount fixed amount of water yeah look I get what you mean but at the same time you have to I get water first it's gonna be it's gonna be a tight no I mean really which of us do you think would take a sip of water first man if there's one fountain well if the in your example one fountain I'd like to think we'd share the fountain but like if there's a limited amount of water no I'm just saying I'm like so like there's a water fountain you and me are in a room we're locked in there we have all the food we need but every time we take a sip of water oh well close to a water who drinks water first and we have to calculate how many marbles land I think I might drink first you're more in tune with the universe I mean this is coming this is gonna happen well I mean you know as you said it not that it's the perfect example but we were talking about something that is really going on and we all kind of are really contributing to it I think you do I think it is worth like examining and at least looking at that a little bit but again I don't you know I think if you know your taxes go to murder I look isn't it ethically isn't like it an ethical again I think that these are questions you don't want to ask I agree but isn't well I actually do want to ask but I think in general people don't yes we don't like to think about it but isn't that ethical decision to make and I don't just mean taxes I mean like knowing for sure that within the next couple of weeks there is gonna be another drone strike I mean there was one I think yesterday yes like yeah so there's one every day because there's fucking dudes in Vegas like gamers who just sit in air conditioned vans and press a button that transforms that creates like complete annihilation of families and I mean just right here if you want to look at things like I mean the mass incarceration where we're literally we're fighting a war on a nonviolent crime because the prison union's lobby and tobacco and alcohol companies lobby us into like the prison union lobbies them into keeping these you know what mandatory minimums and all these things funded by my god it's just disgusting so let me end this with a an important question because now I think we've assembled an idea of like your POV and the but from a libertarian perspective knowing that fundamental violence is happening and is is in some tiny minuscule way related to every financial transaction taking place in our society today what is the ethical move what does an ethical person do and how and also if the markets are so like good how is this allowed to happen well I mean okay because look okay so let me it's first off I guess might shot it because it's really really fascinating you know like question I think I do say that there is like the point I made before where you're a little bit off the hook you're a little bit off the hook because you're forced and if somebody you know if somebody mugs you at gunpoint and you give them your money you're not exactly morally responsible for what they go do with this money but now if they keep mugging you repeatedly and you know they're taking this money to go kill someone I think let's use the concentration camps though to address that point Nazi prison guard right he's under someone else he got he's like look you're going to a fucking labor camp all right you got to be a guard there and you're a fucking soldier so you have to do what we say or you go to the fucking you'll be in the camp too basically if you don't want to yeah history does not like go through the Nazis who were at the concentration camps no they all of them are complicit all of them are well well we I mean certainly a lot of them got killed but if you look at like the trials at Nuremberg and stuff like that what was more or less decided was like we're gonna go after high level people who are planning it and we will give somewhat of an out to the low level people who were like basically gonna die anyway I don't know I mean I think look I say I guess the balance I would find is like I'm not I don't think it's productive uh and also I'm just not willing to sacrifice myself to just go like I'm not gonna send my money in anymore I'll go be a martyr I'll go to jail something like that yeah but I do think that from a libertarian perspective once you realize all that there's an onus on you to try to maybe spread that knowledge do something I mean I think there's you know it's not necessarily one or the other and then just to acknowledge the second part I don't you know when I say markets uh I'm saying volunteerism works very well in authoritarianism does not and I don't know that the human that there is a human tendency for both and I think we have to fight against one and move toward the other no I the reason why it which so crazy me is for how much capitalism is is uh demonized by everybody on the left it the horrible the mass immoral you know tragedies of our time are all being committed by governments I mean they're all being committed it's these these wars mass incarceration just just robbing people blind I mean all this cronyism it's it's all being created by government the fact that the richest districts in the country are right outside Washington DC and right around New York City government has been infiltrated by corporations yes yes corporations are the result of capitalism well okay I don't I would disagree with that a little bit I think corporations okay the idea of firms and companies certainly are are a creation of markets and capitalism the idea of a corporation so someone having like legal personhood that protects them from that's kind of a government creation no I think there's this right people tried uh and you can look through the the titans of industry all these guys in in the latter part of the of the 18th or the 19th century um they all tried to monopolize their industries like JPMorgan and all these guys they all tried to take over their industries they failed over and over again and just created a lot of stuff because it's very hard to monopolize in the in the free market and they all end up going into government I mean they do they go they get sucked into this government thing where instead of trying to outcompete somebody you just go lobby the government to get a rule against your opponent and it becomes the so yeah I'm I'm I just look at it as uh as as look there's there's basically two different types of interactions we can have uh voluntary or forced there's no legitimate reason in my opinion to institutionalize forced well let me talk about that for do you have a second we're going over time no sure I'm good yeah so volunteer okay so this is interesting someone that I'm sure a libertarian does not like very much Zizek do you know Zizek I don't think I do he's amazing but he like he's uh uh a marxist he calls himself a marxist but he so he talks about uh the two different violent what do you call it volunteerism versus authoritarianism okay so the example he gives of this is like um okay authoritarianism is you're my kid we're gonna go see your grandmother all right and I'm gonna say to you put down the fucking Nintendo switch we're here where you're gonna go take a shower and wear your nice clothes and we're gonna go see your grandmother whether you like it or not that's authoritarianism you gotta go there's no choice I'll drag you into the car I'm your dad right so that's like authoritarianism or I say to you John can you stop playing Zelda for a second I want to talk to you you know that your grandmother is very old and might not be around much longer and she would really like to see you but I'm gonna give you the decision about whether or not you can come and see your grandmother or not and in that last in that part the child is being given the illusion of volunteerism but the reality is the kid is being emotionally manipulated and knows what the right answer is now this is a problem now this kind of trick this trick is is rotten because it appears in a lot of different ways so when we think okay the man is allowed to work at the cash register or not work at the cash register really though he's got to have those green bits of paper I can't remember which comedian has that fantastic joke might be Bill Hicks but I can't remember who which is like if you want to understand how this is in a free country look at what happens when you run out of money you can't do shit you can't do shit for you to get into the cab to go with the muslim man you got to have those green slips for me to get in the fucking cab well yeah I mean yeah you gotta have something to give back yes I agree but so so so the problem is that what we think of as volunteerism isn't true volunteerism in the sense that there is a there will be a stern consequence from the state should you no longer but that's okay just just to push you by first of all the first thing I would say is that I just kind of hesitate if you're when you're using examples of authoritarianism versus volunteerism to make authoritarianism maybe make it seem not as stark of a contrast or maybe even authoritarianism is better they always like to use an example of a kid and I really really just reject the idea I get this all the time and I reject the idea that the government are the parents and we're the kids I just don't think that's a fair analogy because the problem is that then you ignore the fact that we're all adults we're all the same equal thing and anything that you're every authoritarian institution relies on this kind of master slave king surf no like this mentality that all adults are not equal human beings there's the adults up there and then you get this mentality where you go and people project this shit onto the government all the time they go like a you'll be arguing about the war on drugs and you go alcohol is more dangerous than than pot and you're almost assuming you guys are just dumb but that assumption is that they're trying to write a like they're a good parent in your mind they're trying to write the rule well but they're just fucking up but the truth is they work for the fucking tobacco and alcohol company like it's not that it's not any of that you're just getting duped so I hesitate to use tobacco and alcohol company or a result of the free market um I think that a lot of sure there's a lot of companies that are uh make money in the free market and then go try to take over government I have no problem with them making the money in the free market I don't want them to try to take over the government a natural progression of by the way man let me just say again I am not a communist I for me to in some way or another dismiss how lucky I am I have a great life because of the way things are working right now so I just I'm not like saying therefore let's take the property from their wealthy and disperse it among the people again I'm just saying when we look at unfettered capitalism the end result of it is the infiltration of the state there's no question about that this is essentially why I'm an anarchist and not a minarchist libertarian I think what you had as I was kind of saying before with the history of America is you have this a large experiment in free markets with a small government and as the country creates all this wealth then these wealth interests go in and try to take over the government it's almost why I think this entity shouldn't exist at all because it is kind of inevitable inevitable that it will grow and grow and grow in size and strength that's kind of what you know so I do alternative I think I think the alternative is it will look how we get to to uh from from here to free markets I don't know I think I have a few different ideas on how it could maybe play out I think it's possible that more and more technology um just makes more government things obsolete I mean I kind of think when you can 3d print a gun it's not going to really matter how you feel about gun control I think when you know what I mean like there's all these different things where the government can kind of just be virtual reality multinational office buildings that are where the workers are paid in bitcoin I mean there's lots of there's lots of different like like you know kind of possibilities but I also think that if you whatever there's this kind of tendency someone this guy Stephan Molyneux is a internet libertarian guy he made this analogy I thought this was a really well done one but he goes uh he was saying like if you were like that economists uh during slavery and that this is real you can look this up would used to make this argument that uh they would be like who would pick the select who will pick the cotton and that the southern economy would be destroyed if you didn't have slavery and all these arguments and they they if you were to have given an accurate answer to that question if you're gonna like who will pick the cotton you'd be like well you know we're gonna dig into the earth and find dinosaur juice and then big build metal rope like nobody actually knows if you get rid of authoritarianism and let a market work we don't know exactly how this is gonna go but we wouldn't be able to have massive wars like this we wouldn't be able to talk about getting rid of authoritarianism because that seems to be like the obvious ethical actionable move we've got to get rid of authoritarianism we have to arrest the the reptilian claws off of the fucking steering wheel of the country and and but to do that to do that come on no i'm it's no small task but it goes back to what i was saying before you're talking about sure violent it would require not necessarily violent revolutions don't usually work out that well i think look i think that um there's no question what i'm talking about is a revolution but it goes back to what i said before about like if you were you know if you were sitting in round in 1845 saying who's you know we need slavery and if you were if you were sitting in a in 1985 and and said uh you know communism's gonna fall i mean this would be a crazy right thought but it happened and these things can happen and the truth is we've never been closer to it i mean like we it's actually pretty amazing how you know i mean we've never had a real shot at this until now where ideas can spread and people can have these conversations there's all these different things that people used to say like well you'll just need authoritarianism for this and now we're figuring out like oh you don't so i mean let's i don't know how it happens let's say the some like 15 angels appear and they go to washington and they of they like take every senator every congressman bought by the corporations that truly doesn't represent the people right they take every every president vice presidents whoever they may be they take them to another place but that's here's the thing right it's like yeah that's or i evaporate the heads of all tobacco companies or i evaporate like every single no it does nothing it doesn't matter someone else fills in that void the thing that you need is to actually get at a shift in awakening i mean this is this this does happen it's it's not like impossible this is what you need but it's not it can't be a top-down approach like that what does happen though right is we're living in this era now what just happened with hillary clinton is really fucking fascinating yes and the implications of this i think are that i don't i don't think they're ever gonna be able to run a career criminal again and it's because of the technology if you've been a fucking murderer for 25 years there's going to be a julian assange out there who gets your emails gets a leaked thing and we're gonna and now you have this thing uh nick gillespie who's uh editor of reason magazine made this point on my podcast that really stuck with me because there's an amazing thing that that technology does where you'll see like hillary clinton's uh tweet and she's like i want you know better jobs at higher wages and communities coming together and then what right underneath it it's like you're a lying cunt you murdered 15 people like you and it's just the establishment is being degraded look what i said before about the reason they don't make taxes voluntary right just very quickly take the war effort if they were to say uh say we're in the middle of the wrack war and they go if you want to the funding is now voluntary for the iraq okay so the 30 40 percent who are against the iraq war they immediately pull their funds out the other uh 70 60 percent now has to pay for that other share too that makes about 10 to 20 percent of them drop out then the other has to pay the whole before you know what this whole thing's over why do they make taxation uh uh why do they why do we have to be forced to pay for these wars why do they have to control the media why do they have to do all this other shit because it'll fall apart if they don't and that's our hope that's our hope is that the fact that they rule over us like that indicates that they need this and look if you look at the numbers of the media they're freaking out right now this whole fake news bullshit that they're going off on they're freaking out right now because all of the mainstream media numbers are going down all of the alternative media things are going up it platforms even like this and and fucking like a lot of our other friends doing stuff this did not exist before where we're challenging all that shit and and so i'm just saying i wouldn't look it could go really bad probably but i wouldn't be closed off to the idea of like things could work out really well well i do i mean i when you kind of see what's going down you do kind of witness them it does appear to be a machine it has all the symptoms of a malfunctioning machine like oh we're in the end of something i mean it's it's it's amazing like almost i i try to sometimes like i'll do this at a show if i'm like in a packed room sometimes i'll ask if there's a historian in the crowd i'll just try to get into the thing where you're like okay so let me paint you a picture there's a great nation it becomes a great wealthy nation starts as a republic expands into an empire then it gets way too far expanded militarily spends itself into debt and the culture starts falling apart this ends well right i just kind of go through like is this ever is this ever ended in a good way i'm not like what are we looking at here uh but it's but that is really what's happening and if you look at trump or the social justice warriors i mean you look both sides you think about a culture falling apart or the conservatives like a generation ago are like bill buckley and f a hayek and now it's like grabbing by the pussy the liberals a generation ago you know they're like we need to end the war in vietnam and that they're like you're micro like wrestling against everyone's going fucking crazy right now it's nuts right yeah it's nuts i mean we are witnessing a meltdown for sure and we're and what's really interesting about is uh it's a meltdown like it's literally a meltdown like uh the the whatever the whatever the machine that was created by the founding fathers is is beginning to uh to to fall apart in this really strange way it's not like it's like it's like a sudden sudden someone has suddenly like put a guitar pedal in front of everything and the sound is being modulated in this chaotic way where all these fundamental pillars of what we thought were just a normal part for example a president that is uh stable you know they've all kind of even if they have been like murderous they're stable murderers they're like an american psycho level i put cream on my face every morning and comb my hair and then syndrome attacks that kill hundreds of people but well it's like george w bush like they'll always bring up they bring this up all the time because you know trump will be like you know these muslims they're out of control and people will be like even george w bush always said islam is a religion of peace and then you're like yeah and then he slaughtered like 300 000 of us like but they're like yeah but he didn't say mean words though like that this is really crazy but that's the world we live in where you're like yeah i don't really think he should be saying those mean words but are you out of your fucking mind that this is the big offense well we wanted our in the old days when a high priest sacrificed someone they did it with a kind of like regal ceremony you would like you know sprinkle water on the baby's head lift it up to the moon and then rip it's hard out well that's right and they need that ceremony this is what they hate about trump okay that's a great great point because he breaks the fucking ceremony and you can't have that this whole thing's got to be sold that way dude you can't have it's like look when you go into a religion and they've got like it's like the stained glass and the big ceiling and someone plays the organ is like and then they come up and they're like oh he's like someone can't just come and turn a chair backward and be like hey let's rap about jesus it doesn't work that way they need the show and when you start removing the show it gets very very dangerous for them because you can expose the man behind the curtain also yeah and i mean the big mistake trump is making i think uh i mean because if you look at evolution and and the idea and i think we disagree on this point i'll rethink my thoughts on it uh because i didn't didn't have those words volunteerism versus authoritarianism until today so i get i have this new tool to work with but when you look at like uh uh trump and the mistake or the idea of evolution of the evolution of imperialism right the evolution of imperialism becomes like an invisible emperor that's the idea it's not really an emperor it's like a president that we elected he's like it's not certainly not what it used to be used to be fucking i was the pharaoh yeah i'm the the like i'm god the there's a major shift from kind of the monarch model to the democratic if you want to call it you could like it was a normal thing to like be sitting in some imperial palace wearing robes eating fine food yes but there are also there's this guy uh there's a really great book on this topic uh called democracy the god that failed by haun sorm and hapa and he writes about kind of the compare uh you know after the first world war where we europe went from this transition to monarchy into these democracies and he really talks about a lot of uh you know one of the things that's really interesting it also changes the mindset where he goes this whole mindset of like we are the government the government represents the people because no one really bought that shit under a monarchy you kind of sit there you're like yeah he's the king he rules over us we know what the fuck this is but even like you're saying like now it's like they're kind of like people really buy into this mythology of like well we we represent a leader and blah blah blah like they choose the leaders that you get to elect it's it's such nonsense well the aesthetics really bad though i'm just saying the pictures of trump sitting at that fucking massive table with oh it's horrible the little with with baron and it fucking like he's wearing barons wearing bannon barons wearing what bannon i don't know there's a new picture it's trump sitting in that beautiful fucking oh oh oh it's okay yeah it's like it's like baron is like in two robes and like there you know what i mean they're like there's like there's chalices filled with orange juice and it's just like the the life of the elite right and the problem with it is like he's cutting all these like you know he cut meal he will what the he cut like i don't know three million ten million dollars from me three percent of them thirty percent i don't know the budget but he like the government's no longer well he's his his budget proposal is is really like uh just some of the worst of the worst i mean he wants to massively increase some of the worst things that the government does believe me listen if you i know there's a lot of people talking about how he's gonna cut the budget i would just say look at the number of total spending i bet you it goes up under donald trump i bet you it doesn't go down look like just i mean give it give it like one fiscal year i bet you it goes up he keeps flying to marlago man we have to keep paying for that but he's also looking for a 54 billion dollar increase to the military budget which is already the biggest military budget in the history it's like how many times we need to be able to blow up the world he's got an attorney general who's doubling down on the war on drugs he's saying that we need a federal federal police coming into chicago so he is he is not reducing authoritarianism in any way and there's a lot of these is why i said at the beginning of the show there's a lot of these like people use the word libertarian that probably are not in the same realm of where i am who are kind of like yeah like whatever with the police and military but just like cut this one regulation for a business i have money invested in like i'm not one of those coat brother libertarians like that's but so yeah what trump's doing yeah he wants to cut look i like it because it's the revelator sorry no no no go ahead i was just gonna say to be honest i think probably a lot of these programs should be cut but we should be cutting all of them but i i yes and and well i don't know we've got to come i think if we do like voluntary taxes where it's like hey what do you want to pay money like do you want to give money to like meals on wheels social programs or you want to give money to the military where do you want your money to go then i think those programs are going to do really well i try to say this a lot to uh people that that is a very big part of my pitch that i try to say to left-wing look i i try to start just like with a moral proposition of like who is it morally acceptable to throw in a cage because that's what we're getting at here with the government thing like who do we want to build prisons and throw in there like rapists murderers okay thieves okay now you want to just go to nonviolent crime you want to go to people who won't fund your health care program you're throwing in a cage that i'm not getting on board with so we can fund it i want to fund it um but there there is this kind of like a after that after that point i will say okay just kind of the point you made just look at it from the effect of what would happen right now if you allow them to have this fucking taxation system they're going to continue slaughtering people in the middle east and locking the poorest amongst us in cages and destroying inner city neighborhoods and all this shit if you take that away they won't be able to do that anymore they won't it's a fact they can't do it without force taxation so then you can get into this but what if we don't cover people's health insurance okay well first of all it's a little bit weird for anyone who's left-wing to be able to make that moral deal okay we'll keep slaughtering these people and imprisoning people but someone's health insurance will get paid well i don't know if that's okay um and then on top of that it's like i don't know maybe with all the money we're saving from this other shit and i don't i don't think people understand man we spend i've seen estimates that say close to a trillion dollars a year on the military industrial complex yeah i mean the amount of wealth that could be left in this country and created we'd have so many more resources so many more opportunities yeah and and we the idea that poverty poverty could be eliminated as as far as we know at this point in time i love what i i just love the idea of like getting some tax form that's got like even two checkboxes which is like do you want to give your money to the military or social programs right even those two things i think if we started doing that then suddenly you would begin to see like these massive marble libraries appearing oh i i don't think you're wrong well look if you if you look at already look i just want to say i think there's also there's a big problem when we go the government route with all these things there are major major incentive problems and moral hazards that get created i mean when you when you just come in and say uh so we're going to just on a grand level on a federal level just economically speaking we're going to subsidize unemployment now i know you might you want to call that like an insurance or whatever but you're saying we are going to pay people to not have jobs i mean there are major moral hazards that come along with that if you if you subsidize something you end up getting more of it if you tax something you end up getting less of it it's like an economic rule and and so we tax labor and subsidize unemployment we end up having way more unemployment than than we otherwise would there's like major major problems to going around they've got to pay off i mean the idea isn't the idea that like we have to pay off the uh we have to pay off the unemployed to not riot like the idea is like if we don't give them food then there's going to be if they can't survive if enough people can't survive there's just going to be a rebellion well okay usually every time i i'm thinking of something when there's a violent rebellion it's usually because there's a an authoritarian government that leaves them no other choice most people don't want to go fight the government violently it gets to a certain point where you're like they're going to kill us or we have to go kill them i i don't think you're going to have that problem unless you have the authoritarian government listen i got it i'm going to leave you on this one question sure what is some with all this information that you've given us what is some action that we can take starting right now to help move things along in a way where these fucking horrific wars overseas stop the the the the tendrils of the corporations that are now controlling laws what do we do man what's an act is like a conversation is i've had with you it's like quite enlightening but it kind of leaves me with a feeling of like fuck yeah i'm much better at having a good conversation than actually forming a solution i think um i mean look i don't know what i like i said i think we need this kind of cultural awakening and i i don't know exactly how we're gonna get there i i honestly think like from from my perspective and i'm sure a lot of people here listening disagree with me but i think like what ron paul did was just phenomenal i think more people who can if you can use kind of like the political machine to get to expose the people and wake people up to different ideas i think that's amazing i think um like whatever world you want to live in there's i don't believe in the idea like i believe in free will i don't believe in the idea that there's this predetermined or a predestined you know future that we're moving toward whatever world you want to live in you got to think about what you can do on your level to contribute toward that you know and and whether it's like you know just like being i i just one of the things that really bugs me about left-wing people and believe me there's tons that bug me about right-wing people so but it's always kind of this advocating that the government do something and now i get to feel morally good about myself and virtue signal because i i'm for universal healthcare i'm for letting immigrants in i'm for all this but really at the end of the day you're just like i'm four billionaires paying for this and and you're like okay well what do you do i mean you know bernie sanders i said the one percent have to pay you're the one percent you're the fucking one percent okay if you look at the world or human history you're the point 0001 percent you know when i say you got to start helping people do you remember when bernie sanders this is something that really bothered me about bernie sanders man because i was like you know a lot of people i love love bernie sanders me too he i remember and i haven't memorized what he said i think you can actually google it small google bernie sanders small cluster of troops in afghanistan did you see that do you remember that when you said that and i and it was during the time when he's saying like we got to have free college for everybody and he's simultaneously saying we've got to keep a small cluster of troops in afghanistan i remember thinking what does that mean man all the contractors involved with him what is a small cluster of troops to you how many troops are you talking about here and then when you consider the fact that like the military itself is comprised you want to see something fucked up man this is something i got into the other day the marines are putting out boot camp videos have you seen this yeah so people getting the first day of boot camp getting their head shaved and shit and then when you realize the people who are joining the military many of them are doing that because they don't want to be a cashier in a fucking mcdonald's well they were literally bribed into it i mean we come to them and we bribe the poorest amongst us to go murder poorest in a third world country that's it and then when you realize so now we've got this incredible kind of like slip and slide that leads to the fucking us military we're going through this insane conditioning program to get shipped overseas to transform people in a hamburger meet for billionaires who are making money because from building more bombs and then the thing that you're talking about man fuck what the thing you're talking about he's supported the f1 fighter program i mean he's he has not been against the military industrial complex yeah it bugged me a lot he that bothered me a lot can i say what i'll say this about uh bernie sanders and to me this this always really stuck with me and summed up might but this was years ago it was back in like uh 2012 maybe ron paul was running and i remember bernie sanders was on hardball with chris mathews and they cut from a uh like a clip of ron paul at a debate and someone had asked him you know they try to always ask the libertarians tough questions but he goes uh he goes well you know in your society a free society what if someone you know decides not to get insurance and then they get on a motorcycle they have an accident uh are you saying they just have to depend on charity and their friends and family and neighbors and ron paul goes that's what freedom is all about i mean some of us make better decisions some of us make worse decisions that's what insurance is and you can't and um he basically just gives a libertarian answer and they cut back to uh bernie sanders and he goes and bernie sanders like look uh i know ron paul i respect him very much uh this is what they believe libertarians believe if you don't have health insurance you should die you shouldn't get health care and i sit there and i'm sitting there going like oh that's what libertarians believe if you don't have health insurance you should die so bernie sanders has never had a fucking real job in his life he's been a politician advocating that billionaires go do other things for people's whole life ron paul is a fucking medical doctor who worked in a christian church that never turned anyone away he made a dollar an hour for like several years when he could have made way more money and he actually rolled up his sleeves and did it and then to represent his view as he thinks people should die because he goes hey maybe these bought and paid for pieces of shit aren't actually providing us with good health care they're making their corporate donors rich and it's like this fucked up thing so that's to me what bugs me about the left wing it's like you gotta get past something where you feel like you can just say i'm for the government doing this and now i'm a moral agent even if you're for the government doing it at least get out there and fucking do something yourself okay so i think the takeaway here is what you said it twice now there's some kind of awakening that needs to happen a personal awakening some some form of self-educated and and just i'm sorry to interject but just what you think i think it maybe it'll be brought on by the fact that a lot of these government programs are collapsing like you know the soviet union didn't necessarily collapse because they had an awakening it collapsed because the the finances were so out of control so maybe that'll lead to an awakening but yeah that's i mean we all know though i mean the way i i i doesn't everyone at this point know that our government is pretty much run by the corporations more there's some polling to suggest that more than ever more than that yeah and most people know that the drug laws are just another way to make pick for profit prisons make more money yeah so people know that so i think there's evidence in the way that we're moving toward that but no one's doing shit as much more i guess so i see what you're saying there's like a slip may i like what you're saying because it's like it feels like ideas like if we like try to imagine the perfect paradise universe type class a civilization all human beings functioning together and a kind of like as one super organism that is somehow maintaining its individuality and this thing has been reached through a kind of self-awareness and not a an x and a top down in position just a natural progression into this like i mean it might be helped along with a leader i think humans need leaders you know but it's but it's still kind of like a bottom-up thing but isn't god this is i don't mean to make this to keep going on but isn't that description communism isn't the idea a super organism of a cell of individuals working together isn't that a form of like wouldn't that be like in other words communism not imposed by some dictator communism not imposed but the idea is like somehow we all wake up well look if you're talking about communism to me you're talking about a stateless classless society with no private property i think this is all just kind of a ridiculous delusion that that mark look say whatever you will about marx i mean he was fundamentally wrong about human nature he predicted the workers of the world would unite and that that that they would unite as workers and fight off the bourgeois and what happened is the workers of the world united under nationalism and slaughtered each other but i mean he was completely wrong about how humans were humans do not work absent of incentives they do not work absent of property they don't work and they're not going to there's going to be different classes naturally speaking there are people who are smarter there are people who achieve more there are people who are just better at certain things is it possible that there's a non-existent like as of yet in other words communism was you know it was emerged well the big problem for me that communism is kind of this idea that will never will never get to anyway the socialism which is what he advocates we move into or what the natural order is is where you end up with russia uh china and and these aren't things that went like kind of bad but is there some system that doesn't exist yet do you think is it possible that there's some economic social system that some genius just hasn't thought i mean it's it's certainly possible there's something a genius can see that i can't see but i don't see really at the end of the day you can either kind of send there are certain things that are binary and you can either centralize or decentralize and you can either have you know imposed rule or voluntary rule so i don't know to me i don't think there will be another system i think that if you have uh competition and markets different kind of communities will arise and some will do things better and some will copy things from other people um the the communism again and this is the the other thing i would just say about the bernie sanders i would just be for anybody who wants to you know identify as like a democratic socialist or the word socialist or communist i just i guess what kind of i mean look you had the socialists in in the 20th century the socialists and the national socialists are literally the the worst groups that have ever fucking existed i mean they're like the most evil horrible like at least look into that connection that when this happens and the idea oh well it's going to be democratic so then it's okay then everything's okay like what why would any of those policies be okay if it was voted on first i mean i i just don't know why you would embrace this where it's true and and you can for anybody who's out there talking about like the scandinavian countries they're not socialist countries they're they rank higher than us on the economic freedom index uh but the that idea that and it gets into what we were saying before when you look at the authoritarian the father and the kid if you project this idea that there will be a dictator of the proletariat who kind of like does good for everybody given you know power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely and that's i think what we find out more and more with communism or government in general but you could i mean like there i think that there's a you a libertarian if you were a surgeon like suddenly i gave you the ability to if i could give you the ability to like just download into your brain now you're a surgeon and you you you can like you know how to do it you know how to do open are all forms of surgery and then we're just you and me and a few other people in the neighborhood somebody comes in who needs i don't know a c-section and they don't have any money but she's gonna die aren't you gonna give her the c-section yeah right so you built into you is the impulse you're not gonna be like hey listen i'm gonna give you the c-section yes and in fact even if there's no even if there's no law that says that uh doctors have developed something through the market called the Hippocratic oath and now they take other oaths or whatever but pretty much every doctor has has sworn an oath to never do that and by the way i this is the thing where people almost project this like thing where if the government wasn't there i remember one of my favorite things ron paul ever said was when they asked him because they really tried to trip him up at the fox news debate in south carolina they go so are you advocating legalizing heroin are you saying heroin is an exercise of liberty and he goes how many people in this room right now are concerned that if the law went away they would start doing heroin how many people here are like oh my god thank god there's a law against that or i'd start go doing it and he made this part where it's like me yeah well you know listen there are some of us uh but we'll probably do it whether there's a law or not right so it's this idea that doctors if there wasn't a law there will now all of a sudden just watch that person die because that's why they went into medicine of course because of these callous people i got you are willing to just you know let so yeah no i agree with you of course we should we should you want to listen man it just clicked for me because what you're saying is very beautiful it's that human beings are fundamentally going to help if they can't well it's it's that too but there's the flip side to it which is that also power corrupts and corrupts like like we can be good we can be bad you give us this authority to rule over people and we'll end up being bad but i think when you i think when you say we need the state to make sure people are good you're dehumanizing oh absolutely you're like saying that we're kind of like so fucking flawed and this is why i reject the adult child comparison because you're almost look here's the thing that they don't want to look at you go like okay well if we're so flawed you didn't find a different species to put in government that same but people will say this all the time during like a they'll be like oh i'm you know i support the free market and you're like oh really you think everything can be done for profit like no for profit does not incorporate the market there's non-for-profit activities there's charities there's all types of things and there's people there's human beings they they work for many different reasons but then you almost go like do you think the politicians lose this like self-interest profit motive like when they go into government they're like well now i'm a benevolent creature i sit above everybody else and i'm just looking to make rules for what's best for society no they're the same fucking person but now they're exercising authority wow you know so that's that's the point i got you it's crazy it's really beautiful i don't think people understand how humanistic and how like it's really interesting and it's look i'll say for me personally for anybody like it took me a while to be convinced of this i was a libertarian way before i was an anarchist i read about it a lot so i'm i understand where people have their objections or their how would this work their question i try to take on all of it and again if if there is like even when you said like what if someone thinks of a different you know economic system that i'm very open to that there's there's people out there a lot smarter than me who who might figure something else out and if i'm presented with new information i'll be like oh okay maybe that works better it is disgusting to think that the state has gotten in our heads so deeply oh yeah that we think we need them for us to be ethical oh dude can i tell you one one thing on this that i'm just gonna close because i think this is so great tom woods who's like my hero this brilliant historian it's got a great show the tom woods show out there he made this example and i always use this analogy because it's so brilliant but he goes let's imagine uh because when you're saying the state has this like brainwashed he goes let's imagine uh just for a second that walmart ran all the schools he goes let's say walmart ran all the schools and and they would do your kids had to go it's a rule they force you you got to go to school you got to contribute to it walmart runs the school they get your kids and uh the first thing they have them do when they come in is take a pledge to walmart uh they pledge their allegiance to walmart and then you have uh like all around the school picture are all the pictures of all the first ceo's of walmart and they're like the first they just these ridiculous lies that we know are bullshit like they go the first walmart ceo never told the lie he chopped down a cherry tree and this is and then if the population came out with like a pro walmart bias would we not sit back and go you know this is kind of fucking sick like this is insane and that's why they want to control the schools who said that who said tom woods brilliant historian god damn it man that is so true that's why they want it oh my fucking and i think that's why more people don't come out questioning the government i pledge allegiance to the flag of the united states of walmart and to the great walmarts wherever they the fourth he was the the ceo was the great emancipator and then this guy was the great this and ever and then you look back at the history and you're like oh that guy was a fucking creep that wasn't a great emancipator at all dude i hope if you drive a car it's a fucking early model but they're gonna fucking slam you into a tree what's his name again what was that guy's name michael uh fucking uh god if michael uh is a hasty michael

150^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - JOAN HALIFAX and RAGHU MARKUS Transcript and Discussion^2015-05-04^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, my dear sweet friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast, and I am recording from the Ram Dass retreat in Maui, which means that right now I'm kind of a metaphysical drooling mess right now. I'm completely baked on everybody's good vibe. I feel high as a kite. These are retreats. You get weird, teary moments, and the whole thing just blasts you open. It's really, really intense, and I'm realizing that it's kind of tough to record an intro to a podcast in this kind of weird state, which feels like I've been given a combination of all of my favorite psychedelics at once, and I just sort of want to ooze into the carpet and transform into the entire universe and float away. That's kind of how you feel. Also, the ocean is outside, and it's filled with beautiful fishies that I want to look at out there as I snorkel, and also I've had these incredible moments during the retreat where I feel as though I've just merged into everything, and it's just an odd feeling, and it's weird to record a podcast in this state of consciousness. I feel like it would be better for me to just come down a little bit from the weird spiritual buzz I'm getting from this thing than to record this intro, but I feel like I've got to do it, and here's why. One of our guests today, Roshi Joan Halifax, who is an incredible human being. She is a Zen Roshi. She runs a Zen Center called Upaya, and she was married to this kind of infamous psychiatrist named Stan Groff, and they used to administer LSD to dying people to help them understand that death doesn't necessarily mean an extinction, but is rather a phase shift. So she's obviously a very intense person, and she's an activist, and she has a lot of ties in Nepal. So I'm not gonna do any commercials for this podcast, but I am going to ask you guys, if you feel compelled to do so, to go to Upaya.org, that's U-P-A-Y-A.org, and click on the Nepal Earthquake Relief Fund, and let's embody what the folks over at Singularity University are trying to do, which is let's use the technology of podcasting and the internet and social networking to actually beam money in the direction of folks who just experienced the geologic equivalent of an atom bomb going off underneath their villages and temples and homes, and let's just do it. I know you guys can do it, I know you will do it, you don't have to do it, and you shouldn't feel guilty if you can't or just don't wanna do it, but if there's any kind of inkling of a desire to actually help those folks over there, and you've been hesitating to do it because you've heard how many, many charities aren't actually run by human beings, but are run by monsters who, instead of allocating the funds that they get from people who are donating to the cause, to help folks, they use that money to buy cocaine enemas, which they spray into themselves and dance the night away at nightclubs, I get it, we're all a little skeptical when it comes to any kind of fund or any kind of donation thing. I certainly have been, my God, the stories that you hear about these vicious demons who instead of using the cash, this is not the kind of thing that you see when you're laying in your hotel room and you're baked and you're watching that nefarious weirdo standing next to a child and pretending that he's actually helping him. This is the real deal, I've met Roshi Joan, she's been working with folks in Nepal for a really long time. She's got a network over there of people who are actually able to get water filters, tarps, and rice to people who desperately need it right now. My God, I'm doing a telethon, I'm so sorry, but really, you know, we have this sad window of opportunity right now, which is this space, the most critical space after a disaster hits and a lot of people have died and there's not access to clean water, then a lot of diseases can start breaking out and a lot of awful things can happen and Roshi Joan is working really hard right now. I don't think she's sleeping actually, just to try to get resources over there. So if you feel like it, go to upaya.org, that's U-P-A-Y-A.org and send some green energy in the direction of the folks in Nepal who need your help so much. I'm at a meditation retreat. I'm allowed to do this kind of stuff, while I'm at a meditation retreat, but I still hope you will forgive me. And also, before we get going with this podcast, I wanna thank everybody who came out to the live shows. It was such a blast. Thank you guys, it was great meeting you and I'm gonna be doing many more of them and I hope that you will return. So, without further ado, if you will please open your heart chakras, ascend to the, out of the confines of your ego, merge into the universal whole and blast is not the universal whole, but the W-H-O-L-E and blast as much love energy as you possibly can in the direction of today's guests. Ragu Marcus, who you've definitely heard on the podcast before, he runs the Love Server member foundation. He's got his own podcast called Mind Rolling. You can find that over at MindPod.net, which is the spirituality podcast network that he has helped organize. And there's a lot of great podcasts over there with Ramda, Sharon Salzburg, Roshi Joan, Krishna Das. Go check it out if you want a nice blast of philosophy or spirituality. And also please welcome to the podcast, Roshi Joan Halifax. If you like her and you get a good vibe from her, which I certainly have, and you feel like going to an actual retreat, she's gonna be doing one May 22nd through the 25th at Upaya in Santa Fe, New Mexico. So, go to that retreat. These retreats are the real deal, man. I don't know why they work, but they definitely work. And it's really fun and intense. And if you're around that area, you just feel like doing something outside of your comfort zone. It's a great thing to do. Okay, everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trustle Family Hour podcast, Ragu Marcus and Roshi Joan Halifax. 수록 Rw Marcus Rw Marcus Rw Marcus Rw Marcus Rw Marcus Rw Marcus We're rolling and we're, we're mind-rolling and we're Duncan Trussell-ing. Family-arring. Yeah, something like that. Here with Roshi Joan Halifax, who, Duncan, did you, you heard Duncan this morning when he, when he was with Ramdus? You're really, really cute. Thank you. Really cute. And he said, the first thing he said was, I am so scared standing up here with you. Yes. And, of course, Ramdus put a pin in that right away, right? Yes, he did. Yeah. So Roshi, Roshi, I've had two people in my life that were, well, the first one, to give you an idea, the first person was a man named Casey Tuari, who, if you watch the films of Maharaj, named Karoli Bama, you'll see he is, he was one for us, Maharaj would look at him, and bang, he'd go into a deep samadhi of some sort. Right? And he, if you'll remember this, Mr. Natural, the comic. Oh, yeah. Okay. Do you know Mr. Natural? Yes, I do. Oh, my God. R. Crumb. Yeah. By the way, R. Crumb. Get him. He was exactly like Mr. Natural. Every moment it was about awareness. I mean, he was one of Maharaj's closest devotees. But if he wasn't a Buddhist, I don't know who was. I mean, he was a Shavite in the Hindu thing. But his whole thing with us was about being present. And he would remind us all the time, like in the cartoon, Mr. Natural, he would say one thing or another. If you think you're doing this, my boy, you're lost. Say things like that. Second person in my life like this, who I discovered later in life, is Roshi. Oh, no, who's that? So you're coming here because Roshi never does anything. No bullshit ever, no matter what the situation. No trying to make nice. Right. And she has, and we've gotten to know each other way better than the last couple of years only, a few years, through Ramdas. And I'm so highly appreciative of you. And I'm telling this sincerely of what you mean and your work and so on and so forth. I don't want to appear too dramatic. No, please don't. But so he's coming along and he does stuff way worse than me. And wait at least I can tell you about it. He does. He's like, what? Like unworthiness stuff. Oh, well, I think that, you know, I think it's important to, I mean, I know ultimately there's no hierarchy, right? There's no hierarchy. Ultimately, everything's one all one. But in some way, there has to be a hierarchy. And there should be a, isn't in Zen, you are a Roshi. In Zen, Buddhism is systematically hierarchical in the way that it's structured, isn't it? Absolutely. And I am definitely on the bottom of the pile. Oh, really? You don't seem like it. Oh, really? Well, what do you mean by that? I mean that when I've been listening to your wonderful talks, it feels like I am witnessing the thing that they call Dharma transmission and the idea that you, I feel like you are in what they call a lineage or a spiritual bloodline. And when you were talking, I can, I feel like that's coming out of you. So wherever that is, as far as hierarchy goes, it feels like it feels to me as though I'm not just listening to you, but I'm listening to your teachers and their teachers, and it's coming out and it creates a very psychedelic feeling in me and I think the people listening. So I guess that's it. Oh, good, good. Yeah, I do feel like I have a lot of men holding my back and it's about time some women stepped into the line or got dragged into the line. It's kind of interesting. You look at my lineage chart and you see, oh, this is kind of fascinating. There's 81 guys behind me. So one of the things that you get a very strong feeling about is the gender bias and formal religion. And we're in a phase shift now and with that is a lot more lateralization. Things are a little more equal. Right, yes, for sure. And I know that Zen, along with all other organized religious structures, mostly have been patriarchal up until this point. And there seems to be everything's kind of shifting in that way. But it seems like the thing that's coming out of you is way outside of gender. It's way outside of everything. And I was wondering if I could get you to repeat that evening prayer that you did. No, yeah. Yeah, that's wonderful. So the prayer, if you will, it has two parts. And the first part of it are the four vows that are the bodhisattva vows. And they're impossible assignments. And as such, then very liberating. And so the first one goes, creations are numberless, I vow to free them. And this is about everything. This is every ant who's suffering, every ahi and mahi mahi, if you will, like it's served for lunch, but also every creation of the mind. And there's this vow that you take in every breath to liberate all beings, including the internal beings, which are the thoughts and the feelings and the sensations. So it's a very, for me, functional vow, because it points right to the big assignment, free, free. And then the second is delusions are inexhaustible. And boy, do we ever know that. I vow to transform them. And what's interesting about that vow in the Chinese, actually, it goes, I vow to end them all. But as a woman, I'm a little bit more pragmatic. I want to, it's like my assignment is to kind of get in there and to sort of work with things. Oh, you changed it. Yeah, I know. It's bad. I loved it. Yeah. No, I love that. That's so much better. Yes, no, that makes so much more sense, too. So much more pragmatic. Well, my own teacher, one of my own teachers, but really my favorite is Glassman Roshi. And he really objected to that particular translation. It's not a translation. It's an adaptation. I personally think that these vows need to be made relevant. They're not like antiquarian vows. This is about now. And so when we first used the word transform, he was kind of objective. And then we're persistent and consistent. And he actually has adopted it, which makes me feel slightly victorious. But never mind. Oh, yeah, Bernie Glassman Roshi. Oh, you said Bernie Glassman. Oh, I didn't hear that. Bernie Glassman. Yeah, is he alive? He's alive so far, as alive as we are. Yeah, of course. And then the next one is very beautiful. Reality is boundless. And then you're invoked, I vow to perceive it. And that's like the whole assignment. I mean, can you really see things clearly? And then the awakened way is unsurpassable. Then I vow to embody it. And that's like, now I'm not going to just think about it. I'm not going to just pray about it. I'm going to embody it. So one of the cool things about Zen is how directed toward the body it is. It's understanding that our bodies are actually conditioning our mind. And then it's a two-way street, the mind conditions. The body, too. And the mind is embedded in the body. And the body carries the mind. But here, this is to like, I vow to walk the talk. Right. And then there is the. Then there is what's called the evening gata. And that goes. And I don't always do it, because it's usually done at the end of the day. So the last thing that is transmitted to you at the end of the day are these words. And they're scary as hell. And it is, life and death are of supreme importance. Time passes swiftly, and opportunity is lost. And then let us awaken, awaken. Do not squander your life. Ooh. It's great. You know, that's like the assignment. And you say that every night. Every. Well, when we're in intensive retreat, and I say it on the night of retreats that I'm leading, because, you know, I think you can spend a little bit of time considering, we don't know when we're going to die. That's right. We could be young, or we could get to be really, really old. But don't squander it. Use your life as a vehicle for awakening for all beings. So that's, you know, not everybody has that sense of urgency. And my sense of urgency might have come out of my, you know, childhood being really sick, and being born during the Second World War, and then being a young person in civil rights and anti-war movement. But also in the middle of that urgency is a kind of stillness. So, you know, they're sort of working two sides of the street. You know, one side of the street has this sort of ferocious energy. And the other side is this deep quiet inside that comes from confidence that, you know, everything is characterized by impermanence. Everything is transitory. And who knows what's going to happen the next minute? And why not be an ally to uncertainty? And you are truly walking the wall. Because at this moment, when I came here to record the podcast, and we came here to record the podcast, I could hear you in the other room. And I'm not positive what you're talking about. I wasn't eavesdropping. But I know that you are right now in the midst of doing this retreat, which seems to me, even though I'm sure it's not for you, like it would be an incredibly stressful thing to every single day have to guide a group of people who've flown from all over the planet wanting something, who are, and a lot of them are going through some heavy duty stuff. I imagine that we would feel like a very great weight to me. But on top of that, one ball that you're juggling, you're also doing everything you can to try to help the earthquake-stricken people in Nepal. So in your spare time, instead of doing what I would do, which would be to watch forensic files, you're working nonstop to help people in a distant part of the world. Can you talk a little bit about that? You know, it's more fun than watching forensic files. Everything really sounds horrible, quite frankly. I just have this real connection with Nepal. And I've had it for decades. And the people are incredibly resilient. And this earthquake is an enormous catastrophe. And each of us, if we just do a little bit, that's grace. I can't do more than a little bit. But in the last 24 hours, we managed to be part of a thinking, doing team that has put together hundreds of water filtration systems in a place where color was going to be a big threat, because there's no clean water. In the Kathmandu Valley, it's hardly clean water there anyway. But right now, we saw all the systems down and out. And we're now looking at how can we get a half a million dollars worth of tarps into the outlying areas. And so it's just my assistant, Nova, calls it parallel processing. You know, it's a whole bunch of people feeling this and thinking together, and strategizing, and one coming up with an idea, and another one making that idea a little bit better, and a third one seeing the solution, and then us collaborating. And I think it's a fantastic process. And one of the things that's really helping this whole process in Nepal is our social platforms. I mean, more information has gone down on Facebook than on CNN with regards to what is really happening. I can't get any emails going between here in Nepal, or very, very few. But in terms of Facebook messaging, wow. My Facebook message hopper is just flooded with messages of, you know, this is needed, that's needed, this is how we do it, and so forth. So it's, and a tremendous amount of information is being posted at this point by people in Nepal. Unfortunately, I have a lot of friends in Nepal on my Facebook page. So, you know, they're posting, in some cases, minute by minute, what's happening. Can you talk a little bit about what the situation on the ground is like over there so that people listening can understand just how severe the situation is in case, because amazingly, some people that I've spoken with are not even aware that an earthquake has happened weirdly. Well, they should, you know, they should, you know, get a little behind the program. It's possible. My gosh. Well, let me say one of the really cool things that's happening. There's a big gap between the aid that the government, the Nepali government is really obligated to provide and what's going down on the ground. And so what's happening is young people are self-organizing and they're, you know, getting their trucks and they're buying rice with what, you know, money they have and they're delivering rice and tarps and fresh water out to outlying villages. And what I really love is that what you're seeing, you're also seeing frustration and there've been some, you know, protest events and things like that. But what I really am seeing is the heart of Nepali people. There's an immense resilience in that country. And that resilience has, you know, been in the face of 12 years of civil war, no infrastructure that's any good in that country or very little that's any good. And yet the people just have some kind of directness and joy and lack of neurosis. And I really go every year to Nepal as a kind of psychological cure from Western culture. I mean, you know, we go with our nomads clinic, which is organized through UPIA Zen Center and I've been doing it since 1980, but it's just incredibly beneficial for Westerners to be with people who are so, you know, unbelievably powerful something like this, which is tragic, which is hyper-traumatic, stressful, is something that they will get past and they'll rebuild. What I feel we have to do right now is take care of kind of on the ground practical things like water filtration and tarps because monsoon looks like it's coming early. And that's just, it's a mess. Hundreds of thousands of homes have been completely demolished in this earthquake. So, you know, we have a lot of... Hundreds of thousands. Right. You know, these are mud and stone homes. But these are homes. They're homes. Yeah. And that's the thing, you know, that when those, you know, when I think about, because it's so, it really is, the news can accidentally turn you into a sociopath because the numbers are so big, when you hear possibly 5,000, maybe 10,000 people have died, you're, you have, it's hard to have a real reaction to that number because you only know, how many people do you know in your life? How many people do you know? You know, there's this thing, Dunbar's number, have you ever heard of that? Dunbar's number is the maximum number of social connections a person can theoretically have in their mind. And it's... 150. That's it. 150. I remember now. 150. What number? 150. So I don't think I know 150 people. And maybe I, I mean, I know many, many people, but how many people do you know that you talk with on the phone? It's what, 30, 20? And so then when you think, oh, 10,000. For you, it's different. No, for you, Duncan, I think it's different, frankly. And I think also for you, Ragu, you guys are, you know, working the public arena in Incredibus. I just mean, when you hear, so when you hear 10,000 people, you're hearing about 10,000 mini-apocalypse that have happened. You're hearing about holes in families that will never be healed. Brothers and sisters have just gone. And not only are you left without, your home is crumbled and you have nothing, but possibly your entire family is gone. So when you consider that that's the reality of the situation over there, that fills you with a kind of feeling that you get when you do the first vow, which is, well, I can't do a thing. It's just too much to bear. I'm not going to deal with this at all. That's for, I think a lot of people feel like that. And then people like you are like, no, we're getting them tarps. We'll just get them tarps. We'll get them water filters and tarps. I think that's the coolest thing ever. You know, futility is a kind of stupid thing, but a lot of people suffer from it. And, you know, I actually am not in the favor, in favor of futility, but there's something more. And that is that those of us who've been to Nepal often return again and again, why? Because the people have a kind of special spirit which exists in few places in the world. And I think that's what we're seeing in the midst of tragedy, what you're seeing is dignity, determination and love. And that's, you know, you're drawn into that. You're not drawn into despair. You're drawn, you're inspired. And I think that's why there's been such an extraordinary response at the sort of public in general level to what's happening in Nepal. Because so many of us have been over there, even if only one time you still have the same feeling. This is one of those treasures in the world, not just the architectural and historical treasure. It's the treasure of the Nepali heart. And then you see, you know, all of this work that's going on as it will become more and more apparent through time at the sort of grassroots level. Instead of the grassroots level just sort of caving, giving up, drying up, the grassroots level is really energized by service. And what I'm seeing is the younger generation really stepping into the gap. And I love it. It's, well, you know, when you were talking this morning about Facebook and what's happening through Facebook, I was wondering if you were familiar with Kurzweil at all, with Ray Kurzweil and that concept of the accelerating returns and how technology has the potential not just for to destroy the planet, which a lot of people are worried about, but also to heal things in a way that has never been possible before. Yeah, I completely agree. I think Ray Kurzweil has fantastic ideas. And I think that Nepal is a very interesting and moving example of how social media is actually as has in other situations, social media is providing the platform for people to find each other, but also find themselves. I want to switch gears. OK. We're at this retreat. And you just told that lovely coin, that lovely story. There's two of them in the first one around the tree. Would you mind telling that again? And then to the podcast audience. Before that story, I'm sorry, can I please get, just could you say the link really quick? If I don't mean to turn this into some kind of telethon or something, but it is imminent what's happening. And if you could just say that link really quick, so that if people want to chip in to help you get some parts over there. So if you can, if you will, I would really appreciate it. It's www.upiah.org. And you'll see the banner. And there's a photograph of me, a child who's been badly burned, but who's been bandaged by clinicians that are nomads clinic. And you'll see a link immediately to be able to donate to the earthquake relief fund. And up is UP. UPAYA. .com. .org. .org. .org. www.upaya.org. I'll have links in my website. And you'll have links and they'll be on Mind Pud Network too. Thanks. Thanks guys. Thank you. Tell us. Well, you know, this is called Kyoge's Man in a Tree. And I'm particularly fond of this koan because koans are these public cases, these little zen stories that are about the nature of our mind and not just the nature of mine, but the nature of one's mind in both the sense of emptiness and the relative aspect. And what is so wonderful for me about this koan is, you know, Western culture, we're so damn solution oriented. We've got an answer for every question. We've got a solution for every problem. And can you basically hang out and not knowing? So I already gave you, you know, the big secret right there. And I had to really smile yesterday because, you know, these are audience, the audience here in Ram Dass is retreat. It's all love, serve, remember, and serve is all solution oriented. And so everybody had a good idea, but it wasn't the right one. But never mind. So it goes like this. There's a man hanging in a tree by his teeth being wrapped around a branch. His feet can't touch the tree. His hands can't touch the tree. He's just hanging there. Underneath him walks another man, and that man said, hey, why does Bodhidharma come from the West? You could say why does Bob Ram Dass come from the West, but it's Bodhidharma. Now, if the man opens his mouth to answer, he falls to his death. But if he doesn't open his mouth to say anything, he doesn't help the other guy. End of case, you know? It's infuriating. It is infuriating. It's infuriating. And it's not just that you're teaching in the best way possible, it creates this very specific feeling that drives you crazy. And do you know what I mean? And I'm going to have to think. Good. I thought I was driving you sane. I think so. But it's that you're saying here, this is an answer-less thing, and you can let your mind whirl around all you want, but you're not going to find a solution. But then the first day you were talking about how, we're always wanting to know what's going to happen next. And you called it radical insecurity. I felt like when you're at the chiropractor, when you said that, and someone cracks your back, when you said that. Because that feeling of insecurity, I try to escape from that. I would say 80% of my calories are being burnt, trying to escape that feeling. Well, that's a very low percentage, considering the average is much higher. Just shows you how awake you are. All right. But can you talk a little bit about this? This radical insecurity, how that feeling of I don't know what's going to happen, and I'm losing it, is actually something perhaps not to be avoided? Well, I think the earthquake in Nepal is a perfect example. There are all kinds of predictions that an earthquake was going to happen, but they didn't know what was going to happen noon last Saturday. You just don't know, and your life could end in a moment. But my first send teacher was this amazing and very funny Korean named Sung-Sang, Sung-Sang Sun-Sanim. And Sun-Sanim used to say things like, only keep don't know mind. You know, only keep don't know mind. And I actually thought it was like a Chinese fortune cookie. That was kind of, well, that's kind of stupid, except that here it is 40 years later. And I'm still saying it, and I'm kind of beginning to resonate with what he means. And that is this mind that is Sasuke Roshi called a beginner's mind. And it's that mind that is really fresh. It's not caught in hyper-conceptuality. It's not seeking solutions. It's super in the be here now-ness of it. And that's just so incredibly powerful. It's not to say that the past isn't in the present. And the future isn't right here. But it's also to have this kind of radiance of this is what is right now. And any place other than where we are right in this now, which includes the past and the future, will be also shaded or shadowed by fear. So, you know, that's a really. So my thing is working with dying people and psychedelics and then years ago and the kind of work that I've done in the prison system and then just, you know, working as his end teacher, you're always in the state of radical uncertainty. You never know what's going to happen with any student, anything. I kind of love to say, you know, open up to get the students talking because that's when I'm kind of most alive. I feel like, wow, that's really interesting. Gee, that was a really good point. And that was so stupid, you know. But those are just opinions. But it is this sense of not knowing what Bernie Glassman Roshi talks about, not knowing. And there's a wonderful line from Nicole on that goes, not knowing is most intimate. I mean, our no mind, our knowing mind separates us from each other in this moment. So it's a really, I think it's a really cool thing. I want to get back to the colon, though. Oh, I didn't know you had left it. Oh, I have never left it. I'll care about you. Well, I'm going to represent the love and lighters. Trump or Rinpoche used to call us love and lighters. And you still do. And I'm not even Jewish, and I can say oy. Yeah. So representing the love and lighters from that Coan thing, right? All right, you tell me. OK, so this is completely, and it's are typically that I, when you said, right? OK, now, what is it that you experience in this colon? What what can you identify your initial thing, right? Whatever you said. You ready? I'm listening. I'm all ears. Christ. OK, what do you mean? He that there is nothing else but to give yourself completely up under any circumstances. So what would that look like? So that would be him letting go, I guess, of the tree, right? I know. OK, now I need you to dissect it. I'm not going to dissect it. That's your trip. I have no idea. They have some kind of idea about it. But that's an interesting idea. You know, Christ didn't exactly let go of the tree. He was nailed on to it. So excuse me. He probably wouldn't wish he could have. No, that's the point. He let himself be nailed to the tree, right? He let that happen. Weren't you brought up Christian, Roshi? I mean. Don't blame me for something I couldn't avoid. OK, no. OK, honestly. And then take it further that the whole thing for us, Christ and Hanuman, the same energy of complete, utter devotion to service. You know, this day I shared a perspective which was a little bit different. And it's kind of interesting because the ego can get involved in devotion. There's the self and there's the other. There's the object of devotion. And then you're all this wonderful kind of Christ energy or Hanuman energy or Bodhisattva madly running around saving all sentient beings from suffering. But there's a very deep image in Zen that I think is kind of interesting. And that is instead of Hanuman, right, that feeling, it's actually of a wooden puppet. And what is pulling the strings of the puppet, suffering. And so there's no self there. There's no idea there. There's not even will or desire. So at the very deepest level, there's no self to be devoted. There's no nothing to be devoted to. You're just responding seamlessly to the world of suffering as it is without any reference. And that's a really interesting image, I feel. I mean, it's kind of when I find myself involved in self-conscious altruism instead of altruism, which is principled and healthy and where there's really no self and other. Even though the word altruism presumes other, but somehow this self-other distinction drops away. Then there's no way I can be tired. Just this I'm responding to, that I'm responding to. I'm in this seamless relationship with the world as it is, including the world of suffering and the world of joy. So the wood puppet's really kind of an interesting. But people don't like it because it's not the monkey god. It's like, no way. It's not the beautiful long-haired blue-eyed Christ. And it's also not the monkey god. It's a wooden puppet, which is a kind of dead thing. And that deadness is an example. There's no devotion. There's no not devotion. It's an example of fundamental unconditional equanimity. It's just that openness to things as they are. But I love the love stuff. I mean, don't let me discourage anybody from devotion or love. See, there's those of us that we have no chance at all. We don't have the discipline. We can't sit with our back straight and our front soft very well. Oh, please, Raku. This is amazing. You know what I feel like? I feel like I'm watching a very sweet parent telling their child that there's no Santa Claus. And then being like, but it's OK if you still want to believe in Santa Claus. It's just not real. And that's what I love about Buddhism is because it does because here's some, even though I wait, wait, before you get into this, I have been now the children. That what Roshi is talking about, I experienced in another being a complete, absolute emptiness of anything. And as Rob does said today, when I met Maharanjanin Karolibaba, I saw him as something for humans to look to as a possibility to be. So. See, I think Neem Karolibaba is more like a Buddhist or a Buddha than almost any other of the spiritual teachers that I've read about, heard about, or encountered who are not Buddhist per se. I mean, you know, he wasn't looking for devotion. Now, there were tons of people attracting massive amounts of it. People were going to transcend his presence and people have created a whole religious movement out of him. But actually go that far religious movement. Well, I don't know. I think, you know, I think R.D. is head of the club. He's the clubmeister. But, you know, he wasn't looking to do that. There was no self in there, you know, trying to magnetize people to do anything. You know, he's as far as I could tell from just listening to you guys, mostly guys, some women. But in listening to you talk over these years is this was a very empty dude. Yeah. And in that you did a workshop some time ago with Frank Dostososky and Brahmedos, and he went into that space. And you commented on it afterwards, because in that space of completely feeling that total love that he experienced back then, in this moment, he said he's just so empty, so empty. And that was the essence. And do you know that one day, Krishna Das and I went to see Maharaj and a lot of stuff happened. I won't get into it because it's a long story. But at one point, Krishna Das had a book. He'd keep stuff in the diary. He had it with him. And in it, he had written some of the Mahamudra. He just wrote some of the verses down. And then next page, he had a picture of Maharaj. It was that kind of a thing. Maharaj, he says, show me that. He takes the book and he had to translate it. Teak, he went right to the Mahamudra, song of the Mahamudra. He flipped the page over and he saw a picture of himself that Krishna Das had put in. He just, he said, who's that? He was always playing with little kids. You, Maharaj, nay, Buddha. More than once did he do that. And not only that, he's, I mean, this isn't that. He meant he was Buddha, but it was a complete. You're expressing, yeah, no, that's not. Because you can't hear it for the podcast, but you're expressing some skepticism in regards to that claim. No, I mean, I- No, it wasn't a claim that he was a living Buddha. It was absolutely taking us, what you're saying, exactly beyond anything of him being Hindu or only giving Hindu teachings. Of course, he talked about Christ. Buddha just means awake. Yeah, right. Just, you know, he's saying, I'm awake. That's what the Buddha said, by the way. I'm awake. But he's just saying awake and not the historical Buddha. And we don't want, you know, and I think that's the, that's freedom. And I feel like, you know, in his sort of sleepy way, because, you know, I always see Neem Kohli Babi's, you know, doing sort of supine. And there he's got his little Linus blanket. And, you know, he's there with his little sleeping, you know, and it's a, and, but he's actually in the paradox. He's like super awake. Right, that's exactly what it was exactly, being in that presence. But it's, you know, he's so let go. It's like he was in the cradle and totally in beginner's mind. But, you know, it's the empty feeling. That's how I always, you know, I'd look at his eyes and I realized, you know, the thing that I feel, even looking at Neem Kohli Babi's picture is, I feel that he sees who I really am, which is not a devotee. That he's perceiving my emptiness from his emptiness. All right, well, that's what it all is in terms of reflection of these beings too. So I look at, you know, devotion in a certain way as a beautiful intermediate stage, you know, that evocation needs an object of love. And that evocation, the feeling of evocation of other, you know, allows love to flow, but then as love matures, then in a way it empties out completely into the boundless. But maybe you've done another billion lives or something. You're already at that doorstep. I don't think so. It is interesting though that, because I, you know, the last podcast we did with Ram Dass, it was so funny to me because you, you both seem to really disagree on this point. And you both seem to disagree, even though there's the way that you disagree is very respectful and very open-minded. I don't disagree anything that you just said at all. I'm not trying to stir anything up here, but it does feel like when you say an intermediary stage. So you have the bhakti. You have the object, you know, this is some form of bhakti. Here is the object that you love. Here is the lover. You have these two things. There is a duality, there is a duality here. And with what you seem to be talking about, and I only know it from reading books and maybe a couple of acid trips, is this idea of, well, more than a couple of acid trips, but I've had more, but a couple of good ones. What you're talking, what this thing that you're pointing to is just this one thing. And you can't have in this one thing an object of devotion. And you can't have the moment that that happens, the one thing is now two things. And then the two things become a trillion things. And the trillion things become a trillion things. And the whole thing breaks apart. So when you say intermediary, it feels like you're saying, or intermediate. Intermediate. Yeah. At some point that has to go. But I also, you know, I can disagree with myself, which I enjoy doing. And that is that this experience of what Sukhni Mubashayik calls juicy love is incredibly healing. You know, it's just, it's not what he calls greasy love. You know, this kind of syrupy, sappy thing. It's more greasy, greasy love. Greasy love. Yeah, this is juicy love. And that, you know, the trap, of course, of emptiness or the trap of boundlessness is just being so spaced out that nothing matters. And that it's really important to have both. You know, I mean, I think juicy love is really important. I think it's incredibly healing. I think that also it takes you into this experience of absolute connection. I think having a yidam, having an object of devotion, which actually reflects your own Buddha nature back to you is a fantastic thing. It's a upaya. It's a device to point to something that is beyond language, beyond words. So you've contradicted yourself. Yeah, I enjoy that. Not really, but. Not really. And because you also say, I come to every winter, I come to see Ramdots for a heart transplant. You're not supposed to say that in public. Really? I don't, we don't. Of course, Roshi is perfectly fine, everybody. This is no reflection on that. I know I wrote a friend of mine who's had actually some cardiac problems. I said, you know, dear so-and-so, I'm here in Maui having a heart transplant. And he wrote back in about a half a second, are you okay? What's going on? No, it's more, you know, it's, it has to do for me with metta, loving kindness, you know, hanging out with people where there's a lot of joy, where there's a lot of acceptance, where there's trust is very wonderful. It's like nourishing the human psyche. Now, Arti would call it soul. We won't get into that discussion, please. But anyway. We should, we should. I mean, I've been meaning to ask you this for a long time. No, no, no. Remember that podcast where Ramdots, because Ramdots says this is the funniest thing ever and your interaction with the way you two interact is so fun to watch. But Ramdots said, this is, remember he said, this is my fantasy. You know, in the midst of this, because we were talking about the soul and I could see, you know, it's easy to see what you think as far as that goes. And he's like, well, that's my fantasy. And you go, finally, after all these years, I get you to admit it. And I think it's cool. I think it's, I don't think you have to tiptoe around the fact that maybe there isn't a soul. And I think that the idea that there is a soul or whatever that is, is sometimes I like that idea and I enjoy the idea. But sometimes I think this is a teddy bear. This is an imaginary friend. This is like my pacifier when I was a kid. You know what, look, I'm being serious though. No, no, we're being serious. Oh, we are? Yeah. I don't think this, he has that as a nomenclature soul. But ultimately, I don't think he thinks it's any different than Buddha mind. So, you know, I have a different idea, but it's just another idea. I actually wrote about it in this book I wrote years ago called The Fruitful Darkness. And for me, the principle of soul, and this really comes out of the fact that I'm from the South. And was, you know, fortunately able to be nourished by people who are not from my immediate community. And when people in this other community that I cherished would talk about soul, they weren't talking about some kind of monad that's sitting inside of you, a little, you know, happy homunculus, if you will. Happy what? A happy homunculus, you know, your little soul that's gonna go tripping out of your whatever. But it has to do with some kind of connectivity with your, you know, your deep heart. So when you say, my God, that person's got soul, you know, you know what they're talking about, because you can look in that person's eyes and you can see right to their essence. So that's what I feel is, you know, really important. That kind of, you know, immediate powerful transparency, which is characterized also by love. Right, right, because who knows what soul is and who knows what Buddha-mind is. I'm so glad you're saying this, Raghu, you know. I've had this, you know, he publicly humiliated me so many times, you know, he says, well, you know, Jones, you know, Joe Jones, you know, and then he smiles, he flashes those teeth at me, you know, those kind of that dragon mouth and I'm like, thanks a lot. You know, I'm gonna look like a bad person if we continue this conversation. He says soul and then he goes like this. Oh, he knows that we like to tease each other, mercilessly, we don't know anything. Right. That's the bottom line. That's it. Not knowing is most intimate. And in the podcast that, when you first met Roshi at that retreat a couple of years ago, and then we sat around the table and there was a beautiful reference which was making friends with the mystery from Roshi. And that has stuck with me. And I think that that is so essential for us to be able to make friends with the mystery. What a relief. It's such a burden to have to worry your mind over the idea that God is a monkey or that God is some beautiful hippie with washboard abs or that God is any, it's really kind of a bummer. You know what, it's a bit of a bummer. If it really boils down to it or that's it, really God's got washboard abs and that's it, that's it. It's such more of a relief if it's something you have no idea what it is. There's something much more exciting about that, isn't it? The question mark is a wonderful thing to worship. So this is the essence of Kylgan's man in a tree back to the koan. Exactly. How can you just hang there in not knowing? How can you really be a friend to uncertainty? Why do you always seek a solution as a reference point? So it's such a, I mean, I've actually shared that koan with a number of different people in various teachings. And everybody goes for the solution because they need some kind of safe toehold. They need a place to kind of put their flag, but actually it's about groundlessness. It's your feet can't really land on anything. And I like it a lot. Oh, that's so good. It's wonderful. We are at 49 minutes. Oh, okay. So this is it. It's over her Roshi's commitment. Thank you so much for this. Thank you. We have to say, please do go to opiah.org and it is a way to directly get, I even said to Roshi, because my other hat is the love server member foundation.

So that is happening, everybody. That is happening. So please do go. And also, Roshi, the last book that you just mentioned, is it still available?

Use offer code Duncan and you'll get 10% off your first order. Hey! Hello my dear sweet darlings, come on into the cave, sit down on that rock over there and let's suck on each other's feet for a while and talk about the universe. You're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast and if this is the first time you've tuned in then you should know that this particular episode is being recorded in a hotel room in Vancouver at the very end of the longest comedy tour that I've ever been on in my life. And you, a first time listener, are probably not aware of the fact that I have some high level connections over at Monsanto and DARPA and my sweet friends over there have actually sent me what's known as an ectoplasmic relaxation coffin. It's not a flotation tank, it's an actual sarcophagus made of a kind of tight night gold that you lay inside of in between shows inside the coffin is a kind of seminal ooze, not quite white, a little rosy pink perhaps. Like, I don't want to say it's like bloody semen because that brings to mind so many horrible industrial accidents and various disasters that would have had to happen for the coffin to be filled with that much bloody semen. And besides, it's a vulgar thing to say. I shouldn't say it and I certainly shouldn't upload it but I don't have time to edit this thing. The point is, I'm laying in a vibratory warm bath of ectoplasm is what the folks over at Monsanto called it. It does smell a lot like what my experience with smelling semen is but they tell me that this is actually ectoplasmic gel from the astral plane that has been pumped in via the udders of some kind of interdimensional goat beings that they keep under the Monsanto building. It's a relaxation gel, that's the point. In fact, I'm laying in it right now. I'm not even using a microphone to record this but tiny nanobots have climbed into my skin and are transmitting telepathically everything that I'm thinking into this recording device. The point is, welcome to the podcast. I'm glad you're here. We have a wonderful episode today. It was recorded on a bus in St. Louis, a city which seems to be on the precipice of beginning the race war that Charles Manson dreamed about so much. If you want a taste of George Orwell's 1984 mixed in with some of that sweet St. Louis paranoia and fear, head on down to St. Louis and you can really experience Alex Jones's worst nightmare come to life. Cameras everywhere, SWAT teams lurking on the street, invisible ninjas hiding in the tops of buildings, laser sights on you at all times. If you don't have a laser sight on your forehead when you're in St. Louis, then something is probably wrong. It's an exciting episode because comedian Mikey Kampman is my guest and he had just experienced a run-in with one of the tentacles of the dark dragon, the authoritarian, tyrannic force that for whatever reason likes from time to time to emerge into our dimension and suppress the will of the people. It happened right there. We'd been in town for three hours and this happened to Mikey. I'm not gonna give it away, but it's kind of mind-blowing that we live in an era where someone as sweet, as sweet little Mikey Kampman, known as God's angel of comedy, should be harassed and assaulted in such a ferocious and vile way by jack-booted thugs who want nothing more than to enclose this entire planet in the maze of polyurethane checkpoints where they can anytime they get the impetus to shove their clawed reptilian fingers into the buttholes of the innocent. This is the ultimate dream of Satan and you will hear a terrifying story right after some very quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by my lords and ladies over at squarespace.com. You call it the internet, I call it the flesh of God and if your website doesn't look good, if you have a low-grade crap website, then you are like a blemish on the sweet skin of our eternal father and mother, the heavenly ever-present ultra-force that created every single one of us. Your website is a blasphemy and not the good kind of blasphemy and there are good blasphemies. This is why we have the Satanic black mass, a hilarious ritual to try to, for the poor bastards who have had the dark side of dogmatic Christianity shit into their brain holes by terrified people, the black mass is a wonderful opportunity to shake the manacles that you have chained upon yourself because you believe the ghost stories of terrified people. I'm not talking about good blasphemy, I'm talking about bad blasphemies and what's a more horrible blasphemy than starting a business, creating a website and then having the thing look like shit so that anybody who goes to visit your website is immediately shown the truth, which is that in an era where it is so easy to make a website, you have failed in this endeavor, I don't mean to shame you, look, there's something beautiful about all things in this universe. The point is if you're thinking about making a great website, why not go to squarespace.com, use offer code Duncan and you will get 10% off a brand new website. You can transform the blemish that you have, that you can transform that canker, that infected oozing mole on the love handle of God into something beautiful like a wonderful tattoo or some kind of transhumanist glowing LED chip that tells the universe, hey, I love you enough to try to create nice websites. If we look at the sum total of all websites on the internet, then what we are witnessing is what the Egyptians described as what a person encounters upon death, which is that the soul is weighted. They're these scales that the soul gets weighed on and weighted, the soul is weighed on these scales. And if you've been an asshole, if there's more asshole-ness inside of you than love, in other words, if you're heavy with the dense darkness of a selfish life, the scale will tilt in the direction of doom, and I don't know, you get eaten by scarab beetles or something, but the internet, it's very similar. When the machines wake up, when the aliens finally descend from hyperspace, they're gonna use the internet to try to determine whether or not we're a food source or something that they should give blowjobs to. And your website, your shitty, stinky, crappy, lazy, low-grade, 1990s style bullshit website could be the website that tilts the artificial intelligence that's about to emerge from the flesh of God in the direction of destroying all of us and feeding us to its robotic spawn. So do me a favor, go to squarespace.com, try them out, use offer code Duncan, you will get 10% off a brand new beautiful website. Another great way for you to support the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast is to go through our Amazon portal. It's one of the easiest things you could do. And listen, Amazon is fantastic because they have everything that you need. Don't get into the hellish dark river of boredom metal that we call traffic because you wanna buy some toilet paper. Are you kidding me? Don't spend your time risking your life and traffic. If you've not gone to Reddit, Ford slash WTF, if you've not seen the disasters that are happening on our nation's highways, wild dogs jumping out of the backs of trucks, climbing into the mini vans of parents on the way home from basketball games and chewing all of them to bits, do you want that to be you? Imagine that wild dogs leaping into your car as you drive to get toilet paper. That was your last quest. Your last pilgrimage was not to climb to the top of some sacred peak and let one of your tears fall into a grail cup that you could then give to some sick baby so that he or she would be rejuvenated. Your last quest on this earth was to go to a ride aid or a Costco or a Vaan so that you could, because you're out of toilet paper and now wild dogs that have leapt from the back of some laboratory Vaan experimenting with making dogs angry or devouring you and your thought is my God, if only I'd used Duncan's Amazon portal. If I'd only gone through the portal, then I could have had toilet paper delivered to me probably the very next day. And I'm sure there's other stuff in the house I could have used in the meantime is toilet paper and Amazon would have given Duncan a very small percentage of their toilet paper profit. And so I would have contributed to the podcast. Do you want these to be your last thoughts as you're staring down at wild dogs ravaging your bowels that are sprayed all over your car in an awful multicolored spray of red and brown and yellow? No, do you wanna smell your own intestinal tract or the excitement farts of wild dogs as they chew upon you in the awful rush hour traffic of whatever city you live in? No, if you don't want that to happen to you, please go through the portal. It's in the comment section of any of these podcasts. If you go through the portal book market, they will give us a small percentage of anything that you buy. And there's so many wonderful things to buy besides toilet paper. If you're a video gamer, I highly recommend Dark Souls 3. I've never played a more insidious game. This game has grown inside. I dream in the Dark Souls universe now. It's a fantastic game. And if you're more of a spiritual person rather than a video gamer or if you're both, which I like to consider myself and that's an embarrassing thing to be, I guess. But we are what we are, friends. Then check out Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism by Chogium Trumpa. You could order that book on amazon.com. You can get it on Kindle. You can get it on Audible, whatever. We also've got t-shirts, posters. For those of you who didn't get t-shirts for whatever reason on the tour and the first leg of the tour, we went through a t-shirt company that ruined the order so we weren't able to get shirts for the first six shows or so. We are going to have a very limited amount of tour t-shirts available at the shop. I'll let you guys know when those are there. Okay, great. Oh yeah, and one last thing. This is the final leg of the Squarespace You Are God comedy tour and so Vancouver's sold out. Tonight's sold out. Tomorrow I'm gonna be in Seattle. There's some tickets left for that. After that I'm going to be in Portland. The first show is sold out. There's still tickets for the second show and then after that I'm gonna be in San Francisco. The first show is sold out. There's still some tickets for the second show and then finally I'm going to be in L.A. on Sunday. That show is sold out, but I think we just released a few tickets. If you want to come to the show, I really hope that you'll get some tickets in advance Seattle and San Francisco because I guess because the simulator is malfunctioning, a lot of my shows have been selling out and I got a really sad tweet when I was in St. Louis which read, help, the show is sold out, I'm standing outside on LSD. Very sad tweet. What can you do? So anyway, just get tickets in advance. I hope I don't sound manipulative or weird or whatever. Don't get tickets in advance. I don't. I wait till four minutes before I get in the car to go to the airport to buy plane tickets sometimes. I'm a horrible procrastinator. I get it. Okay, there it is. Now everyone please. I hope that you will welcome a very dear friend of mine who came with me on the entire bus part of the Squarespace you are God comedy tour. He was the tour manager, but most importantly, he was the MC of every single show and he's brilliantly funny, an incredible human being who is a co-creator of one of my favorite internet series called two wet crew. Links to that will be in the comments section of this podcast at dunkintrustle.com. Now everybody please welcome to the DTFH, the magnificent Mikey Campman. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands, glory to you blue. Welcome to you. Welcome, welcome. It's been dunkintrustle. Welcome, welcome, welcome. Mikey Campman, welcome back to the dunkintrustle family hour podcast. God bless you for going through this tour with me. You're welcome. It's been absolute joy, truly. Yeah man, this has been one of the most psychedelic, insane, weird. I was just telling you how, are you tired? Because like I'm this kind of tired that I don't think I've ever been before. It's the worst thing that I've ever been. I don't think I've ever been before. It's the weirdest kind of exhaustion mixed in with what must be confusion from always waking up in a new city. Do you feel any of that at all or is it just me? No, it's true. I think we are tired. We had a day off a couple of days ago and just everyone vetched out for 24 hours and just to lie down was a nice thing and not move for a day. And that's when you kind of feel it. But I think it's actually easier to sort of keep when you have movement, it's easier to just keep gliding, moving forward than it is to stop in a way. Yeah, when you stop, it's crazy. When I laid down in that bed, where were we? That was Madison, Wisconsin. Madison. God damn it. When I laid down, it was like falling into a quicksand pit. I just passed out, woke up like three hours later, and I was like, huh, where am I, what? Passed out again. We're so tired. And you don't even realize how tired you are. But it's like, and I hope I don't sound like I'm complaining because it's one of my favorite feelings on Earth. It's a very wonderful kind of exhaustion. It's a fulfilling 24-hour cycle that we live on right now. You wake up every morning in a new place, right? You get up out of bed. And you get up early because you're not only are you doing stand-up on the shows, but you're tour managing. So you've got a job job. So yeah, what is your cycle like? What's your day look like? I'll wake up when I feel the bus has, there's a difference. So I sleep in this little cage on the bus. A literal cage. Next to the trash can beneath the bus in a bay. So I get tucked into bed every night by Duncan, which is really sweet. Well, I want you to have a nice, I mean, it is a cold cage you're in. And I do feel bad. As long as it's not raining on the roads, it's generally pretty good. It's been raining most of the tour. It has been, yes. But I wake up in the morning when I feel the bus is kind of arriving somewhere. And I got to make sure that the parking situation is cool. And talk to English, who's been up all night alone. English is our bus driver. Yes. Who's from England? And we talk and we maybe watch a horse race. And then, yeah, do a little bit of paperwork and then kind of maybe go back to bed or whatever like that. But then so anyway, we wake up in a different place every day. And it's kind of a mystery. You don't know what it is. Every day it's a little different, whether we're on a street side with little activity or we're in a parking lot somewhere or behind a venue. And then we go through our day, whatever it is. I'd say Duncan, you enjoy your sleep. Well, I don't see my problem. So I'm in this like, Mike, you need to do a cage. I'm in a fucking palatial. It is kind of amazing. I'm in like, you're in an adult crib. I'm in an adult crib. It's exactly if you were going to be an adult baby. And I just saw a National Geographic, a fantastic episode on actual adult babies last night. But adult babies, you know that fetish adult babies. So it's like adults who put on pajamas. They lay in a, they have these massive cribs built for them. This guy's found some woman who tends to him like a mother. She reads him stories at night. And it's crazy. It's crazy. But it, but if you were an adult baby, that's what your crib would look like is like flat screen TV, comfortable bed, window looking out at the sky. And, but the problem is I can't fucking sleep after these shows. I'm usually so amped up that I can't get, I don't get to sleep until the bus starts moving. And usually the bus doesn't get going to like four a.m. So I sleep till late because I'm, I'm essentially on a graveyard shift now. But, but you don't get to do that. Cause you got to wake up and handle shit. Yeah. So I also really love travel though. So I do like to kind of see some, some what, some, some of the place that we are, we're in. And if I can see some friends in those places. You have friends everywhere. You're staying in touch with people. You're a shocking human. You are a shocking human. You are a traveler. Everywhere we go, Mikey has clusters of friends. I've never, I don't think I've ever been around someone who has such a massive social network scattered across the country. Everywhere we go and you're, I don't know what your sleep schedule is like, but you're like working man. And you're having great shows too. You're opening up, you're doing really good. Thanks Duncan. It's pretty badass man. It's what you're doing. It's been cool. This whole, I like experiences that push you, you know, like force you to, to grow, become stronger. And a lot of those, on most of those experiences, the first, it's the first few, like the first week or whatever, that's really challenging. And you kind of almost even have doubts about, you know, can I do this or do I, am I enjoying this? That maybe I couldn't, that maybe I was like not fulfilling expectations of what I needed to be as a performer because maybe my brain space was, was too scattered. So that for example, my set, when I wouldn't really think about my set until about 10 minutes before I got up on stage. Because I was doing other stuff throughout the day. And, but eventually we just, we just all dialed it in. I mean, that was what's cool about this experience. That was really cool watching you dial it in too, man. It was really cool. I mean, you had good shows all the way through, but it's pretty badass watching your evolution over the course of doing a show after show after show after show. It's a really cool thing to watch that shift the confidence increases, the ability to connect increases. It's really cool, man. Well, I call it confidence, confidence with no substance. So. Well, yeah, that's called being human, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is no substance, there can't be. I mean, that's the ultimate secret of confidence, isn't it? Yeah, that doesn't, that no one needs to know that there's, that you don't actually have anything going on. And whenever you see, like, think of the most confident person you know, and just understand it's all bullshit. Like, just know that whatever the thing they're doing, they've either hypnotized themselves into thinking somehow that there's some stability or security in this universe, or they're just really good actors and they know that if they act confident, things tend to go better for them. You should act confident. Things will go better for you. There's actually a, you know, people who act, because the other thing is, if you're acting like you're not confident, you're acting too. That's the funny thing, no matter what you're acting. So, like, when you meet those people, they're like, I just, I just don't really know. I mean, I think I can, but no, that's an act too. Dum dum, we, you're, it's all a big fucking act. So, people who are acting insecure, that's just another form of confidence. Right, and it takes, it actually does take energy to act insecure as well. It takes confidence to be insecure, because you have to be confident that you're insecure. So, it's like, no matter what, you're definitely thinking you're something. There's a term in a Zen Buddhism that I learned at one of these Ram Dass retreats called radical insecurity is what it's called. Roshi Joan Halifax talks about this. And so, this is like, because a lot of these Zen koans that they ask, they're unanswerable and they torture your mind because they don't really have an answer and the feeling that it generates is this kind of frustrating feeling that I can only compare to like trying to write with your left hand if you've never written with your left hand before. It's just frustrating. It produces this very frustrating thing. Or it's like that feeling of like, everyone, you know, when you're waiting for that phone call, whatever it may be, you're wanting a job or you're wanting a girl or you're wanting a guy or you're wanting a whatever. So, you're waiting for the call. That feeling of waiting for the call is a constructed game that you have built where you pretend that you need a thing, the call, and then this produces a tension between the place where you're at now and the call. Then you get the call and then you get to experience relief because you've gotten the thing that you've been waiting for. But really nothing has changed at all about your actual situation, which is the actual situation is no matter who called you, unless it's some genetic scientist who's figured out a way to inject you with some superpower that's gonna eradicate your body's tendency to get old, get sick and die, then you're still in a situation where you're fucked on one level. You know, so this feeling of in so we trick ourselves into thinking that there's a solution to the problem in the micro and that's why it keeps people moving because they're just evading the macro, which is that yeah, it doesn't really matter if whoever calls, if you become president or whatever. Anyway, so insecurity, it's the right way to feel, but you can feel insecure and act confident at the same time. That's the, you're feeling the right way if you're insecure and strategically being confident seems like always the right choice. Yeah, yeah. Plus everything's just always changing. So even if you figure something out for a second, that's no guarantee that it's gonna last, you know what I mean? So it's just a constant, everything's just always shifting, which in some ways makes this lifestyle that we're on right now of being on this moving bus, traveling across the country, doing show after show, where it's very similar, but you're constantly sort of having to readjust and sort of get your bearings in a new place. You got to be in the moment here, man. Yeah. Because you're right. It's like this landscape is always changing. The, every single variable is constantly in flux. And so in that swirl, you have to find an anchor point somehow. You have to find a place. Well, we have that, the bus. So the bus is our little safe place in the world where no matter what's going on outside of these walls, we can, because that's the importance of having like building a, your corner in the world, where everything is, where you feel calm, where you feel good. That's why I think it's important to build a home that you really love being in. You mean like a physical home? I think a physical home really does help. Having a space, and this is like maybe a nice, I mean, we can talk about having visited, I know they were just on the podcast, but Alex and Allison Gray, going up and visiting Cosm, and you see what they've done there. They're trying to build their sort of, their perfect space in the world, where they feel both relaxed and free and strong. And then we've also seen that in different venues that just have maybe a little bit better energy because they've put a little bit more care into sort of building a place where you wanna be. Something that I've found the more and more of travel is that you have that place that you can come and return to. Well, what is that for you usually? Like, cause you're somebody who travels around the world with a tent. Yeah, my tent is that place. That's your home, the tent. I mean, the joke of it is that I feel more at home and more like everything feels so stable when I sleep in that freaking tent. Because it's the same, it's that same thing. It can be up in the mountains, it can be out in the desert, it can be on the side of the beach. When I get inside the tent, it's the same, it's stable. So it's like the, so it's just the, something about the illusion of how, cause a tent, what's a tent, man? It's like, what's it made of? It's made out of nylon and mesh and poles, and it folds up, you know? But somehow that structure around you, creates this illusion of having a home. Yeah, yeah. Cause clearly that's not the, I mean, it's kind of like, that's like a, I mean, it is sheltering you, but a lot of it's symbolic, right? It's like, here's a symbolic thing, it's like a ritual. You build the tent, you get inside the tent, but it's all mostly symbols to give you a feeling, right? The feeling of being home. How do you, if you had to, if someone, how would you describe the feeling of being at home? That I don't feel like anyone's watching me. And that's so stupid, because in many situations, it doesn't, it doesn't matter. Like that's why LA is actually a fun place to live, because people, there's freaks there that just do whatever they, they don't feel like they have to, like, like restrict themselves from just doing whatever they want. New York's the same. I mean, these kind of big cities, you can see that a lot in big cities. You also see a lot of crazy people. Yeah, I just saw this video that popped up on the internet of a guy in New York walking down the sidewalk, pulls his pants down and shits on a busy sidewalk, just sprays like projectile blasts, this long awful turd onto the street, very slowly pulls his pants up, casual style, buckles his belt, looks back at the turd, and then walks away. And people just keep moving by. It's like, no one's, what are you gonna do? It's got shit on the sidewalk. Yeah, no, it's cool. I mean, that's, there's other motivation. Oh, there's, that's, I don't know what's going on there, but that's, I don't know. I don't think I would ever wanna do that, honestly, but. Well, no, I mean, you're saying that your feeling of home is, something about it is privacy. Privacy is a huge part. Yeah, like, okay, that's one of the reasons why I like going to these really, really isolated places in the world. And it's not because I go out there and I do anything strange or whatever, but it's the sensation that I am in that moment only restricted by my own mental belief. But even those can evaporate. So, for example, like I'll develop little behaviors out there. Like I'm almost like a different person when I'm out there because I feel like there's no judgment. And even, even for my- What person do you become out there? Someone who feels more free. Where I'm playing by my own rules. So, in that sense, like, everything, for me, how that manifests itself is that I become very silly and I do things for absurd reasons because I'm like kind of, I'm building the world as I go. Right. Or, even on just a practical level, like I can wear whatever I wanna wear or walk however I wanna, I mean, it's just, there's no- Give me an example of what this manifest says out there. Like, what's an example of some silly thing you do? Cause like I know right now, you're going out to the desert, you're going to- The Alvord desert. The Alvord. So, when you're out in the desert, what is an example of ultimate freedom form Mikey Canman? I, well, my imagination definitely is running more wild out there. So, well, I'll just, I'll sing more. I don't know, that sounds stupid, but out loud. That doesn't sound stupid. I will- What kind of songs? Songs you make up or songs- Yeah, all of it. All of it. I'll talk to myself more. I think talking to yourself is really cool. I mean, it's totally- Very important. It's very important, yeah. To feel okay about that. Cause you are having a conversation with yourself all the time no matter what. All the time. So you might as well honor it and recognize it. And- Yeah. And enjoy it and enjoy the different voices that exist in your own head. Well, you know, and also there's the shamanic idea, which is that we create the world with our language. So, by vocalizing, you're actually bringing the universe into creation. And this is the shaman song that they sing the Ikaro. Which is, have you heard these songs? No. So they're beautiful, man. I'm sorry guys, I've talked about these before, but I'll try to do- I mean, I'll just make one up. I don't really do it, but it's like they- So it's like, they have whistling as part of it. So it'll be like- Whistling That's bad. Obviously I'm not doing one. That sounds like something like really annoying. But when they do it, it sounds beautiful. And various songs, and these songs are given to them. They're passed down or they're given to them by the ayahuasca, or they're given to them by whatever the plant medicine is that they contacted. And so, but they say, I've never done it, but they say that as these shamans sing these Ikaros while you're under the effect of ayahuasca, then it forms three dimensional shapes. So it actually, you can see what they're singing it, but it's their building forms with language. So talking to yourself, singing, all very important. Right. Almost as if I'm having a dialogue with the actual physical landscape that I'm in. So another, I mean, I was just thinking of another example of something I'll do. I'll just sit in crouch and eat, I mean, not eat sticks, but chew on sticks or do things that make no sense. But because they make no sense, I get to figure them out and almost try to understand them while I'm doing it. And then that also connects me with that physical place. That's so I like that aspect of it as well. Or I'll take, I own some clothes. Like I like to think of myself as having a nice style, but there are articles of clothing that I'm like, even I'm like in a city or a place, I'm like, I can't do that, I can't wear that. Like it's too much. Like I'm just asking for weird attention. Like you're not to uniform. Duncan! Yes. And so I'll take those. I like to go out and wear those clothes out there and just make up my own rules like in that regard. Yeah. And that's what I'm saying about where I don't feel like I'm being judged. It becomes almost more an exercise in how silly you can become and being okay with it. Because then when you come back, you can understand those things a little bit better and feel more comfortable. Everything you just described to me, sounds like a magical ritual. It sounds like you're going out there to do magic because so much of magic is based on, I mean, that's the, I mean, one of the most delightful parts of the time you get free enough or desperate enough or sad enough or whatever in your brain to start practicing magic, where you actually start doing it. Because to practice magic, you know, you've got to throw off a lot of like, you got to throw off a lot of bullshit like to do it. Because right now, for those of you listening, especially the skeptics, imagine practicing some kind of magical ceremony. Like whenever I think about it, a few people in my life, their voice will come into my head. Because you know, different, you put the masks of people you know on different components of your personality. So people who've influenced you the most, when you're about to do something, you might hear their voice as the voice of advice coming in or whatever. I don't know if that happens to you, but I've got a whole, what do you call it? Panoply of people in my life sit silently either feeling proud of me or judging me in my head. You know what I mean? So you'll have all different aspects of your behavior. Like for example, you have some part of you feels like you can't do magic or you can't become this being that you are out in wilderness or in a low population density area, in a high population density area. And so there's some block there that's like, shit, you just can't do that. You can't do it here. You can't wear the weird outfits here. I haven't seen you wear too many weird outfits on the bus. You can't, so there's something inside of you keeping you from doing that, right? So anyway, if practicing magic, you'll hear all these funny voices like, what are you, you're losing your mind. That's one of the first ones you'll hear. You're going nuts or what's wrong with you. This is a waste of time. You're desperate or you're stupid. Or are you out of your, what are you fucking hippie? You'll hear all these things, right? And when you finally manage to throw those things away. And magic, you know, or what I consider magic, it is exactly what you're talking about. It's not like you can refer to some of the varying scriptures or grimoires or whatever for the rituals that you want to do. But really like my version of it is, understand those as a kind of structure that people have come up with, North, South, East, West, understanding the directions, understanding where you are in relation to those directions. And then after that, it's like, just have fun. And I have a sacred substance involved in it, helps a lot too. So like get insanely, insanely, insanely high and then start doing just what you're saying. It reminds me of magic, chewing on sticks, connecting to the earth, connecting to the space you're in. I'll say goodbye to hotel rooms, man. Like when I'm leaving a hotel room, I'll say, thank you so much. Thank you for letting me sleep here. I love communicating with structures. But yeah, so it's magic. What you're doing out there is magic. And you only let yourself practice magic in the wilderness. Yeah, yeah, I suppose. Wilderness and within my own household as well. In your house, that's where you do it. Yeah, as well. Just because that's where you feel good. And it sounds silly to keep using that word safe, but safe is an idea of judgment. Well, you don't want to deal with the fucking evil eye, man. I mean, that's the thing. It's like we're talking about what, so as all practicing shamans and magicians, witches, and there's so many of them out there, one of the things that we don't like and we are very sensitive to is something called the evil eye. And so that is if a person looks at you in a judgmental way, or if you're in the beginning of some creative endeavor and a person looks at you in some weird way, this is the evil eye. And it can make you start questioning the beginning of your process. And then that can cause the process to become tainted and diluted. And then shamans talk about how they throw psychic darts. They'll throw these poisonous darts that get stuck in you. And so the Western version of that is somebody that you trust, or someone that you like, or someone you know says a passive-aggressive thing to you in passing, but you start thinking about it later. You've got a linguistic dart inside of you, a little poison dart that they threw, and it can ruin your creativity. So you're worried about the evil eye. You don't want someone to judge you for expressing yourself in this ultimately free way, it sounds like. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's where that's actually maybe one of the areas where we're smoking weed, especially like at home, if I'm getting dressed when I'm not to make this about fashion and stuff like that. It's a huge part of everything. It's a costume that you just decided to put on every day anyway. Yeah. So in the same way that you're saying insecurity is an act, so is everything, the whole thing. That's actually one of my great friends. Tom, he once said that his whole life is a performance. Right. So might as well just enjoy it and express yourself as much as you can. But so smoking weed at home, especially if I'm getting ready to go out for a night out, is really fun because then you end up coming up with some little, you just frame your mind within your own home space. And then you enter the world like that. And you can carry that energy with you. I'm a big part of if we're going to describe this as magic, which I hadn't really ever thought about before. But if I belong in any form of magic, it would be energy magic. So that with you, no matter how you look or where you go, you carry with you a certain energy that is palpable to people. It can be read by people. You can be as transparent as you want to be. So for example, just thinking about this because we're in a new place every day. And I walk around and sometimes I feel like an outsider because we're just into this. Yeah, we are. But I like to just think of it as I can navigate this space. But as long as I'm calm and as long as I have that peace with myself, then I can almost be water through this place, you know what I'm saying? And water just moves wherever the path of least resistance is, right? Isn't that true? Oh, yes. But there's certain places that I have done these awful, I don't know if you'd call it the placebo effect or whatever. But so there's certain places in the world where I've decided that I have less potency than other places in the world. So I've created a magical hierarchy where there's some places where I feel like my juju is somehow diminished versus other places. Now, this is all another form of magic because by imbuing one place as a potent place and another place as a non-potent place, you have done the spell in your own conceptualization of the place. And this is actually, I would say, an indication of a kind of neophyte when it comes to, if you want to call it magic or whatever you want to call it. It's an indication of just not recognizing that you're still in the process of creating the illusion of sacred spaces. When the ideal, it's fun to just come up with ideals, right? Like when you're planning to just shoot a sketch, whenever you're planning to make something, you imagine the ultimate version first. Like if you had a trillion-dollar budget, we're going to have flying dragons. We're going to have to build a bridge here. We'll have a skyscraper. I need stuntmen. We're going to get Patrick Swayze on board. So you imagine the ultimate version. And then you start reducing it down to what you can actually afford. So in the same way, it's fun to imagine, OK, the ultimate version of Mikey Cameron. And so it seems like the old one freedom, that freedom that you're talking about, that you have to make these pilgrimages to go contact nature where you are fully embraced by the universe. And in that place, you blossom and become yourself. So the ideal, wouldn't it be that you no longer have to do any of these pilgrimages? Because that state of expansive consciousness comes into you wherever you may be. That's the dream, yeah. That's the super powered you. That's like the ultimate wizard campman. That's Gandalf campman, right? Where it doesn't matter where you're at. Yeah, I think that's what people must talk about. That's what they're just trying to describe when they talk about knowing themselves or being at peace with themselves or something like that. Actualization. Yeah. Because underneath all this brick and. Well, so for people who are listening, it's like, yeah, we've been on this tour. And you're thinking, oh, well, I live in a bus with Duncan Trussell. That must be really rad. It must be exciting. And aside from like. The black eyes. Yeah, I was going to say exactly. The occasional sort of physical and verbal abuse. Once you get used to that. I don't consider it abuse. It's a form of love, I suppose. I feel like you're abusing me right now. Honestly, God, every time you whine about sleeping under the bus, I feel like you're abusing me. We really do have so many. We've had so many good conversations. And so it was like almost when we decided to do the podcast today, I was thinking, man, like we've already talked about so many things. But one of the conversations we had one night that I really remember, and I wrote it down as we were talking about this idea of there being chaos in the world or being in the presence of someone who's having a fit of some sort or bringing their bullshit into your life and whatever. And one of the mental images I got in my head was the idea of this roaring sea, this stormy, chaotic, rough ocean with white caps and stuff like that. And being able to take that in your hand and grab it with your hand and bring it over to this other side and let it go. And it's instantly upon letting it go, it's a mirrored pond, just perfectly still. And that's something as well that I'm like, that's a new idea that I would like to keep thinking about. That's a great one. And that's the somewhere in the Bhagavad Gita that described the mind of the sage. And they talk about it's like a vast ocean with all these rivers entering into it, and it's just calm. In meditation, they say, it's like when you have a glass of sediment and water, the sediment will inevitably kind of go to the bottom of the glass. But then if there's turbulence, then the glass is suddenly filled with dust. And that's compared to the mind. And the sediment is your habituations and thought patterns and the neurological, whatever has been baked into your neurology, your addiction, and all that. But then the water would be the consciousness that's always there. Interesting. And so no matter what, you're just that consciousness. I mean, no matter what, when you go out into that vast space, it's not that you're experiencing it. It's that you're experiencing you. Because you're mirroring that you are that place. And in that same analogy that you just gave, in that glass of water where the sediment floats the bomb, it's not like the sediment went away. You can never escape that. Those things are there always. But what I like about, so for example, out in the place, like in Antarctica, I discovered this a lot as well, because it was such a quiet and at times isolated place. And same with whether I'm in the desert or whatever, it's silence ultimately that becomes that thing that a lot of those superfluous thoughts and noise, those go away. And what they do is they peel back those layers to reveal what is there for me. I don't know if that makes sense. Yeah, for sure. But do you ever do any kind of like meditations where you begin to? I've got the worst discipline in the world. Oh, I do, too. You don't, the whole, I don't know. I guess, sure, of course, meditation and discipline are somehow mixed together. But it's like, all you discipline fucking meditators out there, go run a marathon, go do your fucking meditation push-ups in a different temple, bitch. This whole thing, because so many people are like, look, I get it, congratulations. You guys managed to become a discipline meditation. But some of us are like, so what happens is, for me especially, my mind will say, OK, well, this is what meditation looks like for you, Duncan. So I'll tell you, my mind will say to me, OK, if you want to get spiritual, Duncan, here's what you, what it looks like. Right, right. You're going to wake up at five in the morning and take an ice cold shower and sit at your puja table and listen to the Hanuman, Chalisa, and say some positive affirmations and prayers for the world. And then have a nice vegetarian breakfast and then go for a jog after your food digest and write in your affirmation journal and get in your line. Shut up. That's a super ego. That's not it. Fuck you with your fucking 5 AM wake-up call and your cold shower and the puja table. No, no, no. Meditation is something that can happen right now, even during the podcast. Even with us talking, you can begin to meditate. You don't have to have the ego wants to trick you into thinking in the same way that you think. And I don't mean to diminish it, because I do think there are definitely sacred spaces. But the idea is if I go to the way out of the desert, there I can truly be myself. If I'm in my home, I can truly be myself. But these places, I've got to be a little bit on guard. So in the same way your ego will tell you, you need to go to this place to meditate. You need to go to that place to meditate. No, now you can do it. You can do it laying in your bunk. You could do it falling asleep. The whole fucking thing is a temple. Smash the walls that you've constructed around yourself. Yeah, because it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. All of that is just the mind tricking you, as it will, to be consistently at odds with yourself, creating the stupid tension between where you are and where you should be. And that produces the sensation of inferiority, which then produces the sensation of accomplishment, which then makes the dopamine secret, which produces a perfect addiction mechanism. So you need to stretch yourself out, create the tension, so that you can feel good again when you release the tension. And this is like, anyway, so the point is this expansiveness meditation, which cornfield does a lot, which is you can just sort of like start playing around with like, okay, where am I, right? Like, you know, right now we're sort of sitting in a chair on a bus, right? And so then, but where am I? Where am I really? And so like, where is the boundary between where I stop and where the world starts, right? So you just start playing. You fell asleep on me, boy. Wake up, Mikey. What? Oh. You start spreading out. I will break your fucking leg. You'll go to that goddamn Sonora Desert with a lamp. I wanna, yeah, yeah. But you can expand out now, you know? You could stretch the fucking thing out. They've done, I've done, they do these guided meditations and these cheesy retreats I always talk about. But in these meditations, they will open your mind and your mind starts stretching out so that you realize that the enclosure that you've created for the poor little primal savage that is your heart in this tiny little egoic guerrilla cage that you've been running around on doing like swinging on, you realize like, oh shit, it's a fake enclosure. The fucking wild savage primordial being at any time that I want to, you can go stretching outside the boundaries of myself and suddenly it's like, you're not in a bus anymore. The bus is just a denser form of matter that happens to be around you. But really, you're stretched out, man. You're stretched out as far as you fucking want. It expands if you want it to. And then the anchor point is the pain or something, right? The suffering or whatever the anxiety is. Yeah, maybe you come back to those things. Yeah, yeah, exactly. I don't know, it's exciting. It's exciting. All those ideas are really exciting to me. Yeah, they're pretty cool. It's a pretty cool, they're all, I mean, you know, they're all tricks, really. It's like, they're just tricks. There's like little tool tricks, tools and tips and tricks that people have come up with over thousands and thousands and thousands of years of trying to. But what's the alternative? To just accept that life has to be a certain way. That seems boring, you know what, you know, does that make? Well, some people are really, I mean, I can only extrapolate from my own pain. So I know like the way I act when I'm in pain tends to be shitty. Classic examples slamming your finger in the door. And someone walks by and's like, hey, what's up, Mikey? And you just slammed your finger in the door. You might be like, fuck you! Yeah, yeah. You don't mean it, you don't wanna hurt them. But some people, their heart has been slammed in a door that they can't open. That's true. And so they're in the most agonizing psychic pain. And they don't realize it maybe. And so the alternative is to allow yourself to be in a never ending state of pain and paranoia and suspicion and anger. And to allow that to be the thing that defines the universe you're in. So now you're in a universe of good people and bad people. Good people punished, or rather bad people punished, good people rewarded. And then in that you become your own little fascist, tyrant dictator running a little city-state that consists of imaginary things. Cause none of it's real. Your idea of what anybody's like around you is completely just a projection of your own identity under them. Should we talk about how I got pulled over by SWAT today? Speaking of fucking pigs. Yeah, this is, so you just tell the story and most people know why the city we're in right now is a little on edge, but you give the back story. Yeah, okay, so we're obviously in St. Louis, which is, we're nine miles from Ferguson, Missouri right now, where of course the death of Michael Brown and all the protests went down and the riots and- Let's imagine some people aren't aware of what happened to Michael Brown. An unarmed black man was shot after being pulled over by cops and maybe there was a disagreement. Even my own knowledge on this is a little weak. I'm a little confused about it. Like I think he like, didn't he like go into a liquor store or something and was like, isn't there some video of him doing some kind of grabbing some shit in a liquor store? Yeah, so there was, it's not like a perfectly clean situation of just guy walking down the street. Well, I mean, the last I checked shoplifting from a liquor store doesn't have the penalty of death attached to it in the United States. Right, no, that's absolutely true. So this horrific event went down within the last year, right, it's still fresh, I mean, it's ultra fresh. And so that's where we are, we're in St. Louis. And again, we wake up, the bus lands, I feel it idling, get up, talk to English, watch a horse race. We watched the Grand National Horse Race today. And then at some point I decided, hey, I wanna go get a bite to eat. And so I checked out, you know, found this place online. It's supposedly a nice little piece of Americana. I like to check out these little diners and very Guy Fieri-like. And I head out onto the street. And so I'm walking down the street and I feel like I'm wearing a comic relief eight sweatshirt. I've got a War of the Worlds hat on and I'm wearing violet sunglasses, which I got in Madison. And so I'm walking down the street. You stick out like a sore thumb. Yeah, but I don't look like a freaking terrorist. You don't look like you live here. Yeah, maybe it's true, but who knows what anyone looks like. I'm not trying to justify what happened, but that outfit that you were wearing, if I was casting a movie and I wanted to cast like some kind of like hacker for Occupy Wall Street. Like an Occupy Wall Street hacker. It's the same hat I wore when I played hacky on the Tim and Eric tour, the hacker, the computer hacker in the crowd. See, there you go. So it is rooted in some hacker culture. So, but nonetheless, I'm walking down the street, very casual. I have my earbuds in. I make a phone call to my friend who's a farmer in Oregon. We're just talking. He's standing in the field right now while we're talking and he's asking, how's the tour going? And I'm saying, I'm talking about how great it's been and- He's dunking, he's hitting me. He's dunking, he's hitting me. Me, me, me. You know, those supportive conversations really help. Get through it. Me, me, me, me. Now, out of the corner of my eye, I see this strange looking structure, architectural structure. And I'm all like, what is that? Like on this beautiful day in St. Louis. What is that? Interesting architecture. And I bought binoculars before this tour started. And as I, even a surprise to my own self, I'm starting to get into watching birds. Bird watching. Bird watching and also just, how about having a tool in my backpack that at any given moment, I have 10 times the strength of my own eyes. Really cool. Why would I not have those on me all the time? So I have my backpack on me and I bust out my binoculars while I'm on the phone with my friend. And I'm checking out this strange structure. It kind of looks like roads curving into the sky, like a sky bridge of some sort. That's what it looked like to me. And I was like, what the hell is that? I couldn't figure out if it was freeway or what? But it was like these like strips, like bending. Like I just saw like a corner of it. And so I have my binoculars out and I'm like zooming, I'm like zooming and looking at them. And then I was like, that's really pretty. So I've figured out that I can put my camera lens up into the binoc, one of the eyes of the binocular and take photos like that of like, that's cool. So I take one picture. I've just put the picture camera down. I saw the binoculars in my hand and boom, boom, two police cars pull up like perpendicular style, like as if they're like cutting me off, you know, but I'm like already standing there. And one of them is a SWAT vehicle and one of them is a regular police vehicle. Two cops come out of the regular police vehicle and a solo SWAT officer comes out of the SWAT vehicle. Suddenly I'm surrounded by three. What's the SWAT officer wearing? A black, all black outfit with says SWAT on it. Like, you know, when you realize you're talking to a SWAT, I mean, that's just what the fuck, like what's going on? So they're coming up with, like they walk up kind of slowly but they're, you know, I see them checking out. There's immediate tension, of course. And they say, what are you doing? You know, what are you doing? And I said, oh, I'm checking out that building. I've never seen anything like that before. What's that, what's that building? And they're so confused. Right. What, which building? That one over there with the sky, like the roads, like what, oh, Union Station, the train station. I said, yeah. And they go, okay, do you realize that you're next to, you're appearing into a police parking lot. And it's not like a parking lot full of police cars. It's like, hey, I work at police headquarters. I got to park my civilian car for the day. Yeah, there were a few, we passed it. There's a few cop cars. There's some like, you know, vans and stuff. But there's not like, it's not filled with cop cars. No, like, no signage anywhere that says you're not allowed to look. One sign. Well, there's a sign, police. Yeah, but definitely not. No, it just says police, it says police parking only. I mean, they're saying don't stand here and take pictures. Right. So they asked me where I'm from. I said I'm from California. They say, can I see your ID? Now, I know Duncan, we already talked about this. There's such, you're saying, I don't have to, I don't have to respond, yeah. Right, technically, theoretically, you don't have to respond. But I- But the police officer's here. Me being someone who, in this case, I've got nothing to hide. I've been caught looking at architecture. And also the cops here do kill armed people. Yeah, also you are aware, like, oh, shit, this is, yeah, Ferguson, like this is St. Louis, okay. So they check my ID and very skeptically, sort of like, they just say, listen, you can't do this, you can't, you can't, you know, I was there for two minutes, man. So whatever surveillance cameras picked me up, they fucking, they were in there in a flash. So after this happened, I'll let you finish the story real quick, they're, Mikey, after this happened, now he's living in, because he had contact from the state, now he's in, now we're in 1984. Cause once that happens, and the illusion of your autonomy has been completely shattered by armed thugs, stopping you for nothing, completely violating your constitutional rights. You can't fucking do that, you're doing nothing wrong. Then we start looking around, man. There's cameras everywhere, this whole neighborhood is littered, every corner has got surveillance cameras. So there's something going on here in St. Louis that is, we haven't experienced anything like this anywhere else in the country. Personally, I don't think, I mean, this felt, and I even, they said, you gotta understand, we've had a lot of incidents here recently, tensions are high, there's been threats called in on us, there was the Michael Brown incident, which we were joking, it's like, oh, the Michael Brown incident, where you shot an unarmed person, like, yeah, I could see how, I could see how. People might be a little un-edged. Yeah, but I wouldn't, how would that make you nervous? Because you asked them if they've noticed a correlation between rising tensions and them shooting people for no reason. We've noticed the more we keep stopping people for doing nothing, that tensions seem to be rising more and more. I didn't say, all I said was that, I said, well actually, no, so they let me on my way, and I get back on the phone with my friend, because at some point I said, hey man, I gotta call you back, I'm surrounded by cops. I should've stayed on the line, is what I should've done. So I call him back, and I get, maybe two minutes down the road, boom, boom, same two cop cars, pull over again, all three cops get out again, now suddenly I'm surrounded for a second time. You should've run. That's how I get shot in the fucking back. So they say, sorry, we're not trying to harass you. And I go, okay. You're not trying to harass me. No, you are. You literally are harassing me. But we noticed that you took a photo back there. So they've, I don't know if they got an instant replay and peeled back the surveillance camera, and watched me take a photo. And so they go, we saw you take a photo back there. You don't, technically you don't have to show us, but it would make us feel a lot better if you did. And again, I think almost to like, prove the absurdity of the situation, I was like, yeah, I would more than happy to show you the one photo of a piece of architecture. Oh god, dude. Now see, that's where you messed up. Because what you should've done, it's shown them, I know you must have a dick pic on your phone. Yes. You should've shown them a fucking dick pic. I think this is it. Is that what, is that train station made of big dicks? Or a picture of Michael Brown on the ground. Oh, that would've been awesome. And you would've been shot, or you'd've been arrested. Oh my god. Because that's the problem here, man, is it's like, we want to be constitutionalists, and you want to rebel, and you want to make it hard for them, but also you don't want to get murdered. Here's what's strange, in this situation, they were the ones who were visibly nervous. They were the ones who seemed to be living in a fear state. Yeah, they are. And that's what I even said to them. I said, this is eye-opening to me, and I'm sorry that you guys live in a world where a guy who's looking at binoculars is interpreted as a threat. And they didn't really have much to say about that. But they said, sorry, again, to have stopped you, and hope you have a good day. And I just said, yeah, I'm probably not going to do much here for the rest of the day. Not going to have a good day, because you guys just fucking stopped me for nothing. But think about that, man. Think about that they do live in a world here where they are on that edge. And I don't know if, again, it's such a complicated situation. But in those situations, I just feel sorry for people that that is their reality, that that is their vision of reality. And that is because it's just so tainted with fear and so tainted with violence. But think about this, because it's good to feel compassion for them. And I think that's important. And I don't do it enough. It's so easy to demonize them. But think about this. You've been in this city for less than what? We've been there for less than maybe two hours. Less than two hours. And you've already been stopped by a SWAT team. You've been here for less than two hours. You've already been stopped by a SWAT team. Imagine living here as a Black dude. Imagine that. If a fucking hacker looking hipster dude wandering down the street with binoculars gets the SWAT team called on them, what happens to just the normal African-American dude who for whatever reason, in front of all these security cameras, turns the wrong way or stops? And that's actually, but further down the street from where this all went down, there was a group of people just on the street. And when they let me go, it was mostly Black people. When they let me go, it was an eye-opening experience of like, oh shit, here are these dudes now who have been living in this. This is their home city. This is probably something they're experiencing again, yeah, every day. Yeah, they've tightened the screws too much here, man. That's a problem. If they're fucking pulling you over, that means they're harassing everybody. And that whole like, sorry, I don't, well, you don't want to harass you. No, you're harassing me. You don't get to do this. And it just radically changes how you feel about walking down a street in your own country, in your own city. You're being monitored. I mean, you're being monitored by cameras. They did replay the footage. Otherwise, they would have asked you about it when they pulled you over the first time. They replayed the footage. Also, they filed that footage away somewhere now. They probably have like a folder of suspicious people that you have landed in. I would love to get that for my reel. You know, so it's fucked, man. This is a fucked situation. It really is. And you never forget it, man. When the state shoves their gross, trembling little finger into the asshole of your life and prods around a little bit, it's like, you don't forget about that quickly. It sticks with you. It's just so, it's incredible that these things that we even talked about in the last hour can all just coexist at the same time. All symbols. Well, it's a war of symbols. It's like, here's what happened. Three guys with symbolic power pulled you over. Their only real power is physical, violence. That's their real power. But they have symbolic power, which has been imbued upon them supposedly by the will of the people. That's the idea, is that people have imbued these people with power. They have their magical outfits on. The SWAT team has his magical outfit on. The police officers have their magical outfits on. And these are all types of magicians who have come to you, imbued with the power of the state. But it's all just symbols. They're real, the only symbol you really need to worry about, of course, is their gun and their physical power. But really, what happened is three guys that you don't know stopped you on the street. And they're playing a game of make-believe. And the game of make-believe they're playing is we're police officers. That's a game of make-believe. You're not a police officer. You're a human. You're a monkey descendant. But you're not a police officer. You're just a human wearing a costume. And now I have to play this game of make-believe, where I submit to you. And if I don't play the game of make-believe, the illusion is I'm going to be fine, because it's my right to do this. But once you start shooting people for not playing the game of make-believe, then I have to play the game of make-believe. So now you are forcing me to play game of make-believe. So it's all just symbols, right? It's all just symbols. And when you realize that it's just a war of symbols, then it can loosen it up a little bit, or at least make it slightly more interesting. But those cameras, those cameras, those are symbols. Every single one of those cameras is saying we are watching you. If they posted signs all over that said Big Brother is watching you, then there would be more protests, and they would have to take the signs down. But they don't need to post those signs. They just need to put those cameras up. And it's the same fucking thing. We are watching you. You are not in control. You do not have the power here. You do not have the power. We do. That's the message that you get here. And that's the message you got rolled right into town, didn't you? You rolled into town and had the classic archetypical running with a fucking sheriff. It's like, well, well, well, what do we have here? Stranger in town, huh? Hope you're not up to no good, son. Are you up to no good, son? Yeah. That's what you had. It's the classic running with the law. But then two hours later, I was watching a koi fish eat a french fry in an artificial jungle of this restaurant that we went to. And the koi fish got arrested. I don't know, man. I just, it's just, it's disturbing. And I'm glad that this is where we have the luxury of being like, guess what? Bus is peeling out at 3 in the morning. Bye. Yeah. But yeah, my sympathies do go out with people who have to live in these states. And this is, guess what? We aren't the only, I mean, obviously there's countries out there in the world that are way worse than this. Palestine. Yeah. Look at the fucking Palestinians. Look what they have to go through. Yeah. How can anyone find, yeah, I don't know, man. It's, yeah, yeah, we've created all of this, too. That's the irony is we've created all of it. Yeah, we built, we built the thing up. Everyone's playing this ridiculous game. And make believe, yeah. And changing the rules of the game and make believe at that level are really difficult. Like it takes a lot of, because when you, when you see a riot happen, or a huge protest, what you're seeing is a group of people saying, hey, just for a second, we're not going to play make believe. Right. We're done with this game for a second, OK? We're not playing make believe. We're going to play real right now, or we're going to play as real as we can, which is that we're tired of being monitored. We're tired of being shot. Right. And so for a second, we're going to not play this game. And I love that. I love watching that happen, because in the United States, they're really good at giving you the feeling, because what they say, you know, this is freedom, is really saying you're free to make believe you are whatever you want, right? Up until a point. But the moment you start going against the game of make believe that they want us to play, at some point you hit this invisible barrier, and that's when the fucking weird vehicles start pulling up. And that's when those people in the goddamn Darth Vader outfits come out of the backstage area, and they like start fucking spraying you with poison, beating you with clubs. They say, you are going to play this fucking game of make believe, or we will spray you with poison, and we will fucking kill you. Get back to playing the fucking game. And then you do. You're like, all right, I guess I'll play the game again, because I don't want to die. That's the problem right there. And a revolution is just one game of make believe overcoming another game of make believe. So what do you think, what should people do? Well, I mean, this was the idea of the election cycle, is that every four years we get to vote on what game of make believe we're going to play. And then we're supposed to elect people that are going to represent the game that everybody wants to play. And so the problem is when the people that we've elected are not playing the game that we thought they said we were going to play, we were voted for you because we wanted to do jump rope. And you guys are doing hopscotch. So yeah, so that's where the problem comes. But here's the biggest game. This is the real problem. There's so many more of us than there are of them. So many more, so many more. And it doesn't matter, ultimately, because really the other game that we're playing is we're pretending that they have the power. They don't have any fucking power at all. There's so many of us. There's so many of us. They couldn't do shit. It doesn't matter if they have all the fucking weapons. If we united, if everyone unified, if it really happened, we only need like 70%, 60% of us. It would never happen. But the point is, once the people join together from the individual to the whole, they become the most dangerous, blood thirsty, savage beast. And when that happens, it's like, I don't care how many fucking SWAT officers you have or how many outfits you have, no one cares. And you get to watch this now. There's videos all day long on the internet. Just check out fucking Gaddafi. Check out Gaddafi being like stabbed in the asshole. That guy used to live in like a palace, you know? Or look at like Mussolini. Look at Hitler in a fucking bunker. You can see again and again and again and again. It's just an illusion. It doesn't last. But the idea was, let's figure out a way to not change these games with violence. There doesn't have to be a human sacrifice to start a new game. Like we could figure out a way to do it in a more, in a less violent way. That's the idea. And it does work. You know, Martin Luther King, well, no, he got shot. But he did do non-violence and he did help some stuff, but they'll kill you. That's a happy way to end the podcast. Why are people so resistant to change? Well, I mean, I think it feels good to, I think that if you're, so if we're talking about this game of confidence and insecurity, and if you're some fucking, if you're a 300-pound man with a cyclone of insecurity inside of you, raised by racists, taught that black people are crooks from the moment you were born, just hearing the poisonous fucking story. It's an old story over and over again. Cause a lot of these, you know, it's that fantastic, what's that quote from Rage Against the Machine? Some of them who burn crosses, wait, some of them who work forces are the ones who burn crosses. Some of the, you know, so it's like, so when you realize that like the KKK and a lot of those people did a relatively logical chest move, which is that they just became police officers. Yeah, including, I found this out about the Los Angeles, I'll have to talk about this. So I went to this amazing conversation, and it was on black history in Los Angeles. And the police force in Los Angeles was recruited from the south, from southern states, Alabama, Arkansas, people who came back from the war. I think this was the 50s, so at the end of World War II. And they found people who had racist tendencies and said, hey, you just got back, you looking for a job? Guess what? We're building a police force out in Los Angeles. Would you like to have a job? We'll pay for you to relocate out there. And systematically, a racist police force was built in Los Angeles in the 50s, which then 30 years later, after 30 years of established behavior and culture, it manifested itself at the end of the 80s, early 90s with Rodney King. Oh yeah, that's right. Oh, there you go, well, there you go. It's like, so when you start to peel back some of these layers of that's rude, like facade, and then you realize that, dude, so many of these things that have gone on in our own American history are so buried in history by these very specific actions to create a world that was run by racism or run by control of power or wealth or greed. Man, it's so disturbing, so disturbing. Well, there's where the problem lies, because it's like, you know, if you did a brain scan on some of these people who are heavily armed and you realize that they've been indoctrinated into a philosophy that looks at minorities as an inferior race, less intelligent, more prone to crime in a race that like, many of them probably still think that slavery might not be that bad an idea. So when you look at that and realize that they've become heavily armed, and really, it's like, you know, you only need one pedophile to ruin a summer camp, right? Like you don't need like, you don't need a bunch of them, right, so like, so like, in a police station, not all the police officers working there are indoctrinated racists. Some of them are people who want a job, some of them, and this is the part that'll bring a fucking tear to your eye, are people who want to be heroes. In India, the class is known as the kashaitra class, the warrior class, and it's a class of warriors who want to protect people who need to be protected. So some of the people in police departments are heroes. They want to be heroes. They got into it because they want to protect people. So mixed in with this group of like, people who are there for a fucking job, people who want to protect people are fucking demons. People who go home at night and talk about how, I wouldn't be surprised if it's on them, talk about how they want a fucking race war, how they can't wait for the next riot so they can get out there on their big fucking goddamn water cannons and wield their military-grade weapons and look at the shriveling fear of oppressed people as they gaze up at them. They like that feeling. That's what I'm saying, man. Some people, it gets their fucking dick hard, man. They like it. They're sadists. Okay, there's people who love S&M, right? There's people who fucking love tying up other people and some people love tying up other people because they like to give pleasure because some people like to be tied up. So it's like an incredible way to give people the most extreme pleasure, right? But some people, like the BTK killer, the Bind Torture Kill Killer, he liked tying people up because it gave him pleasure. He liked having someone tied up who couldn't move, that he could then torture for a few days because it made him come really hard and he really enjoyed it. There are people like that who have badges. They just like it. They like the feeling of it. They like it when you're showing them the picture in your phone. They like it when you're acting nice. They like it when you feel empathy and compassion for them because they look at it as a kind of cowering, submissive weakness that gets their dick hard. So that's the fucking problem is we gotta figure out a way to get those people out of the position of putting people into prison and into prisons, you know? And how do you fucking do that? I just wanna take my shirt off and go to the beach. Take your shirt off around here. You'll get shot, Mikey. You'll get blasted. If I bet, that's a fun thing. Somebody should do a game show here. Somebody should do a, this would be a really fun game show. Like how quickly can you get blasted? So you think you can get blasted? That's a fun, hey guys, living out here. Don't get hurt, but I think it would be a very funny YouTube series. If I was a black dude living out here, I would do a series which is like see how long you can do certain things here without getting stopped by the cops. Like see how long you could do constitutionally accepted, completely approved things here before the cops stop you. And you ever can do, like you could do bets. You could like, you could do bets. You could like, it would be, that'd be really interesting. Cause if my friend, Mikey, who is white as the snow of Antarctica. Come on man, I got a nice tan. You're white dude. I've been complimented multiple times on this tour for how are you so tan. You're gonna have coffin on the, you're literally sleeping in a, fine. You're tan, whatever you want to say. Jesus. You look like you've climbed out of a fucking cave man. I know I'm not embarrassed by how pale I am. The point is, if you, Mikey, can't fucking pull a pair of binoculars out on the streets here without immediately getting stopped by cops, then it must be like, Jesus fucking Christ. If you're a black guy walking home here, it must take you two hours just for all the checkpoints you've got to go through. Someone should start documenting this. I would love to see that. Yeah, but I think the response you'd get to that is from black communities in this country would say, we are documenting it every day with our eyes and with our bodies and with our minds and our blood and everything. So wake up, like, guess what? It's, you know, this country's just so big, man. This country's so big, it's hard to be in touch with all. So that's what's been kind of cool on this tour. So drive around and get a sense of where everyone's at. And this is the definitely of all the spots we've been. This is definitely, because when you told me this morning, I was about to leave the bus to go eat. And Mike, he's like, I just, I was actually looking at Twitter, he tweeted, I've just been stopped by the spot team. And I'm like, that's hilarious. But then I realized, oh fuck, it really happened. But yeah, when you walk around here, man, there's a real tension here. People, we are so sorry that you're having to go through this, this is a, this is a really, I don't know the answer, man. I mean, you know, this is such a callous thing to say, but I guess you peep, some people just can't fucking move. But it's like, just fucking, I'd want to just leave. I just want to leave. But then to leave is to surrender, I guess. To leave is to be like, letting them win. What would you do? What would you do? I don't know. Joint, try to become a police officer maybe? Like get in there and try to. Whoa, that's a cool idea. Yeah, yeah, maybe that. I don't know, man. Organize, I just, you know, we saw a protest at the police department. I guess that, that's really admirable. You know, man, there's people out there who are to this day, protesting in front of the police department. There's, they're fighting here. They're resisting. That's pretty admirable, man. Being vocal, using their constitutional right. Free speech and pretty sick. I think I'd move. I'd move it. I mean, yeah, it's, I don't know why people, why, why, yeah. Certain situations. That's a dream, isn't it? Like if only we had some like, like, cause if we had discovered teleportation in another planet, then, you know, it'd be amazing if everyone just left. That's a funny thing to imagine, just fucking leave. So all that's left is the cops. Just an empty city with a bunch of angry old fascist shithead racists and no one to beat up. Congratulations, you won. Now you've got a bunch of dilapidated buildings and wild dogs running around. And that's it, you fucking assholes. I mean, what do they want? When does it, the real question is, when does, if right now they're like on lockdown, when does it stop? When does the vice grip of fascism loosen? When do they let go? Cause the scary thing about power is that it doesn't loosen. It only tightens. It doesn't go, it doesn't. Well, and also the other thing is that this in climate, like this environment creates a climate where you don't even want to talk to cops in, when you see them in public. So for example, is back in Los Angeles, my friend and I were getting taco at a taco truck. And there was a police officer ordering right at the same time as us. And we ordered our tacos, he ordered his taco tacos and we then kind of sat almost ignoring each other's presence for the five minutes while we waited. That, what I've done that in, if it wasn't a police officer, way less likely, enjoy talking to strangers. Cause it's connected. Oh, well, whatever we did in our lives, we both found ourselves at this taco truck at the same time. So we got that in common. We got that going for us. But what the police are, just when you hear these stories, it just creates an environment where you're just like, you know what, nah, I'm just gonna chill. I'm gonna chill and pretend like this person's not here. They're not all bad, man. And they're not all bad. But even worse than that is in any situation, in anyone's life, if you have a problem with anyone, if you don't try to at least talk to them, you're never, you're just gonna get, you're gonna just increase that gap, right? Oh, you're right. We were talking about this. Right, that's the problem. Yeah, cause you can, like, but I know police officers listen to this podcast, so I've met, they're so sweet, but they're stuck a little bit because they can't, there's, you know, there's archaic laws. And here's the other thing that, you know, and I don't want to be like an apologist for violent racist at all. But I think no matter who it is, I'll try to put myself in their shoes so that I can get some understanding. But like, if you see, if you're in a job where one of the things that can happen, there's a whole YouTube compilation of people shooting cops. I don't know if you've seen it, but one of the things that can happen, wait, it's cop shooting people. I mean. I'm sorry. Oh my God. Now that I think about it, I think it's just cop shooting people. But like, there are, you know, it does happen though. People do blast cops from time to time. And if you're in that situation where like when you're pulling somebody over, who's driving erratically, right, we need someone to pull over drunks. You need it. You need someone to pull over drunks. We don't want drunk drivers on the road. So you pull over someone who's driving erratically and when you're pulling them over because you don't want them to run over someone, you don't want to kill. You're the, okay, so it's your job. It's night. You're driving. Here's a person who's driving all over the fucking road, right? Now, if you're like anyone else who's doing their job, you are thinking, God fucking dammit. If this guy wasn't driving like this, then I could keep cruising in my fucking car and join the night and I won't have to do this. But immediately your blood pressure goes, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Now you gotta pull someone over, right? So you turn your lights on. Now in your mind, you're like, you know, because I'm a cop and I've come to the scene of accidents and I've seen people's brains on the road. If you're a cop, you've probably seen some brains on the road. You've seen some blood. You've seen what happens when a drunk driver runs through a red light and kills people. So you're like, I have to stop this guy because I'm the only one who's here to do it. No citizen is gonna pull this fucking guy over. I have to do this. You have no choice. You have a responsibility. Because later if you hear about a fucking Mustang plowing into a goddamn bus stop and killing three people, that's you for the rest of your life, right? So it's a huge responsibility. So you pull this fucking, you turn on your lights. Now, here's the other thing I always think. Guess who's at home, right? Your wife, she's pregnant. She's probably due to have a baby in like the next, I don't know, month or so, right? So like you have a pregnant wife at home. You're pulling this person over and guess what happens? They decide to run. So now you gotta chase this fucking asshole. They're running through fucking red lights. Now you're calling in like, God damn it. So now you've got a fucking chase on your hands, right? You're chasing this fucking drunk piece of fucking shit. Your pulse is just through the roof. You're thinking, my God, man, if my fucking car, if I fuck up here, if someone hits me, I'm dead. My kid's gonna be born without a fucking dad. I'm just trying to make drunk people not run over assholes, you know? So you finally get this fucking guy pulled over by slamming into his car because you're trying to get him to not kill people. Seven of your friends are there too who are worried that you might have gotten killed. So they're all fucking pissed. They're like, you motherfucker, what are you gonna do, man? Because when I'm in traffic and I get sometimes cut off, oh yeah, I'll get mad just for that. How much angry are you gonna be when some meth-addled piece of fucking shit almost kills a bunch of people for no reason? And this is the other thing. They've chemically, they've proven it with two scientific research. When your brain gets worked up like that, when it gets angry, when adrenaline pumps through it, it takes an hour for it to chemically rebalance. So basically, anytime you're mad in your own life or someone else is mad at you and they're saying crazy shit or saying hurtful things, keep in mind that let one hour of just sitting still go by. If you're worked up and you're making a decision that's gonna affect someone else's life, take one hour and sit quietly and just chill, baby, and see what's up in an hour. See how you still, if you still feel that way in an hour, okay, but people make all sorts of really, really foreign decisions to their own personality when they're worked up like that. So it happened to me in Montana where I came around a corner in February and on this highway and we were going about 65 miles prior and I come around this blind curve and when we come around the curve, there's four vehicles, including two cop cars and there's been a car accident. And so I now go to hit my brakes and what's happened is on that curve, there's a patch of black ice and that's what caused that initial accident. So I go to hit my brakes, guess what? No brakes. No brakes. So now I'm sliding, I've got two people in the car with me and it becomes a game of freaking like real life dodge, real life dodge, try to steer an uncontrolled vehicle through cars and also the police officer who was out in the middle of the road to try to assist. So as I'm realizing, there's no way in hell we're gonna stop, we barely miss one collision. We come around, I'm like somehow managing to steer this sliding vehicle just around. I'm laying down on the horn to alert everyone. We squeezed by Duncan. It was like, it was the type of thing where my passenger, everyone was like gripping on to the seats, ready for the wreck, you're preparing for the wreck and everyone's like, you're seeing it in slow motion and everyone's like fuck, fuck, fuck, good job, good job, job. You know, like as it's like going through, like good job, go get, fuck, fuck, fuck, go, fuck, fuck, fuck. And then we made it through and immediately what happens, start to pull over on like slow down the other side, police car, the police officer gets back in his car, peels after me, almost slides into me with his sirens going. He pulls me over and immediately comes up, he's worked up angry. He thinks that I've just recklessly driven into the situation. He ended up getting me a ticket for reckless driving in a situation where we did everything in our power to avoid hurting anybody in the situation that we had no control over. I later, thank God for the Montana court system in this tiny little town where I was able to go, compared to living in LA, it was amazing. I went into court and went in front of a judge and got it waved and- Like on that same day? No, like a month later in a really- What do you mean, you went back to Montana? I was up there working on a movie. Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, and Montana's amazing though. But yeah, police officers were so- Did the cops show up to court? No, no. But it was interesting from our perspective because he clearly was his adrenaline was pumping so much. And it's like, in that moment, you remembered what you just said. This guy, it's not like he's some universal cop who was born from a cop mother and cop father. You almost hit him. He was just a person who was scared and fallible and he was so emotionally worked up that he ended up making an impulse decision to use his power to just give us a ticket as some way to be like- Release that pressure. Release that pressure. And but yeah, totally, I don't know. So it's funny. So you understand, they're freaked out, man. They're freaked out. So everyone's freaked out. But really the thing is, I think the problem is, we're not paying them enough. Like I think that if you, cops and teachers, like if we could like, if cops were making doctors' salaries, so it's this hyper competitive job to get. And what goes into it is like, years of like psychological conditioning to learn how to calm yourself in all situations. That's what it is, man. I think the solution, it sounds so counterintuitive, which is you don't want to reward them. But I swear to God, man, if these fucking cops out here are making a fucking shit ton of money so that to get a job as a police officer wasn't that easy, then I think things would change. And if teachers were making doctor's salaries, then things would change in that world too, because kids would be, that's the answer. Let's pay these, let's fucking code our pork with money and turn it into lambs, mate. Well yeah, in any given situation, in any given situation, always put education at the fore. I mean, this is, I don't know. We're on this tour, we're having such far out experiences and we're talking, we're trying to solve the world problems. You got blasted by you, the pigs pulled you over. Mikey, I don't blame you, I would be, I'm still angry about the fucking checkpoint we went through on the Canada coming here. Yeah, we had a very equally bizarre, sort of shitty experience there. The dark, the eyes of the dragon have fallen upon us twice and it's kind of annoying. But ultimately, you get to decide what you want to tune into. The idea is, you got a little poison dart from the fucking state today. And the idea is you can't let it fester inside of you that long. No, I reject, no, I'll spit that venom out. Spit that venom out, God is love. This has been an incredible tour. It's been so nice hanging out with you, Mikey. It's been so fun. Thank you, Duncan. It's a magical few weeks. Yeah, and we were saying, and this is a cool thing and I hope people get to experience this throughout their lives is that you go on these sort of experiences and you come back radically a different person. And it's amazing that in such a short amount of time that can happen. And on this trip, there have been, like when you were a kid and you felt like the back of your knees hurting as you're growing, as the bones are growing. I've had that sensation like in my brain multiple times throughout this tour. So it's been really, yeah. So thank you for the opportunity. Of course, man. Thank you for crushing it up there and for crushing it here. You guys have no idea the hard work, Mikey, has been doing while I've been lounging around in my royal suite. Thank you, Mikey. I'm very grateful. Thanks for everything that you've done. Yes. And how can people find you? Check out Two Wet Crew. That's the project that I'm working on. And when we were talking with Alex and Allison Gray and seeing the world that they were building, I was realizing that there are actually more similarities in the sort of psychedelic world of Two Wet Crew than I realized. And so that's a project I'm becoming more and more proud of. And I know we have our wethead fans out there that it's nice to meet some of them out on the road. And then also, yeah, I got my own projects. I got my own ideas. Mikey Kampman, Michael Kampman, whatever. Check me out on whatever. I don't really actually. Check him out on Twitter. I'll have all the links at DuncanTrussell.com. Thank you, Mikey. I'll talk to you in about one second because you're still going to be here with me. OK, bye. That was Mikey Kampman, everybody.

The monolith was first found earlier this month by rangers in the Utah desert during a wildlife survey. No one officially knows who created the object of what it was. Monolith. A large single upright block of stone. Greetings friends, it is I.D. Trussell. This is the Ducket Trussell family. Our podcast, that song you just heard was called Mysteries of the Monolith. It's from Gerard Rune's new album. Monolith Songs, which is going to be available on Magna Rex records in July. Today has been one of my favorite days of all time. So I'm going to bore you with it. I woke up early with the baby. Made breakfast for him. Grits in this incredible banana pancake recipe that I found on a diet app because I want to lose weight. It's you basically take two eggs and one banana and you mix them together. And then you use olive oil. I think I'm not supposed to use that oil and you cook the pancakes. I think this is essentially a crepe, but I haven't taken the time to look up crepe recipes. And then you add yogurt and blueberries to it. So I made these banana pancakes and grits for forest and in all my life, I can't think of much that is more pleasing than listening to your kid eat food and in between bites say things like yummy, yummy, yummy. I don't know. All my years of hedonism, all the money spent on a variety of psychotropic cocktails to induce pleasant states of consciousness, nothing compares to just something as simple as that. And then I came to the studio and I had one of the greatest conversations maybe I've ever had with today's guest, Douglas Rushkoff. All thanks to Conor Abib who connected us. It's a great conversation you're about to hear. Rushkoff is a genius and you're about to find out why. We're going to jump right in to this podcast, but first this.

We're going to jump right into this episode of the DTFH, but first I want to address something that has happened so that y'all hear my side of the story. I'm sure by now you've heard that listeners of the DTFH have been experiencing a variety of attacks from birds and small animals. Many of our listeners have sustained pretty severe wounds, beak wounds, from flocks of crows coming out of nowhere, as I'm told, and just falling upon them, attacking them. They go for the eyes, apparently. Fortunately, the people who were attacked by these flocks were wearing glasses or covered their eyes so that they weren't blinded. They go for the nipples. I didn't know this about crow attacks, but if they can get through your shirt, they're going to try to rip your nipple off your chest. They use it for their nests. They feed their youngs with it. Here's what I know. These attacks are happening to listeners of this podcast, and I've had my research team look into these attacks, the squirrel attacks that happen in Portugal. Horrible, horrible. Somebody lost a pinky to that, to three squirrels who apparently were passing it among each other, not eating it, but just weirdly passing it to each other, holding it in their mouths and giving it to the next squirrel. Fucked up. The weasels in Sweden, ferrets, whatever you want to call them, I guess some ferrets made their way out of an aquarium and did some damage to the back of a listener's neck. Stitches. What they all have in common is that they weren't subscribers to my Patreon, which you can find at patreon.com forward slash DTFH, and this is not some veiled threat. I am not orchestrating these animal attacks. I'm not using sonic beams to send random packs of small animals after my listeners. That would be horrible. That would be horrible. I love all my listeners, not just the folks who have subscribed to my Patreon. And I have a team of lawyers, if anybody wants to come at me and try to be fancy and say that I had anything to do with any of these attacks, I didn't. But I will tell you what every single person subscribed to my Patreon has not sustained any attack from any small animal in the last many months. And that is a kind of assurance, I guess all of you can have, that if you subscribe to my Patreon, not only will you have access to commercial free episodes of the DTFH, not only will you be able to join us three times a week for our Tuesday group meditation journey into boredom, our Wednesday book club where right now we're reading Gris for the Mill or our Friday family gatherings, not only will you have instant access to our massive ever-growing library of content, not only will you be able to experience the association of your family on our Patreon Discord server, but you will protect yourself from the possibility that one day while you walk outside to go to your car, you suddenly get attacked mercilessly by animals that up until that point you probably thought were cute. And I can't guarantee that the animal attacks aren't going to start happening with bigger animals, bears, pit bulls, alligators. There's a lot of big animals out there folks, a lot of big animals, and if someone had a way to control them, you know, I'm sorry. I've just been reading this book, How to Create a Successful Podcast, and like the first rule is in the first five minutes of your podcast, try to threaten your audience and terrify them into joining your Patreon. If you guys don't join the Patreon, it's fine with me. I'm just happy that you listen. And I got to tell you, podcasting, it's my favorite thing to do on the planet, because I get to have conversations with people I normally would never have a chance to interact with. Douglas Rushkoff has been named one of the world's 10 most influential intellectuals by MIT, and they meant it. He is brilliant. He's written a plethora of books. Is that how you say it? Plethora? Plethora. That sounds like somebody who fights dinosaurs in the ancient times. He's written many great books. I wasn't named one of the top intellectuals by MIT. I can't pronounce plethora. Plethora? I'm not going to look it up. Regardless, thanks to Connor Habib, I connected with Mr. Rushkoff, and we had the conversation that you're about to hear. Definitely check out his book, Team Human. It's amazing. Not only is he a great philosopher, he's a really good writer. All right, everybody, strap in, and welcome to the DTFH, the great Douglas Rushkoff. Douglas Rushkoff. Welcome to the DTFH. Douglas Rushkoff, thank you so much for being here. Do you want me to call you Doug or Douglas? How do people refer to you? Douglas is kind of more fun for me. Okay, Douglas it is. Awesome. Douglas it is. Well, okay, so I'm just going to start off with this beautiful passage from your book, Team Human. We're moving from one understanding of our place in things to another. The renaissance may have brought us from tribal to the individual, but our current renaissance is bringing us from individualism to something else. We're discovering a collective sensibility that's more dimensional and participatory than the unconsciously formed communities of the past. We had to pass through the stage of individualism in order to get there. Wow, this is the best, and as you know, the weird thing about the experience of the world right now, I think is that maybe more people than would admit it have this odd sense that we are on the precipice, not of some catastrophic thing, but some kind of renaissance, and yet I had no way to really make sense of that until I started reading this chapter in your book and I wonder if you could go deeper into it for us. I mean sure, I mean it happens in a way the easiest way to understand it is how it happens in a human being. You know, a baby is born and it thinks it's one with its mother, and that's kind of like our kind of more original indigenous first people stage, you know, one with the planet, we're just part of this bigger mother organism, and then you kind of develop your sense of separateness. Oh, that's my mom and I'm me, you know, and you get your terrible twos and threes. No, no, no, I'm a part, I have my ego, I'm something, it's about me, me, me, me, me, me, and you see the kid all selfish and my toy and give me this, you know, and all that until they get to be about adolescent, and then they're like, ooh, look at those other people over there, kind of want to touch them and, you know, get them inside them and them inside me, so you want to break down your ego to then become a real adult, an intimate adult, and I feel like that's kind of where we are as a society now is we had our kind of tribal phase, then we moved through the Renaissance and the Renaissance, you know, it was both bad and good, you know, the good thing is that we invented really or reinvented the individual, the Renaissance is the rebirth, that's what the word means, the rebirth of old ideas in a new context, so we rebirthed all those ancient Greek notions of the individual and, you know, and the central state and the authority and all, but the Vitruvian man, you know, that image of that guy standing in like a cross or an X, sort of this perfect human individual, that's when we got the individual, and all the Renaissance inventions were really based on the individual perspective, you know, we got the printing press, so everybody got their own Bible and could read it and interpret it individually, we got Protestantism, which is about your individual salvation, we got perspective painting, which is about this is how this looks from a particular point of view, you know, so all of these things, it was a new dimension that each person has their own perspective and it got us to the enlightenment and one man, one vote and individual rights and beautiful stuff, but now we're in a place where it's like, wow, we've really pushed this cult of individual thing a bit too far, right, you know, we have you, you're the one, you deserve a break today, it's the me generation, it's about you, because the consumerism loves individuals because we don't want, you know, we don't want you sharing a lawn mower with your neighbor, we want you get your own lawn mower and they get their own lawn mower and do more jobs and more stuff and individual, individual, but now we're like, we're realizing, wait a minute, and I do believe, and this is sort of the way I looked at the rise of the internet and digital technology back in the late 80s and early 90s, I was like, oh wow, this is going to be the next Renaissance, the last Renaissance we got perspective painting, this Renaissance we get fractals and holographs, you know, the last one we got circumnavigation of the globe, this one we orbit the globe from space, you know, the last one we got the printing press, this one we get the internet and the computer, you know, so each of the things that we got, you know, are kind of the new levels of dimensionality, where the last one we got the individual, this one we get this kind of fractal collective multiplicity kind of rave like collective point of view and as a result, the things that get rebirthed are the opposite of what got rebirthed last time in the last Renaissance, we got the corporation, the chartered monopoly, we got central currency, we got colonial powers and expansion and exponentialism and linear thinking, this one, we're going to get the opposite and we are, we're getting all those medieval things that got repressed, witchcraft and women and craft beers and hands on and, you know, occultism and all these new, the I Ching, I mean, the sensibilities that were really repressed the last time out end up rebirthed now, so, assuming we can make it through this strange labor that we're in, I'm really hopeful about what this new Renaissance can bring. The book did a great job in helping me really understand how what you call, I'm assuming you invented the term singular, singularitists, what are we, what are they called? Dudes, these dudes, I mean, I don't know, singularitists are singularitans. Ciglaritans. Yeah, I mean, the people, yeah, who believe in the singularity, but that was the impetus for the book. I was on a panel with this guy, you know, one of these famous dudes who thinks he's going to upload his consciousness to a chip. Yes. And he was saying, you know, that, that human beings have to accept that we're going to be replaced by the machines, that evolution is the journey of information towards more complex states. So it went from, you know, atoms to molecules to organelles to organisms to human to society, and now computers are better at information than we are, so we should just pass the evolutionary torch to them and accept our inevitable decline and extinction. And I was like, no, dude, this is, this is terrible, you know, there's, there's a place for humans in the digital future, you know, human beings can do stuff that computers can't, we can get in the soft squishy places between stuff, not just ones and zeros, but what's in between a human being, you know, can watch a David Lynch movie and, and not understand what it meant and still experience that as pleasure, right? That's beautiful. We could sustain paradox over time. Human beings deserve a place. And he said, oh, Rushkoff, you're just saying that because you're human, right? Like it's, like it's hubris. So that's when I said, fine, guilty. I'm on team human. Yes. I love it. May I just, I just wanted to connect to the Renaissance aspect of it and what this cleared a lot of cobwebs out of my head because in my sort of, I don't know, thinking about the Renaissance and wondering what it could be, there was some of that in there. This idea of like, well, maybe the Renaissance is McKenna's end of time. Maybe it's the invention of a time machine. Maybe it's the some, something so astounding that it completely collapses all of civilization. And I don't think I realized what an empty aspiration that was and what a, a kind of complete den, just denouncement of all the beauty in the world. What you're saying, sustaining paradox over time. It's such a beautiful thing about humans and humans, then we're, we're fine. But this, this transhumanist, and I don't want to bash transhumanist too much, because there's things that I think are hopefully going to be part of the and beautiful in that vision too. Yeah, beautiful. But still, you know, once I did, I had a conversation with an author, Mirabai Starr, and she pointed out how in certain ways of thinking in the spiritual community, specifically those that involved in personalism or the complete sort of merging of the identity into all things are actually weirdly misogynistic in the sense that they kind of in those states of consciousness, how are you going to be a mom? Like, you know, it's a dude thing to be like, you know what I mean? I'm going to go, I'm going to put myself in a chip, you raise the baby, I'll be in the chip, you know what I mean? Totally. It's another version of the dudes, you know, throwing frisbee on the beach while the women were back, you know, cleaning their pot, right? Yeah. You know, it's a, it's like, yeah, y'all do your whatever your girls stuff. I'll be in the web, baby. See you later. I don't need this body. And it's really, and that's why, you know, that your book got me on Team Human, help me remember, oh yeah, that is what matters. And I'm a dad. Are you a, do you have kids yet? Yeah. Yeah, I got a 15 year old daughter. I know it brings you back to the ground in a real way. It sure does. It sure does. But I want it just because in your, the path, the, when you were writing about the Renaissance, you, you mentioned, and I didn't know this. So I don't even know why I'm thinking about a future Renaissance when I barely know the past Renaissance, but you were talking about going from perspective 2D to 3D. And that made me think, well, maybe it's not holograms or VR. Do you ever speculate that it could be a new way that we look at time? Well, it's gotta be, right? I mean, in the end, it has to be. That would be the, that would be the fourth dimension. I ended up writing this other book before this called Present Shock, where I was looking at the collapse of time in this kind of, that the always on internet thing, the fact that we can live in the state of, you know, emergency interruption that only 911 operators or whatever used to have to endure. Now we do it, you know, just as a matter of course, notifications and all that. And we have these sort of multiple instances of ourselves existing simultaneously, like there's your Twitter self is still there, even though we're talking here. God knows, somebody might right now be reacting to something you said yesterday on Twitter, and you're like in the middle of getting canceled without even feeling it because you're not there. So it's scary, right? It's all that. So when you can't live in more than one place at the same time, yet we're sort of doing that. So it feels like it is the beginning of that, of that thing of, if you're on more than one timeline, then you're kind of in the beginnings of time travel. Whoa. Yeah, like then in this, maybe, like the QAnon stuff, the, or the, or just the simple like seeming bifurcation of reality between two main political factions, where you can jump to one news network and see one version of reality, jump to the other one and a completely different version of reality is happening. One version pandemic, wear a mask, we're all going to die. This is, this is the, the great kid, the other one, it's like, well, it's bad, but we need to relax a little bit because it's not that bad. And it's like, we're, it is weird. And if two people could have full lifetimes on this planet at the same time, you'd experience those two different narratives, right? He lived in two different, it's like the Philip K. Dick sort of man in the high tower. It's like, it all depends which show you're watching, right? Yes. And then this, this, you know, as I do love conspiracy theories and honestly, I feel a bit bummed that the conspiracy universe has been, you know, infected with Trumpism and with like, it's been sort of hijacked, if you ask me, I mean, I mean, I love it too. I love it. I don't object to any of the content really of almost any conspiracy theory, even the ones that, you know, have, have, have people like me, like sucking the blood out of children, whatever, you know, go for it, think it, but, but the problem is with this one, with the QAnon one, it got, it's being accepted literally rather than as this metaphor. And as a metaphor, I mean, it's true, basically, the working class is being infantilized and fucked in the ass, right? By the neoliberal elite, right? So I get it. They are like abused children, not being treated with, with, with respect or proper care by their guardians. So I get it, but it's not real. They're not actual. Hillary Clinton is not taking nine year old girls and sucking the adrenochrome out of their brains. It feels like it though. And that, and we lose access to that, to that metaphor, once we, once we grind it down into, into literal sense. That is wild. Yeah. That's, and maybe that's where the sort of the resonance, the sense that this is real is happening because, yeah, I get it. On one level, it's real on another level. Give me a break. I mean, if there was adrenochrome out there by now, we would have heard of it for sure. Like, right now we'd be having this conversation feeling bad because inside we'd be like, well, you know, there is adrenochrome. I've never encountered it, heard of it, seen it. We've both been to burning, man. It's not there. No, we would have done this anywhere. It would have either been there or I would be able to find it with my tour browser on the dark web, right? It doesn't show up. If I could get DMT vape pens, I'd be able to get adrenochrome, right? Exactly. Yeah. If you can get literally stacks of cocaine bricks off the dark web, you can probably get adrenochrome. But this, you know, this sort of weird, get-soid split of default reality between various people is really curious and seems to be weirdly, I don't know. I don't get into astrology that much, but there's this conjunction that's happening. Do you know about this? It's coming up. Yeah. The real age of Aquarius is finally going to hit like in the next few weeks. Yeah. I mean, there's that. I look at, I mean, I guess because I'm more of a media theorist, I tend to look at it as the first effects of the digital media environment, you know, that there's this, well, on the one hand, digital media environment is so much about memory. Everything's happening, you know, everything's happening in memory the way we're looking at it. But moreover, it's like we relate to our media and our stories more as programs. So it's like, I'm, I'm on, almost like a drug, I'm on QAnon. What are you on? Oh, I'm on MSNBC. And so it's like, I'm going to let Morning Joe program me. And, you know, and it's, it's this sense, I wrote this other book, Program or Be Programmed, which is kind of about that, that in a digital age, your media programs you and then your behaviors and your attitudes, it's like we, it's not that the algorithms are going to get us, it's that we are treating ourselves like algorithms, not like human beings. So we get certain programming and then, you know, and, and the way, the way I'm judging if it's a good program or not is, does it make the person hard and ideological or does it make them soft and squishy and open? Like whatever you're on, I want to be on that, right? You're soft and squishy and open. You, you are capable, no matter how weird your guest, almost in an art bell-like way, you can kind of try on what they're saying. Oh, you let it run through you, but you don't grab onto it, you know, and that's the thing. Some of these programs, they don't let, they don't let us process them. They try to, they try to nest inside us and become our permanent program. And that's, that's the fucked up part. The cookies. That, you know, it's, it is, it's cookies. Yeah. Right there. Yeah. I'll clear your cash. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I want to thank Storyworth for sponsoring this episode of DTFH. Storyworth is one of the coolest, most innovative ideas I've seen out there in a long time. It's an online service that helps your loved ones share stories through thought-provoking questions about their memories and personal thoughts. It's a way for you to engage with your family, especially those you can't see in person. I'm a podcaster. I love having conversations with people who I've never met, but for some reason, it's more difficult for me to ask questions to my own family. And Storyworth solves that problem for you by sending your family members really interesting questions. Things that you maybe normally would never think to ask, like, what were your grandparents like? One of my most prized possessions, I don't know if you call it a possession, is the podcast that I did with my mom before she left this particular plane of reality. It's nice to have a reservoir of information. And look, when I was growing up and my parents started going on about their grandparents or my grandparents started going on about their parents, I didn't want to hear that shit. I wanted to watch TV. I wanted to steal sherry that my grandmother had in a little cabinet and drink it. I didn't think to really listen. I wish I had. I'm not trying to guilt trip y'all, but I'm telling you, it's nice to have a little repository, a little reservoir of data. And that's what Storyworth sends you. Because at the end of the year, they compile all the stories and photos into a beautiful keepsake book that they ship to you for free. This is a great thing to have, even if you're not sentimental like I am now that I've got a kid and I'm 46, even if you're not sentimental, it's a nice way to connect to family members that maybe you haven't connected to or lost touch with. It's a really brilliant thing. And I hope you'll subscribe. You can give your loved ones the gift of spending time together wherever you live with Storyworth. Get started right away with no shipping required by going to storyworth.com slash Duncan. You'll get $10 off your first purchase. That's storyworth.com slash Duncan for $10 off. Thanks, Storyworth. That's what it is. It's like these sort of, yeah, this is again, as I contemplate the incoming neural lace or mesh. Is it lace or mesh? Why do I turn into lace? It's not brain lingerie. It's mesh. Or is it lace? I like lace. It's like lace. Neural lace. That's nice. The incoming ability. Yes. I'm wearing black brain lace right now. That's all a metaphor. Mesh is a metaphor anyway. So go with lace. Yeah. It's the ability to sort of quantify thoughts, potentially download dreams, all these things that the transhumanists dream about. To me, it's the possibility of one day being able to scan my identity and see the variety of these, whatever you want to call them, parasitic or symbiotic memes that are inhabiting, that are hiving inside of me so that I could understand. Because you know how much of what we're up to is from what you're talking about, from being implanted with an insidious tightening, whatever you want to call it. What was the comparison you were using between a reed and a? Like a river reed and a cedar tree. Cedar tree. How many cedar tree style, unrelenting, unshifting, tight, brutal ideologies are we currently being inhabited by that we're not even aware of? I know. And those, when you talk about it, it makes me think, those are the splinters. Those are the splinters in your eye, the plank in your eye that Christ was talking about. It's like, you got to take the plank out of your eye before you can take it out of someone else's because it's in you. You're not even seeing straight, right? You've got an algorithm nested in your vision. Wow, that's so interesting. And this, did you ever get into the course of miracles? You ever got into those books at all? Oh, yeah, a little bit. Yeah. I started, you know, just looking at it and reading it. And what I found, and I didn't do the day by day thing, I'm like, fuck that, I'm not going to do daily exercise advice. I was going through it kind of trying to understand it. It's channeled material, which is interesting. But the idea seems to be something along the lines of we are like these, this splinter or whatever you want to call it, all the apps running in our identity, they're acting as a kind of, I don't know, perfectly shaped. Like if, if there were a keyhole peering into paradise or something, then all those things have filled that keyhole up. So we're essentially our very almost identity or most of what we are is literally blocking our ability to see. We've been blinded by these things. And it, don't you feel like some of these splinters or whatever you want to call them, they're being placed there intentionally. It's like there's an intentionality to it. Why do you think that is? Why, why would there be people out there? I'm not saying it's Morning Joe necessarily. No, it's, I mean, it starts because it's, it's advertising. That's the television model, right? Is create people's realities for them. That's, that's the way you sell. Or, you know, and I wrote this book way back when called media virus, which helped launch viral media. And I didn't realize it was going to become what it became because I didn't think of it as marketing. I thought of it as sort of cultural agendas, like the Rodney King tape and things like that were happening out of control. But then people looked at it, marketers did and said, Oh, memes, I get it. Memes are the things that we can nest in another person. And only thing a meme does is says, make me, make me it, you get a meme in you, and then you're compelled to share it. Like, Oh, you know, whatever the Q non meme, Democrats are, are, you know, molesting little children and taking their thing. Once you find out, you've got to tell somebody because, Oh my God, it's, it's so horrible. So we end up becoming like the machine that's played, but you're right. The more of these you have, the more they obscure your ability to see anything else. And now that we spend all our time on these meme machines, just looking at scrolling through crap, you know, on these various networks, there's so little left. But you know, the thing I keep arguing for people to do, just to recalibrate is just to look, look in the eyes of another person. And you reactivate, you know, 800,000 years of, of evolutionary systems that were designed to allow you to establish rapport and connect and get soft and human again. I want to ask you base, based on what you're saying, where is your inspiration coming from? If the effect of these sort of malicious or ambivalent digital memes is that it produces a dehumanized state. When I'm reading your writing, which is really not just interesting, but good writing, like you're a really good writer. But where's your inspiration coming from? If, if not these memes, if most of us, you know, like it brings to mind those horrible parasitic, um, the fungus that gets into creatures and makes them go into the water and shit out these horrible worms. It's like, I become that when I'm like coming home to my wife and being like, so did you, did you hear what about the earthquake, COVID, whatever it is, you know, the, it's like the worm comes pouring out of my mouth. If, if that's what is the sort of, I don't know, symptom of being infected with these things, where is your inspiration coming from? What is it that is cleared the cobwebs for you? Or how are you, where are you sourcing this stuff from? I mean, one, one, one place that I know you certainly got it too was, um, you know, after my daughter was born, when she was like, you know, one years old and would just like lie on my chest naked or whatever, you know, this, this, you get this, this some kind of oxytocin rush, but it's more than that. It's like the whole evolutionary something just happens and you're like, Oh my God, I've been with this soul so many times. And now I'm the grown up and she's the baby, but she's trusting me. And this thing happens when you realize, and, and once you connect to that, you get that feeling, then you can see, I can't anyway, you can see and feel kind of echoes of that, you know, depth of connection in all sorts of things. I mean, for me, it's always looking for the liminal, like the, the soft squishy places when you find, I used to walk around New York City just looking for other people who weren't on their smartphone and make eye contact with them. And it's like, you're part of the secret conspiracy of that, you know, it's like, we're not the body snatched. Oh, there's another one. And you almost have a smile with them of like, Oh, I get it. Hi. So there's them or, you know, like I said, like David Lynch, just watching Twin Peaks the return or listening to a Neil Young record or, or, or your show. I mean, there's, there's these people in places that go in the in between, the unguarded in between liminal place. And it's like, Oh, they're here. So it's, for me, it's, it's kind of live, live people. And then the artifacts of people who are celebrating and, and recording the, those liminal experiences that the in between space. When was the last time that you found yourself in the valley of the shadow of death in a place, you know what I'm talking about? Like, do you, do you, you're, your energy, it feels so beautiful and optimistic and real. And that's why everyone loves your books. And that's why, but when, how often do you find your, sometimes I just find myself not lately, but lately I've just been feeling this, you know, basic elemental joy about being a dad and having a family. And I, and I love it. And it's wonderful. But there's a piece of me that's like, Oh man, how long before you land back in that place where you are numbed down, you are completely lost in the phone, you are doom scrolling, as they say it. When was the last time that happened to you? Or does it happen to you anymore? A week or two ago, you know, it happened to the point. I, I actually had a, I did a signal talk with a friend and I actually cried because I was so there. Yeah, this, this, you know, one of my very best friends in the world who'd been a light, you know, what I thought anyway, a light QAnon thinker user. After the election happened, he's got really mad at me. He said, you know, you got blood on your hands. This, you know, Biden is gonna, you know, he's gonna resurrect the war machine and the kids of all these, you know, red state, you know, truck driving people that you don't like, you know, they're gonna all go to war and die. And this is on your hands. I'm so, you know, you know, I hope you relish, hope you relish that. And I was like, Oh man, man, I mean, and, and I just didn't know. You know, I've had my own cult experiences, certainly even back in the cult, even the, in the course of miracles days, you know, I experimented with stuff and I know what it's like to start believing in a system more than, than anything else. But this was so, it just, it hurt so much because I walk around. I mean, like you, I walk around with my soft squishy underbelly just open. Here I am. This vulnerable, softest, stickiest little part of me is just open, especially with my friends. And for someone to go in and just stab right on it, it was like, Oh, it was, you know, it worse than losing any girlfriend I ever lost or anything. It was just brutal. And so it was a dark place. I don't know if it was that I was so programmed or something, but so capable of being hurt by the program, you know, really being, being, being, being hurt. It's, it's a, it's a, it's a cash, it's a cash, you would that if, if what, you know, you, you made a brilliant observation saying that this weird sort of data, but like split this schizoid parallel info timelines that we're all living in simultaneously as a sort of the result of us getting used to technology. Then your friend and friends, I have friends like that, not quite as bad. No one's like, turn the knife in my stomach yet. But certainly I have experienced a distance to say the least between people who, who, you know, subscribe to that ideology. And it's a casualty. It's some kind of, I mean, this QAnon thing to me, it just smells like, and saying this makes me sound like one of them, it smells like a psyops. It smells like an intentional, like some kind of intentional attack using, doesn't that, doesn't it feel like that to you? That's the way I thought about 911 conspiracies, because the open conspiracy was bad enough. We trained the guy. I mean, just the regular news story is so damning that the crazy news stories, you know, the conspiracy theories distract us from the true real world crimes that happen without even going to the weird place. So yeah, I suspect that a lot that these are, that these are that. But you know, in answer to your real question, I have felt myself fall into the program. Like, one of the programs is in the digital age and with us now publishing and content creators, you want to be the guy who came up with the thing and gets credit for it, right? If you come up with a great joke and you see, you know, some other comedian doing it, it's like, fuck, man, that was my bit. And they're, you know, and, and you don't want to get mad, but you do because it's like, I want credit for that. So, you know, I, I, when I went into that, these, these guys, they're these guys, they did this movie on the social dilemma about, you know, you know, social media and all that. And these guys are all like quoting my stuff with no credit and all. And I'm like, all right, whatever. I got to look at it as good. You know, these are the first bad guys I was able to chip off from the big digital machine. I'm going to be above it. They're using my words. I don't need credit. I don't need that. And then they call me, like, they call me and say, we're going to launch a new website. We want to make sure it's okay with you. But, you know, we're calling it team humanity. What? It's like, dude, I just read a book called team human. You can't just go. I got so mad. I got so mad, but it was so, I didn't get mad on the surface with, I said, good, it's fine. It's whatever. And I quickly made a YouTube saying, look, there's this thing coming up. We've got to welcome these guys. They're just tech bros. They need to feel like it's their thing. Like they came up with it. So just welcome them. And someday maybe they'll, you know, realize that we're all doing the same thing. But inside, I'm thinking, I got damn motherfuckers. You know, this is my thing. I want credit. Why do I always end up, you know, running around trying to sell six books. And, you know, millionaires are out there and bam. And that's when I realized, no, wait a minute, you're in the program. You're in capitalism. You're stuck looking for credit, looking for money, you know, and not really doing the thing that I'm preaching, which is, you know, just be the change. Just engage with people and watch how things change. They're changing. They're coming to my side and I'm not welcoming it because I want credit. You know, so that's me falling into the trap.

I've gone to so many Ram Dass retreats and I've seen some of these great teachers speak and I've marveled at their patients doing exactly what you've done, which is like for sure you want to talk about like people like with in comedy it's if you are identified as a joke thief you just just hang up you're done hang up it might not happen right away but you will there's some it's self-police and you're it's doom it's doom you can't steal jokes it's a you just can't it won't work at least in the before times I don't know maybe now but the in the spiritual community you know you see this is a thing that happens which is that people's writing gets lifted people get their some of their main core like pillars of their teachings just get lifted and with zero credit and and if they were to even you know show any sign of being pissed off it would almost negate their teaching you know and but and and so it's a beautiful thing when you watch them relinquish that and they really don't care and you realize they don't really they don't it's fine for them they're they're doing the dandelion and the wind thing it's really but where but the people who rip it off they're denying themselves the connection to the legacy yes in other words they value this idea that of novelty I've come up with something new the new new thing and what they've lost touch with you know as you get back in in in older religions you know in the myth of eternal return there's nothing new under the sun you can't say something new that the the indigenous people got this that there's there's the gods have already done it someone before you has done it you know they had two circles everything you do is an imitation of something that went before right and everything's going to come back everything reincarnates and once you accept that it's like you want it's going to feel better if you can accept the resonances of the thing that you said it's it's your legacy it's your elders it's your teachers it's your partners yeah they are denying themselves the privilege of of of rapport of comrades of solidarity and that's sad that's stuck in the last renaissance in the in the individual in the culture of the individual and you know what else they're doing is they're they're uh it's like the other thing that's great about citing people when you can remember that you were saying something that they said is that you connect everyone you know it's like it's it's a gift it's like when I when I'm quoting Sharon Salzburg I like to say Sharon Salzburg not just because I don't want to be the person who ripped off Sharon Salzburg which would make me just feel like the worst person on earth but also I want people to find Sharon Salzburg it's like they're cutting people off from you and your great books and that's right exactly we're all trailheads to each other you know yeah we're all links you know you want to like create like a that that's a to me this is the part of if I'm going to drop into like a creeped out despair state the way that I'm going to do it is by recognizing how quickly history lineage connection truth can just be obliviated can just be wiped out do you know what's the name of that great conspiracy theory it's uh big mud have you heard this one you know I'm talking about no it's like I'm saying it wrong it's basically the idea is that history as we understand it it's completely wrong that there was some disaster that happened not like in the lesser driest like Graham Hancock says or not not like in the last ice age but like 500 years ago 600 years ago something happened the world got wiped out and history got completely rewritten now I obviously it wouldn't be that hard for anybody who had a slight understanding of anthropology or pottery fragments or to be like no that's so not true like how do you explain carbon dating on certain things but again if you look at it as the metaphor mm-hmm oh it's scary to think like how how in the same way you just got like iced by these people and just wiped out and in that wiping out they take all the credit complete and and rob people from being able to go dive deeper into your philosophy but uh it which is a kind of a form of a weird kind of murder but it's a tiny little part of this other possibility you write about the Renaissance you write about team human about this impending beautiful decentralized communal yet somehow the main we can maintain our identity we can share and still without turning into some communist you know what I mean empty void uh but there are don't you have don't you feel like there is another way it could go don't you feel like there's another way with all this beautiful technology uh that it presents obviously the beauty of the team human style Renaissance that you're talking about but it also presents the possibility of something so incredibly sinister that I almost don't want to talk about it jaren linear talks about it this Skinner box thing where the AI hypnotizes us completely keeps us magnetized to specific timelines memes or whatever you want to call it and we can't pull ourselves out I mean honestly it feels more probable than not wow you know if I'm gonna be honest I'm not I'm not optimistic I'm trying to stay hopeful you know and and and maximize the potential for as many of us to get through this as possible but you know we're not breathing together we're not dancing together you know we are we are still really so caught up in the capitalist myth that it's uh it's scary you know that we can't arrest these systems that you know we have the ability of course to stop global warming and climate change and to deal with refugee crises and all these things but we don't have the political or economic will and you know I I feel like our leaders are telling us that you know we can have our cake and eat it too that you know it's like the great reset that the davos wwef people want to do you know with corporations now we're gonna recognize multiple stakeholders and it's like yes we could stay billionaires and fix the world right and it's possible maybe they can't you can only have so many billionaires and a climate at the same time whoa right that's true yeah right yeah that's the this is the um and this again it goes if you while the these people are you know rolling their eyes at the vast number of folks who are uh subscribing to q and on or whatever it may be they're feeding that fire they're they're they're just just enhancing it they don't seem to understand that they they they need us to exist or maybe they're starting to maybe maybe it is you know god you know I don't understand communism I didn't mean to bash it earlier I really I don't think I'm smart enough I've tried you were bashing you were bashing totalitarianism which is a little different a little right the living in communion is like to me I can't like outside of like a perpetual orgasm or something even that's actually that doesn't sound great it kills people I've heard of people with a form of epilepsy where they come to death I don't know if you ever heard of that it's a different podcast but the the the but the the what I'm saying is that Carl as I was in one of my many attempts to try to understand communism by reading Carl Marx yeah early days just upset my dad because it would just freak him out to see like the communist manifesto just laying in my room or something but the Carl Marx writes about this full automation getting to a point where everything's automated and the people who own the mechanism of automation are going to be the ones who become bezos and the people who don't they're going to be irrelevant they're not even going to be able to work there won't be a job for them right and uh it's doesn't seem that that's where we're at right now that's it well that's what's coming that's where the the wealthiest among us think things are going I mean there's this story I it's in the team human book where I thought I was going to go do this talk for these wealthy like hedge funders about the digital future and it turned out to be just five billionaires who wanted advice from me first it was like you know ethereum or bitcoin or you know augmented reality or virtual reality like they're gonna put their money somewhere but then the whole thing was like Alaska or New Zealand you know and we spent an hour I spent an hour with them on the question how do I maintain control of my security force after the event right so they they're gonna have their bunker they're going to be in New Zealand or Alaska or somewhere and they've got the navy seals they hired but their money is worthless so how do they make sure that the navy seals protect them so these guys you know they're already planning right they're taking 20 percent of their money and planning for the the the apocalypse for the the climate change or global unrest or economic crash or electromagnetic pulse or plague or whatever it is that makes the world unlivable but their model is to leave the rest of us behind right wow they're going to get off the planet with their spaceship if they can you know get to mars with alon musk or or go underground for a century or two until the zombie apocalypse is over but if that they get it right so they've been going since the renaissance they've been traveling west earning money going with exponential growth and now building digital technology and now they realize oh shit you know where it's like the coyote off the edge of the cliff they got they're there you can't build out any more society to sustain them so they are as aware they're they believe more than we do in the inevitability of a of a major event crash horrible thing and when those guys if the the the these are the winners these are the winners of the digital economy oh my god are the ones who believe that so i mean yeah and i don't think it's that they see better than we do i think it's that they um they they're they're living life in this in this kind of insulation equation it's like how much money can i earn how much money do i need to earn in order to insulate myself from the reality i'm creating by earning money in this way wow and you can't ever get there it's a you can't it's a it's like some asymptote you can't never reach that it's like how do i build a car that drives fast enough to escape from its own exhaust you know you're gonna come back around the other side of the planet eventually and you'll be in it right okay tell me i gotta know what was the answer for the security force like how do you keep your security force from just taking over your bunker i told them if they want the security force to take care of them in 10 years when they're in the bunker then like pay for their daughter's bat mitzvahs now wow that's what i told they didn't like that answer but you know what i was yeah but you know what i'm saying it's like be nice be fucking nice man you know it's like not shock collars not the secret combination to the safe it's like if you if if 10 years from now they are thinking about killing you to get into the safe and then they remember right before they pull the trigger oh right he paid for my daughter's bat mitzvah i can't kill this guy you know that's that's the way to engender the trust for later i think the bat mitzvah gets you two years max maybe not even that i just think it's a better than nothing you know i i went i interviewed somebody who had a who they had purchased one of these god i don't know uh underground massive underground bases that the u.s military had been using uh and i think it was in a limestone it was in limestone or something it's still there and they were basically you could buy a lot inside this massive massive cave where you could put your you know airstream so it's like a more of a middle class even though airstreams are not middle expensive but it's a way that you know you don't have a level billionaires low level billionaires you know you you got to get there you got to get there but if you can get there then you're going to be in this massive dark cave the pitch that the guy had was he was going to have a wine bar there was going to be a wine bar and he had on display a an rv with some astroturf in front of it with a playground set on it and the darkness of this cave and i'm looking at this guy he's a big guy and i'm just thinking how long before this guy calls a meeting where he makes himself the lord of this universe how long before he gets a message from god telling him that you know look stop getting your wife's pregnant it should just be me how long and that security force question man that's keeping some people up at night to this day isn't it that it is it is and that because that's one of those common questions i get asked by these people but you know the real answer is in is is instead of trying to earn enough money to insulate yourself from the damage you're creating spend your effort making the world a place that you don't need to insulate yourself right you know it's a much much better bet right is avoid apocalypse than than how to survive the apocalypse but is it i i can't remember the book i wish i could there was an essay it was talking about how if what's happening here from an evolutionary perspective is the wealthy have become a kind of economic uh galapagos and they're breeding with themselves they're living with themselves that you're not they they've created these enclaves i believe this person i gosh i wish i could remember it was uh he uses the term or she uses the term uh i don't know economic force fields essentially so you create these you know you you're not there's so many places in the world where maybe you i don't know i know i'm never gonna make it to the bohemian grove it drives me crazy i just want to go i know but but and but within these little sort of bubbles there these converse not just conversations are happening but people are reproducing people are marrying people are and and within that almost like the i guess the hypothesis here is it's creating a new species that it's a creating a branch or something it's trying it's creating a another thing and it ain't it's not us and they don't care you know i don't sound like i'm trying to do a george the george the now that the it's been overplayed that great george carlin bit but it's like it's not like they can't they don't when you tell them that they're like no i don't they don't think of us in the same way because they haven't been hanging out with us maybe for centuries and if they have been hanging out with us it's only because we're cleaning their houses we're bringing them food i have a friend who used to work at one of these fancy super elite places as a waiter he would bring people you know drinks at the pool and he said they don't they don't tip they don't understand the concept of tipping like they they don't they don't do it they they don't they and they don't look at you like you're a human so to me that's the other i don't i don't know why i'm getting so dark with you because no but they don't want they don't want to interact with you i mean that was you know the the big stoned insight i had when i was reading about uh thomas jefferson's dumbwaiter you know that that i remember being taught as a kid oh look what a great invention this is so the servant doesn't have to walk all the way up the stairs with the food they just put it in this thing and you pull a string and it arrives yeah and it's like no it's not why thomas jefferson had it he had it so his he and his his dinner companions wouldn't have to look at the sleigh wow right the food would just arrive like from a star trek replicator there wow so yeah that's the it's it's that sense of of wanting to insulate but the fact is what things like covet are showing is they can't insulate they can't insulate the bugs get in you know the air gets in there's there's just no hermetically sealed tank in a you know in a mountainside in utah that you can go in and even if you do you're gonna fucking die in there you know right there's not going to be light there's not going to be love you and your blue blood blizzard companions you know are de-evolving in order to survive rather than evolving forward because evolution and this is the whole point of that team human book evolution is a team sport that that evolution is not about the survival of the fittest individual that's not what darwin was saying what darwin was saying page after page if you read it it's like look at how species are collaborating and cooperating in order to ensure mutual survival that the path of evolution is towards greater collaboration and cooperation between the members of the species so if we're going to evolve forward as humanity it's because we are working together we're establishing better rapport better solidarity we know as smart people as loving people we know the whole object of the game is to connect with others and isolation kills you babies that don't have their their touch of their mothers they die they quite literally die getting getting fired from a company that you've worked at a long time is experienced as as dramatically as losing a leg and that's because we thrive on connection with others so these people who are disconnecting themselves from their their fellow humans they're they're killing themselves they're they're in a suicide pact and that's why they're thinking about the end of the world because their world their world is ending and we just have to hope they don't take ours along with them this so now i'm going to just to italicize what you just said i'm going to read a small bit from this wonderful bakowski poem called born into this dinosauria have you heard this poem before i don't know read it it's so great but it's uh it says they're rich this is like towards the end of it they're rich in the chosen will watch from space platforms dantes inferno will be made to look like a children's playground the sun will not be seen and it will always be night trees will die all vegetation will die radiated men will eat the flesh of radiated men the sea will be poisoned the lakes and rivers will vanish rain will be the new gold the rotting bodies of men and animals will stink in the dark wind the last few survivors will be overtaken by new and hideous diseases and the space platforms will be destroyed by attrition the petering out of supplies the natural effect of general decay and there will be the most beautiful silence never heard i mean how so this this i think in our conversation this you have illuminated a real problem and it's the problem of ignorance and the ignorance of how we are interdependent and so let's say i am a lizard person listening to this right now let's just say by some impossible stroke of either good or bad fortune i don't know uh uh rupert murdoch you know just randomly picks this podcast and is like shuddering and listening and he suddenly hears he's like rush coughs right what the what have i done i i've got it i've got a what a what do i do rush cough what do i do what do they do i mean what does it look like in a just in a real world way with where it's not about making sure our security forces don't kill us but what you're talking about in team human what do these people do because it's in and that's the first part of the question the second part is is there anything they could do or is it more of like a bottom up thing that has to happen something that we do that hopefully i don't know soaks in to their enclaves and bomb shelters well well in some way they they already did the good thing by mistake you know so these are the westward ho people that you know since the invention of text and the ability to write down our history and write contracts into the future they've been living in this very linear uh very linear timescale where everything is the future and progress and go forward you know and we got colonialism and slavery and exploitation and all those horrible things and they went west and built more and had the industrial age and now the digital age and what they didn't realize was that when they built all these digital technologies digital was different digital is cybernetic cybernetic it means it has feedback there's feedback loops it comes back right so the very last stage of this extremely linear culture ended up being circular they're getting the feedback loops from all of the media and all the stuff that they created it is it comes back so you get it in the form of yeah sure crazy things like QAnon but you get it even with with BLM you know Black Lives Matter and Twitter and nobody knows a corporation doesn't know are they responding to our message or are we responding to their message the the cause and effect the call and response has gone away so Fox News Murdoch's evil propaganda empire Fox News is a feedback they're just they're just putting what's on Twitter they're not they're not generating they are um they're feeding back they're part of a cycle so they've lost they've lost control which is a good thing so you know they pushed so far that that they created their opposite that that the the original the original vision for the whole thing which was you know Francis Bacon back in the Renaissance saying empirical silence will give us the ability to take nature by the forelock hold her down and submit her to our will you know it's a rape fantasy that's what science was supposed to be a rape of nature and women that finally they raped it so hard it's coming back it got pregnant it's pushing through right their feedback mechanisms are happening so so they've been hoisted on their own petard you know in that way which i'm happy about but in terms of if if if and when um one of the billionaires comes to me and says what do i do what do i do 90 percent of the time what they're really asking me is what do i do for myself and my family you know so i'm going to still make this evo-capitalogical addictive technology for everyone else's kids but what do i do with my own should i send them to Rudolf Steiner or Montezori should it's always their thing right usually but but what i would tell someone who actually cared is first scale down you can't do anything at scale at what at corporate scale it just doesn't work these are monsters they are they are these corporations they are truly monsters they are they are alien gods that that cannot exist they cannot coexist with human beings that that they should start living their life at scale which means walking on the ground looking into other people's eyes i i i would tell them take 10 minutes a day to sit with another human being and not do anything just see if you can tolerate 10 minutes with a person and then work up from there you know so it's sort of that because what happened is they've decalibrated whether it was capitalism or staring at stock charts or looking in computers they've decalibrated their human organism their their their their soul has not spoken to them and so long they've they've auto-tuned they've really auto-tuned their soul and you know it's it's it's what happened to pharaoh in in torah you know god said it god says um i'm gonna harden his heart the pharaoh when he was being so mean his heart gets hardened and that to me means he lost his free will his heart was hardened his he could no longer have free will he could only do the awful thing he could only not let the jews go or the israelites leave or whatever it was and these folks too they've i think that they've they've calcified or concretized frozen their free will you know they've gone into full petrified wood cedar stage you know yeah and so they've gotta soften they've gotta and the only way to do that is to be really you gotta reconnect with others so find your wife or your mistress or your child or whatever it is you've got look in their eyes you know and that will recalibrate breathe in sync with the other person you know it's so simple but once you do one of those guys if rupert murdoch looked at a

153^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 493: Peter Kalmus Transcript and Discussion^2022-02-17^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, pals. I've just returned from Los Angeles, the city of angels. And in case you didn't know, that's what it meant, Los Angeles. Sometimes I've thought that was a very sarcastic name for the city. Sometimes I have thought that that was a very sinister name for the city. But having just returned, I've got to say, that's a pretty accurate name for the city. It's beautiful there. After you've been on the East Coast during a dreary Seattle style winter, being in California is a little bit like being in paradise. It's beautiful there. And I was fully prepared for LA to be only a little better. Then when we departed, which was the first summer of the pandemic, that kind of feels crazy saying that, that we've already had two fucking pandemic summers. It's just wild to me. But when we left, Ash was raining from the sky. There were, you know, the 10 cities were just stretching out everywhere. And on top of all of it, no one knew what was happening. We're talking police tape around playgrounds. For a second, living in LA felt like you were trapped in some kind of never ending, shitty, red hot chili peppers song. City of Angels, my how you have fallen. Police tape around your playgrounds. Police tape on the brown mound. Police tape in the brown mound. Who used to be my butthole as a burial ground? You know what happens there is I think, oh, that would be fun to try to like imitate the red hot chili peppers. And then I realize I'm not the red hot chili peppers. And then I realize that I want to sing the line. Used to be a butthole, now a burial ground. And then I spend an hour making what you just heard. That's the process of podcasting. Regardless, as far as I could tell, LA is on the mend. Is a perfect no or any of us perfect now? No. Is civilization perfect? No. Is there some possibility that we are all gradually being inhaled into some future transhumanist singularity and what we're experiencing or the seismic shockwaves resulting from tachyon particles being blasted backwards through time, as Terrence McKenna said, absolutely. Is asking yourself questions on a podcast annoying? Probably. Should you stop doing it after you have already gone through at least four questions? Of course you should. Do you know how to stop asking questions once you've started asking them in this weird self interview style? No. Are you realizing that once you get caught up in asking questions on your own podcast to yourself, that you've essentially jumped the podcasting shark, that you're becoming some kind of thing falling in on itself? I don't know. I can't remember the question I asked myself. And this is the process, as I was saying before. Anyway, LA seems great. I don't know what's gonna happen to the city, but most importantly, it just feels like home. I lived there for 17 years and I don't wanna get all sentimental and shit. I'm a horrible meditator and Buddhist. I don't even know if I am a Buddhist, but I'm sort of haunted by the idea that no matter where you go, there you are. You're carrying your mind with you anywhere you go and that theoretically you should be able to live anywhere that if you can calm your mind down and find a place of true inner peace, then it doesn't matter where you're at. You could be living on top of a gigantic ice cream sundae made of frozen shit and a little stupid shit tent where you just eat sugared shit all day. And if you were enlightened, then you could theoretically enjoy it. But that's like me saying if I had massive, I don't even know what they're called, glutes that I could do the America Ninja Challenge. I don't know. I'm not there yet. I'm where I'm at and where I'm at is, I wanna be in the sun. I don't wanna do any more winners. And I know all my East Coast friends out there, you love it, you like it. You like being frozen down and I get it. There's something beautiful about the cold and walking you out into the cold and being like, fuck, this is cold. But I kinda wanna be near the ocean again and most importantly, all my friends are there. Most of my friends are there, some of them split. But I just love that city. I think it's okay to feel sentimental about a place. And so yeah, I think we're gonna head back there pretty soon. What does that mean for the DTFH? Absolutely nothing, except more than likely you're gonna get some shitty recording quality as we begin our migration back west. I do feel like I'm in some kind of Buddhist parable. I'm sure you've heard the one about the person who's like sitting in the shade and gets too cold and then moves out of the shade and gets too hot and then moves back into the shade. Well, I don't give a fuck. I'm going back into whatever part of that parable represents Los Angeles and I'm really excited about it. We have a great podcast for you today. And my apologies if in this podcast I seem a little cynical or something. Today's guest is Peter Kalmas. He's an environmental scientist and honestly I hesitated bringing him back on the show not because he's not interesting and not because he's not super fucking cool and not because he's clearly a fucking genius but because his brilliant way of sort of articulating what's going on with climate change is terrifying and off-putting and I don't know, just like freaks me out. But in this conversation you'll see that somehow I managed to be the fucking buzzkill. Still, I think if you stick around you will find that Peter Kalmas is a wonderful example of a synthesis of scientist and spokesperson. You know, because a lot of scientists, no offense to my scientist friends out there. Look, there's a reason there's not a show called America's Funniest Scientist or America's Best Scientist Singer because they've decided to spend their entire lives lost in their laboratories while all of us go cavorting around in various degrees of narcissistic hedonism. I mean, not everybody. Again, I'm making sweeping judgments here. Point is Peter is very charismatic, super smart and is actually, I would guess, I don't know this for sure but if I had to roll the dice, he's gotta be part of the inspiration for the movie Don't Look Up, which by the way is fantastic and when I tweeted I thought it was great, boy did it piss off a lot of people who told me I was cringe or virtue signaling, which is really fucking crazy to me because that movie to me wasn't just roasting the sort of poisonous hyper-right but also the sort of impotent, can you say impotent, impotent? The sort of impotent gesticulating left and everybody in between, it's a good movie. Regardless, when I was watching it, Peter popped into my mind and then I reached out to him and we set up this podcast. So stick around, with us here today is climate scientist Peter Kalmas. We're gonna jump right into it, but first this. Thank you Lucy for supporting this episode of the DTFH. You know one of my favorite Stephen King stories is in his book On Writing and he talks about how his family didn't intervention with him and showed him this bag of shit they gathered from his office when he was writing bloody, clean exes that he was shoving up his nose because it was bleeding from doing so much cocaine as he was writing the shining old cigarette butts. But anyway, the thing he said is of all of the drugs, the hardest one to quit was nicotine and the reason being that he actually had some sense that maybe it was helping a little bit with the writing. You can look it up, sadly, I only say sadly because nicotine is so addictive, there's a new tropic effect that nicotine has. All I'm saying is, you know smoking is fucking bad for you and there's better ways to absorb nicotine. If you enjoy using nicotine, you should definitely check out Lucy's Products at lucy.co.

National Anthem Peter, welcome back to to the DTFH. I was watching, don't look up in the whole time, I'm just thinking, my God, this is about Peter Kalmas. This is your story. And then I loved that movie, not, I love the movie because I just saw a super amazing satire. And then I tweeted that I like the movie and immediate attacks from people say, what, oh, you're virtue signaling to say you like this movie about the environment. And then that's what I virtue signaling because you want a habitable planet. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, come on. But to me, that what really inspired me why I reached out to you is because I realized like, oh, God, it's not now you can't even talk about it. You now to even talk about the this reality that we're all experiencing is to be attacked by a lot of people. And so if that just happened to me for saying I liked a movie because I thought it was great satire, what's your life like that in that regard, do you get attacked for your public the way you keep reminding us of this environmental disaster that we're all just beginning to get a taste of? You know, there's the hardcore deniers out there and they love telling me what an idiot I am. And they like to say that they'll leave their, you know, truck running in their driveway for a week nonstop because of something that I said. And I don't I don't mind that at all, actually. I mean, I don't think they should do that. I think it's stupid. But I don't mind getting attacked like that because it makes me feel like I'm starting to have an impact, you know, that my message is starting to get out there. But it is so weird that we can't as a species all get on the same page about wanting to have a fucking habitable planet. I mean, what could be more fundamental than that? Well, I mean, I think I don't know, as I'm like, as I wrestle with it, like everybody does, I think that it's it's the sense of no, no good solution, like, or, or, or another way to put it is, I think there's a you could chalk up COVID to climate change. There's a way to make a direct connection to our like ability to instantly get from one place to the other are hyper connectedness as why this pandemic is never is not going away according to people's timelines. You know, that this is an experience of climate change. But maybe the reason the problem is the solution seems to be increasingly fascist. People get this sense of like, no one is going to stop. People are running their cars in their driveway to punish you and all the other people who are just sort of like, you know, leaving the lights on, driving gas, guzzling cars, taking trips on planes, living, you know, living in a mock quote, modern way, that there isn't really a no one's really going to change. It's not going to change. And so there's so much to unpack there. So it's not so, so, you know, I wrote a book when I started down this path of like getting really worried about climate and ecological breakdown, there was no real movement. I didn't know how to connect and engage sort of as an activist very well. Like back in 2010, like 350.org was barely there. There was no extinction rebellion. There was no Greta. There are no big marches in the street. And so one of the things I did was I just started to feel kind of really gross about burning fossil fuels. And I kind of got made a game out of it to reduce my own use of fossil fuels. And then like after about a year, that was fun. It was a lot of fun. After about a year of that, though, I realized, man, you know, I can I can reduce my own emissions a little bit every year. And it's it's fun. And there's a lot of great other reasons to do it. But, you know, if humanity is emitting 40 some billion tons of CO2 per year, it's not enough. It's really not this this path of me reducing my own emissions isn't enough. So I, you know, I was also thinking, well, it can help sort of spark cultural change. You know, people can see you doing this and they can be like, well, that's that looks like fun, maybe, or that's interesting. Or, yeah, you know, this is a problem we should start reducing our emissions to. Maybe we should start flying less, for example. And what I quickly realized with that is there are a few people out there who will start to take these kinds of steps and reduce their emissions. But it's a smaller fraction of humanity than I thought it would be. And I think there's a lot of interesting reasons for that, too. There's so many stories that are deeply baked into our cultural operating system. Stories about, you know, how great technology is, how humanity can do anything with its technology. Technology is going to save us. We can never go backwards. Like we could never, I think the majority of people out there who have been on an airplane can't imagine life without airplanes now. Whereas just a few decades ago, there were no airplanes and everyone was perfectly happy. But there's this the sense of not being able to go backwards at all. So then what I realized kind of like the third step is how important it is as an activist to engage with systems and to sort of get collective policies that would make it so that people wouldn't burn fossil fuel this much. So you can't expect people to any significant fraction. I think it's probably far less than one percent, I think, of people that would actually significantly reduce their emissions. So you need to get some kind of policies in place. And these policies probably ultimately have to be international because this is a global problem. And so then the question as one mammal walking around out there, one one person interacting with these huge overwhelmingly huge global systems, right? The food systems, the transportation systems, the political systems. What the question is, then, what do you do? How do you engage with that in a way that's maybe somewhat effective, that feels somewhat meaningful, that doesn't make you burn out? So that's the I think that's really the fundamental question as an activist. And one one, I think just to sort of set the stage here, one really important rule that I've realized when I get asked over and over again, like, how do I be a better activist? How do we what should we do? Right? That's the fundamental question. Really, you got to kick that back to people and say it's up to you to figure that out. Like, that's part of that. That's such an important part of the path is to dive in, you know, and start swimming in this water and you get better and better at it. And you start meeting other people and you start figuring out what you like and how you can contribute. And, you know, that's it's sort of a lifelong journey into climate activism. And anyone who, you know, likes having a planet with decent temperatures and good food and water and air to breathe, et cetera, which is literally 100% of us at this point should be a climate activist. I mean, we all are literally the earth, and we have to start protecting the earth like we protect ourselves. So that's what to me, that's what climate activists are now. They literally are the earth protecting herself. I want to thank Bluetube for supporting this episode of the DTFH. It's time. I don't want to say why.

They literally are the earth protecting herself. But also there is a undeniable, legitimate, joyful aggression people feel towards the earth. So I think that there is an assumption that people do want to have a habitat they can live in, or that people do have some kind of like inkling of respect for the planet. But I have listened to religious sermons, where the earth is considered to be a kind of phase that we're going through. It's a sort of testing ground of souls, ultimately that is meant to be like exploited for its resources. And people that's part of their like some religious people feel like their religion is being threatened with the idea of we're all the earth. They're like, I'm not there. I'm not of this earth, Peter. I'm of heaven or I'm a spiritual being temporarily inhabiting this earth. So people get really upset with climate activists, because they see it as a kind of paganism, you know, they see it as a kind of neo paganism that is actually satanic. I'm just saying what you're up against here is some group of people who share what you just said, like, oh, we want to live in a, it would be, I don't want my kids to be like experiencing 500 mile per hour winds or whatever is, you know, possible. But then there's people like, no, it's the apocalypse, Peter, it's the end of the world. Now you see this is the end of the world. And there's no way you can stop it. You can't stop it because God's coming back. This is why stories are so important, isn't it? I mean, maybe religion is one way to understand it is it's just a very deep kind of story, like a story that's so deep in someone's brain that it's not questioned. It's like, got this, it's a platform upon which everything else they do and think and how they understand the world is built on this story, essentially. So and to go back to don't look up, I think that's part of what's so interesting about climate stories and storytelling. You know, we're, we're kind of, I think we're kind of as a species in a period where the old stories aren't working anymore. They're starting to break down like that, that story you mentioned about Dominion over all the earth and all of the, yeah, the creatures that crawl on the earth and swim in the water, yeah. And you know, to me, a new story that that's emerging, that that has emerged in my life, or I don't know that I felt called to from a very young age is the story of just awe and wonder at the earth and the trees and the creatures and the sensation of breathing air and the sensation of feeling sunlight on your face or the sound of a stream in the mountains or the waves on the seashore or the, you know, the laughter of children playing. It's just, you know, looking at the night sky, right, seeing the Milky Way and starting to understand the universe a little bit. To me, it's also very deeply woven in with science, the sense of just kind of this animistic wonder of walking around on the planet, but then also to like, to learn about Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism or Einstein's equations of general relativity and how gravity is geometry. And the, to me, the sense of wonder is exactly the same that from science as from like seeing my lemon tree and like feeling a tree being happy, like somehow feeling a connection to this other being deeply enough to see the color of its lemons and how abundant it is and get the sense that a tree could be happy or that, you know, a crow could be happy or unhappy as the case were. So I don't know. I think almost feels like maybe we need this kind of a deep story to emerge of kind of interbeing of interconnectedness of sharing each other's carbon molecules. And when I say each other, I don't just mean other people. I mean, all the earthlings, like all the beings on this planet and this joy, this joy that doesn't exist in the metaverse, right? Like when you're, when you're, it's, you know, one in the morning, and you're, you know, you get bored with Netflix, and then you go on, you know, some other website, and you know, that feeling of kind of internet boredom, like there's, it's like, it's like the feeling of eating potato chips, right? You'll never get, get to the bottom of that sort of longing. But then when you, like, if you go out and do gardening, and you're like, planting plants and, you know, looking at the dirt and smelling those sensations and, you know, just being with the earth, I don't, I don't get that. So, so to me, like just the real, you know, soil and trees and birds and clean air is, that's to me, like the real metaverse, like the joyful metaverse, because there's, it seems like there's kind of an element of joy that is missing from all of the, like, kind of corporate technology, to me, at least. And maybe a sense of connection, like it's, it's all about connecting, right? The internet. But there's a deeper connection that is maybe hardwired into our brains, because we evolved in this, this planet, right? With kind of this, the primal, the primal, more primal stuff, right? Being a body on this planet, and the joy that that, that goes along with that. Oh, yeah. I mean, I know, I know what you mean. I love it. Like, I love that feeling of going up into the woods with my kid and watching him play in streams around here and like just, you know, just, I don't, that sense of the whole thing, whatever the game is we've been playing, it's turned off. But I think don't look up like what it captured was this, the cultural layer that is acting as a force field, keeping people from even getting close to that taste that you're talking about, that, and there's so many different versions of it. That, you know, one thing I think that's really fascinating about the way people react to that movie is certain groups felt that they were called out or scolded like Trump people, not seeing, no, you weren't the only ones, everyone was dragged through the coals, including climate scientists, you know, and spoiler alert everybody, but you know, at the end, when they're sitting around the table kind of saying we did everything we could, it's like they didn't quite believe it, you know, that there's a sense of like, did you really do everything you could do? Because, you know, to me, this problem, the problem that we're talking about, unless you want to enjoy like disregarding literally 90% of what scientists are saying, or you want to ignore all the crazy shit that's been going on around the planet, pretend that's always been going on, that it's not anomalous. If you choose not to ignore that, you enter into this bizarre place when you start thinking of solutions, your solution is pragmatic and I love it. It's sweet. Maybe if we get everybody to touch the earth and feel it again and understand how beautiful the earth is, there'll be a reawakening, a new story. Well, that's the story. I think the, you know, it's again, so much to unpack. We, so okay, so going back to like doing everything we can do and sort of the layers of collective denial that don't look up revealed, especially in the media, and it's fascinating how the like elite film critics panned the movie. So being kind of really in the trenches of this movement, one thing I've noticed is that there's kind of a divide. It's probably a continuous spectrum, but you can think of it as a divide between the people who, they know that we're in a, we have a real problem here and they accept the science, but they don't truly understand how short the time scales are and how much we stand to lose. And to them, like talking about potential civilizational collapse is a kind of taboo, and they'll try to minimize you and kind of, you know, deflect you by saying that you're doomist if you even mention the possibility of civilizational collapse. And then on the other side, there are people who are like, holy fuck, this is an emergency. We stand to lose possibly everything. Like, you know, billions of people could die. We're, we could have massive food shortages. Everything's going to get worse, you know, every single year until we end the fossil fuel industry. And that's the key thing, you know, the people who see this as a planetary emergency of the highest order. They, they'll say like, you know, net zero by 2050, what is that bullshit? You know, 2050 is way too late. We're not going to have a civilization in 2050 at this rate. And what's with this net zero bullshit? That's, that's fossil fuel industry propaganda to deflect attention away from the root cause of everything that's happening, which is the fucking fossil fuel industry, right? So we have global heating, which is driving, you know, reduced agricultural yields, which could end up to severe kind of, you know, multi regional crop failures, which is driving the flooding that we've been seeing, which is driving the heat domes and the wildfires and the sea level rise and the loss of ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest. All of this is caused by global heating, which is caused by burning fossil fuels makes makes the planet warmer. Right. And that's the fossil fuel industry, which has been literally lying to us for decades. They've known exactly what they're doing. They chose their own. It's the, it's, it's like the super villain. You can't make this up. Right. I don't think there's ever been a movie villain that's as bad as the real kind of fossil fuel capitalists, which knew that they were selling out the planet for their bank accounts, which were already like bigger than they could ever possibly spend. Right. I mean, it's, it's really just insane. But here we are. And you have, we have to call out the real problem and the real solution. Right. The first order solution is ending the fossil fuel industry as quickly as we can. And yet you, you know, you look at COP26, right. And there's no discussion at all there anywhere of ending the fossil fuel. There's discussions about like reducing methane leaks. There's discussions about, you know, dealing with deforestation, but they dance around ending the fossil fuel industry, which is that's the thing we have to go after. Right. Nothing, nothing we do will be meaningful until we, we ramp down this industry quickly on a schedule. But guess who was the biggest delegation, for example, at COP26, the fossil fuel industry, the fossil fuel industry, what they were, they were like invited to this, you know, meeting of kind of the nations of the world to set climate policy. Right. And they were, they were there kind of looking over things. There were literally more kind of delegates there from the fossil fuel industry than from any other single country, which is just insane. And then, you know, look at what Biden did a few days after COP26. Right. He expanded drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. He had a lease sale. And then the administration tried to say that this was, you know, ordered, they had to do it because of court orders. But the Justice Department even had a document that said that that wasn't true. They could have certainly delayed, if not completely delayed, you know, basically indefinitely or, or not had. So we have, you know, the industry kind of calling the shots right now, and we're still expanding, even though we know we're heading towards this, we're already, things are already burning up. Right. It's already too hot. I don't know if you've personally experienced kind of climate impacts with your own body, but I certainly have. Yeah. And yeah, it's, we, we have to start going directly at the heart of the matter. But isn't the heart of the matter design, I mean, not like, yes, I know the fossil fuel industry, if you and I could like do some kind of incredible bit of magic and just make it go away, that would be great. Although it's all gone. But then we're still going to have this desire for convenience. And for, like you were saying, the idea that we're always going forward, we don't go back. We got up in the air. We can get, I can get from here to Hawaii in no time. It used to take forever to get to Hawaii. I could take these awesome trips to Tulum, no problem. And not only that, like the reason that we all want to do that, the reason we do want to get in airplanes and take vacations and go visit our friends and go to spiritual retreats and go and do all these things is desire. We have a basic human desire. I mean, this is where like, only because for me, whenever I am, whenever I'm playing around with this solution, which is probably idiotic, because there's not any one solution, but just in the sense of if we were both running the Sims or some game where we could alter variables with complete, with complete success, the way it looks to me as well, okay, is climate change real? I think it is. Okay, so the climate change is real. Then essentially, we're waiting for the earth just to kill enough people so civilization falls apart, so that naturally things start cooling down, because there's not any people anymore. They're either glaciated or fried up or whatever, it's gone. And if there are people, they're just some, you know, Mad Max people, whatever, they might be driving around the desert and fucking cool cars. But they're just, they're having to dig up gasoline, right? So that's, that is the, that is some version of the future, probably not even close to as cool as that, more like the road or something, just a dusty uninhabitable planet that gradually turns into mercury or something like that, because we fucked it up so bad. So we're talking mass deaths, mass casualties, and which is why one of the solutions, and I think the reason people push back against climate activists is because they have this sense that climate activists in some way must understand, well, maybe fascism is the answer. Maybe the answer under the compassionate thing to do is not to be like, okay, it's, well, 2055 or whatever, it'll be fine. We'll do 2055. Maybe the, you know, at Chogam, Trump or Rinpoche talks about idiot compassion. And idiot compassion is where you imagine you're doing something compassionate, but you're still prolonging the problem. It's like enabling or something, you know, it's like buying someone heroin because they want heroin, you know, that's idiot compassion. True compassion would be helping them get off a heroin. So anyway, I'm sorry, in Buddhism, you have these sort of three root poisons, as they're called, the claysias, the three, and there's different names for them, but essentially it's desire, aggression, and ignorance. These are the three things that are driving all of the suffering in the world. And so I'm saying, maybe the answer is not getting rid of the fossil fuel industry. Maybe it's going one level deeper. I don't know what that looks like, but figuring out a way to, I don't know, help people overcome that itchy thing, that quick, impulsive itchy thing that makes it make sense to take these trips. And we're back to, I think we're back to stories. So I think, you know, to me, like I said, the kind of the first order thing is to put the fossil fuel industry directly in the crosshair. But then you have to ask like, so let's say we could magically convert all of our energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy, for example. And yeah, we had the same amount of energy as we have now, but was always suppose that like suppose we could do that, then what will we do with that clean energy? We'd keep paving over nature and building stuff and extracting for profit. We'd have instead of three billionaires with space companies, we'd have a thousand billionaires with space companies, we'd start getting trillionaires, et cetera. And we'd still fuck things up and we'd have other ecological problems. And we'd basically be more or less in the same place, right? So yeah, the second thing has to be a complete rethinking of how we do economics and how we kind of inhabit this planet as a species. So you could call that degrowth. And you know, in my mind, one of the kind of the first things that the one of the most important pieces of that is figuring out ways, systematic ways to redistribute wealth. What do you mean degrowth? Wait, I'm sorry. What do you mean degrowth? Basically, an economic system that isn't all about, isn't designed for our economic system right now is basically designed for two things, right? To maximize GDP growth, to get as much GDP growth year on year as you can. And for capital to accumulate. So you have capital, people with billions of dollars, corporations with billions of dollars. And that capital tends to create more capital until you have this kind of black hole of capital that gets so powerful that it can work politics. I mean, it's so cheap, relatively cheap to buy a politician. If you had a trillion dollars, you could probably own every politician, every newspaper around the planet. And then there's, you know, forget democracy at that point, right? And that's kind of, that's pretty close to where we are now. I just saw a fact that the, the 10 top billionaires, the 10 highest, the wealthiest people on the planet, their wealth doubled in the last two years during COVID. And they now control 1.5 trillion dollars of wealth, which is crazy. Like that's, you'd have to make a million dollars a day for more than 4,000 years to accumulate that much wealth. Like that's how much it is. Like I'd be totally happy with just a million dollars. Like I could, you know, set that aside, plan for the entire event. A million dollars a day for 4,000 years. No human being needs that much money. And it's, it's kind of an accumulation of basically social energy that's just being wasted in these kind of. But isn't that just an agreed upon? Like when you get to that level of alleged wealth, like at some point, isn't that just sort of like, you're just sort of agreeing that everyone's in this hypnotic trance where we're just agreeing that that, that value is even real? Is it, you know, like we've, we, that part of, part of what's happening here is that, you know, billionaire, for bill, for a billionaire to exist, there has to be a global agreement regarding the value of a dollar, right? So the whole planet has to agree, yes, that's a dollar, a billion of those things mean something, right? Like, you know, somebody, if somebody could say, I own a billion grains of sand, nobody gives a shit, it's just sand, you know, it's, but we're, similarly, we're, we're giving these people their power, that black hole you're talking about, its power isn't coming, I don't think. Duncan, they're just ones, they're just ones and zeros in some database somewhere. Right. It's even less, it's even less than sand. Yeah. Because it's silicon based, but you know, all money is, is, is just a way to keep track of social contract between people, between entities, between nations, etc. It's just, it's just a reckoning system for kind of social obligations that we all have with each other. And when you get to the point that we're at now, what you have, we, we can't even make inroads in homelessness. We have people even in the United States who can't buy your food for the week that can't pay for rent that are getting evicted, that don't have healthcare. It's totally fucked up out there. And then at the same time, we have these people who, you know, make $200 billion in a year during a pandemic, right? Because they've, they've managed to capture that capital and that capital just accrues more capital like, like that black hole. So what that tells me is that the social contract is completely broken and needs to be completely rethought and rewritten in a way that's more equitable. And that's part of what climate and ecological breakdown is telling us is that we can't keep living in this way with this much inequality. You know, the billionaires, the amount of emissions they, they put into the atmosphere is like thousand time what the average person puts in or something. I mean, it's the, there's a direct correlation between somebody's wealth and how much they damage the planet. Like they can't spend that money. Like I said, it's, it's more money than, it's, it's astronomical. You can't, it's hard to explain how much money, you know, $500 billion is and what you could do with that money. They can't spend it. So they, they buy these mega yachts, they buy multiple private jets, they start their spaceship corporations and which that's an incredible amount of fossil fuel emissions. And that's just the stuff you hear about. That's just the stuff you hear about. There's no telling what they're at, what's really going on. I mean, that to me is the, I mean, if the stuff that you know we're witnessing is this, you know, the rocket ships and the, you know, the, you know, the yachts and all that, God knows what is happening behind the scenes between these people who have essentially become post capital. Like once you have that much money, you are now existing in a world where money is valueless in a sense. And that like no one's going to be like, no one's going to be able to buy you. Like how much are you going to give a billionaire to do something? Like they don't need money. So you, it goes back to trade again for billionaires. They trade favors. They don't, the flow of money becomes more irrelevant to them, right? We need to figure out a way to come together and create a new economy, which is centered on human flourishing and sort of human happiness and not about just accumulating more capital and extracting as much from the natural worlds.

So I'd say kind of like the third thing. So this can all happen simultaneously, right? Like targeting the fossil fuel industry to end it, because that's like the fossil fuel industry, that's like our arms been chopped off in the bloods, we need to get the tourniquet on, right? That's ending the fossil fuel industry. But then we need to like start kind of living in a healthier way. That's kind of rethinking economics and kind of not centering things around this growth and capital accumulation. And then the third level is just kind of like waking up as a species, kind of what we were talking about earlier. And I think stories are critical to that, right? And don't look up didn't tell that story. Don't look up was just the like, holy fuck, we're heading towards collapse and we got it. And the media is blocking a mainstream movement. That's kind of the story that don't look up was telling. And there's thousands of other climate stories that need to be told. And there's a few I think really key primal ones, which is, for example, the story of how a species came close to destroying the only oasis of life in the known universe, this beautiful, miraculous place, this riotous place with all these crazy, colorful species, right? And food that you could just pick off of trees. And this, you know, the species came so close to destroying all of that. But then they woke up, and they kind of figured out that they were stewards, they weren't here to conquer. They were here to enjoy and to sort of uplift and to wonder, to be in awe at this planet. And they realized that just in time, and the fires kept getting worse for a while, things kept dying for a while, ecosystems got worse, the sea levels rose, all the coastal cities had to be abandoned. It was really confusing. But then things started slowly getting better. And they realized that life would be better for their kids and life would be better in 10 generations, and that the biodiversity would start to recover. And it was this, this, this party, this celebration with all due respect. I can't admit that is just, just, I can't imagine. I mean, I can imagine that if it was you and me and our friends, but like looking at what's happening right now globally, you've got, you know, Russia amassing troops, we're somehow we're back, we're right back at almost at the Cuban fucking missile crisis. Like right now, suddenly on top of everything else, this pandemic, right now on top of that, there's just some slight extra possibility that there might be a nuclear war. Like suddenly the reality of like, of like, oh, guess what? We still have nuclear weapons. Talk about environmental disaster. Talk about just getting it all over within one fell swoop and one potentially one afternoon. You know, this is, this, this is where we're at. You there, there, these, these, and when, when the these events happen that have been happening, where shit is just suddenly all of a sudden, like in New York, people are drowning in their base, drowning in their basements. This has never happened. Just all of a sudden that was shocking to me too. Yeah. Yeah, right. Well, that stuff, whenever that's that that stuff is happening, it's not like the next day people are like suddenly coming out of their apartments in New York and be like, Hey, is this a good idea? This whole New York thing that we're doing this whole driving around all the time thing? Because no, it's like we literally like robots just go right back to it, right back to it. And it and if we don't go right back to it, the way we don't go right back to it is generally not some mutual intent of healing the earth. It's generally like getting scared and then angry and then and then bowing down to whoever seems to be the most powerful monkey who has the weapons and then following what they're doing. I mean, I'm sorry, I just can't. God forgive me because I I want it to be what you're describing, but I can't picture it, man. I like it's it's hard to picture. How do we get there? Yeah, I'm not sure. Again, you know, so okay, so there's there's a few things that kind of I know for sure, which kind of help keep me going. Okay, so one of them is that I've kind of given up. This is sort of a sad thing to say I've kind of given up on the world leaders, you know, kind of waking up and freaking out about climate breakdown as much as I do and kind of doing the right thing. We they've had so many decades to do that. It's and there's and like I said before, they're still and this is not just in the US, it's everywhere. They're still expanding the fossil fuel industry. And they're, you know, they love talking about things like carbon capture because it's like a distraction away from ending the fossil fuel industry. Right. So it's clear. It's clear to me that we need a mass mainstream climate movement. Like we need people to organize, to get out in the streets, to bring out the pitchforks. It's not exactly clear how that happens. It's starting to happen. It's, I mean, we're at a way better place now in terms of the movement than we were like four years ago. COVID took a huge chunk out of the movement. I think I think it slowed things down dramatically. Things were really starting to get going. And now, of course, so there's this other thing, which when you're talking, it made me kind of think about, which is there's a real problem with the way we organize kind of collectively, which is that the sociopaths tend to rise to the top, you know, in the corporations and in the governments. We've never, I don't think we've ever really, you know, I don't think the people who wrote the Constitution were really kind of, we have to kind of reframe how we do government with that in mind. Like that has to be the thing at the top of our minds as we were like rewrite stuff. And like, how do we figure out this like government thing and organizing together? I don't think a document written more than 200 years ago by a bunch of slaveholders is necessarily the most relevant way for us to self organize today. And it's very hard to see how we redo that without a ton of violence and bloodshed. I hope there is a way, but it definitely seems like things aren't working right now. You know, minority rule isn't working, because the vast majority of the electorate wants rapid climate action. Your climate change is now one of like the top quote unquote issues. And I think as we get more heat domes, as we get more crazy floods, as we get more food price spikes, which are probably going to continue being, you know, ascribed to inflation, but I think more and more there's going to be a climate signal driving higher food prices. But as all of this stuff gets gets worse, you know, that climate breakdown will become more than an issue to a lot of people. It'll be the top issue. But if we and if we had real democracy, we'd start taking real action on it. But but if we if we have kind of, you know, fascism or kind of pseudo democracy, which, which we have now right with the Senate, for example, the Senate is not a Democratic, the Electoral College is not a Democratic institution. We have basically rule by the minority and rule by the ultra wealthy and the corporations. Yeah, Alec Alec writing this American legislative and exchange commission literally writing laws, mostly at the state level, because they realize that, you know, the state level is easier to kind of write laws and pass laws and that are very, very, you know, corporate friendly and planet unfriendly, right? Yeah. So so if we can figure out a way to kind of come out of this, this anti democracy, and you're right, it feels like things are getting worse right now, instead of better, it's sort of like a race between kind of the fascists and maybe the the earthy hippie climate activists. The earthy hippie climate activists are fucked. They don't have nuclear weapons. That's the that's the whole spooky reality. I think people like us forget. Let's bring let's bring in the killer robots now too, because if I was a fossil fuel capitalist with billions and billions of dollars, I wouldn't really trust the human military so much. I'd really want those robotic, you know, because they can't they you can't they can't rise up against you, right? So we're at it. Remember learning about the robber barons in high school. Yeah, we're we're right now at a historical point, which is even more intense than the robber barons and even harder to figure out how to deal with, because the corporations and the ultra rich have had, you know, like 100 years since then, to figure out how to do it better and how to capture the media. So when you don't have a media, basically, you know, the media has been almost completely absent in terms of telling the story of climate and ecological breakdown. So is it any wonder that the climate movement has been relatively fringe, right? And hasn't been mainstream and hasn't been powerful enough yet to fight against the fossil fuel industry. And they've captured the politics, I think even more than the robber barons of old have and you capture control the politics, then you control the military, you have, you know, a monopoly on violence, and you're starting to see climate activists who do things as as relatively benign, for example, as break windows, they're starting to get multi year sentences, right? And there's a systematic push to make any sort of direct climate activism, you know, to label those people as terrorists, for example, to try to to squelch the movement down and keep it from getting bigger. So it does feel like a sort of race to me. Does it wait? Okay, go ahead. Sorry. Well, I was gonna I was gonna come back to the movie again. That's why that's why I wrote that op ed. I was so happy that, you know, something came out of Hollywood that was genuinely mainstream. Yeah, hundreds of millions of people watched and kind of resonated with a lot of the latent climate anxiety and concern that's out there, right? That hasn't been discussed in either the mainstream entertainment media or the mainstream news media at all. So for that to break through and to be financially successful for a corporation, Netflix, that doesn't rely on advertising, right? So it's kind of independent of the fossil fuel industry. I'm a little bit heartened to see what comes next. And if we can have climate stories that are resonant enough to contribute to building a truly mainstream climate movement, because that's that's what I've been pushing for for years and years and years. Because like I said, that's to me, that's the little tiny window, you know, the Indiana Jones door stone wall that's closing down that we have to slide under, right? Okay, to build this movement. Let me add to the story idea. I want to push back a little bit on not just your, I don't want to call it scorn, but the rush cough is has such a brilliant way of articulating this too. There's a name he asked for people who believe the singularity is like coming and, you know, is going like the technology is going to save all of us. It's like a religion. And it was definitely beautifully. That's what I loved about Don't Look Up is because they made the main technology guy look like, you know, who he was, I'm pretty sure was designed to look like the leader of Heaven's Gate, the Heaven's Gate cult. He wore the same clothes. He had the same affect as the Heaven's Gate cult. So like, it was such a brilliant way of saying, if you're like, believing that technology is going to save us from what's from what's happening, you are in a genuine kind of death cult. But this is my pushback to that. The metaverse, which everyone is talking about right now, in a way, isn't one of the big problems right now, the problem of getting meat body from point A to point B. That's why we have fucking fossil fuels. We like to haul our asses to places where there are other people and hang out with them and then haul our asses back, not to overly reduce it. That is pretty much what's going down here. The metaverse, right now, in whatever phase it's in, is probably looks pretty stupid. I've seen some of the weird Facebook shit they put out there, meta or whatever they're calling it now, and it just looks silly. But as technology and the ability to emulate reality becomes increasingly powerful, as neural interfaces inevitably appear, isn't there actually some kind of potential that we can experience as sort of digital teleportation, where we are senses are actually immersed in that way that you're describing when you go outside, that for better or for worse, technology does come close to replicating those experiences, thus reducing the need for travel, thus decimating the fossil fuel industry. Why am I getting on a fart filled fucking plane wearing an uncomfortable goddamn mask across the ocean to go to Hawaii if I can put on some neural interface and be there instantaneously? I think as long as it's not kind of co-op, the corporations are moving in, they're investing into this, and if it's just about driving more consumerism and optimizing the algorithm for extracting more money from people, from consuming products and from knowing what they're thinking, basically, and monetizing that. The capitalists, they try to enclose and monetize as much as they can, and they realize that they can even enclose and monetize sort of how we think. But if somehow the metaverse doesn't just end up being a giant commercial that leads to even more consumerism and more sort of products that are designed to break after six months, so you buy more of them, etc., which would just accelerate everything that's happening to the planet now, then you're right. So to go back to like 2010 when I was talking about my kind of desperate attempts to reduce my own emissions that turned out to be kind of joyful and fun, but also not nearly enough, one of the surprising things that came out of that for me was that three-quarters of my own emissions at the time were from flying, because at that time I was an astrophysicist. Yeah, and at the time I was kind of like, well, maybe if more people knew what a big slice of how bad flying really was for frequent flyers, they might stop doing it. And I was wrong about that. And it turned out, the most intense conversations I've ever had kind of on Twitter, after talks that I've given, they're all around flying. People really get emotional about flying, because I think they tend to associate it with really good things like freedom, like power, like giving, being important and going to conferences and going on nice vacations and stuff. And that's a very human thing. But the fact is, look, we are in a climate emergency. If you're on the side of that, the kind of divide within the movement of whether this is a genuine emergency or whether we just need more electric cars, basically, and things aren't really that bad. But if you're on the side that it's a genuine emergency, I think more and more of those people are starting to realize that we don't need to fly. It's not like if you don't get on that plane, no one's going to die. So if you start seeing climate and ecological breakdown more and more as a real life or death thing, you start to think like, all right, so we have this fossil fuel, let's say we want to get rid of all the fossil fuel by 2030, which is really ambitious. I think if we were truly in emergency mode, that's the kind of time scale we'd be thinking about. So if we're all on the same page, I know there's 40% of the United States that kind of still thinks the election was stolen and everything. And so we're not all on the same page. But if we were, and we agreed that we had to get things done by 2030, I think commercial aviation would be just about the first thing we ramped down and got rid of, because it's not necessary. We'd be like, we need the electricity. We'll die without that. We need the food system and we need the food to be distributed. We'll die without that. So we're going to keep those things to run on fossil fuel. So we're going to have to ramp those things down gradually. But let's deal with the easy stuff right away, like all these huge SUVs, these private jets and the commercial aviation industry. And then what COVID, just to kind of finish up, what COVID sort of taught us is that that's true. We don't really need commercial aviation. We could do a lot of this business, quote unquote, travel remotely. And if we could get that, you know, better than Zoom calls, if we could make that sort of remote interaction better through kind of virtual reality, I am all for that. I think that that would be a tremendous asset to humanity. So long as we can, again, if it doesn't become a giant commercial, and if we can leverage it to do things like eliminate commercial aviation, at least until we have fossil fuel free aviation, which we don't have. Right. Well, okay, so this to me, if you do want to find a place where everyone's going to agree, I don't care if you think the election results were fake. I don't care if you believe the earth is flat. One thing I think everyone can agree on flying fucking sucks. Nobody likes it. It's horrible. No one likes getting going to the airport. No one likes getting on an airplane. It's a it's a it's a horrible experience. So it contributes to pandemics too. Right. We know that now. It spreads the disease and it sucks. It just I mean, all the pandemic should decide. It just sucks. Your arms rubbing up against somebody's fucking arm. You want to out you want it. Someone's people are getting increasingly raucous on the plane. People are getting duct taped to chairs now, right? Because it's that bad. That's why it sucks. It's making people go nuts. So this, I think we can all agree the flying sucks. And then to me, like, you know, if what you're if you're right, if fossil fuel, if the fossil fuel industry, and I think you must be right, because you're way smarter than me. I haven't spent I'm gonna lean into this. If the fossil fuel industry is is the culprit. And if I think we're both, I don't know about you, I'm pretty skeptical about the idea of shutting that shutting the coffin on that Nosferatu anytime soon. Then this means we need to either come up with a weird way to do quantum teleportation using some as of yet non existent device that allows people to get from point A to point B without burning fossil fuels. Or we should be putting all of our energy into replicating the experiences that people are achieving by getting in a car and going to someplace. Because if that could happen, what who's going to get in there? Who's going on an airplane? Seriously, who gets on an airplane when you can just like, from your home, technologically teleport somewhere. I just feel like the metaverse is getting, I don't know, the metaverse is getting bashed when I think any kind of hypnotic technology at this point is a is a positive, even if it is consumerist, you know, like, if the like, if people are buying, I don't know, shit in the metaverse, whatever it may be, land in the metaverse, if people are buying houses in the metaverse and constructing houses in the metaverse, this is not hurting the planet at all. And yeah, aesthetically, is it going to be a pleasing future for us? The idea of like, just a bunch of us in our houses, like twitching under some like, virtual reality, neurological interface slash psychedelic drug being blown into our faces to prove the experience. No, it's but it I'll tell you, it's a lot more pleasing than drowning in your basement, having your eyes ripped out of your face by splinters being blown by Hurricane Force winds that unexpectedly sweep through your neighborhood. To me, I think the metaverse might be actually one of the most logical solutions. Let's get rid of people's reasons to travel, not by making not by thinking that we are going to implant in humans right now any kind of ethical or moral responsibility, but by creating a more desirable reality inside the machines. Well, I think there's, you know, there's different reasons to travel. And as the metaverse gets better and better, or as like virtual reality options for, you know, kind of meeting people remotely. And so doing business, for example, I think you're right, like you probably don't need to fly across the planet to meet people. If you could meet them in virtual reality. And if that was if that got the job done, you know, if that was satisfying enough. But there's a there's another option too, which, you know, is again, it's like a taboo thing to say because of this religion of technology that we have, which is like, let's reinstitute fucking sailing ships. They were beautiful. They were amazing things. We could do them all 21st century, you know, we could do like the Star Trek sailing ships. There's this amazing passage in Kim Stanley Robinson's recent novel Ministry for the Future, which is set in the near future. And the main character is on a ship crossing an ocean to go to a meeting and just enjoying the hell out of it, getting a ton of work done being with like the ocean planet that we actually inhabit, you know, kind of enjoying the sun rises in the sunset and wondering why the hell we ever gave up this beautiful thing of kind of slowly crossing the planet on the oceans, you know, having a little time out from your hectic schedule and then, you know, truly kind of valuing travel and valuing the time that you spend in the far away place and making the most of it because it's not just something that you kind of booked at the last minute and right a couple hours you were there and all of your like the, you know, all of the fucked up hecticness of your life is just like amplified and you can't like really run away from the stuff that's making you unhappy. But maybe if you had like these kind of like, you know, a week long timeout to cross an ocean and just kind of like breathe a little bit like there's nothing really bad about that. So pirates, you know, I think I think all of the above pirates, pirates are real, they're real. No, you can, I listen, I'm, I'm gradually realizing pirates that you are more of an optimist than you are more optimistic than me. I feel like, you know, sometimes like when I was getting ready to talk to you, I get nervous because I think maybe because I'm projecting my own negative sense of humanity onto you, you have this beautiful humanist view of some possible future. And I think it's wonderful. Maybe I'm just being a little too hard on my species or something, because my sense is more a kind of Machiavellian analysis of why we are, why we consume. Why do we consume so much? Why do we do it? And I know, and it's a dumb answer, it's because it makes us feel good. So to me, if, if we are to, you know, short wire that quality of humanists, we're not going to do it by somehow giving like great Dharma talks to people so that they begin to gradually let go of their addiction to matter. We're not going to do it by telling people, listen, I'm telling you, if you don't, if we don't stop living in this way, we are literally going to be like choked, coughing blood from the poisons in the atmosphere. Everything's going to catch on fire and die, because that just clearly hasn't worked. No one's really, that was actually my favorite, one of my favorite parts of the movie, when God, what was, I don't remember what her character's name was. Oh, shit. Like the one person who had the right reaction, what's her name? When she started screaming, screaming, no, the God, what's her, she was in Mockingjay. I can't believe, she's a super famous actress. I can't believe I can't. Jennifer Lawrence Lawrence. She's on TV. She's the one person who has the logical reaction to a meteor fatted, which is like, we're all going to fucking die. And she's just like made fun of, immediately turned into a meme. You know, so. She is my favorite character. Amazing. I loved her. So anyway, what I'm saying is, all of the current, as the clock keeps ticking, all of the subtle ways of trying to deal with this stuff seem to be somewhat pointless to the point where it seems like the idea is, let's hijack the human nervous system. Let's get people what they want, not tell them to revalue life. And by giving them what we want, I mean, let's find a way to hack into the human nervous system and blast people with digitized experiences that replicate why they travel. I'm sorry. I'm going to keep going back to that point. You know, there's other, there's almost a billion people and they're so different. You know, we have a lot of similarities, but we have a lot of differences. And yeah, there's other ways to hack into the human brain, besides the metaverse, right? A great way, like we've been talking about throughout this conversation to hack into the human brain is through stories. And really, I think, you know, movies are incredibly powerful. Comedy, comedy is incredible, incredibly powerful. Like what if Pixar decided that it was going to just start making movies about this beautiful kind of world slash story that I have in my brain that a lot of people have in their brains right now that we're trying to get out and kind of like make more real for everybody. Right. And they're, and they're, they're so good at storytelling. And they would be, they'd be like putting those messages right into the brains of our kids who, you know, in 10 years and 15 years, they're going to be running the show, right? That's incredibly powerful. Instead of just, you know, kind of movies about cars or movies about kind of escapism, right? Or, or, you know, whatever movies that are designed to just make money for the studio. If they were really kind of trying to hash out, like what does it mean to be human on this gorgeous planet that's in the process of degrading right now? And how do we, and then, you know, so I have, I have this kind of, I guess you could say vision or story in my brain that that I'm constantly sort of working on, like as I'm falling asleep and trying to figure out and trying to articulate and not doing a great job of it. And then the other thing that I have, which I wonder if a lot of people share, I think they do, is just this like, this deep sense of paradox of being human, like to, even if you're vegan, right, to eat means to kind of like, to kind of remove habitat for like other species and other animals. It's like, it's just being alive on this planet, like, which is like constantly cycling carbon and, you know, people are getting born and other animals are getting born and they die and then they turn into trees and then fruits and then they get re-eaten again. It's like this, the earth is this, it's so beautiful, but in some sense, it's kind of brutal in the way. It's just like constantly chopping up bodies and then composting them and then making, it's sort of beautiful. At the same time, it's kind of horrifying. And, you know, humans need energy. It seems like every time we come up with a new technology, which is kind of, it's a wonderful skill that we have as a species. We fuck it up, like it makes things get worse. We're like these really war-like apes that run around with spears and kill each other and bash each other on the head and then design like nuclear weapons that can be delivered at like ultrasonic speeds. You know, it's like we're such a paradox. You know, we do such wonderful things and, you know, if you kind of wake up on the wrong side of the bed, you can see like how kind of horrible we are too in a lot of ways. So I don't know. I think that if all, you know, close to a billion of us, we're sitting on that meditation cushion for, you know, an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening, it would do wonders for our species. And maybe in a hundred years or a thousand years, we'll get to that point where we're all basically Buddhists and we're walking around. We're not afraid of death anymore, which allows us to be kind of really selfless with each other. And we're just kind of like enjoying the wonder of being in this cosmos together for a brief instant and the awareness of literally being the universe, little folds of the universe that are having conversations with each other and kind of enjoying jokes with each other and enjoying eating fruits with each other. It's just so fucking amazing that we're here at all. We should be constantly in a state of wonder, in my opinion, but we're not quite there yet. We still have, you know, we still have people that don't have enough. There's artificial scarcity. There's people that can't get access to medicine. There's the whole global north, global south divide. Like we're kind of an adolescent species that I think climate and ecological breakdown is telling us to wake the fuck up. And I hope we do it soon and save what can still be saved on this amazing planet, right? But anyway, you know, until we have that sort of like level of kind of collective buddhahood, you know, maybe to get there to help bridge that gap. Again, I really think we need stories because I don't think you can have a movement that instead of having a few million people has a few billion people kind of making making this their life's goal to stop climate and ecological breakdown. You don't get something that big unless you have really, really compelling stories in my opinion. Or I guess maybe if everyone is panicking enough because of all the floods and fires and heat waves, maybe you get that then. But then you're right. Like if you don't have the kind of positive stories that can lead to a feeling of solidarity, then everything might just kind of descend into chaos and be really horrible. And then you kind of get to the road, right? So I think we need stories at this kind of critical bottleneck in our species and in our planet's history. Yeah, I love, no, I love that. Yeah, I love it. It's a Chogyam Chopra Rinpoche, who was a great Buddhist teacher. That was he said that the way that the dharma, these ideas will grow will spread is through art, that it's it art is a vehicle through which some of these ideas that do like anyone who has meditated or anyone who's like, you know, had any spiritual practice gets that intuition, that sense of like, wow, if everyone was doing this, there would be legitimate change in the world. Real, real, because you start to you start to plug into this like force field of meta, this like, to me, like one of the most kind of profound parts of my meditation practice is doing a few minutes of meta after the end of a sit. And what meta is, I'm sure a lot of your listeners know this is basically loving kindness, and you can you can sit there and kind of with the awareness of bodily sensations and like, you know, maybe you're feeling these subtle vibrations, and you could basically beam loving kindness towards yourself, but also towards all beings in the universe, not even just on the earth, right? And you're beaming this like loving kindness, may all beings be happy, you know, like, your happiness is my happiness. My happiness is your happiness. I just want there to be, you know, happiness throughout the universe and love and harmony throughout the universe. And then when you start beaming that out, you realize that there's other beings, certainly on earth, probably on other planets that are doing the same thing. Yeah, beaming it to you. And you're just like, holy fuck, like I live in a universe where there are there are beings that don't even know me, but that genuinely want the best for me. And to me, like that's such a powerful story, because you start coming out of this sense of being alone, and the sense of needing to battle for everything that's yours, and this, this sense of zero sum. And it all comes from realizing that the, the universe was here before you, the universe is going to go on after you. And you literally are the universe. So you don't, you start to dissolve the fear of death, right? Through kind of like this sense of profound connection. So I do wish everyone could have that. You can't give it to somebody just by talking. You have to, they have to experience it. And for them to experience it, it takes a little bit of work. It takes a little bit of commitment. It takes some a willing to a willingness to relinquish some of these stories that we have in kind of Western society, right? That, you know, everything is the dollar and everything is science. You have to be able to kind of, or maybe that everything is Christianity, you know, and when I was growing up as a Catholic, like I literally had this image in my brain of some guy with a beard and a white robe in the clouds, right? So you have to be willing to give up some of that stuff and to just experience what's really happening like in your, basically in your body and in your mind, which is to me, like that's a very scientific thing to like just literally observe what's really going on, right? Right. Now that I, this is, yeah, this, um, what you're meta Tong Lin is another name for it. The, um, the, that's a big piece of it is not like necessarily abandoning some like global cultural story, but yeah, just like whatever the reason that you have told yourself for why you're suffering for a second, get rid of that, give it up, forget it, and just experience the thing itself. And not just in the experience of what you're talking about, the beaming out of love, but in the experience of your own suffering, however you're suffering, if you're, you know, lonely or scared, or maybe you're going through, uh, you know, you have some disease and you're going through healing from that disease, whatever your experience, millions of other people are simultaneously having that identical experience. So when you take your own story away and just feel that, then you are experiencing, um, the suffering of the world. It's not, you know, the stories everyone has about why they're hurting might be different. Generally they're not, but they're the feeling itself is real. And I love that stripping away the story. Um, and maybe that's where it needs to start is not with some like, you know, the conditioning, the money story, or the, you're going to be happy once you have this much money or this kind of house, but even deeper than that, just strip away the story that you tell yourself to help you cope with your own personal pain. And then you can start feeling compassion for everyone else and you can start feeling compassion for the ignorance out there. Um, and I say that, you know, we, we all have ignorance and we all, we all react with ignorance, right? And we make things worse for ourselves and other people when we react. Um, but you know, there's a place for, I think there's a place for rage as well and for hard action to with, if it's done from a place of kind of centered spiritual, um, and, and a desire to protect as much as possible and to prevent suffering. Yeah. It's also interesting. I get a lot of, um, people, you know, that I, for example, like in responses and Twitter that say things like, um, like the earth's going to be fine. Like we're the ones that are going to be fucked. And it's, yeah. And it's this sense that, like, um, almost like the, the subtext is like, why even bother trying? Like after 10, they're right. After 10 million years, the, this will be a geologic layer and biodiversity, even if this even if we don't stop the six mass extinction, even if we keep recklessly accelerating into the six mass extinction, after 10 million years, biodiversity will recover. There will be some other, you know, probably a lot of turning of species and the, the kind of species that are here in 10 million years might look very different, but they're right. But meanwhile, I mean, we're here for this, like this cosmic nanosecond on this planet and it's beautiful. And like, why wouldn't we want to, with that time, engage in, in trying to, you know, to help as much as we can to prevent suffering and harm and death on this planet and to kind of, to, I don't know, to me, that's really meaningful to just like, try to make things better here for, for everyone and for also for nonhumans and to kind of figure this out. Like it's this, it's so confusing to be born into this hot mess, right? But there's something really, what else do we have to do with, with our few years on this earth, then to try to figure it out as best we can and to try to make things better. I don't know what else to do with this time. Like, I'd be really, I'd find it really depressing to not try, you know, like to not try to go back to the movie again, to not try to do everything that I can to, to make things better here. So, you know, I hope everyone starts to kind of shoulder some of that load. And that, you know, we kind of, I don't know, we sort of celebrate about that. And I'm yearning for a sense of kind of solidarity and joy in this movement as we kind of do this together and try to pull things back and try to, you know, make things better for the people on this planet who don't have anything right now and who are suffering in ways that a lot of us in the United States can't even really imagine. All while trying to like figure this whole, like, how do we exist on this planet thing out, right? Peter, thank you. You made me feel better. I was afraid to talk to you, because I was, I don't know, I've been very, you just made me realize how absolutely cynical I've allowed myself to get about the, regarding my ideas about climate change. So, I think that, yeah, I like your solution a lot better than mine. And yeah, it's a more beautiful thing to be part of telling stories that inspire people to help than to invent technologies that hypnotize people using hyper-advanced artificial intelligence so that their nervous systems are hijacked for the brief time that they're here so they won't hurt things. Brother, we just, we just got to keep doing everything we can, right? So, what a pleasure to talk to you. Thank you. Where can people find you?

I was taught by Benji from Chantala at a meditation retreat this past weekend. How to sort of do, like, tube on throat singing. A friend taught me once before, but I didn't quite understand it. But I'm going to teach you how to do it. It's kind of cool. It's a fantastic way to freak your dogs out, maybe annoy the people around you a little bit. Here's how you do it. You make the E. OK, that's the first part. And then you add an R to it, right? So you're making the E sound, but you're making the R shape with your mouth. And the way Benji explained this to me is, and this is someone who studied under Ali Akbar Khan. This is like an incredible musician. And he explained this to me in line to a buffet. So forgive me if I'm, I don't know. I don't know how to do it, obviously. I'm not up in the homolias. I'm not in Tibet. I'm not sitting in some snow cave. I'm not drinking mountain rain out of a skull bowl. But here's what here's how it sounds. This is from practicing three times. E. Now, as any great student, one of the things I like to do is to improvise. And so here's what I figured out. Not only if when you make the E sound and add an R to it, you get that very interesting, warbly, wind chime inside your mouth sound. But if you put your finger in your butt while you're doing it, it makes this sound. E. OK, I'm going to put my finger in my butt. E. Now, this is where it gets fascinating. Watch what happens when we put in three. E. Isn't that wild? It's like with each finger, there appears to be almost another voice added to the mix. And even though I didn't want to, I had to find out. What happens if we go full fist? And this was maybe one of the most amazing musical discoveries of my life. Take a listen. E. All right, here we go. Good people don't smoke marijuana. E. I don't know if it's just my imagination, but when I put my entire fist in my ass and do Tuvan throat singing, it sounds like former attorney general Jeff Sessions talking about marijuana. Maybe it's just in my head. I could be having some kind of confirmation bias or something like that. But just to be sure, I'm going to do it again. OK. E. I'm not sure we're going to be a better, healthier nation than if we have marijuana being sold at every corner grocery store. I just don't think that's going to be a good for us. Yeah, that's definitely former attorney general Jeff Sessions talking about weed. I guess you learn some every day. We've got a fantastic podcast for you today. The great Greg Fitzsimmons is here with us. All right, here we go. This episode is brought to you by Charlotte's Web, the world's most trusted hemp extract.

Thank you, Charlotte's Web. It happened again. A friendly person in bumper-to-bumper traffic was blasted with the evil eye by a warlock driving by in a small carriage being pulled by black goats. He didn't even know he'd been zapped with the evil eye, but by the time he got home, his face fell off, leaving only a bloody skull. This can happen, which is why if you decide to risk traffic, you should be doing something wonderful, like going to a park to drink moon oil out of a scented gourd.

That's what you get when you go and see a really good comedian, which is why if you ask me, it's always better to go see live comedy than to listen to it. In fact, it's almost two completely different things. Today's guest is the type of comic that creates some specific infernal slash holy mystical energy in the room when he performs. I love watching him at the comedy store. He's also got a fantastic podcast slash radio show called fitsdog.com. But mainly, here's the thing. If you happen to be in San Francisco tonight, even though I don't know when I'm going to release this or tomorrow, which is November 10th, definitely going to release it by then, go see him. He's performing there. He's also going to be a few other places, November 15th to 17th at the Comedy Works in Denver, November 23rd to the 25th at the Improv and Brea, December 28th to the 30th at Levity Live, and December 31st at the Helium Comedy Club in Portland, which is a, to me, that's, if you're going to go out on New Year's Eve, Jesus Christ, that's the only thing you should do. Fly to Portland, wherever you may be. Okay, friends, without further ado, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trestle family, our podcast, Greg Fitzsimmons. Sorry, you can't watch. It's the Dunkin' Trestle family. It's the Dunkin' Trestle family. Greg, welcome back to the GTAivens. We're coming over here, man. We were just talking about ketamine therapy, the depression. Yeah. Yeah. Did we talk about it in the last podcast? I didn't know that was something you wrestle with. Oh yeah, I've wrestled with depression my whole life. My dad had it. He died at 52. My mom's got it. And I take meds. I meditate every day. I try to work out. What meds do you take? Lemectal. I don't actually like to talk about it because if people are wondering what'll work for them, I don't want them saying, oh, I should use it. I don't want to be a commercial for any drug. Oh, sure, sure, sure. Yeah, that's a bad mistake for people to make. Anytime, man, like anytime I start using the internet or the advice of someone I hear in a podcast to like help me figure out my medications, but it's bad. That's dangerous. I go to a doctor, you're gonna fuck yourself up. Oh yeah, and if I say it, I should have to say, you may experience dripping from your anus. People bleeding. Yeah, when he passed, was it related to depression? Well, sort of. He was an alcoholic and he smoked three packs a day and he died of a heart attack. So I think it was very related to his overall unhappiness, I think the way he medicated himself. And yeah, I mean, I think it was the cigarettes that probably made his heart give out. Was he a vet? Did he go to war? No, he had trauma though. Okay. Yeah, he had childhood trauma. Yeah, fuck, man, depression is such the, it's just like the worst thing. I was, I don't mean to like, you're right here, but we were talking about ketamine therapy and for depression, which I have used to treat my depression, which I have, like I've had a recurring depression that comes on throughout my life. And yeah, it's the damnedest thing that it compared to all the other attempts I've made at treating it, it just seems to work. Wow. Yeah, it's so odd. How do you ingest it? Well, if you, it depends on if you do it as you should through a clinic, like you shouldn't do it yourself. Yeah. God, I'm such an old man now. Like in the old days, I'm like, you fucking snored it, man. Dude, you chopping up with some weed. Get some friends together. I just can't help but I'm becoming such a dad. It's like, well, you need to go to a doctor, which you should, but usually the way it's administered is intermuscularly. They inject it into your, into your shoulder or into your bicep and you, you go bye-bye. And some people have different ways of doing it. Some people actually administer it and then give you some kind of sedative so you don't fully experience the psychedelic quality of it. And then some people it's just like they don't do that. So you like go fully in for the ride, which is what's weird about ketamine is the guy who invented float tanks was really into it, John Lilly, and he mapped out based on dosages, the universes that you go into because it's not, there seems to be various types of psychedelics like that produce subjective states. If I take mushrooms, for example, it's gonna be like, it appears like I'm looking at some kind of melting, bending, wavering thing. And if I take a full dose, there is ego, what you would call, I guess, a disassociative state or emerging state, but the landscape seems to vary from trip to trip. Whereas with ketamine and DMT, the landscape doesn't really change that much, which is particularly interesting to me. You mean from experience to experience, you go back to the same place? Yeah, and not just that, but if you're with people doing ketamine, people will experience the same place together. No. Yeah. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. So that's pretty weird and interesting and mysterious. And also the fact that this somehow is not just like a recreationally or spiritually cool thing, but it's also curing depression is really weird when you think about that as though, there's like an idea that Carl Jung, I'm reading this wonderful book, The Undiscovered Self, he's saying like the problem is right now, religion has become quaint and people don't really believe it in the way they used to. There's no connection to a transcendent reality. We're totally glued to this reality. And when we think about religion, even if we go to church every Sunday, it's still a mythology, it's not a spirituality. Yeah, that's it. So we're looking at a world where there's this weird famine, but the famine is not related to food, it's related to a lack of connection to some kind of transcendent state of consciousness. And so everyone's getting fucking depressed because that used to be the normal way to be. That was your fuel line, that's what fed you. And then you took the transcendency, you took that energy and you basically manifested it. Everybody manifested it in different ways, but we were all connected to some kind of a lifeline of energy. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, and it was real. It wasn't some kind of like cutesy thing you do or some kind of like retro thing and it wasn't like a self-help thing. It was self-help, but it wasn't a thing where like maybe this will help with my career. Maybe it was like you were communing with something that was real and now. Well, I think that's why meditation has become so important is because you don't really need the religion part of it. You don't need the mythology. All you need is like that nowness to if you can be present in a meditation on a regular basis, you can definitely feel some transcendence. What kind of meditation are you doing? TM. Oh, cool. So you have the mantra. Yeah. What is that, 20 minutes twice a day? 20 minutes twice a day. Yeah, and I don't do it twice a day every day, but a lot of days I do, but I do it at least once every day. How long you been doing that? Like four years. Wow. Four or five years. I have friends who swear by that. Well, me and I was talking to Dave Kekner. Have you ever had Kekner on your show? I haven't had him on the show, but I love him. Oh, he'd be great. He's a real Catholic. And we were talking on my podcast about how many people we know that do TM that are people that we look up to and who say that it's changed their life. We go, why have we not done it? And so we signed up and we went together. We went to the place in Beverly Hills, the TM Center in Beverly Hills, which you show up and it's like, you know, beautiful people in yoga pants, barefoot, and they take you in this room and this woman was amazing. She was very like, she was very worldly. And, or should I say, otherworldly. I don't know. Otherworldly. Otherworldly, okay. And then we had this guy in our class named Jimmy and he was young and good looking and a hungover every time. And then he asked her at one point, he goes, will the TM work if you're doing cocaine? What'd she say? That's an important fucking question, dude. And she's kind of said no. She goes, well, you know, it's every practice is different, but in general, that kind of thing is gonna jack you up and bring you out of like more of a quiet space. Right. Yeah. God, I've desperately asked my teachers that question, hoping beyond hope that they'd be like, oh yeah, not cocaine, but like I can remember Sharon Salzburg is this great meditation teacher. And I can remember asking her like, you know, cause I'd been watching Westworld and like at the time I was drinking, so I had convinced, I thought it was cool to like sit and drink whiskey and watch Westworld cause they all drink whiskey in there, right? But you know, when you're like habituated to booze, you're just coming up with reasons to fucking drink, right? Like it's just your stupid brain tricking you and like, oh yeah, that makes sense. What do you do? Like when I'm watching other shows, I'm not like, ah, fuck man, let me like, let me get some like, like if I'm watching a post-apocalyptic show, I'm like, let me get a bucket of garbage and smell it during the shows. I smell this world. But yeah, but so, and I was asking her like, well, isn't that kind of like, can I practice mindfulness? Can I, isn't that a practice, you know, drinking and being in the moment of drinking and watching? And she's like, well, it's a practice, but you're practicing the wrong thing. But then there's other schools of thought which are, run counter to that, which is that no, actually, there is no break in it at all. There is no moment where you're being profaned, moment where you're being holy. The whole thing is- Jesus served wine. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, he did, yeah, that's right. And so I don't know, I am always going back and forth on that, but it does seem to be a pretty recurring, a recurring message, which is that at some point, entering into this with a sober mind is going to be more efficacious than not, you know? What about marijuana? Yeah, it's, you know, I keep, you listen, my, the people who I'm, who I work with, they're from this, they're like Ram Dass, who was like a friend- Yeah, Ram Dass, yeah. You know, he was, it was mushrooms that brought him to his guru, essentially, or that started his like, actually synthetic psilocybin that started his like awakening, for lack of a better word. And, you know, they don't tiptoe around that fact. They're like, if not for that, it wouldn't have, I wouldn't be, he wouldn't have written be here now. Right. Because there's a, you can sort of track his course through India, which it was based on wanting to give LSD to people who meditated to see what they thought it was. And the, so what they say is like, it's like, you can do it, go ahead. That's what he says, do it, do it. If you're drawn to it, if you want to take psychedelics, just don't trick yourself into imagining that what you're doing is, if you're not really using it for to awaken, if you're using it as a form of escape, escape, you know that, like you can't trick yourself, you know what you're doing. That's really what it's about, isn't it? It's about going inside or it's about hiding, you know, using, whether it's drinking or smoking pot or any addiction, you know, any workaholic, you know, alcohol, and it's all, you know, and then you discover, and I didn't think about drugs as being able to enlighten you until I was much older. To me, it was just about being a teenager and, you know, doing whatever thing you could do to get, think about the term to get fucked up. Yeah. Like that's the opposite of enlightenment, to get wrecked. I think you're fucked up tonight, man. I am so fucked up right now. Are you fucked up right now? I'm not right, I'm fucked. Yeah. I'm wrong. Yeah, yeah. You're smashing apart your whole reality. I can remember being completely blast on acid when I was in high school and saying that to someone, like, man, I'm so fucked up right now. And he was like, you really shouldn't say that, you know, like fucked up, like, are you fucked up? Like, is that, and I remember thinking, what a fucking idiot, shut up. Yes, I'm fucked up. The walls are melting, man. I'm seeing skulls in the fucking stucco right now. This is what I wanted. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But now, again, in my old age, I understand, you know, that language can give you a horrific trip. If you're using that language, it's, you know, you can definitely go down a dark. Well, this guy who leads you through the ketamine, does he sort of like coach you through it, prepare you for it and kind of walk you through it? No. He just administers it. Most people that, well, I mean, he prepared, yeah, I would say that there's like a, he's a doctor. So there's like a preparatory, there's like most, a lot of people who are working with psychedelics right now, they have a really great attitude about it, which is that we facilitate, but the healing is happening from your relationship with the medicine that's going into you. It's not, it's depending. Like there's so many different types of psychedelic therapy. The stuff they're doing with MDMA to treat PTSD is like a long-term, I think it's a year-long, intensive program where I believe there's two MDMA, you do it twice in the year and there's like a lead-up and then there's an integration and then you do it one more time. I think in that second time is that you can choose to do it or not. And, you know, it's like very like, it's been worked out and it's not just the MDMA itself. It's like, you know, if you have trauma, there's not, the MDMA is not gonna be the only thing that fixes the trauma. If you have trauma, you gotta deal with some shit, man. Yeah, yeah. Have you heard about that theory of what trauma is? Have you ever heard that it's a memory problem? Have you heard that? Yeah, I mean, the problem is that our brain has two halves and one side processes trauma and emotions and the other side is linear and it's chronological. And so with PTSD, whether it's a soldier or some type of abuse that you went through, your mind does the two sides don't connect. So the trauma lives on one side and until you connect them, that's why I like when you do EMDR, which is, you know, basically when they used to do it with a watch, follow the watch back and forth, now they do it with your whole two different sticks and they vibrate alternately back and forth as you talk through what the trauma was and it connects the linear side. Because otherwise that trauma relives itself over and over again as if it just happened. And when you connect both sides of your brain, it says, oh no, no, that's behind you. That already happened, you can let go of that. Right, yeah, you've done this? Yeah, I did a little bit of it. Yeah, man, it's like a- I mean, is that your understanding of it? Well, yeah, it's, yes, that's how it was explained to me and if I try to like regurgitate, it was explained to me by Rick Doblin, who is running the MDMA clinical trials or is part of MAPS, I mean, a lot of people are running it. And I feel like if I try to describe it, well, I guess the, I'll just say, like guys, obviously, I'm a bro scientist, I have no, like he told me- He told me and I listened and I tried to understand, but it is related to what you're saying. It's that, it's something to do with like when you create him, so when you remember something, your brain is, I think, creating it. You know, like it's like the memory itself is being recreated every time you have it. It's just what you're saying. You have this trauma, some shit happened to you over time that was completely horrific. And because of that, you are now always living in that zone of anxiety or whatever it may be. You have maybe even repressed the memory. You just have an anxiety disorder. You don't understand, I just always feel nervous. What's going on or maybe you've got an anger problem. So you've noticed that sometimes you get fucking mad and you don't even, you just think that's who I am. I'm a guy who gets mad sometimes. You don't realize, well, the reason you get mad is because you were getting the shit kicked out of you when you were a fucking kid. And the only way to make that shit kick and stop was to get fucking like nuclearly angry, scream, bite, thrash, you know what I mean? So you don't remember that because you can't tolerate the fact that somebody in your life who you respected and loved and maybe to this very day have been trying to like win their admiration or something was kicking the fucking shit out of you when you were a 10 year old. But you don't remember. You were dependent on them. Your life was literally dependent on their care of you. And instead they were hurting you. That's crazy for young child to try to understand. I mean, and it's just like, you know, that sometimes when you read about abuse, you'll see that there's physical abuse and then there's psychological abuse, sexual abuse. But it's like, if you're getting physical abuse, you're getting psychological abuse too. It's not like they're just punching you. And then they're like, you're awesome, kid, let's go. But it's like, they're also trying to rationalize in their own mind the fact that they're like beating up someone younger than them. And then on top of that, they're trying to make the younger person understand that this somehow makes sense. Makes sense, you fucking pussy. This is how it works. So you get trauma and now you can't remember that shit, but you're always kind of nervous. You're a little afraid all the time. You're always kind of afraid all the time. That's because this, you're living in it still. And this is a memory disorder. So something about the combination of therapy to get in there, cause you gotta get in there. And then the MDMA, so as this like, you finally like get into the thing. You know, like some people have these blisters for lack of a better word in their brain around a cluster of experiences. And you can't go, that is a no goes, you can't go there, you can't. And so you go into that place with a therapist on MDMA, you're something about the combination of that medicine and revisiting the memory is cause- It drains it, it drains the blister. Drain the blister, yeah. And then there's follow up after that. And then another one. So yeah, it's apparently like the, they're getting very good results from it. But I know, I know. But it's, you know, traditional talk therapy has always been very hard for people, like especially when you talk about the military, which is, you know, a big section of people that have trauma are coming back with, you know, being fucking blown up in a tank or, you know, watching death on a constant basis. And they come back and you've been trained as a soldier. First thing they train you in in basic training is don't talk about it, don't think about it, don't feel it, do it, just be tough, basically. And then when you experience that stuff and you come home and they, for years they tried to do talk therapy, these guys can't talk. They've met end women, they can't talk about it. No. And so they had to find a way to get inside of there, whether it's through MDMA or whether it's through EMDR, you know, where you- What does EMDR stand for? Eye movement. Oh, what is it? It's something eye movement, because traditionally it was originally, it was about your eyes moving back and forth. I just remembered I have access to every- Oh yeah, you have the internet right there. EMDR, what does it mean? And it connects things. And it lets your, lets the both sides of your brain can act with each other. And it's almost like resetting a clock. Eye movement, desensitization and reprocessing. Wow, that is so nuts, man. Yeah. Did it work for you? I didn't go far enough into it. I did a little bit of it, I needed to do more. I mean, it's like the work of like addressing stuff like that is just, I don't know, man. I mean, in a weird, it's almost like it's so rotten to have to like go back into there that you almost feel like, you know, I'd rather just be anxious for the rest of my life than like go back to that- I'm bottoming out though. Like I'm trying this thing now. You talked about Neil Brennan did it. Yeah. Which is the magnetic cranial therapy, what is it called? The cranial magnetic therapy, CMT. Yeah. Yeah, where you go in and it's a commitment. You go in every day for like eight weeks. Wow. And they hook you up for like a half an hour. I'm starting it in a couple of weeks. They hook up the front of your brain and they run some waves through there. And they basically, I think they stimulate parts of your brain that are responsible for good feelings. And it gets it flowing again. But it's got like a 75%. It's for people that are treatment resistant. And you have to prove to your insurance because it's expensive as hell. So your doctor has to go to your insurance company and say this person's tried three or four types of antidepressants and none of them worked. Right. And then they'll allow it. Right. Wow, man. Yes. Treatment resistant depression. Treatment resistant depression. Yeah. Yeah. I think, I don't know, man. I'm sorry to say this because like, this is like, well, maybe I won't actually. It's something I related to Neil about ketamine therapy. I don't want to say anything about it because I don't know for sure. But, you know, I had great. Is it that he's gay? He's a gay murderer. He's a gay murdering alcoholic. He's a serial killer. Yeah, I didn't want to say it, but yeah, you know, it's probably not a big deal. No, I mean, he's a comedian. He talks about it.

Man, it's just like that thing, like, you know, as you get older, crazy shit happens to you and you remember crazy shit, crazy shit happens to you. And if you notice this, like, how do I put it? Like when I was younger, I could look at the world and I could pick out people and be like, that person's a fucking asshole, right? That's a asshole. You know, you're just out, you know, when someone does some dumb ass thing, you're like that fucking motherfucker, what a dick. And then the older you get, and you realize that everybody's experiencing these landmines in their life. And whoever you may be running into that's acting like an asshole, guaranteed some rotten thing happened to that. And then you lose the luxury of hating people. Have you experienced that? Yeah. And I think when I'm in a better place, I have more empathy and when I'm not in a good place, it's almost like because I quit drinking, I quit drinking like 27 years ago. And one of the things that's allowed me to not drink is, you know, you do some program stuff and you realize why do I feel like drinking right now? You know, why am I craving a drink and looking at it and thinking about it? And it's just a big red flag and you just gotta stop and go, all right, what's going on? Right. What's really bothering me? What issue is coming up? You know, am I like right now, I'm having a hard time because I'm about to go on the road for three weeks straight. Oh yeah. You know, gone for three days, home for two days, gone for three days. And when it's coming up, I always get in a bad place. Had an argument with my wife today, we don't argue. And, you know, got mad at somebody driving. I don't, and I have a horrible temper. I had it my whole life. Used to get into a lot of fights, constantly yelling, blown up relationships, really bad temper. And it's gotten a lot better. Great. But when it pops up, I get to stop and go, what's going on? And so I did that today and I went, oh yeah, you're going away on Wednesday for three weeks. Right. And so that's what kept me from drinking. And it's the same thing with, you know, just your mental health in general and seeing that person as, oh, they're not an asshole. They're pushing the button that my father used to push when he tried to tell me how to behave or whatever it is, you have to connect the dots and say, why is this really bothering me? Right. But when you're in a negative place and you're under duress and something's really riding you, it's harder to give that person a break. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is, you know, man, I was, I do this like, my meditation teacher, this guy, David Nicktern, and like, he comes out every once in a while, teaches classes, and like, we'll do like a little podcast talking about Buddhism. And then like, people ask questions to him. And one of the people in the class asked this like, brilliant question that's just stuck with me, which is like, since I've, you know, everyone says when they're talking about meditation, mindfulness, there's a sense of like, it's going to make you feel great. You're going to be a polished river stone of a human. Really what happens is you start knowing yourself more. And in Tibetan Buddhism, that's the name of meditation is gom, which means self-understanding, yourself knowing. And so you start knowing yourself more and then the knowing of yourself more, you begin to realize that, oh no. You know, like, I can remember like, I would watch somebody talk about trauma on TV, and I would be like, man, that must suck for you. Yeah. And then suddenly you start going down the rabbit hole of your past, and there it fucking is. And you're like, oh, shit. Oh, shit. No. Oh, really? Oh no, I don't want that. Hold that, hold that order. Yeah, yeah. And so then now, so it's sort of like this like, things starts happening where you have to, you're not numb now. Like you got to deal with it, like now you start understanding a little bit more. If you get angry, if you have weird moments or whatever, it's kind of not, it's strangely luxurious to imagine. They're like, oh, I'm just, you know, sometimes I just, you know, blow steam. Yeah. And then when you start seeing like, oh fuck, the whole, what it's all built on and all the connection. And then when you start seeing that, and then you realize this like, almost every single person's life appears to be built on blocking out data streams, because if you allow yourself to see what's really going down, it can be pretty like heart wrenching, you know? So, I don't know, man. I like, to me, it's scary because we're all alone. You know, you try to find someone to love and you know, you're married now, congratulations and about to be, you know, family man. Yeah. You know, and all that stuff is great, but you know, we're all, we're still all alone. And whatever you experienced as a kid, when you were that alone, and you thought you were part of something, you thought that there was a construct and that it was seamless. And then when you're taken out of that for whatever reason, whether it's through trauma or just a natural life cycle of moving on, I mean, just growing up and leaving your home is a trauma in a way. Fuck, yeah. Because you're alone, now you're alone again and now you can't be taken care of and you have to take care of yourself. And that's frightening to have to take care of yourself, especially when things go bad. Right. You know, and that's why you were talking before about how when we lost religion, part of religion, because it is the spirituality of it, it is the transcendence, but it's also the community of it that we've lost. And that with that, you know, not only you're losing your connection to what's above you, but also to what's around you. Right. And it's that aloneness that you have to deal with when all this data comes at you, when you feel alone dealing with it, it's insurmountable. Oh God, you're right, man. That's, there's so many people who like have no community, no one to talk to, you can't afford a therapist. Yeah. And then for whatever reason, the brain decides like, hey, remember when this happened? Hey guys, so, hey, I want to show you something. I got this photo album of shit that'll fuck you up. So crazy. Remember when you thought this was a cute memory? Like I had this memory, I was a smoking pot like 25 years ago with a friend of mine, and we're sitting there and we're like, hi, and we're talking about old shit. And the YMCA came up, we're talking about, yeah, I used to go to play basketball at the YMCA, and I was like, yeah, I used to go to this swim class when I was like six, and five even. And I remember like this guy, Mr. D, would come into the shower room, and we would all be naked. I remember he picked up this one kid, Elliot, and he grabbed him and he picked him up, and Elliot was naked, and he was like, I'm gonna take you out to the pool because the girls are swimming out there right now, and he was jumping with him, and I just, and Mr. D was like in a bathing suit, Jesus. That didn't occur to me at that time that that was wrong in any way. I thought it was, he was teasing him, there was girls out there that that was the whole dynamic. And then I'm sitting there, big thinking, that was wrong. Yeah. That was a bad thing. Yeah, yeah, that's right. Not for me, but for Elliot. For you, well, you observed it, and that was, you know, just being in the presence of it. It's like everyone's getting blasted by that shit, man. It's like everyone, because what happens is these fucking predators, man, they either subconsciously or consciously recognize that there is an innate defense mechanism that pops up in people who don't wanna deal with confrontation. They know that. They're like, they know how to be invisible. Oh, it's so fucked, dude. And like, you know, yeah, so you're, and a lot of times this will come to people when they're stoned or when they're on some psychedelic. You know, your brain just suddenly is like, you know, okay, here we go. Because you're, I think what it is, is it's like, from what I've heard, you know, once people get into a place actually where they feel stable, is when the stuff starts coming. Because you're, something in you doesn't wanna reveal some of this shit when you're, when you are alone, when you are in a crazy place. That's, those are the periods where you're just getting hammered all the time and acting like that's normal because you're having fun, you know, just a party. You don't even think, oh, you know, I can't remember. Like, I think about like nine years of my life just seem to not be there at all for some reason. Ha, ha, that's normal. Yeah, right. That's a drink, ha, ha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then you realize you weren't alone for more than five minutes in those 10 years. You just always made plans. You always hung out. You're always active, taking trips, sitting at the store until two in the morning, talking other comics, going to a diner after that. Like, just never alone. On the run, man. Always on the run. Gotta keep moving. And this is a, you know, like, maybe you notice in yourself this sense of impatience, you know, like impatient people who are like, or I've noticed in my own life, like I will suddenly find myself like, for example, I'm going to take a walk, let's say. And suddenly I'm impatiently trying to find the shit I need to go outside and take a walk. I'm in a hurry to get out there to take the walk. And then even when I'm on the walk, I'm kind of, it's still in a hurry. And you're like, well, I'm always in a fucking hurry. What's going on here? Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I'm in a hurry to go relax and take a walk. Yeah. So true. Yeah, so you see these people with trauma, PTSD and like, they'll, you know, they're always in a hurry. Yeah. Always gotta keep going, gotta move, move, move, move. Gotta keep going, gotta keep going. Cause you're trying to like, you're still running away from this fucking thing that isn't even happening anymore. That's why sometimes super successful people are such assholes. Because the reason they're successful is that they've been just driving themselves and not dealing. And it's almost like, it's like a caffeine rush all the time to just be running from yourself. Yeah. And you have these goals cause then those goals are gonna redefine how you feel about yourself. And they never do. So you keep trying. Anytime I see somebody who's got like, you know, $10 million and they're still working their asses off. Especially if, it's one thing if like you're an artist and you're doing it cause you love the art. But when you're a businessman and you're still working like, you know, 12, 14 hour days when you have all that money, it's like, you're a miserable motherfucker. Yeah. Yeah. Like, I, you know, it's very, it's like very similar to the any kind of horror movie where the protagonist is like evading some chainsaw-wielding lunatic. It's like, except here in this reality, the chainsaw-wielding lunatic is something in the past. And the people aren't allowed to scream here. So like, they kind of... Oh my God, Jason is a, is a fucking beating you got from your dad when you were four. That's right. Yeah. That's it. Jason is like the continued psychological abuse that you receive from somebody when you were growing up. Yeah. And the fucking, it all makes sense that you realize why people love those fucking serial killer movies. And like, it's because it's like so many of, man, I'll tell you, when you realize like, you know, one thing I've thought is the United States, the way the United States wages war is crazy. We've been in war at war. What is it? 92% of our history. And we very rarely have anyone blow us up back. We blow people out. Like in the old days war was like my army hits your army. And then there's missiles come into my home kingdom. There's, you know, the people war was really bad because there was this like, you would get attacked. There was this, you were at war because your kingdom was going to get overrun. Right. Now it's like the way we do war is we just bomb the fuck out of people. And over here, nothing really happens. It's a weird dynamic. It's a weird dynamic. We get a terrorist attack that's rotten here and there, but relatively speaking, based on the number of structures we've blown up to the number of structures that get blown up here, there doesn't seem to be any kind of real. Harity. Right. And so I would always think about that. And by the way, you know, this is a horrible thing to say, but now I got a kid on the road. Oh, here we go. I don't want there to be a parody. I don't want to get blown up. I'm sorry. I didn't tell them to send the missiles over there. I would, you know, it's not like I'm complaining here. You know what I mean? But that being said, there is some slight parody, which is that what's happening is people are coming back from over there. And all that fucking violence is in them because they have PTSD. And then they're like beating the shit out of their kids or they're maybe not beating their kids, but they can't handle what happens. So they're getting drunk all day long. Right. And so it's like, even though we're not seeing buildings being exploded, what we are- Well, they're shooting people. There are definitely a lot of incidents of vets coming back and shooting people. That, yeah. So we're seeing this like, what's, it's not as though we're our hands are this place. Yeah. We're, what we're witnessing is kind of, it's like at least over there when buildings have been blown up and you know the buildings been blown up, here you can pass a perfectly nice house on any given street. And inside that fucking house is a, is somebody who is doing every single thing they can to not blow their brains out. And simultaneously to raise their family. And the family feels that. And so the family's going out into the world and the kids are going out into the world and they're taking that inside of them. And then they're doing weird shit. At school or to, they're bullies or they're hitting people or they're cutting themselves. So it still is bleeding out into our society but no one really talks about it. No one even understands, like we've been awarded 93% of our fucking history, man. How many people have PTSD in this country? Right. Untreated. It's nuts, man. Like my dad, he, he was telling me like, oh yeah, they just told me like take Xanax when it happens. You dad? Yeah, my dad was in Vietnam. Oh, no shit. Yeah. Wow. Has he talked about having PTSD? Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. What happened with my dad was like, I, you know, I had heard my dad, I knew my dad had PTSD. My mom had told me, oh, your dad has PTSD. And I remember my friend is a doctor. I was like, oh yeah, my dad has PTSD. I was just in the middle of a car. He's like, wait, what? I'm like, oh yeah, he has PTSD. And he's like, Duncan, do you know what that is? What it means? Like what that, what happens? And then he starts explaining my childhood to me. Yeah. It was crazy. Yeah. That was a big moment for me. So did he ever get treated for it? Well, no, what happened was, well, he got treated by the VA. So the VA, I don't know what programs they're using now, but what they would do is that what they, they treat the symptoms, not the, I don't, you know, I guess you can get counseling or whatever, but the whatever they're doing doesn't really matter. Whatever they're doing doesn't really work that well. They don't go to the root of it. Right. There's apparently like a whole underground group of veterans that give MDMA to other veterans. Oh wow. Yeah. But man, I don't know. It's like, to me, like these days I have been thinking a lot about the effects of trauma on humans and the like looking out at the world and just thinking, oh, I get, I see what's happening here. Everyone's fucking traumatized. Right. And we don't know how to deal with that. Yeah. And it is, it's like you said before, it's so easy to see if you're looking for it and you're open to seeing the signs of it, that that guy's an asshole. No, that guy's in pain. That guy doesn't trust that the universe is going to take care of him. That guy thinks that when you're trying to pull into his lane, you're actually going after him on a personal level and trying to hurt him. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Cause that anger that comes up when you do that to him and he gets that angry, that's not rational and you can't react to that. You could, you have to have empathy for it on some level. And it's like our whole fucking paradigm here is based on this idea of exacting revenge. Right. So it's like though, we're all trying to get revenge. And I, you know, man, I went to see the Dalai Lama speak in Anaheim at some, he was his birthday party. Right. And it was like one of the most embarrassing things I ever saw because it was like all these celebrities wishing the Dalai Lama a happy birthday. Like whoever organized it was like, it was just, no one like, it was really weird, but like, in sad. Where was it? It was like in some theater in Anaheim. Like here's the Dalai Lama. And he's on stage and celebrities are going up and saying happy birthday. MC Hammer reads him a poem. I didn't know that's what it was. I didn't know that's what it was. It's Lava time. It was like, it's, you know, I don't know, I was expecting it to be like the Dalai Lama speaking. And he did a little bit. Yeah. And you do get to enjoy like the energy of that being flooding out into the room. And also I think what was awkward about it is the Dalai, like I guess that it was the sad pompous expectation that the Dalai Lama was going to give a shit about celebrities. Yeah. It's a fucking Dalai Lama. Like it's not that he doesn't like MC Hammer. It's just that he doesn't think MC Hammer is any more special than anybody else, you know? It's a cult of personality meeting like, you know, just someone who's like a very advanced being. But he did say something that stuck with me, which is that if someone's doing something shitty to you, it's an echo. Like that's not a person doing something shitty to you. That's an echo of someone doing something shitty to them. So it's like that realization really fucks with the entire concept of how we're supposed to run shit out here, which is now what are we gonna do? It's like, well, someone's an asshole. Don't they deserve punishment? You know, don't they deserve to get smacked? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's the thing. And then you look, you know, I saw a thing on 60 Minutes about incarcerating people in Denmark. Did you hear about this? No. They don't, I mean, if you want to sort of extrapolate that idea to the prison system, like whether or not you can reform, or whether or not it's there for punishment. I mean, why do we have prisons? And in this country, it's a very different idea than it is in other countries. And in Denmark, the prisoners go in, and I'm talking murderers, go into prison, and it's like having your own apartment. You have like a one bedroom with a bathroom, and it's like you can leave on the weekends, and you only spend like maybe a year or two doing time, and then you're released again. And while you're in there, there's all kinds of programs, there's all kinds of freedoms, and there's, and people heal. And the recidivism rate is extremely low. People change, and you stop and you go, all right, well then what are we doing in this country? We're taking people that are echoing negative experiences in their own lives, and they're putting them out into our society, and then we're taking them, and giving them more trauma by putting them in solitary confinement, and in places where they're getting beaten up, and then they're putting them back onto the street. Now they're echoing more stuff. Right. It's like a battery charger for trauma. Prison's like charging the battery. Put it in there, juice it up, and get it right back out. And then the trauma spreads, and then that person like continues to infect people. It's an infectious psychic malady is what it is. And it's like our view of it is so fucking stupid, and backwards, and crazy. I don't know, man, it's a... What's gonna turn it around? Meditation? David Lynch wants to teach in the public schools. Yeah, you know, I don't know. This is like a thing that was coming up in this talk, I was having with David Nickton is one of the other things someone was saying is like, well, you know, they're teaching mindfulness to drone pilots. You know, they're you, oh yeah. Yeah, so they're like, because mindfulness is a neutral state. It's like a way to observe your thoughts and not get attached to your thoughts. So in a weird way, for the military, it's kind of a wonderful calming mechanism as you're preparing to launch your missiles into some village. Calm the mind, a thought emerges. What is the thought? I don't know if I should launch a missile into this village. Think, this is called noting and Buddhism. Thinking, oh, you just think thinking and then fire the missile. It's just a thought, just another thought. Fire the missile. So you become a drone too. Yeah, yeah. You're a drone launching a drone. Yeah, it's just a new, it's a neutral technology. It's a mindfulness is a neutral technology to not get entangled in your thoughts. Some people believe that the practice of mindfulness will somehow also bring compassion out of the human heart. By understanding yourself, you will begin to understand that there's really, unfortunately, no bad guy as we understand it out there. We're just dealing with people who've got a lot of weird code in their operating system. And the way to fix the code is not necessarily to blow up the computer. It's to figure out a way to get in there and shift the code. To answer your question, man, I have no fucking idea. If you watch that documentary on the white helmets in Syria, have you seen that shit? No. Have you done any like any? I noticed the people that show up after an explosion and try to save the people. And very often they're killed because then they re-bomb the same spot. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Yeah, you just, I was watching this documentary because I was thinking like, well, I should at least know what's happening over there. I don't really understand it at all. And so I watched this documentary. And it's just the worst thing you can imagine. And it's just buildings on top of babies. And babies being pulled out of crevices and buildings. And then getting bombed while you're pulling the babies out. Yeah, or one of the things that shows as a person waiting, knowing that, oh, a building got bombed and there's three bodies. And waiting to hear if one of the bodies was his brother. And getting to enjoy a nice couple of hour period of not knowing if his brother was alive or dead. Just that alone. Your brother's alive. That's the rest of your life. You'll never forget that. And that's happening every day there. So I was watching that. And my sweet, spiritual, Ram Dass, I love it so much. And then you watch a thing like that. And you're challenged deeply by that. I was just thinking like, I don't know what could ever be done to make that work in the future. Because even if I press a button and some piece descends on Syria, what about all the people who, for the rest of their lives, I think it's like 300,000, 400,000 dead Syrians now? What about all the survivors for the rest of their lives? Yeah, for every one of those people that died, there's five, six close family members that are completely destroyed for the rest of their lives. And many of them want to perpetrate the violence back to the Syrian government or whoever is responsible for the bombing. Yeah. And then you look at that and you're like, well, that's just that. I don't know. And I talked to my teachers about this. And they're like, their response is, well, right now, what can you do? What's the real thing you can do right now? Like what right now? Because that stuff is just like dramatic. Oh my god, the horror. Now I'm all dramatic and shit. So they always just go back to like, OK, OK. But is that kind of like drama that you've like the show I just put on as I'm like amplifying myself to talk about my horrified sensibilities? They might say like, is that it? What does that feel like to be like that? What is that feeling of being horrified? Let's sit with the feeling for a second. What's going on with that? And then the process of like getting back into the now, at the very least, it's going to like calm you. So the idea is like basically they put is like, well, the reason we're doing this at all or practicing at all is so that when we come to a point where we need to deal with that, where we come to a point where we can make a real decision that might help something like that around us right now. Yeah, it's almost like when you see triage nurses working unwounded in a like the white helmets. Yeah. How is it that they're able to? OK, let me go get some bandages. Let me get a splint. Let me take care of business. Let me put one foot in front of the other and take care of it. And there's a part of them that's doing that. They've they've somehow neutralized all that horror and they're able to continue on in the face of it. Yeah. Now, are they experiencing trauma as a part of that? Absolutely. Yeah. But in that moment, they're present. They're in the moment. Yeah. Of care. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a idea that which is like, well, you know, and I've thought about, I used to think, why do they even call it a fucking practice? You know, why is it called a practice? What does that even mean? What it's like, you're not playing piano. And now I think I have a better understanding. Is what it is, is you're practicing for the moment that will happen to everybody. Yeah. Whatever it may be, there's a moment that will happen where you freaking out and losing your shit or going nuts or getting hyper angry is not only going to like hurt people, but like potentially like cause like a lot of rotten karma to happen to you. So the practice is like, we do really, it's like, well, at least the way I've been taught is like, everyone's kind of a white helmet. It's just like for us right now in the West, that shit isn't happening here yet, you know? But we don't know, you know? No. Could be a rocky, our kids are going to have a rocky time. You know, the winter's coming. Winter is coming, right? Yeah, people, people, Terrence McKenna said something that was really quite dismal. And, but isn't necessarily dismal in the sense that like potentially like people learning that there are real world effects for our decisions as a country, as an individual, there's real world effects. But he would say like, everyone's saying, oh, at the end of the world is coming. It's like, you know, at the time, I don't think Syria was imploding, but he was like, you know, I think he was talking about the Congo where the genocides were happening. He's like, go there, it's happening now. If you're out there and you've suddenly witnessed what's going on out there, which is like, I think it's the Congo. Unfortunately, the problem is it's happening in so many places, it's hard to pick one. But you know, there's like organized rape that happens. Yeah, yeah, the John Jui and the South Sudan. Yeah, they're just going in and they're burning, they're killing all the livestock, burning the villages, raping the women, and then moving on to the next town. That's right. How do you, how do you possibly, you know, they're doing the most twisted, I don't even wanna talk about some of the stuff they do. Yeah. And you just think like, well, yeah, that is, that's the end of the world. Yeah, that's what it looks like. And because you know, people think the end of the world is gonna, people's idea of the way the end of the world happens is really like, they based on movies. Because you watch a movie, man, if you're going to watch a movie about the end of the world, if that shit hasn't happened within the first like 15 minutes of the movie, it's a boring ass movie. If I go see an end of the fucking world movie, I want the end of the world to happen within the first five minutes. Or hopefully it already happened and they're surviving in some wasteland. I don't remember what, I saw some shitty apocalypse movie where the fucking apocalypse, it didn't really even happen to like act, like the middle of act two or something. I was like, come on, give me the fucking apocalypse. Ha ha ha ha. Apocalypse now. I wanna. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But like, you know, in the same way people think like the way people think, people who haven't been around dying people, they think that the way people die is the way happens in a video game where someone just like, and it does when they're like, someone gets like a super traumatic injury. But mostly the way death happens is a process. So, you know, if you're with hospice, they'll tell you, oh, the process is starting now, which is the body gradually just starts shutting down. And I think similarly, if there were to be an apocalypse, it's not gonna just happen. It's gonna be, we're gonna like see it. Fuck, look over there. Wow, it looks pretty bad over there. Ah, I'm gonna go lay in my hammock now. Ha ha ha ha. There's no apocalypse around this hammock. No, I mean, look, it's beautiful here. It's like, it's wonderful, it's wonderful. And so, and so then it gets, so for me it does go back to the question of like, I don't want to imagine that the reason that I'm doing some spiritual practice is just some hedonic pursuit of like feeling good. That's a really fucked up thing. Like, I'm gonna meditate to feel better and great and wonderful. And I just want to draw people to me and become magnetic and become charismatic and maybe become a little telepathic and then start controlling people and then make some fucking money or whatever it is. The idea is like, here's maybe what's happening. We're about to go into like a really, really turbulent period in human history and we need people who are calm and peaceful and have learned how to not be reactive so that people can help. We need white helmets everywhere. I think that's the, at least that's what they keep telling me. They're talking about Michelle Obama right now, aren't you? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm talking about. But that's what's weird about Trump, not to make it political, but Trump is the opposite of that. He's the guy that has to push back, has to push harder, has to intimidate, has to react. He's the opposite of what you're describing. And that's why our country is so at dis-ease right now. That's what disease is, dis-ease. We are in a state of feeling like daddy's drunk and he's gonna hit us. And it's triggering all of the people whose daddy's had fucking PTSD. And it's like, that's what's happening. People are just getting fucking triggered, man, because it's like, it totally reminds you of a, maybe it reminds you of a little thing that you learn to live with. And then what happens is it's like people who have an abuser, you've, I'm sure you've heard this, right? Like you either like, resist the abuser or you become the abuser, you know? Like there you become a friend. So you start enabling the abuse, like the idea is like, because it's like for sure, if you're a kid and you're around alcoholism, for example, in a family, then you're taught to not see shit. You're embedded with blind spots, you know? Like your dad, he just sleepy right now. Or your dad's in a mood right now. He's in a little bit of a mood right now. Stay away from dad. He's like not feeling well right now. But you know what it is. He's hammered. There's fucking booze in his breath. He came in at fucking 2.30 AM after fucking somebody or whatever, you know? Like, you know, your mom's freaked out or she's got big fucking circles under her eye, you know? But that is like, you know, because it's easier for you to believe something that's obviously not real, than to realize your mom is lying to you, your dad's lying to you, than what you do. And you're not safe. And you're not safe. You really aren't safe. I remember my dad when I was about, probably about the same age that Mr. D picked up that kid at the YMCA. My dad drove home drunk as he did almost every night and he hit a tree, full speed. Died, you know, his jugular vein got severed. And my mom was driving behind him. It's like three o'clock in the morning. She's driving behind him from a restaurant. Jesus. In New York. And she drives, no cell phones back then. She drives, calls an ambulance. By the time they get there, he's got no vital signs. They bring him back to life. Spends like four days in the hospital. And the whole time my mother's just saying, oh yeah, dad's in the hospital. He had a little accident and everything's gonna be fine. And he comes back with black guys and stitches. And I just remember at the time, like not registering much, except like, we were watching a lot more TV. But then realizing like underneath, we were extremely stressed out. Yeah. That's right. That's it. Yeah, underneath. And it's like, you just subscribed to the lie. Yeah. And I'll tell you, man, if you really wanna put yourself into a lot of fucking danger in that kind of situation, tell the truth. Yeah. And get ready for some real fucking just horror to happen. You'll destroy your family. If you were to like say they're actually what's happening, you can't even say it because you're a kid. You got taught this was normal. It's normal. You're just being sensitive. Being sensitive. And that was the thing. And I don't know if that's as much a thing today as it was when I was a kid. But being sensitive, being a pussy was like the worst thing you could be. So I grew up trying to be so much tougher than I really am. I still am. I've still fallen to that trap. Yeah. I'm afraid of seeming like a pussy in any way. And you see it with a lot of guys. You know, there's a lot of guys, our peers that are tough guys. And you just think like, all right, what are you afraid of? What's going on? Yeah. Yeah, man. Well, you didn't, what happened was, so you're having an authentic reaction to being around a bunch of fucking drunk shitheads. Which is like, this sucks. You're probably crying. You're terrified. You don't know if you're gonna get fucking killed. You might get killed. People get killed all the time. Kids get killed by their drunk parents all the fucking time. So you're freaking the fuck out. And then you say it and you're like, come on, this is life. Get used to it. This is what life is like. Cause I'm telling you, man, if you wanna hear, like if you listen to a drunk's narrative of what life is like, it's not great. A drunk's not gonna tell a kid like, hey, you got a lot to look forward to out there. He's like, they're gonna try to fuck you over. They're gonna try to steal from you. Keep an eye on this and that because you're fucking gonna get fucked if you're not tough out there. Cause it's a fucking hard world. It's like, well, it's a hard world if you're a lying, alcoholic. Low self-esteem, paranoid. Yeah, you're drawing all those problems to yourself. Yeah. And then because you, you know, most alcoholics, when they've been, you know, saddled by that demon, they can't bear the fact that they're, they've become like mounted by evil. And so rather than believe that they're being ridden around the house by a fucking imp, they try to pretend that this is like who they are. And they try and say, they like can't deal with the fact that they don't have any real autonomy anymore. And so they try to rationalize it by painting a picture of a world where they're a victim and the world's out to get them. Right. You know, that's the craziest shit. Yeah, so. And that's contagious. Then the, yeah, the kid can't not pick up on that. You know, and I think about that stuff with my kid because I really do feel like I did everything I could to, like you talked about whether or not you become the, would you say the abuser? Yeah. You become the abuser. And for me, it was like not drinking was not so much that I was such a fucking disaster. I drank a lot. I got arrested a few times. I used to get into fights. I drove drunk. I got caught doing that. There was enough signs for me to go, you know, this is not a good thing in my life. Right. But I was not a guy who like lost a job and beat up a girlfriend or whatever. So the reason I stopped is because I want to stop the cycle. I didn't want to be like my dad and seem like a very lonely, isolated, scared person. And I didn't want that. And I didn't want my kids to get that. And so like as much as I could, I tried to stop the cycle. I don't hit them. My dad used to beat the shit out of me. I never hit my kids. And I really thought like I gotta stop this cycle. And I don't know though that one day my daughter is not gonna be on a shrink's couch going, you know, my father made me, you know, afraid of things. I don't know. I don't know what I'm still passing on. Well, that, well, Ramda says you're gonna pass on something. Yeah. Like the fantasy that you're gonna be able to like suddenly become like this perfect angelic parent and like not pass on the poison or the darkness. Yeah. That's like setting yourself to a ridiculous standard. Yeah. But just a simple act of being like, you know what? I'm not gonna be a drunk dad. Yeah. I'm not doing that. I'm not gonna be a drunk dad. That's what I've decided. I'm not doing it, man. Yeah. I don't want booze in the house. I don't want a drink. I don't want my kid to smell booze on my breath and have like a weird slur to the way I said. I don't want that, man. Like I don't want to pass that on. Just to me, I think that, you know, and like being honest, you know, but not like doing the like hyper intimate thing that some parents will do with their kids. What's that? So what'll happen is like a parent will make friends with their kid, which is, so like, which is okay. But I mean, a parent will like start opening up to their child about the intricacies of their divorce and the kids like eight years old. Right, right. So that'll start happen. That's a thing. That's another form of psychological abuse is the parent starts saddling the child with the adult responsibility of like their neurosis. So suddenly that's when the parent is like just vomiting darkness and like a nine year old kid is not the one to ask to help you with your marriage. And not you can, you know, or a 10 year old or 11 year old or 12 year old kids need to feel like they're in a stable environment where they can grow. And I think it's just as simple as that. Not like they don't need to, you don't, you shouldn't ask your kid. I don't think it's cool to ask your kid whether or not I think, you know, it's life is worth living. Yeah. You know, don't ask your kid that cause you're chronically fucking like, you know, depressed. It's like, ask your therapist that or your friend's that or read some Camus, but don't like blow that shit out on your kids if you can help it. And if you do, okay, you did it. But now stop doing it. Yeah, give them some order. Give them structure that they can live inside of. That's your job. Your job is to create a world that they can live in and that they have a right sized proportionate place in that world, not an outsized. Like that's another problem is it's in, they're making the child, they're giving them more credit. You're a fucking kid and you need your hand held. You need to be told not to do things. And I see that now, live it on the west side of LA. You really do see parents that just never tell their kids there's no boundaries. And they feel like they're so afraid, maybe because they got traumatized as kids and their reaction to that is to not give the kid any guidance whatsoever. And that's an even scarier place for a kid. A kid wants to be told what not to do. They want to be punished when something goes wrong. And when I say punished, consequences for actions. Validating that you have choices to make in life. That there's going to be rewards or there's going to be withholding of things you want from bad choices. Yeah. And without that, you're doing them a huge disservice in the world. The problem is, so like we get as human beings, unless you're super lucky statistically, there's odds are pretty good, you can get traumatized. Like you're going to get, especially like, I think now where people are getting more refined in their parenting skills and learning more and more, but the point is like, so you've been traumatized, right? And so you're like, okay, now I'm going to never, ever do anything bad again. Whether it's through parenting or whatever. And then you're still reacting to the trauma because now you're like trying to do the hyper opposite of the fucking thing. And you're losing all your natural instincts. Yes. Yeah. You've suffocated your whole emotional life and it's all in your head. You're all thinking what to do and what not to do. And then you're not connecting to people anymore because you're not really you and you're living outside of yourself. And yeah, that's where I've been at lately. I've been trying to break out of that place. You're up in your head. I'm in my head lately. Yeah, that's how we get depressed. It's like, if the longer up in your head is just like, yeah, there's your, why did I just read this, man? I was reading, God, someone like posted an article about a tribe, I think it's Christopher, I can't remember who it was. Someone posted an article about a tribe where they think there's three brains. And the brain in the head is considered to be like the tool that you only use once in a while. But the brain in your stomach is where you should refer to for every single thing you do. And they were saying, this is why everyone in the West is so fucking crazy, is they're using the wrong brain, which is the up in our heads. What's the third brain? Your heart, head, heart, stomach. Yeah, so you're like that. This is the whole Ram Dass thing is like from the head to the heart, like getting down in there and just like being in your heart and feeling and being in the moment. And when you go up in your head, learning about that, which is like, if you're up in your head, that means you're thinking, you're absorbed in your thoughts. And the idea is, oh yeah, well your brain produces thoughts in the way your tongue salivates. It's of no import. It's just those thoughts are just thoughts. It's just a kind of like psychic gas. It's just a gaseous quality where your brain is like emitting all these thoughts. Like you're about to go on the road, right? So you're doing that thing, which is this, for me, whenever that's happening, there is a feeling of like tension. I can feel this anxiety creeping in. I know what I've got to fucking do. And it's like, I want to put on a great show, I'm stuck in the future now. And my head is completely in the future, which is essentially like you're simulating a future. So when your mind is creating an idea of what's gonna happen, that's what's happening up in my head when I'm prognosticating some future thing, whether it's a show that night, work tomorrow, some confrontation that I know I've got to do pretty soon, whatever it may be, that's not real. It's a simulation. You've simulated a future that is not what, you don't know what's gonna happen. You have no idea. No matter how many times you've been through a similar experience, you're looking at statistics, you're not looking at the possibilities. Yeah, it's just, you just can't, yeah, you don't know. If you knew, you'd be fucking Nostradamus. You have no idea. So your brain, using an amalgamation of past experiences, has thrown together some simulated reality that you're now running over and over in your head, and through that constant repetitive, never ending running it over and over and getting caught in it. And then like, I don't know if you've ever done this, like you're about to meet somebody for drinks and on the way there, you're already having the conversation you think you're gonna have with them. You're like prepping for the conversation, you know? You're like imagining the first sentences you're gonna say and how the conversation like, go. You have an outline. It's not a script, but it's an outline. Yeah, yeah, you're working it out. And you can get in full in fights with people. You can get in full on like debates with people before you even get to wherever you're meeting them. And all that's just the mind. It's not real. It's a simulated reality that isn't based on anything other than some kind of chains of like neuro-transmitters in your brain that are doing their best to create an idea of what might happen to keep you safe. But all it's really doing is making this present moment right now suck. Yeah, it's like the same thing we're talking about trauma. Like trauma is this rotten event happened in the past and now we're still experiencing the... I was just gonna say, is this the same as thinking about the past? Thinking about the future and thinking about the past. It's the same thing. I mean, Eckhart Toll talks about that too. It's the same, it's anything that pulls you out of the moment because your recollections of the past. Well, even if it is trauma, your recollections of that trauma are not gonna be genuine, like you said. Mommy said, no, that's not that, it's this. But whatever she said it was still feels bad. The recollection is gonna make you feel guilty. It's gonna make you feel angry, whatever it is, as opposed to the moment where you can only feel... Like right now, I'm sitting in a room with you. A smart guy who I'm learning from. Every time I sit with you, I learn things, you expand my mind. We're in this cool house with these little fucking dogs. And it's like this replaces getting on a plane next week and sitting alone in a hotel room. I can choose one of those two things. Right, and one's real and one's not. Cause you're not on the plane. And then it's like, that thing is like, that's so this is like, be here now, let's get back in the moment. And it's like, you're always gonna drift from the moment into the future, into the past. Did I tell you that thing the last, like I heard this cool thing about the reason or one of the interpretations of the thieves being on either side of Jesus in the Bible? No. So like, yeah, cause like it's this idea and it's, you know, it's an interpretation. I don't think this is like a doctrine or something, but the crucifix represents a timeline. So you have the, you know, past, present, future. That's what his arms are nailed to. And then you have the infinite, which is the intersection that makes a human being, a human being, which is where this crazy combination of this infinite transcendent energy that's been nailed to time. And so on either side, you have these two thieves and the thieves represent the past and the future. Cause anytime you're like thinking about either of them, you're robbing yourself of the delicious joy of being fucking crucified. What are you more present that when you're nailed to a fucking cross? Yeah. Thieves on either side of you. I thought you meant, cause there was Barabbas and there was the other thief who were, who were strung up as well. Yeah. I don't think they were nailed to the cross. I think they were tied with ropes to the cross. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. They got, they got off easy, I guess, but like... Barabbas did. They got to pass. Yeah. Yeah. Barabbas. Yeah. Spare Barabbas. Yeah. Who do you want? Yeah. Yeah. We used to have to act that shit out cause growing up Catholic on a good Friday, you would go into the church and they would give you that whole script and we would have to act out the final scene where we would scream, give us Barabbas, give us Barabbas. Dude. And it was always my birthday cause my birthday is April 5th. I swear to God, it felt like every three or four years it landed on my, and I'm standing there on my birthday. I'm like nine years old going, crucify him! Crucify him! I just want to go home and get some cake, see if I got a bike. Dude, you know, not to like, you know, throw in something really weird. Like if you ever heard the idea, this is a really crazy idea. And it is a crazy idea. I don't subscribe to it, but I love crazy ideas to think about it. But so there's the thing Jesus said, which is that many of you will not die before like I come back in all my glory or whatever. Like he was saying that I'm going to return before some of you die, which was very confusing for a lot of the early disciples because they really did think like the end of the world was then and he was going to return in that moment. But so I think it was like Philip K. Dick or someone speculated that no, what's actually happening is that the crucifixion is so potent and so powerful, a moment that it's radiating eternally through time and that you are there right now. You were screaming out Barabbas. Like that was real, but you're sort of in this moment as a comedian, but it's really just the shockwaves of what happens when a God gets murdered. Wow. Yeah. Isn't that trippy? Wow. That's trauma. That's universal trauma. That's right. Timeless. Yeah, that's right. That's universal trauma. That's what that represents. And that we're all this final moment as the divine comes to like terms with this event that's happening, which is, the idea is we're all being crucified. We are sharing and I think in Christianity, the idea is that the church is non-different from the Christ, right? The church is the body of Christ. So a Christian is the body of Jesus and Jesus is being crucified and heartbroken and being ripped apart by this collision with matter. What is the idea like that a Christian should love, should become like Christ? Is that the idea? It should. Well, yeah, I was talking to my daughter about it the other night. She's 15, but ever since she was like seven or eight, she's been very, very entranced by the Catholic faith. We go to church, I take her to church sometimes. And I think part of it is she grew up with a lot of Mexican girls and they were, she would go to first communions and they had their crosses and she would talk to them about Jesus. I was talking to her about that moment when Jesus died and his final words were forgive them father for they know not what they do. So that's what you're supposed to do at that moment. You're supposed to understand that this is, almost goes back to what we were talking about before. Forgive them father, this is their echoes. These are their echoes they're playing out right now. This is their trauma. Yeah. Wow. Holy shit. And that's the apocalypse. Like that's what's actually happening is we're coming to a point where we have to figure out a way to forgive everybody. Yeah. We're fucked. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah, but at least we can meditate and feel good about ourselves. Right? Dude, I can definitely recommend forgiveness to anybody. I will say, man, definitely, if you want to feel better, just forgive. But when it comes to like when, you know what I mean? It's like, you can spout off of the mouth all you want about your little forgiveness is the guy pulled in front of me or the, you know, the girlfriend that cheated on you or the this or that, you know, those little things. But when the moment of truth comes, which it will come, where a thing happens to you that is unforgivable, the pull-up bar is right there in front of you, man. And it's like, okay, now do it. Yeah. Right. And that's why I think Jesus is such a perfect example. Because it's like, what the fuck did he do, man? He was going around healing lepers, walking on water, turning water into wine, doing these beautiful acts, telling people to love each other, saying you don't really need a priest class. You can connect with the divine right now. Yeah. What was he doing? Right. Nothing. Bad. You know? Well, he was trying to upset the status quo. Yeah. So, yeah, I think it's, yeah, did you read that book, Zealot? Yeah, I did. Yeah. And it was kind of about that. He was like, yeah, he was just this, and he wasn't the only guy doing it. That's what I liked about that book, is you saw that at that time, there was a bunch of guys like Jesus that were traveling around, they had a posse, you know, they had a Facebook page, and people were showing up to their gigs, and they were talking about groovy stuff. And Jesus was just the one that was like, I don't want to just minimize it by saying he was the best at it, but he was the one that was divine. He was the one that like, you know, took it to another level. Yeah, yeah. Well, the Reza Aslan, the book. Well, the thing I found really remarkable in that book, a few different things. It was a good book. I particularly enjoyed the description of the temple, what that was like. Yeah. You know, that was really cool. People lined up with their offerings. Yeah, that was really a beautiful description. And then I also found it interesting that he was saying in all, and like, there are historic accounts of Jesus, of Galilee. There are historic accounts, and they always refer to him as a magician. That's one of the, he was doing some kind of like, magical act in front of people. Yeah. He was doing, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, who opened for him? I don't know, you know. John the Baptist. John the Baptist. Hey man, thank you so much for coming on the show. Oh, my pleasure, dude. My pleasure. Really, really appreciate it. So great, so great hanging out. So you got a big tour coming up. We're gonna be able to see it. It's not a huge tour, but I got some dates coming up this fall.

But it's not really all good parenting advice. That's so cool, man. I love her, man. She's awesome. Is she great? Yeah, she's great. Hey, look, I mean, I don't mean to throw something out there. If you guys, I don't know, she probably wouldn't do it. But if you wanna put my wife on there, she's been doing nannying for eight years. Oh, really? And she's like a, she knows like, it's crazy. Like she has a just huge reservoir of data about how to do, I don't even know any of this stuff. Like there's special past fires we got up there now. And like she has opinions on, you know, she has like nanny opinions on strollers, you know? She's got like a whole, it's very interesting. But anyway, I don't know. It is, yeah.

You're listening to the Ducatrussell Family, our podcast. Thank you for tuning in. I had some kind of epiphany today, or was it yesterday? I can't really remember. I think I was just in one of those pandemic-style, claustrophobic moments, this kind of teetering at the edge of some confusing panic that doesn't make any sense, because it's not like I'm starving to death or anything. In fact, quite the opposite. I'm puffing up, because I've been shoving vodka and bread down my throat. Like I'm some kind of Russian farmer. But still, it happens. Maybe that's what makes it even that much more weird, is that all of a sudden I just feel this dark teetering sensation, a kind of flailing feeling. It reminds me of drowning a little bit. I don't know if any of you all out there have ever had any encounters with drowning or coming close to drowning. I've had a few. One of them when I was a little boy and my parents gave me those floaty things, which by the way, I'm finding out now, you're not supposed to really put that on your kid, because it teaches them that when they get in the water, they can swim when they can't. And so a kid who's gotten used to floaties will drown, because I'll just go fearlessly running into the pool or whatever, and they'll think that they're gonna float and they just sink right to the bottom of the fucking pool. Better to teach them how to swim than use some kind of artificial inflatable arm rafts, even though I think they're adorable. And when I was a kid, I kind of liked them, though I think I knew that my life depended on the floaties. And this kid just swam up. It's like he'd figured out something you could do with toddlers floating in the pool. This terroristic little bastard came swimming up to me and pulled the fucking, like the inflator out of my floaty. Just uncorked the thing, so I'm sitting there listening to the air hiss out of my floaty. He swam away. I mean, this is like probably by now, the kid's got a serial killer name and has probably murdered hundreds of people. It could have been, who the fuck knows it? It could have been the Green River Killer, for all I know, as a kid. But the point is, this son of a bitch deflated my damn floaties and I started sinking and my mom had to come in the pool and pull me out. I could have drowned. That could have been the end of it all, but thank God I survived. But I still remember that moment of panic, like that sense of just having no control over yourself as you sink into an area where you can't breathe anymore. Another time I had this experience was just when I was in Hawaii. I think I just swam out too far and got stuck in a, I don't know what you call, I don't think it was a riptide because I think a riptide actually pulls you out into the sea. Whereas this is just some kind of current, but I realized that I was essentially treading water, even though I was exerting all of my energy to try to swim towards the beach. And it went from being like, wow, this is kind of fascinating. I'm stuck in the water here. I can't seem to get back to the beach to like, I'm getting really fucking tired. My legs are cramping up to like, I think I'm gonna have to start waving for help cause I don't know if I can get back. And then of course that's the place where your ego starts saying like, really you're gonna be that guy? You're gonna be the 40 year old hairy dude with fucking love handles. It has to get pulled to shore by some like svelte fucking lifeguard who's for sure on the swim back, gonna shame your ass for getting into some kind of riptide, which he's gonna have a Hawaiian name for. And he's gonna tell you some obvious way to avoid it and you're gonna feel dumb. And then your girlfriend's gonna see you out there like trembling in fear and like scared and you're gonna have to be like, yeah, I'm just weak. I'm a weak, flabby thing. But then it went from that to like the beginning of panic. And somehow, obviously, I guess I swam back to the beach. Either that or I drowned and this whole thing is probably the last few moments of my life on the planet, regardless as far as my current reality goes, it seems like I was able to get back to the beach. And both of those experiences kind of remind me of this thing that has happened to me a few times during the pandemic, a sort of claustrophobic, suffocating sense of being trapped in a kind of very least and incredibly annoying part of fucking history. You know, this is just annoying to put it mildly, you know? And I don't mean to be like, oh my God, I'm being inconvenienced by global fucking pandemic because you get shamed for saying shit like that. But I don't know another word for it. It's fucking inconvenient, all right? And also, it's okay to not want things to be like this. You know, we don't have to be all like whatever, stoic or whatever about this shit. Or we don't have to be all like, you know, optimistic all the time about this shit. Let's face it, it sucks. It's annoying. I mean, it's weird and it's like dark and it feels like some like clowns pissed all over, wool blankets, put them in the refrigerator for a little bit and then wrapped you up and clown pissed soaked blankets. That's basically what the feeling was. And then this is when my big realization hit. I realized that the reason that I was feeling like this was because I have been gorging on the news, gorging myself on everything. I go for, I run the whole spectrum. First, I'll start at, what's her name, Maddow. And then, you know, I'll take in her and it's funny to me because she's like scolds the states. So she like has this hilarious and really like passive aggressive weird way. It reminds me like a mom who's at the end of a rope with her teenager, but she's like not, she's wanting to like guilt trip her or him into like being a better kid. It's like Maddow's doing that with whatever states have decided to open up sooner than they were fucking supposed to open up. And so she literally says things like, way to go, Georgia, way to go. She's so bizarre to hear someone scold a state. So I, and then what I'll do is I'll jump from Maddow, you know, to head over to CNN, you know, see whatever they're saying over there, which is, you know, definitely like every, you know, they're fucking pissed at Trump. And then I'll take a dive over to Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity, who are there fucking pissed at China. And they're like, the whole thing is, mind bogglingly confusing in the sense that you're seeing like data sets that maybe are identical, but are being interpreted in different ways, or you're seeing completely different data sets that seem to point to completely different possibilities. And I think the feeling that I've been getting could be compared to the time that I was stupid enough to get like mildly addicted to Taco Bell. I look back on that part of my life and I consider it to be darker than the times I've been addicted to painkillers. Like there was a pretty romantically wonderful self-destructive time. I would not recommend this to anybody. I got really lucky because I didn't get physically addicted and didn't have to go through the fucking living hell that many of my friends out there have gotten addicted and opioids have gone through and some of them are still in. I think I was teetering on the edge of it though, man, but like, yeah, I was like all brokenhearted, relationship had ended and I would drive around Echo Park and my mini Cooper listening to Elliot Smith eating fucking Vicodin. Ugh, God, I'll constipate it and shit and just imagining myself to be some kind of like, I don't know, romantic existential like archetype or something where really I wasn't able to take shit and I was really uncomfortable, imploded and pretty numb and also teetering on the edge of so kind of physical addiction to painkillers. That being said, that was way cooler than when I was going to Taco Bell like every other day, if not every day and getting this like quesadilla thing and eating it and like over time, I started to experience this cumulative effect from having in my diet Taco Bell on a daily basis. This was by the way, pretesticular cancer. I was also slurping back big massive gulps, whatever they're called. I don't know what the Taco Bell name for it is. Maybe we should look up a Taco Bell menu here. Let's see what they call their drinks. You know, some places name their drinks weird things like gulps or smashes or splatters or let's see the menu here. And of course back down, you know why I'm looking this up. I'm just curious to see if they have like special names for their drinks. No, they don't. Just fucking Pepsi, you know, unsweetened tea. That's a let down. I was hoping they were calling them like slammers but regardless, I was like eating this shit and like, you know, experiencing all the physical symptoms of that, I was starting to smell really bad. Like, not that I smell great anyway, you know, especially these days, I do seem to have a very special stink hanging on me, but back then, man, I was really, really like, I just remember it was like a novel stink, like a new smell that was starting to ooze out of me, which was just my body trying to like eject as much of the Taco Bell quesadilla weird chips that I would get with a cheese out of me. And so I started to smell really, really like industrial, I guess is the only way to put it. Like, probably if like the way like a mutant would smell, just a stink to me, like, you know, like the usual places that stink had a new stink to them. Didn't smell good. Of course, my breath didn't smell great. I attribute this time period also to when like, I got my bald spot too. I mean, I'm not blaming Taco Bell for it. I'm blaming myself. But regardless, I think that if you're experiencing anything similar to that weird, dark, claustrophobic, kind of like freak out that I've been coming in contact with, then it might be that that is the psychic equivalent of the heartburn gastric situation caused by eating too much fucking Taco Bell. Because the news, and listen, I'm not trying to be about Alex Jones here. I think the news does quite often cite data that is verifiably true. It's just the way that they're citing the data has whatever their particular political angle is and they editorialize. And because they're saying something true, but from an editorial tone, then you can slowly start getting warped into whatever the particular version of the zeitgeist is that they want to illuminate. And so this long-term, the long-term effect of this shit right now, I think in particular is that you begin to get freaked the fuck out. I know I'm not like announcing some equals MC squared thing here. My realizations are not that exciting these days, you know? But I did, suddenly I realized like, ah, fuck, you've just been on the news every day all day long. Like when I take breaks from working on the podcast, I go and I'll just turn on the news. Or at the end of the day, I'll turn on the news. Or even in the morning sometimes when I wake up and don't want to get out of bed, I'll pull up the fucking news. And then really late at night, if I wake up in the middle of the night, one thing I've been doing is just diving into retic conspiracy. No offense to my friends over there. But Jesus Christ, this isn't exactly what you would call ingredients in a healthy mental salad, you know? And so I'm not trying to be correct if you're man, if you're getting off on the news, I get it. It's in a fetishistic way. If you feel like just like raking your claws against the trembling back of your poor, psyche, go ahead and do it. I understand, but I will tell you this. I have not seen anything on the news that is actionable. You know, there isn't really anything new there that they're saying. There's no reports I can find in there that are giving me any kind of marching orders or anything more than a general sense of low level despair related to this particular time in history that we find ourselves. So I'm trying to wrench my brain away from the news. And I don't know if this is spiritual bypass or not, but I'm right now kicking around the idea that, well, maybe I can watch the news, but I just have to look at it as what it is, which is a kind of soap opera slash, you know, professional wrestling thing, where these like very charismatic people spew out some kind of infotainment that the worst mistake you can make is to imagine that what they're saying has any kind of real value when it comes to your day to day existence. Unless they're telling you that like lizards have climbed out of cracks in the earth and are galloping towards your particular part of the planet, I don't think they've got much to offer us other than their own weird snarky fucked up, you know, on stage persona, which is deeply entertaining. And on one level, incredibly hilarious. And it gets even funnier when you realize that they expect you to take them seriously. That's the part that is really, really hilarious to me is like they have to work themselves up. They're doing some kind of hardcore method acting. They've got to be fucking pissed off to really deliver the kind of like news that people have gotten hooked on, you know? Like you can't have Sean Hannity all happy and you know, you can't have them come out and feel relaxed, you can't have Rachel Maddow, not like, you know, deeply insulted by the president. Like they've got to be really upset. And then it conveys to you that if you're not feeling upset or angry or freaked out, maybe something's wrong with you, man. And then that I think is where they inject the poison into you. And I'm not saying they're nefarious people necessarily, it's just what they do, it's their job. I mean, what? You're going to get mad at like Alfred Hitchcock presents every time he comes out. He's got to be kind of like dark and somber and silly or the way Alfred Hitchcock was. God, that's an old reference. What are you going to be mad at, a black mirror? There, see, I'm okay, kids. I watch somewhat modern things. You know, are you going to be mad at the host of the fucking Twilight Zone? Srod Sterling, because every, like he seems like he's like, you know, been like snorting fucking rails of ketamine for the last few months before he does is Twilight Zone narratives, it's their job. You know, that's what they're supposed to be. And these fucking pundits are essentially like Rod Sterling slash Alfred Hitchcock, like announcers who are presenting to you data sets that have been warped according whatever the particular agenda of their network and their networks perceived desire of its audience because they're selling fucking cars. We can't forget that. You can never forget that when you're watching the news that they're selling cars.

Friends, I truly hope it doesn't seem like I'm telling you the news isn't real. I hope it doesn't seem like I'm taking the hacky cliche angle that whatever you see that's being broadcast by the mainstream media is a false application of reality. I think the problem is a lot of it is real but some of it isn't. That's not the news is fault. They take on the role of some kind of weird, ancient gatekeeper kind of thing that you can ask it questions but you know it's gonna tell you the lie and the truth simultaneously and then it's up to you to discern which is which and that is exhausting work. When I go to Taco Bell, I'm excited because it means that I don't have to wait for that sweet quesadilla. I don't have to wait for the queso and the chips. I'm not gonna have to make it. It just they dish it out to me but also I know that there's some kind of price for that instantaneous fulfillment that comes from it which is gonna look like horrific bowel movements, weight gain, puffiness, exhaustion, bad dreams and a thousand other fucked up results. Similarly, if you wanna go anywhere where you're getting the answers to your questions fed to you by somebody who already did all the work, who already did all the research, who already looked at the facts or teams of people looked at the facts and then decided that they were gonna weave the facts together in a way that was their articulation of the truth. You can probably expect some part of you, the part of you that's rational, the part of you that understands the little too easy to have somebody in a suit and a costume spraying what they think the truth is into your ears because you haven't done any work. I mean, you sat down and turned on the news and then if the idea is, this is something when I was at a Ram Dass retreat, I'll never forget Roshi Joan Halifax who was this incredible teacher, a Zen Roshi who was doing this amazing lecture on the Zen Kowan, which is this infuriating method of inducing insecurity in people, putting you into a state of not knowing. The idea being all your knowingness is what's fucking you up. This is not to say that there's something wrong with the truth or that the truth is something that is fucking you up, but it's just this thing where you think you know the answer. It's a mess. Anytime I get into that situation where I really feel like an expert and then you see somebody trying to do something that you've done a million times and then you might, I've noticed that all of a sudden, I realized that in my quote teaching or whatever, because I think I know how to do a thing, I'm inhibiting their actual confrontation with a learning curve and that it's like letting them kind of figure out the pathway to truth on their own is way more beneficial than to show them how I have done things. You know, I'm a new dad, so like that's the thing I have to deal with every single day. It's like finding that weird place between letting your kid flail and like not letting them flail too much or they'll hurt themselves. So this is all I'm saying is there's something to be said for getting in there doing your own research a little bit about this stuff. Whatever it is, I'm not just talking about the pandemic. Let me give you an example. I was titillated by the recent news of a 6.5 earthquake, 6.3 earthquake, I'm not sure which, I think they upgraded it to a 6.5. The news story was that this earthquake was happening in area 51. And had I not looked up where area 51 actually is versus where this earthquake happened, then when I would have thought for the rest of my life that an earthquake happened in area 51 and I would have naturally assumed that they were testing some kind of weird, new destructive technology out there. When in fact, the earthquake didn't happen in area 51, it didn't even happen in the Air Force testing base. Now some people say, well, yeah, it's an underground base. It's underground nuclear explosions. Underneath area 51 is a massive underground bunker. I don't know. All I'm saying is, for those of you who've been saying the earthquakes originated in area 51, and I don't blame you, it's an exciting idea that some scientists were fucking around with some UFO technology and screwed up and created some micro wormhole or something like that. But the sad truth is that earthquake happened on a fault line. And so it's probably just a goddamn earthquake. It wasn't somebody touching the wrong wires together. It wasn't an alien barfing some kind of new form of plasma into our biome that caused like a higher density. I don't even know, I'm trying to make up a scientific explanation for, it's just an earthquake. But I wouldn't have known that if I didn't do the research. I think things might be a little more boring than we're comfortable with, unfortunately. The stuff isn't quite as bad as some people are making it out to be. And this stuff isn't quite as good as some people are making it out to be. That it's just somewhere in the middle, kind of boring, not that exciting, other than the fact that we are made of matter and DNA, which is pretty miraculous. But if that's what you're made of from the moment you open your eyes, it's a little on the boring side, isn't it? Well, anyway, maybe this rant is getting a little boring too. My point is I'm gonna do every single thing I can to pull the rusting needle that is the news from my information vein. And if I do find something disturbing on the news or if they say something that seems too good to be true or more fucked up than could be imagined, I'm gonna research it and just make sure it's real. See how they interpreted it. And then, you know, form my own conclusions. And I'm sorry if this is some shit you might read on the side of a cereal box, but I'm naturally lazy. I like Taco Bell. I just don't like the way it makes me stink. And similarly, this psychic contagion that seems to be happening based on whatever way you're getting your information. I think, you know, I'm definitely not gonna be coming up with a vaccine for COVID-19, but I think that I could do something about the fear infection that seems to be directly related to not creating enough distance between me and the motherfucking news.

If you happen to live in a place where you're being told you have to wear the damn things. By the way, man, listen, one of the most liberating experiences of my life was walking through an airport wearing a bandana Johnny Pemberton had given me and like there were free sneezers all over the fucking place and knowing that I was at least somewhat protected from the sick droplets of the free sneezers that used to plague our society prior to this pandemic. I don't know if you remember, but there were people in public, they would just fucking sneeze. They would just sneeze. You know, we have cultural standards when it comes to farting, shitting yourself, pissing all over the place or vomiting in public for whatever reason, it was still okay to sneeze. And if there is some silver lining in this rotten pandemic, may it be that free sneezers feel shame anytime they blow out their vile, viral poison into the world. Regardless, if you wanna find some really cool masks, you'll find them at the shop located at dunkintrustle.com. One of the many cool things about being a human being in this dimension is that you never know when you're gonna make a lifelong friend. And years and years and years ago, when I used to feature for Joe Rogan, I would also, as part of getting to open up for him, get to get like Illuminati seats at the UFC, like insane seats at the UFC that nobody deserves. And during this time, I became friends with a lot of different people who are part of the UFC family and of all of them, the one that I continue to speak to to this day is today's guest. He's an actor, he is a inspirational slash motivational speaker. He's worked with some of the great world leaders, athletes and celebrities from Princess Diana to George St. Pierre. I honestly think that he might be the leader of the Illuminati, I'm not even joking. It doesn't matter if he has cerebral palsy, you don't notice it after two minutes hanging out with him only because he is such a powerful being. All the links you need to find them are gonna be at dunkintrustle.com and now everyone please open your hearts, your souls and send that cosmic astral light blasting through the ether sphere to come gushing down on top of today's Nobel guest. Welcome to the DTFH Spencer Miller. No. All right, we're rolling. Spencer, welcome to the DTFH. My friend, Spencer. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Well, pleasure. Do you think we could start off with you telling everybody how we met? Yes. We met at a UFC. Don't ask me what number it was because it was a long time ago, about 10 years ago almost, I would say. But I went to a lot of UFC's because of my relationship with Frank and Lorenzo Ferdida, who owned the UFC at that time, along with Dana White and stuff like that. And for all of the fights, I sat right next to Joe Silva, who was the matchmaker, who also sits directly beside your good buddy and my buddy Joe Rogan. And the former voice of the UFC at the time, Mike Goldberg. Yeah. Because of my manual wheelchair, and because we were cage side, I needed to be one of the first to show up every time so that they could set up the cameras and the lights around me and everything like that. So once I was in my spot, I couldn't really move for like seven hours. So I was there and that's where I was. And yeah. So then when the main card started of this given UFC that I can't remember which one it was, this guy come walking over and sits with me, a guy named Frosty Rogan. And we're all just sitting there chatting and it's you. And that's how we met. And within the first five minutes, we were busting each other's chops. Yeah. As we did today. Or I should say, I should clarify, I was busting your chops. I think that's way more accurate. Correct. And that's- I saw you just, suddenly I looked over, you just started attacking you, but you looked over me and just started attacking me. Well, look at you. I mean- Beautiful. That's what you're saying. You're saying, listen man, I feel really, I feel insecure to be around such a symmetrically beautiful human with a deep, powerful voice. I think at first you were wondering if I was a fighter. I believe that was the first thing you said to me, is are you like an unannounced fighter? Either that or a ripoff version of Bob Bila. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Horrible. Why am I having you on this show? What are you doing? Because you needed to class it up for once. Yeah, you're right. So, yeah, we just became friends in the UFC. How did you end up meeting those guys? Like how did you become friends with the owners of the UFC? So, in late 2009, beginning of 2010, I knew Tom Wright, who was the incoming president of UFC Canada. And I went to his Welcome Introductory Press Conference, which was held here in Toronto. And Lorenzo was there and Dana was there, and we just all started talking. And one thing led to another. And bang, like I do with everybody, I'm an intoxicating encapsulating figure, if you will. And one thing led to another, and we became fast friends. And that maintained all the way through. And I also have done some work with one of the greatest fighters of all time, George St. Pierre, who is a fellow Canadian as well. So I've done a lot of motivational work with him, preparing him for some fights and different things like that. And then it also branched off to other fighters as well throughout the years. And so that's how that started. Do you think of yourself as a motivational speaker? Like, if you had to write that on a description, would you write that down? I think of myself as a jack of all trades, or jogging. But I'm a motivational speaker and an actor and just somebody who wants to make an impact and make a difference in people's lives. And that's always been my motivation and inspiration to do the best that I can with whatever it is that I'm given in front of me. What is a motivational session with one of the great fighters of all time look like? Like, what kind of stuff would you say to him? A lot better than a motivational session with you, I can tell you that. What the fuck, man? Yes. What kind of motivational speaker are you? Right now you seem like a demotivational speaker. Correct. It really just depends on the mood of the fight or what is writing on the fight with somebody like a George St. Pierre because he was always either in the title picture or defending his title, which he did a long time. You just gotta get in that championship mindset. Yeah. But every fight took on a different attitude. For instance, UFC 124 in Montreal was one of the most hostile crowds that I have ever been in front of because it is coming off of a season that George coached of the Ultimate Fighter reality series at the time with his opponent, Josh Koshchak and the amount of trash shock that came out of Josh Koshchak leading up to that fight, the hometown crowd in Montreal wanted to legit kill him. And I wanted to legit kill him on behalf of George too. So, you know, going into a fight like that, you need to sort of calm yourself down and refocus on what you're actually there to do as opposed to getting caught up in the emotion of it all. Yeah. How much does that trash talk and get to a fighter? So that it actually eats people up a little bit, huh? That's a legitimate tactic if you're preparing for a fight. Certain people, yes. It never affected, well, I shouldn't say it never affected George, but it never affected George deeply. George had an innate ability to take the trash talk and legitimately utilize it towards the fight. He took his fighting ability and the fact that he was always adapting and always enhancing his training to stay on top and put that into once he steps foot in front of the cage, all his trash talk come through in his kicks and his punches as opposed to verbally pour the fight. Right. Yeah. It seems like there's almost like two schools of thought when it comes to trash talk, you see certain fighters who just remind me of, you know, these are like people who've won the Olympics and there isn't really any much emotion that they, they're not emoting a lot. They just are pure professionals. They're really, they're not putting on a show like, like, you know, WW, worldwide wrestling or whatever. You call it, you know, they're not like doing that. They're just fighting. It's like watching shot put or something. There's almost a sterility to it. It seems that's weird. Whereas you get people, you know, the other school of thought is I'm also an entertainer. I'm a performer. I'm going to try to sell tickets to this thing. And to do that, I feel like I need to create a real feud with my opponent because it's going to make the fight that much more exciting. Yeah. And the two greatest examples to me of, of that end of the equation are Chale Sonnen. When he was going up against Anderson Silva, it was some unbelievable trash talk and helped sell the fight, even though Anderson was still at the top of his game at the time. And then in recent years, nobody has done it better than Connor McGregor. Yeah. That guy is the quintessential showman and ability to sell, you know, water to whoever. Fish, water to water molecules. But he's also, but he seems authentically deranged. Like, you know, this isn't method acting. He's like throwing chairs at buses and shit. The guy is like legitimately scared, right? Or not. You know, you know, here's the thing. Success does a lot to people and has different sides of the coin for everybody. You know, going back to George St. Pierre for a second, he had unbelievable success for the vast majority of his career and still maintained being that level headed guy that was still the same guy. Whereas you have the showman in Connor McGregor who came from a Poverished situation in Ireland got all this success, realizing he needed to build a character around it was very successful in building a character around it. But in doing so, I believe his character has now taken over his fighting ability. Yeah. Yes, he will still draw, but he cares about the show more than the actual fight. Right. I mean, this to me, you just summed up one of the great sand traps that any performer can find themselves stuck in, whether it's comedy, music, I don't care what it is, that you'll find yourself falling into the role of this character that you're putting out into the world. And some people get stuck in that role forever. They can't, you know, they're afraid to experiment with a new style, a new way of being. And it doesn't just apply to art either, right? I mean, we're talking a person's life. In your own life, you could start playing a character and not even realize that's what you're doing. You just think it's who you are. And then you're afraid to change because of that. You and I, we have the good fortune of doing what we do and being in entertainment and doing the things that we do. But what comes with that is, at least for me, it's hard to be able to just be spence, if that makes any sense. Yeah. You know, I can be myself with you, for instance, because we've been friends for a long time and you get it and I get it and whatever. And there's a handful of other people that I can do that with. But the vast majority of the time when I go out, whether it's to a restaurant, to the grocery store, whatever the case may be, people are expecting, you know, spence the guy on TV or spence the motivational speaker. And I get that and I appreciate that. That comes with the territory that I chose to take on when getting into this business in the first place. But you definitely see the fact that you need to be on more than you don't a lot of the time. Yeah, it's just, I mean, I think there's different types of people who end up in our line of work. I wouldn't consider myself a motivational speaker though, but I think that like in your line of work, there all of a sudden there seems to be like this added pressure when it comes to putting on this benevolent positivity, this kind of whatever the particular thing that you're teaching people, you know, because a motivational speaker, it's not like you're really, it's more than that. It's, you know, how would you define what you do? It's just one part of who I am. Yeah. But it never stays the same because my clients aren't all defined in the same box. If I was doing a motivational speech for Duncan, before Duncan goes out there to do a half hour set of a special or whatever, I would be approaching that vastly different than if I was meeting up with Mike Trout of the Los Angeles Angels before a big baseball game type thing. It just depends on who it is. You have to curtail it for your given audience. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by the Boner Alchemist over at bluechew.com. I don't know what this thing is. If you got a podcast and you dare advertise boner pills, for whatever reason it validates what people are saying to me, that is some of the most insane, fascist nonsense. I love science and I love the fact that I have access to a beautiful technology. And yeah, I call boner pills technology like blue chew, something that I could just put in my mouth and chew up and have a very, very fast response to it. Meaning that my 46 year old ass doesn't have to deal with some of the realities of being a hairy one bald anxiety ridden erotic in the midst of a global pandemic. I like the way it feels to know I have power over my boners. I love blue chew and I don't care who it was. It wouldn't phase me if Abraham Lincoln took boner pills. I would still love the great work he did as an American president or John Lennon. If we found out he was slurping back boner pills, it's not gonna change anything he did. And you know, some people they feel a little nervous. They feel embarrassed about going to the pharmacy and picking up boner pills. I don't know why. Or they feel they want anonymous packages sent to their mail that have these wonderful supplements within them. Well, you're gonna get that from blue chew. I would wear a t-shirt that says I take boner pills. Cause it doesn't, I'm not there. I can't help it. There's gravity and circulation and whatever the, my nightmarish memories are all sort of combining to make it so that I can't have a powerful boner whenever I want it. That's not, what am I gonna do? Go back in time and been a time machine? No, I'm gonna chomp blue chew and reap the wonderful awards rewards, both that come from this incredible technology. And let me reiterate, I mean technology. Like if someone said to me, Duncan, would you rather walk on the moon? Would you, you could use my spaceship and I'm gonna take you to the moon and we're gonna spend an afternoon on the moon. Or would you rather have the ability to give yourself powerful boners? I'm picking the boners, blue chew. It's prescribed online by licensed physicians. So you don't have to go to the doctor's office and it brings you the first chewable, the same FDA approved active ingredients as Viagra and see Alice. Again, that's B-L-U-E chew.com.

You just pay $5 shipping. Now back to the podcast. Do you have a nucleus or like a kind of touchstone idea that informs your method of coaching people or working with people? At the end of the day, like my whole thing is, you know, I like to inject humor and make it light and make it fun. Well, at the same time, hammering home those principle points, whatever they happen to need to be with that client at that time, while also intertwining some of my own story of overcoming obstacles and overcoming the fact that I've been in a wheelchair my whole life or that type of thing, you know? Let's jump into that part because I think that, you know, this, I'll tell you, my encounter with you has really been transformative in the sense that it's forced me to look at my preconceived notions about people who are in wheelchairs. And for example, you know, I think I told you about this. This is something one of my teachers, Ramdas, taught me, which is I went to one of these retreats with him and this is a person who's had a stroke. He's in a wheelchair. He, you know, he's an elderly person and he's somebody who, you know, you look at pictures of him when he was younger and he's got this like, almost Jesus quality. And suddenly here's a body in a wheelchair and I remember I was looking at him and I didn't even realize I was doing it, but he looked at me and he said, but he said it kind of to the whole group of people. It was a small group, but he's like, don't look at me like you feel sorry for me. Don't, you're putting all of your own stuff on top of me. I'm doing fine, but this is not my body is what he said. You're looking at me like this is all that I am is this thing that's in a wheelchair, this body in a wheelchair. And don't look at the thing that you're in either. It's just a temporary vehicle that you're in. But I wonder if you could talk about that a little bit. Do you get, did I do that to you initially? Do you get people looking at you in an uncomfortable way or do you have to, do you find yourself having to like cross people's expectations in some way? At least once a week still to this day in 2020, I get people, whether it's on the sidewalk or in a grocery store or in the pharmacy or wherever the, once a week, once every couple of weeks, I get people who come up to me still and they're like, hi, how are you? Can I get that for you? And start talking to me really slow and like I'm five years old and I want them. And I'm like, come on, take five seconds to talk to me, realize what this scenario is and then judge how to approach the situation. Don't go into it blind and automatically think that I'm an absolute idiot. And I have to deal with that a lot. You know, but I laugh it off at this point and to be perfectly honest with you, if it happens to be an extremely attractive woman who does it to me, my response is always the same. My response is, I'm fine, thank you very much. Would you mind leaning down a little further so I can look directly down your shirt? Good God. Hey, but do you get, let me, this, okay. When I, okay, when I get testicular cancer and I got one of my balls snipped off, and then, you know, obviously there's no real, it's vaguely related to the experience of being, it's not even related to the challenges you've dealt with physically in your whole life. But just as like someone who's like privileged with, you know, not being in a wheelchair, I guess you could say, I was born in a body where my legs and my, I can walk around. So suddenly that was yanked out from under me. And not just that, but the- Literally yanked, by the way, quite literally yanked. Quite, yeah, I hopefully gently pulled out of the cut they made in my abdomen that they pulled my decaying testicle out of. I would have, I hope he didn't yank it, but I don't know, I was completely out. But suddenly, like I've, man, I like, you know, up until that point, I'd had injuries and stuff, but usually there were injuries you could sort of push through. You know, there's, you could exert yourself a little bit and push through. But I remember suddenly realizing like, I've got to be able to park in fucking handicap spots because I can't walk. Like, and it's hard for me to get out of my car, like pulling out of the car. At one point I was realizing like, I don't think I'm going to be able to get out of the car. Cause if my legs weren't working right, my body was in so much pain, it wasn't working right, man. And like, that was a big moment for me. But I'm going to be honest with you, man. I didn't, when, like I realized there was someone parking in the, cause I had like a temporary handicap thing. And when I realized there was someone parking in the handicap spot, there was a handicap. And then because of that, I was literally probably not going to be able to go and get food. Cause I didn't know if I could walk that far. Cause I was, I remember feeling rage, like, furious rage. And so I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that. Did you, you said these days I laugh at it, but was there a time when you felt bitter or angry or like? If I'm sorry to cut you off. No, please, thank you. If I'm being completely honest with you, you know, it just, it is my life and did I get frustrated? Absolutely. I did at certain points when I was younger and different things like that. But it goes back to that Kelly Clarkson song, what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. But to be honest with you, you were talking about rage earlier and the fact that you felt rage sometimes in those situations, two things. Number one, that is one of my biggest pet peeves still to this day is if I go to the airport or, or, you know, to the train station or whatever they get. And I see people parked in the handicapped spot that clearly don't need to use it. I literally put my head out the window and I'm like, hey, motherfucker, you know, I'm actually handicapped. I have a legit chair in the back. I need it because of XYZ and F and you're just parking there for convenience and because you want to be lazy. So, so that still is one of my pet peeves today. With regards to rage, and I've never talked to you about this until right now, with regards to rage, about, about 16, 17 years ago, I went to bed one night and woke up the next morning. And ever since then, I have been allergic, slash intolerant to like 98% of foods and drink. And since then, I've seen, you know, numerous naturopaths, numerous gastroenterologists, people that are supposedly at the top of their given fields. And I've had everyoscopy you could think of, everything stuck everywhere that it needs stuck to try and figure it out and nobody can figure it out. And as awesome as I am, I still believe that I don't defy medical logic. And yet here I am a decade and a half plus later and I'm still dealing with that every day. So to be honest with you, the fact that I'm in my wheelchair is minuscule because I think about that for 0.2 seconds of any given day because it is my life and you know, I do very well for myself, but the most quote unquote handicapping thing for me has been the fact that I haven't been able to quote unquote, live my normal life for a decade and a half because of whatever reason. And to put it in even more perspective for the people watching slash listening to this, and again, you didn't know this and not a lot of people at the UFC knew this until right now, but anytime that I would travel to Vegas, Houston, anywhere in the world where we were doing a big fight, I legitimately had to go two and a half days or three days sometimes without eating. What? What? And just drinking water and stuff like that. So nobody knew that, but I had to train my body to do that because in the States, they do things different from state to state as far as food prep and things like that. And I didn't want to worry about cross contamination or have to worry about an unnecessary flare up during a fight when I am supposed to be there doing what I'm doing. So I legit had to go two and a half, three days without eating and just relying on ginger ale of all things. And water. So that was very difficult for me, but... I think that's a testament to how much you love the UFC. I mean, you're like a real sports fan. Mike, you are deeply, not just that. I mean, you're like in that community. Correct. Correct. I have a huge love for anything that it is that I do and anybody that I work with, you know, whether it's the UFC and the wonderful opportunities that they gave me or working with George St. Pierre and those opportunities. George jokingly calls me the Terminator because all the stuff that I have to deal with. Or, you know, you and I talk about this as well from the acting perspective side of things. You know, Kiefer Sutherland has been great to me when I worked with him on the show Designated Survivor because I would have to show up on set and go 17 hours again with no eating and things like that and trying to remember your dialogue at the end of a 17 hour day without food and stuff like that is remarkably difficult. Yeah. Wow, man. Well, I think this is what puts you in the perfect position to do what you do. Because, you know, I think one of the things that, you know, every single person in their life encounters is a place where it feels like what you want is impossible to achieve. That there is no way to get it. What you're, you know, whatever the reason may be. I've certainly been there before where I've thought, you know, that, you know, I had this sense like, oh, man, I really want to, I want to do comedy. I want to be a comedian. But I was bombing hard over and over and over and over and I just started getting this feeling of like, I'll never get the amount of stage time I would need to get good at this at all. I might not be equipped to do it, you know, I might, and somewhere in there, you know, I made it work. But it was fucking hard, man. But I think you can really speak to how, I mean, really, you are giving people an example that anything's possible. Like you're working with Kiefer Sutherland, you know, you're working with one of the great fighters on earth. And also you have, is it, I don't know what the, what, what there, this is something I keep hesitating. I feel embarrassed. Can I, what, what, what, what do I say? Do I say you are handicapped? Do I, what is the word for it? I have cerebral palsy. That's the disability that I have. And every disability has different similarities. I'm lucky that on the scale of two and a half, do I need help with certain things throughout the course of the day? Yes, but everybody does. And, and so yeah. And, and the thing about this, and you and I didn't talk about this prior to coming on here, is I don't talk about this stuff ever. Okay. So the fact that I'm talking about it with you, speaks to my respect for you and my respect that I have for our friendship, because I've always thought, you know, it's nobody's business really. And, and, you know, I just go about my business and do my job. And only a few people know about it, like GSP, like, you know, my best friend who travels with me through a lot of my major things. His name is Sean. You met him at a couple of flights as well. He knew about it, obviously, because he knew how much the difficulty I had to go through with not eating and whatever for that length of time. But up until now, the masses never really knew that that's what I deal with all the time. Well, we don't have to put it in the show. I appreciate you opening up about it, but if you feel like it's something you want to leave out, no problem, we'll cut it. No, we're not going to cut it. We're going to keep it because it's informative for people and it opens people's eyes up. And, you know, because I always get people asking me why I never eat at restaurants. And so now anybody that watches this or listens to this will know that. And so if they see me not eating, it's because I don't want to take a chance when I'm out because of cross-contamination and stuff like that. Wow. Yeah, man, that is so heavy. You know, my son has a peanut allergy that we're just starting to learn about right now. And it's, man, it is terrifying because we have to keep an epi-pin around all the time. And like, you know, it's so scary because all it takes is one, we're still, you know, because of the damn pandemic, we've been talking to an allergist on the phone and stuff, but we still aren't really certain exactly what the thing is he's allergic to. So, and it's scary because just all of a sudden, you know, he'll get like a rash and he'll start coughing. It is, and like, you know, at some point we might have to like plunge a needle into his arm. Are you having to do that like with an epi-pin? No, thank goodness. But, you know, for me, what sucks the most is this didn't happen to me when I was a kid. So I had the wonderful ability to eat and or drink whatever I wanted. And then it was literally yanked out from under me for no apparent reason. So all my stuff that I enjoyed doing before, whether it's, you know, going through an event that I spoke at or whatever the case and having the occasional glass of wine or, you know, a nice beer or scotch or what, you know, I was never a heavy drinker to begin with, but having a social drink in our business is somewhat mandatory in some circumstances. So to be able to do that, that was great. Some of the food that are at some of these things, as you know, are our common old common and then to have it yanked out from under me, it was a real, you know, pardon the pun, but it was a real handicapping feeling. Yeah, man. Yeah, I get it. It's, I mean, that's such a huge part of just being, life is being able to like go out and eat. It's, you know, it's a ritual. It's a friendship ritual. But listen, I feel like I want to get in, like if you're giving an address to people, what are you telling us? I want to get into like what your teaching is in particular, because I've known you as the guy who roasts me mercilessly at the UFC's, not as the motivational speaker. I've known you as the person who when we're FaceTiming during the UFC, you're taking shots at me with my wife right there, embarrassing me. So I want to talk about the motivational side. Give me some of what you give people when you're on stage giving a presentation. Right, before we do that, you know, because we're talking about in-depth stuff right now, before we transition into my motivational message, one thing that I wanted to clear up and talk about just for a moment or two is a giant misconception that pisses me the fuck off every single day of my life. Okay, and that is that people, a lot of people over the years have come to their own conclusion that because I'm in a wheelchair, I cannot date, you know, period, slash, quote unquote, able-bodied individuals and- Hey, you're not going to sleep with my wife. If that's what you're getting at, it's not going to happen. You know, I wouldn't want to do that to Erin because she would never want to go back to the miners after going to the miners. But, you know, it is unbelievable to me the amount of preconceived notion that we'll still have today, you know, just because I'm in a wheelchair doesn't mean shit. Like, if I'm attracted to somebody and whatever, that's fine. You know, one of the biggest pet peeves that I get is I consider myself to be an open book so you can ask me any question that you want, put it out there right at the beginning just so that we can clear it up and it's all out there and you understand what's going on. So a lot of the time in a dating situation, you know, I can see in their face the wheels turning and them saying to themselves, how am I going to ask him if he can have sex or if he can have some what? So then I make a joke of it and I'm like, oh yeah, everything works fine, blah, blah. Just don't ask me to run around the bed at any point, whatever. And after that, a lot of them look at me with that, like sideways, you know, dog from up, look on their face like he told me what I need to expect, but is it bullshit? Right. Why would I lie about my own capabilities, especially in that area? Right. It would just be an insult to me and you. Right. Like, so the fact that I've had to deal with that, my whole life is just ridiculous. And it's also ridiculous because people look at me in a negative light because I don't want to date another person in a wheelchair. Because I've had people ask me, do I want to date somebody who is also in a wheelchair? And my answer is always no. And they look at me like I'm the worst person in the world. And what I have to say in response to that is, it's all about preference. Some people don't like dating black people. Some people don't like dating Indian people. Whatever the case may be, it's the same thing for me, just in the case of another wheelchair-bound individual because of logistics and because, you know, thinking about two-handed cat people trying to have sex, it'd be like two piranhas flailing on the ground. It wouldn't be a good situation. Two piranhas flailing on the ground. There's gotta be a better analogy. Two piranhas flailing on the ground. That's not what I was thinking of. He's maybe like more like some kind of like car fender bender. I don't know what it would be, but two piranhas. Why two piranhas? I don't know. When have you ever even seen two piranhas flailing on the ground? Okay, now I'm gonna roast you. That's a terrible analogy. Two piranhas flailing on the ground. You get my point. Yeah, I get your point, man. I think what you're saying is, you know, it's like just the purely like you need somebody for the thing to work. The very least, if you're hooking up with someone else in a wheelchair, you're dealing with like many more extra steps in between humping, right? That's what you're doing. Or tread marks. Tread marks. Yeah, yeah, you're dealing with like, what? Wait, what do you mean? Because you said extra steps. When it's too handicap people, there are no steps. So it would be tread marks, you know, tires. Gotcha. Okay, okay, I got you. Yeah, man. I mean, look, I think, listen, I think that that's really honest of you to like just say that. And also I think, listen, for me, you know, before I was with Aaron, you know, or, you know, any time dating has always been hard for me. And like, if I had to add to dating somehow in the midst of a conversation over dinner or whatever, getting across them like, you know, I can, I can fuck. Like I'm capable of fucking. I just want to make sure, you know, I don't have to say that's what's going to happen, but I can fuck. That's just an awkward moment, man. And they're, of course, they are thinking that too. Because like, you know, so, and yeah, I get it. How does it work for you? If like, where do you meet people? How often do you find yourself going on dates? I mean, before the pandemic, none of us are going on dates right now. Well, you are with Aaron, because you guys are in close quarters. And I told Aaron this when we were watching you at C the other week, that she deserves her own version of a Purple Heart or metal. Yes. Two piranhas flailing on the ground. To answer your question, you know, unfortunately, a lot of it has come to online dating and different things like that, which is a whole other horse of a different color because you never know if you're dealing with a bot or like a real person, or if it's a guy posing it, you know. So all these things are going through your head. You hope for the best and things like that. And I will say that I've had quite the eclectic dating history updated everybody from, you know, business executives to strippers, to the actresses, to you name it, I've done it. And without naming any names, there's been a couple of situations already where I know that I fucked up royally and looking back on it, I'm like, God damn it, if I did a couple of things differently, you know, maybe I'd still be with that person but hindsight is- How do you fuck up? Just, you know, sometimes, you know, philosophies don't necessarily meet on certain things. And, you know, by the time you realize that you could have compromised on your philosophy and sort of met in the middle, the damn has been done and that's what it is. Right. You could have, yeah, I see what you're saying. You're, yeah, I think you should beat yourself up too much, man. That's just part of growing as a person is like realizing you can be a little more flexible philosophically sometimes and your ego wants you to be. Cause typically handicap people are not that flexible but whatever it's fine. I knew you were going, you know what? Honestly, I was sitting here trying to think of another word besides flexible because I knew you were going to do that. So I'm like spinning in my head like, what's another, like, I'm trying to go, I get it's like, fuck it, I'll just do it. Yeah. Now, getting back to your initial question of what my message is that I give out to people. Is I'm only being proof that no matter what your situation is or what your circumstances are, if you believe in yourself and your abilities, you can accomplish anything because I had a lot of people in school tell me that I should just give up and I would never amount to anything. And I very eloquently have told them to go fuck themselves and done my own thing and it's gotten me to where I am now. And it's allowed me to work with some of the great world leaders over the years, including Princess Diana and I got to work with Nelson Mandela and some other people. And, you know, at the end of the day, we're all people. I think a lot of individuals today and in society today in general, forget that when you put everything aside, no matter what level of status you come from, what level of success you come from, at the end of the day, when you strip all of that away, we're all people. We put our pants on one leg at a time and for those who can put their pants on, both legs at a time, that's where the true talent lies in my opinion. But, you know, as long as we never lose belief in ourselves or our abilities and surround ourselves with great core groups of people that have our back through everything and anything, we can accomplish anything. And that's another thing, you know, that I like about us is that you are one of the few people that I can count on one hand, where it doesn't matter how long the period of time is between our conversations. When we get a chance to get on the phone, it's like we just talked five minutes ago. And, you know, you have all different guests on your Dunkin' Trussell family hour here and I'm privileged to be a part of it now. But more importantly than that, I'm just proud to be an extended member of your family period. Likewise, and you are. I mean, we have a word for it in my community. It's called the satsang. It's like a community that transcends a lifetime. And I love the idea. I don't care if people think I'm a woo woo hippie, but the concept is really quite beautiful, which is that, you know, we all, we keep hanging out together. Like whenever we reincarnate, we find each other, which is why when you run into members of your satsang, the weirdness is that like when I met you, it was like, it's the exact same thing like the other day when you reached out and we talked again after all these years. It was like that, except we'd never talked. We still pick up the conversation, but in this case, when did we even start talking? We didn't. So it's something from another life. And you've just, and you've probably been roasting me for many incarnations now, but I do believe that. And I love that feeling. And I think it's one of the real, it's a sign to me that if you're, when you're getting to, whenever people, whenever we find each other again, it means you're doing something right, you know? And, you know, you were on my Instagram with me not too long ago, and we had an interview similar to this. And, you know, we don't have to go into too much depth of detail yet because we haven't ironed it out yet, but why don't you sort of explain a little bit of that idea that I had that I threw out at you that got you really excited? Oh, we can't, here's the thing. Not gonna talk about that. Not because I wanted to be secret, but because should, and even though they can listen to your, but I'm not gonna do it, ma'am, only because it's the kind of thing where after, I'll tell you later, man. That's the kind of thing I just wanna like, for a little bit, but, Did you wanna close so you can take that part out then? Oh, no, I don't want to take it out. It doesn't matter. But wait, man, I wanna talk, this is to me, the like high school fucking sucked, man, for me. I didn't like it, nobody fucking liked it. It's brutal, but like to experience high school in a wheelchair with cerebral palsy and to literally have people telling, in some way or another. And I imagine, maybe you could tell me a little bit about this. I imagine it's not like people are actually coming to you and saying, give up, right? Isn't it just more kind of like an implied give up and implied sense that whatever your expectations are for your life, they shouldn't be the same as a person who isn't in a wheelchair's expectations for their life. And the thing is, they stuck me with an assistant, obviously, to help write, cause I can't write without a computer and things like that. But that assistant was literally over my shoulder all day, every day, instead of just taking notes and compelled to chime in when, didn't really need to chime in. And then I had special ed teachers coming up to me and saying, maybe you should do this work instead of that work. And I'm like, what do you think I'm not capable of doing that work? And then they would backtrack in front of me and try and cover up their own ass. And it was funny to watch them try and do that because I always knew what I was capable of. And no- How do you know that? How did you know that? Where did you get that from? Was it your parents? Was it some influence that gave you this spirit? Working with the people that I have worked with over the years, even from a young age, it made me grow up quick. And I had a handle on what I thought I could achieve. Obviously, was I still growing up and still a teenager? Yeah, did I do some dumb shit? Absolutely, like we all did. But I always knew what I was capable of and I knew how smart I was because my goal would be to hold conversation and get the information the way that I retain information and give out information at the same time. You're really charismatic, man. And you're also, you're just a powerful person. And this is something I think people who have that spirit inside of them and feel it, if you get around the wrong people, which is why I really appreciate what you're saying about that, if you get around the wrong people, they will attempt to suppress that part of you. That part of you will make them uneasy. They don't like it. If you get around the wrong person and they sense that you have discovered that part of yourself that feels indomitable, that feels like it can't be encumbered by anything, and sometimes that is completely paradoxical to someone's life situation. And it can be really make you feel crazy to have this feeling inside of you that you can burst past whatever your particular obstacles are. But if you get around the wrong people, they will try to put poor water on that thing. And some people, I'm afraid, let that happen. And then they end up becoming like human bonsai trees. They could have grown into this massive thing, but they end up like in someone's little garden, there's a cute little thing. And we were talking about high school and things like that. I made it a mission of mine on the first day of high school, on the very first day of high school, to become friends with the senior football team. So I did, and that helped me not get picked on as much and different things like that, because the senior football team was thought of as on this pedestal, as most senior football teams around the country are. And, but one thing is for sure, is that for my senior prom, I remember that everybody was like asking people out and different things like that. I didn't get that because, you know, people were feeling sorry for the fact that I was in my wheelchair and I didn't want to have a date that was just with me out of pity. Right. Whatever, because that would ruin their prom experience too, until I met this one woman who didn't go to our school. Her name was Jamie Short. And she was really nice and we hit it off. And she ended up being my date to my senior prom. And the funniest thing about that, it wasn't funny at the time, but it's funny in retrospect now. The funniest thing about that was, it was at this big old converted train station that was now a banquet hall. So it had this big giant like gargoyle-like staircase in front of it. And then it had a wheelchair ramp on the side of it for me to go up. And then so Jamie goes up this huge gigantic staircase. I go around the side to go up the ramp and meet her at the top. There's a group of guys standing at the top of the ramp drunk out of their minds. And I'm like, excuse me, guys, nothing, excuse me, guys, nothing. And then I'm like, fuck it, I'm gonna try and go around these guys. And as I try and go around these guys, one of the drunk guys stumbles back and stumbles into my driving arm. And I end up tumbling down 14 stairs. Are you fucking kidding? Yeah, 14 stairs attached to my wheelchair, still my electric wheelchair. And it lands directly on top of me. So I'm halfway down the staircase now. And it took three cops to pick me up with my chair and put me back to Miranda. And I felt so bad and whatever, because my date had just watched this happen and had just gotten there for my senior prom. So I went into total macho mode and the cops are like, hey, are you okay? Blah, blah. I'm like, oh yeah, yeah, I'm fine. And we go in and we have the senior prom and I'm dancing and things like that. And I get home and it was like one o'clock in the morning. And then I find out that I cracked three ribs and I couldn't move for like two weeks after that. I was gonna let some drunk idiots ruin my senior prom especially when this wonderful woman saw me fall directly in front of her and was like, oh my God, my date has officially died. That's badass, that's badass, man. That's, you know what? That's broke, cracked ribs are one of the most painful fucking things. But you did it, that's badass. I would not, I mean, look, man, just going to a fucking prom, that's like a cracked rib to me. I was on acid in the forest for my senior prom. I was like, fuck that. I'm just gonna go on the woods with my friends and get high as I can get. If you saw how attractive this Jamie was, you would do everything you could to keep the promise. So cool, man. I don't know what I'm saying, wherever she happens to be. But that definitely seems to be kind of your, that's like your karmic momentum in this particular incarnation that you've taken on is you seem pretty unstoppable, man. You're like not gonna let a bunch of drunk shitbags fuck up your prom. And that seems to be going a pattern that emerges through your whole life. This revelation about not being able to, like having to fast during UFC's seems to be another example of that. But do you ever worry that sometimes maybe you can become a little imbalanced in your, as you put it, kind of machismo sensibility when it comes to approaching some of these challenges? You know, one of the things that kind of bothered me, I guess you could say about my father when he was very sick, is he didn't tell us how sick he was until very close to his passing. Because he didn't want us, he didn't want to burden us. And I wish he had asked for help a little sooner or at least conveyed to us what he was going through sooner than he did. But he was, he felt like, you know, he had to like, he wanted to stay tough, it's up to the very end. I respect it. But do you feel like sometimes you're not maybe asking for help when you should be out of a sense of like, wanting to be that person, the motivational speaker, wanting to be that heroic figure? Well, yeah, and there's an inherent sense of embarrassment for me too. And that happened a lot and has happened a lot in terms of, you know, whoever it is that I'm dating at the time, to sleep next to them, but then realize, hey, I may have to get up in the middle of the night because of a flare up or whatever, you know, that always plays in the back of my mind. What do you mean a flare up? What does that look like? What do you mean? Meaning like, you know, if my stomach says to me in the middle of the night, hey, we gotta get up when I, you know, to wake that person up and be like, hey, I know that you were just in the middle of a sound sleep, but, you know, do you mind helping me for five minutes? I think, and a lot of them were very accepting of it, but that still take away from my inherent, you know, sense of pride and embarrassment, you know. Yeah, it's always been there and it's still there. Yeah, I imagine, that to me is like, gotta be a weird tightrope for you to, oh, damn it. You know, I was gonna say a tightrope walk and I'm sorry. That's gotta be a, you know, I caught myself before you caught me, but that's gotta be like, you know, finding balance there has gotta be a real challenge for you, man, because, yeah, you know, I get it. Like a lot of times, you know, I end up not taking care of myself because of my ego, you know, and sometimes, but you're in a situation where you are going to need people to help you. That's just the way it is. Like, you know, all of us are, but for you, this is like the kind of thing where, you know, yeah, if you're sleeping with somebody, don't you think that they already understand that they're gonna have to be there for you in certain ways that maybe are gonna be different from being with other people? No, 100%, and they were very understanding of that, but that doesn't take away my own thoughts and the fact that my voice in my head is going, you're being a fucking inconsiderate asshole, you know? So that's my own fight that I have in my head. And, you know, I'm a very independent person by nature, you know, so I don't like asking for help. And so for the last decade and a half, while dealing with this unknown situation that I've dealt with, I've had to ask for help a lot. And it's bothered me so much because it really is the only handicapping thing about me. Like I said earlier, my disability is not my handicap. Gotcha. It's this thing. Well, you know, maybe some folks listening, I don't know. You know, like I can't even, that to me is just, it sucks so bad because, you know, at least with a diagnosis, you know what the fuck is going on, but if you've mystified people so much, it's just like, it must just be the most frustrating thing that I have to deal with that. Right, it is. And there's only so much of the same story that you can hear before you throw your hands up in the air and wave them like you just don't care. But to answer your question from earlier, like I like to think of myself sometimes as the lyric from the one hit wonder band, Chamba Wamba from the 90s. And that is, I get knocked down, but I get up again, you're never gonna keep me down. Yeah. And so that's my philosophy is I can get knocked down and I get knocked down a lot, but you're never gonna keep me down and I'm gonna keep going. Man, that's so beautiful. And it really is inspirational. And I'm sorry that I'm even saying I'm sorry. I think that what you're doing, I mean, I just know just being friends with you has been, has really improved my own life. And it's really like, it does give me a perspective. You have such a perspective on things that, you know, many of my friends are great teachers and I love all of them and all, but only like you and Ramdas are the people I have known who have sort of transcended their physical limitations in a way that is so powerful and really, really like is a reminder. So I wonder if you could just, if we could wrap up with you. I'm not asking you to like given motivational speech here, but just for the folks listening right now, you know, cause we all feel fucking in some way, shape or form right now. I think we all feel a little handicapped, so to speak. We're stuck in our fucking houses. You know what I mean? A lot of people are freaking out. They're scared. A lot of people have lost their jobs. A lot of people don't know what's gonna happen and after they open everything back up again. We got folks with autoimmune disorders who like can't do anything anymore because they, you know, are in a lot, like there's this new virus out there. You know the situation. Can you give us a little micro sermon to maybe to put some fire under our asses or to like help us figure out a way to navigate through this bizarre pandemic situation? Absolutely, first and foremost, for those who are listening because we haven't talked about it. If you are interested in finding out more about me, feel free to go on to Instagram and look up the Spencer Miller. That's T-H-E Spencer Miller and you'll see a lot of stuff on me there. And I got some other cool things coming up as well. Once this pandemic settled itself, like Duncan and I were talking about and we'll fill you in more on that when we can, if we can. And that is, and secondly, before I go into my micro sermon, I wanna say thank you to you because for me to be able to come on to your family, our podcast like this and have a discussion with one of my really good friends in you and talk about a wide variety of things has been very cathartic and very informative for everybody I hope listening. So thank you. My pleasure, man. I love it. And thank you for being my friend. Likewise, man, I'm so glad we reconnected. Yeah. And yes, we are going through unprecedented times right now around the world. But the fact of the matter is, if we continue to follow the guidelines that we need to follow in order to permanently flatten this curve, we will come back with a vengeance, the likes of which we have never seen because. Oh, shit. I lost you, we'll come back with a vengeance. Start there. Yeah, and we will come back with a vengeance because up until this point in our lives, a lot of us took advantage of the fact of just sitting on a patio on a nice day with some friends talking and shooting the shit and things like that. And because we haven't been able to even do something like that during all of this, we will come back with a greater appreciation. We will come back with a greater appreciation for work and for what it is that we do creatively in terms of Duncan and myself, because I miss working so much and I miss being able to work with my colleagues, work with my fellow athletes and different things like that. So all of that being said is always, always, always have an eternal amount of hope within ourselves because as bad as it is at any point, when we get on the other side of it, it is gonna be that much greater and that much more successful and that much more appreciated than it was before. Ah, beautiful, hallelujah. Spencer, thank you so much for coming on the show, man. I really appreciate it. I love you and it's been a wonderful conversation and you gotta come back on again.

So happy to be back, Duncan. How are your holidays? You all do, what do you do? Do you do Hanukkah, Christmas? What is? Yeah, we do Hanukkah, Christmas. I actually love the principles of Kwanzaa because it descenders white people, it's totally for black people, but so therefore we don't do that one. But we celebrate Hanukkah and Christmas because Hanukkah for my Jewish family, Hanukkah Christmas for Jack's family, which is a mix. Okay, so you get it all. I mean, that's nice. Both of them seem nice. I'm sure your grandkids love that. That's a lot of gifts, right? Because Hanukkah, what's the deal with Hanukkah? It's a gift every day or something? It's eight nights, but you know, I remember from my parents, like the first night you would get something you really wanted, the last night you'd get a pair of socks. Bomber, what kind of refers that? What's the theory behind that? You don't gradually degrade into less. Why? They ran out of ideas and I guess they didn't want to start out with the socks and underwear because that would be a little disappointing for a kid. Yes. Yes. I mean, Erin was, we gave the kids clothes and just watching the way they just tossed them, tossed them aside like refuse. Like, what is this beautiful sweater? Why would you even show this to me? I want a car. I don't want to wear a sweater. Yeah. I don't even want to put on my jacket. Trudy, I wanted to share with you. You know, I'm so happy to help you in any way. It's thrilling to me. When you reached out to me, it was thrilling to me that you wanted to use my Instagram to help promote iACT and we talk about that organization in a second. But you know, as I'm looking through my Instagram messages, one of them was furious that I was promoting this anti-genocide organization and it was a quick message, very angry, essentially Duncan used to be funny, now you're all woke. And to me, I found that to be very funny in its own right just because to imagine the mind state of somebody who is offended by a very lazy attempt on my part to help promote an anti-genocide organization in the sense that it's easy to use Instagram. I'm not out there working with refugees like you do. I'm not out there. It's just a simple thing, but this was this push this person to the point of like having to confront me about it. And that got my wheels spinning as I started thinking about how there really is a force, a social force. I don't know what it is in the world that pushes back against attempts to help. And I wonder if you have ever thought about what that force is or why it exists or why it feels embarrassing. There's there's some aspect of service reaching out to help other people that even though you know this is how what we're supposed to do, it feels a little like, oh, I'm showing off, I'm an SJW, a social justice warrior. Why am I doing this? I just want accolades. This isn't real. Can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah, I mean, you've mentioned a lot of the reasons right there. First of all, the idea that we're supposed to be good and we're supposed to help other people, it just, it's kind of smarmy. It's max of, you know, being lectured or church or stuff like that. That is pretty phony or can feel, you know, your heart isn't in it. And then the idea that you're doing it just to get approval or recognition. Honestly, nothing we do is just for one reason. If I help people, I do it also because I'm going to feel good. And I wanted to tell you, I've been playing with the chat, GBT, the open AI. We, you and I played with it some together. Yeah. So I asked open AI. I was like, okay, you, you help me with this question. Like, why, why should you bother helping other people? Yeah. Why bother? I mean, we have problems of our own. I can barely keep my own life in order. Right. So I want to tell you what it said. Okay, great. Can I read it to you? Please, I can't wait. All right. Listeners, listen up. Um, do you often find yourself, this is AI generated. Do you often, and, and it was generated instantaneously? As soon as I asked the question, the print came out. Wow. Do you often find yourself wondering why you should bother helping others? After all, you've got your own problems to deal with, right? Well, fear not, dear listener. We're here to tell you that helping others is a totally selfish act. War on the surface, sure. It might seem like you're being selfless and doing it for someone else. But when you really think about it, helping others is all about getting that warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from feeling good about doing something nice for someone else. You know, that feeling of joy and satisfaction that comes from knowing you've made a difference in someone's life and let's be real. Who doesn't love feeling good about themselves? But they go on, Duncan. It's not just about the warm, fuzzy feelings. Helping others can also have some pretty sweet perks. For example, have you ever noticed that people who are known for being kind and helpful have more friends? It's true. When you help others, you're more likely to return the favor, which can give you more friends. They say, wrong goes to stronger social connections, supportive social network, all that stuff. And we know that friends and support are the key to a happy and fulfilling life. So next time you're considering whether or not to help someone out, remember, it's not about being selfless. It's about being selfish. Do it for the warm, fuzzy feelings and the awesome perks that come with it. You won't be sorry. That's the chatbot response. What? That's amazing. That is really unnerving and amazing and true. That is true. Added charm of being true. Yeah. Wow. That is so cool. Whoa. We could talk about the science and how when we engage in acts of kindness, our brains release oxytocin, the feel good hormone, and then we get healthier. I mean, we could talk about all that, but isn't being selfish more fun? Yeah, I guess so. I mean, it's just, it's like from that perspective, which is really fascinating. It's sort of saying, look, everything you're doing is probably selfish in the sense you have a self, you have to eat, but taking care of other people, it actually does more for you than just taking care of yourself. Because my many experiments and selfishness, serving myself, my God, I should start an organization just for serving myself. This is my life, actually. I'm always tending to myself, cloaching myself, trying to get that feeling that the AI is talking about. And truly that feeling for me does not activate as much when I'm doing it for myself, but the moment I'm doing anything, which is great about having kids, because my God, you're always having to serve other beings. It's like you're, it's suddenly you're in heaven. You're, it's joy. It's chaotic joy. It's incredible. But why, Trudy? Why do people get angry at you if you sort of publicly mention it? If you, you know, and I feel it too, like when I see those YouTube videos of people filming themselves, helping, oh, yeah, disgusting. It's really embarrassing. Yeah, that's harsh. That is, that's harsh. I mean, look, there's obvious ego and then there's the subtle ego, which I prefer. But, um, yeah, but seriously, I think that all these programs, you know, 12 step programs of all kinds, everybody knows that when people are depressed or feeling isolated or disconnected or just down, that actually doing something kind or good for others, it lifts that mood. And I think the reason somebody might get angry is either, either, you know, there's this kind of perverse pleasure of enjoying when you're feeling like shit and enjoying a kind of dystopian view of the world and it being cynical and stuff like that. And so if you challenge that, it can make people angry. It can make them feel guilty or ashamed that they're not doing something. And then they get angry at you because really they're mad at themselves. Right. So they're just sort of projecting their own sort of inner sense of like, well, I'm just repeating. I'm looping here. I'm stuck in the mud. They, they're demonstrating a way out. And also, you know, there, I think earlier you were talking a little bit about any time it comes off as corrective, you know, where it's not just like you're helping other people, but then also you're trying to like, maybe that's, maybe that's the problem is that it's like sometimes service is actually aggression. It's not just trying to get warm and fuzzy. It's underneath it is like, look, I'm better than you. Look at all the good I'm doing in the world. While you're sitting there playing video games or staring at the internet. But, but you're doing it with a smile, but people feel that aggression underneath. Yeah. No, that, that, that is really, um, that's actually, I would get angry at that too. I really would. It's sort of noxious, but, you know, I'm coming more from a place of, for example, with IAC, this group that I have supported, um, because it was founded by people who just could not stand. It was the time of the Darfur refugees and the genocide in Darfur. Unfortunately, there have been, you know, several genocides in the world, but it was, and they, they just couldn't stand it. And they went over there just with this little handheld recorder and they met, they just hung out with the refugees and said, what would, you know, what would be most helpful to you? Is there anything that we could do to help you over here when we're so far away over there and, um, like what, what possibly could we do? And they listened. And that's what was so different from, you know, helping the idea of helping. Like my first teacher that, uh, who was a Soto Zen monkey said, I asked him once because I was working with severely dysregulated children and I was like, uh, and their parents who were tearing their hair out are also very crazy themselves. And I would say, how can I help them? And he said, no idea of helping. Oh, shit. That's deep. Yes. It's deep. It was a, it was a calling for me for years. Like, Oh, right. Not to separate myself out. Like I'm the goddess of giving over here. Right. You're the pitiful recipient of my faith over there. No, that's it. Right. That's it. So they just humbled themselves. They just went and listened to the refugees and said, what do you need? I mean, they knew their community and they were, they were just these few people. So tiny groups. So they didn't, they weren't, um, constrained by having to do these top down things like the UN, you know, all the big refugee organizations. Right. Listened and the refugees said, we need preschool and soccer. We want education and we want to feel like we actually belong to the world instead of being those open prison camps, stateless people. We want to play soccer and they sent a team to, to an international soccer. I don't know as much about the soccer because I went to help with the preschool when I worked in the refugee camp, but teaching them mindfulness. But we taught the soccer coaches too. They wanted mindfulness to help them deal with the stress of their situation and develop some coping skills to work with their flashbacks. I mean, I was like, where is mindfulness on the hierarchy of human needs? Right. All right. So. Mindfulness or any kind. I, I, I get how that would be something that would be incredibly useful for people who are going through something like that. My God, I just watched this. I don't know why I do this to myself. Just this, uh, vice, uh, did a piece on this, the last family. And I think the Ukrainian city is about Kut or something. And it's just getting blown to shit right now. And, uh, you know, it's when you have kids, especially, it is a little girl living with her parents in this city. And all you could do is think that's my, that could be my kid. Why wasn't that my kid? Why, why is that not my kid? This kid is sort of normalized this situation that she's in. She's putting her dad, daughter to put like a big jug of water in front of the window so the glass, the window doesn't blow open when the bombs hit. And then she's sort of showing down in her bomb shelter, they go to what she does for fun, which is like jumping off of a little ledge into a hula hoop. And then you, and you're watching the parents are broken. They're trying to, I don't know why there's, they're, they have their reasons for staying there, which to me seemed, I don't know, but who am I to judge? My God, I don't know. Anyway, you, you, you watch something like that. And, uh, aside from the fact, it just feels like the end of the world. You do want to help you do and certainly like, I guess mindfulness is, if you're going to help people deal with like recovering from that sort of reality. If you ever can recover from that kind of reality, mindfulness seems like it would be incredibly helpful. How do you do that though? Like, how do you teach children who speak another language who have gone through hell on earth? How, what, what would a beginning class on mindfulness look like from you? Okay. So the, the little kids in the camps did not witness the genocide, did not witness the killing and, uh, other horrible things that happened. Um, with the little kids, we taught them mindful games and I had to have translator. I don't speak Arabic. There are many different languages in the Darfurid people, but Arabic is the common one. And so I didn't have a, you know, somebody, uh, we had a wonderful community leader, Umd Atarbash, and he, he would translate for us or this other guy, Ahmed. And, um, but for the people who have witnessed all this trauma, where do you begin? Well, first of all, we'll come in with, you know, our Western stories about mindfulness. You come in with, looking at their community and what do they do already that takes a lot of mindfulness? Like the women learn to walk with these huge, like be done with these jugs of water on their heads to carry water. You, you know how strong your neck has to be? Cause I was like, Oh, teach me how. And they just laughed. They were like, your neck is falling off. You'll snap, you'll snap to carry things on your head. But the balance that it takes to walk and then they don't hold their hands up like this, walk around with it on their head. So, I mean, there's mindfulness or the way that they, um, I was at somebody's, somebody's home of grass hut and, uh, they asked me if I could cut a tomato. And I was like, of course, I know how to cut a tomato. You know, I, and they said, well, here's how we cut a tomato. And they put the tomato in their hand and they cut with a blade toward the hand and really fast, like, and the tomato is diced and their hand is not hurt. And I was just like, Oh my God, but these are things that take focus and concentration and illness. So we started by just picking up on the things that people already did. It's not like we're trying to teach them something they don't know. We're all human beings. We know how to focus and be present. We just have to train our minds and hearts to do that. And so, yeah, so we just started where people are. And we played games like rolling a ball, we'd get in a circle and then, and I want to give a shout out to Susan Kaiser Greenland, because it was her book, Mindful Games, which wasn't even out yet. She let us use, um, her material. You sit in a circle and you, let's say I roll the ball to you and you're one of the little, um, one of the young women who teach the preschool and everybody when they get the ball, they say, what's going on in their mind and what's going on in their body. So mindful of your state of mind and mindful of the condition of your body. And they would say, you know, um, my mind is happy. My body is aching and or one person who even said, and I have malaria and no, you know, everybody was not in good health, but everybody was so happy to be learning and to be playing games and to be learning how they can help the kids and have fun with them. Honestly, it was so joyful to be there in that bleak, malnourished. Uh, yeah, it's an open prison camp, really. Uh, and there's, you know, hundreds of thousands, I think 350,000 in 12 camps along the borders with Sudan. And this is just one place in the world, Duncan, right, that is hurting. And it can be so overwhelming. And you think, well, you know, what can we do? And so that's for me, what, when I get upset about the world and feel so much grief or anger about social injustice, et cetera, et cetera. And I, you know, I'm just, I'm just talking about the unfairness of life. Essentially, when I get upset about that, what helps is for me to do something. I just need to do something. Yeah.

But again, that's microdose.com code Duncan. What helps is for me to do something. I just need to do something. In this case, I went to the refugee camp, but you don't have to go to a refugee camp, buy somebody's coffee, you know, the person behind you in line. You can do sweet things. Okay, I'm sorry to do this. I mean, maybe again, this is just the way we are. I just read something and forgive me anyone listening. If this is not the case, Starbucks employees are like, please stop doing that because they have to keep track. And it's this huge pain in the ass. It's a huge pain in the ass. It's like just buy your own coffee. And then like, if you want to give the person money for their coffee, do that. But this play it forward thing, it's hard enough now that they're doing all the Uber Eats orders. They've got to deal with this nightmare. And now suddenly a charity line forms. Okay, please not pay for somebody's coffee, but maybe you could pay their toll of the car behind you or something like that. I don't know. I get, but I get the spirit of it. Yeah, I, it's like minimize it, you know, doesn't have to be big. You don't have to go be gone. You don't have to go do a salt march. There's little, little things that you can do that maybe you'll get the ball rolling to bigger things. Is that what happened to you? I mean, Trudy, was there ever a time where you were just like, a little more cynical, a little more selfish, where you knew that there were people out there actively trying to help others, but you were like, oh, whatever, that's not me. I'm like that a little bit every day, Duncan. I look around the world and sometimes I'm just like, we are F'd. And, you know, and sometimes I, my 12 year old grandson, I can use the word, right, because he said it, you know, he was learning about climate change. And he's like, maybe we are fucked. I mean, I look around it all the time too. Come on. That's why I have to do this stuff to keep playing out of the, you know, abyss of despair and cynicism and negativity that, yeah, sure, of course. Yeah, I can go there too. But aren't we, aren't we fucked no matter? I mean, like, and again, I'm not saying this cynically. I mean, to me, it's at some point you, you come to this realization of even if somehow peace, global harmony, we still got all these nuclear weapons everywhere, we still have God knows what, wherever, and the way the world works as things will inevitably get out of balance and cause horrific suffering. And then even if that doesn't happen, you're still getting old. You're going to die. Everyone you love is going to die. You're fucking away. So, so, so then it just boils down to, okay. So in the midst of that reality, what is the philosophy that's going to sort of carry you through until you drop your body? What is the right philosophy? And I, you know, there's lots of arguments about that. Some people are like, oh, it's debauchery, it's hedonism, absolute selfishness. Don't fall prey to this bullshit morality out there. There's no morality. There's no morality in the face of the abyss. What are you going to, what are you out there giving soup to people? You should be having orgasms and getting high and getting rich and having lots of stuff, and then you lived, baby, you lived. And then you, you, I don't know, you die in your Porsche or something. And you're, so that's one of the real philosophies in the world. I sort of made it a little bit, uh, non-sophisticated. But the philosophy, it is a philosophy. And I think what you can do is look at the folks, you know, how's it working for you as a therapist, as a spiritual teacher? I, I see these folks all the time, they come to me and they're beautiful, brand new, light gray, coolest color Porsche and pour out their misery. And they have everything. Right. So I just say, try it, try it, try these different paths, see what works for you. Try it in the laboratory of yourself. And that's all the Buddha ever said, try my teaching. See if it works for you. The whole thing is about what leads to happiness and what leads to unhappiness. And for me, I just discovered, look, I guess I was the slightly weird kid too, because I, I remember when I was around eight years old, I had, I used to sit on the curb, I wrote about this in my memoir. I used to sit on the curb and wait for my dad to come home. My mom was nice, but she was depressed and I was eager to get out of the house and wait, so he would walk home from work and I would wait. And in those days, it was the fifties and a lot of the dads would get dropped off by, you know, their public transport and then they would walk home and I would sit and see all the dads coming home. And I could always tell which ones were sad, like which ones were going to a house where it wasn't a happy home. As a kid, I had made a list of the sad dads. Now, you know, most eight year olds, sad dad list. I think maybe who knows, I could give psychological, maybe I was a tune to it cause my mom was kind of depressed at that time, blah, blah. I don't know. But I just think that I, for me, what I discovered instead of just cause I, it was depressing, you know? But what I discovered is actually including the sad dads, quote, unquote, all those people in my consciousness, it helped me in some way. And I think that, you know, when I ask, when you say, what is the philosophy? I'm going to give an answer that might give people the creeps, but it's true. And the philosophy is love. There really isn't anything else. Yeah. You know, sis, I talked about this at the retreat. Sister Helen Preijon, who was the dead man walking the, the nun who worked with the death row inmates and their families. She said, she said, you know, human beings, she would be the last person that that condemned person, her face would be the last face that they would see before they were executed. And she said, human beings at the end, their last words are words of love. They become loving beings. And, and so her, she dedicated her life to working with the most excluded, marginalized, like, okay, death row inmates and their families. Again, we don't have to go that far. There's plenty of excluded people right in front of us. But, but she talked about how, you know, we, we freeze, we fix people in this certain identity for the worst thing they ever did in their life. Yes. No path to redemption. But I think love and trust, I'm sorry if people don't want to hear these words. But honestly, it's they're very alive words. They're about processes that are alive, that are always changing and happening. Sometimes my love, okay, I'm married to a wonderful man. You love him too. I do. But sometimes my love turns to hate and we joke about it. Right. Has that ever happened to you with Aaron? I don't know. Probably never. Never, never has that ever happened. And I've never heard such a thing, Trudy, in marriage that that should happen. Yeah, sure. There's times when we're not getting along. There's times when, you know, yeah, definitely, definitely that has happened. So, you know, if you consider that love and trust that these are like their processes, they include their life, they're always changing there, you know, they include all the feelings that go along with it. And then I feel like, okay, I want to be on the side of the outcasts in my own heart, the exiles that Dick Schwartz calls them in his internal family system. And the more I'm on the side of the exiles in my own heart, Duncan, the more it just doesn't need to be inclusive to others. Okay. You mean the exiles in your own heart? You mean like the parts of yourself that you have been, wow. Yeah, sure. Oh my God. Yeah. Self that get in my way, the parts of myself that do things I wish she wouldn't and say I wish she wouldn't. Exiles in your own heart. That is genius. Oh my God. Like the, just the banished, sad. What is it? I don't remember which cartoon it is. The island of discarded toys. You know, I, I just was watching this creepy show. It's like, I can't remember what it's called, like Christmas train or something, polar express, horrible animation, uncanny valley. But yeah, it's creepy. There's like a, some sad room of toys. Kids don't play with anymore. This, yes, this I get rabbit. You can go to that story too. Oh, don't even mention the Velveteen rabbit. That's a hammer. That's a soul hammer. But yes, yes. Right. Yes. So that's beautiful. So, so yeah. Okay. So you start by loving the remember, I'm sorry, go ahead. No, please. I'm just summarizing what you said. You start by loving the exiles, the discarded or the suppressed or barely suppressed parts of yourself that are also part of you. And then it's just, I don't know. It's just kind of more natural. Do you remember, um, uh, Krishnadas, uh, put in one of his, uh, chance, these beautiful prayers that he sings in his Kirtan, um, he put the words to a zen prayer called the gate of sweet nectar. He put them to music and I'm not Krishnadas, but I just want to remind you what they are because to me, this is actually, this is actually what is very moving to me. He says, um, okay, excuse me. No harmonium, no Krishnadas calling out to hungry hearts everywhere through endless time, you who wonder, you who thirst, I offer you this heart of mine. Calling all you hungry spirits everywhere through endless time, calling out to hungry hearts, all the lost and left behind, gather round and share this meal. Your joy and your sorrow, I make it mine. So my dear Duncan, your joy, your sorrow, we're not separate ultimately, you know? And in the Buddhist tradition, they have these refuges and they're really sources of guidance and wisdom that if you want to be a refuge from the materialistic, conventional consumer, you know, all the things we know that are wrong with our society, it's being a different kind of refugee to the heart. And, you know, to me, this is a spiritual path when we talk about sharing our joys and sorrows as human beings. And you're so good at that. You're so open-hearted and you share everything. You don't have anything back, Duncan. It's called oversharing, Trudy. I'm a professional oversharer. But look, look, it helps people because you talk about and I do it too. You know, I'm not like really the same as a lot of my colleagues as spiritual teachers talking about what most people don't talk about. Giving, when we talk about the voiceless, we're not just talking about, you know, oppressed people who have no voice. We're talking about those parts of ourselves that aren't allowed to speak. I want to thank Rocket Money, not just for supporting this episode of the DTFH, but for going through all of the literally infinite subscriptions to things I don't use anymore and cancelling them. I don't know about you, but sometimes late at night, it makes sense for me to subscribe to five different piano tutorial services, along with a subscription to a guitar tuner that costs $20 a month.

We're talking about those parts of ourselves that aren't allowed to speak. Right. I never thought of that. But, you know, I think there is a cultural prohibition on even kicking the idea around that you, with all your stuff, could also be a refugee. Even though at night sometimes I might be laying there thinking like, my God, what is, well, I'm none of this stuff is really mine anyway. I don't get, I'm not going to die with it. And then also the, the situation of coming into a world where your parents die, a world where you, you, you are innately confused. It's a confusing place and where there's trickery. Mixed in with all of it, where it isn't all compassion and your beautiful song that where there's people who are, and that's, that's something that happens to refugees. That's one of the many awful things that happens to refugees is that on top of the, all the other shit they're having to deal with, people will like abuse them. People will exploit them. People will enslave them. People will just do, just juice them. For whatever it is they think they can give from them. So, you know, I get that, I get it. Look, I'm sorry, but we're all refugees. Would I, if I had to pick between refugee in a nice house with a job he likes, healthy, and like the refugees that you are going to help, obviously I'm picking this life. So I'm not trying to make some, that it's an equal situation. Not comparing yourself to people fleeing war and persecution and genocide and human rights abuses. I mean, but we all need support and assistance and we can all help each other and helping them actually remember that warm fuzzy selfish feeling. That's why I wanted to talk about IACT and Insight LA, the nonprofit that I founded for, you know, mindfulness and Buddhist training and education. You know, we have a part called Insight in action because what do you do with these feelings? You know, we have a whole branch of our work that is really giving people the chance to have some outlet for this wish because there is a lot of work that we have to do to help others. The more we have a good relationship with or let's say the more we have maybe a handshaking acquaintance with our inner life, including all the exiled parts. Yeah. It actually is, I think you can see it in children. If somebody's crying, they want to comfort them, right? I think it's a wired in capacity for compassion. Yep. It is. You know what? Maybe with IACT in particular, I think one of the challenges they are up against, aside from the thing that they're obviously up against, is that I'm not positive that a lot of people are fully aware that genocide is happening now. Like I'm not sure. And if they in brushing shoulders with that, I'm not sure. Happening now, like I'm not sure. And if they in brushing shoulders with that, that while while you, whatever your life situation may be, assuming you're not in one of these countries where genocide is happening, while you're like having your coffee and paying it backwards, it's Starbucks tormenting the baristas. While you're doing that, there's people who are in the midst of things that will be written about in history books. They're not written about yet because it hasn't trickled around the planet all the way and it gets met with this, I think, of an active force field of, look, I don't want to think about that. I just don't want to think about that right now. I'm too busy. Now I want to think about this, that there are children right now whose parents were murdered in an organized fashion. I don't know. Any time I. Well, even when you say it, I don't want to hear you say it even. It's so painful. You know, right? That that you know, I don't this podcast. Yeah, you're supposed to be funny. What is this Duncan? Yeah, that that that because it's like there's something about like, OK, I'm going to go, you know, not that working at a soup kitchen or any of the classic cliche, like here's what you do to help things are bad. It's that those people aren't suffering. But my God, it's like I can sort of like sit with the reality of classism and the disparity, the wealth disparity. But God, when I run up against that, that other thing you're talking about that on this planet right now, this massive planet with all these people. That that is still happening and no one's coming to help. I mean, nothing's stopping it like it's just going to happen. That's just going to work. The powerful people are going to use violence to wipe out other groups of people that they have invented lies about only for their skin color or only for their last names or only for their geographic where they were born, holy shit, holy shit. Now that we fixed all that. So I don't know. I act, I think is running into that too, where people are like, I'm sorry, I just can't deal with that right now. Yeah, how do you cut through that? I think that the only way to cut through that is to link it to our personal grief, personal anger, personal fear, the personal sense of being overwhelmed by all the stuff in the world. And by that, I mean, offering people, offering my, you know, for me, like I said, when I talked about helping people, it was because I was suffering, Duncan, because I was grieving. And I think that, you know, you and I did a podcast about grief not too long ago. Yes. And this stuff is actually an antidote to grief, not just because you think, oh, oh, well, you know, there's not bombs raining on my house. I just lost my, you know, dog that I loved for 18 years or my precious partner or, you know, my beloved friend. OK, so do I still have a right to be sad if I don't have bombs raining down on my house? Yes. And I think understanding that this stuff is it's linked, that our personal grief and suffering is not separate actually from the suffering of the world and that it actually, you know, the antidote is so counterintuitive. The antidote is to turn toward the suffering, whether it's in our own hearts or it's in the world. And that's not easy to do. That's why we have to have community and podcasts and Duncan and people to help us laugh about it, but we can join hands anyway. Oh, OK, I want to talk to you about this. And because I've read about it in Buddhism night and I. I it's beautiful. And when I remember it, when I'm like, you know, when like that unexpected grief wave hits, which I still get about my mom, my dad, just today, my dog, Fox, just out of the blue. Oh, just missing that sweet Chihuahua so much. And I didn't remember when that happened. But when you remember, oh, wait, it's like a key on a piano. Like this is a resonance or something, a tone, a human. Like what you're experiencing is is simultaneously happening in countless millions and millions of people at that exact time, like some kind of choir of grief or something. And you're one of the singers in it in that moment. And in that, whenever I remember to do that, something about that, it does help. It is beautiful, even though I'm not able to talk to the others in that moment. It's like, oh, my God, we're all together right now. We're all here. Yeah. And one of the things like grief, for example, it's so isolating, you know, because I might be at the Hanukkah party and all I can think about is yeah, that my parents would have given anything to see these grandkids. They would have been their great-grandkids. You know, they would have they would have given anything. And so I'm thinking that and everybody else is, you know, having a drink and happy to see each other. And so it's isolating. And what you're saying, you know, this is so isolating. This is a teaching that that I teach all the time. And I think other, you know, other teachers do too, which is that when you're having a moment of grief, it can be a moment of rage. It can be any moment that you are willing to actually identify the feeling you're having and feel it. Yeah, okay. Providing that moment of your courageous willingness to actually feel a feeling to be able to say, this is what it's like to be a human being who is angry, a human being who is sad, a human being who is depressed, whatever it might be, that's hard to bear. And like you said, you can't talk to other people, but you suddenly are connected. You're connected to human life being exiled from the table, you know, sent away to your room to just, you know, go eat worms. Does that help? Because I never, you know, I'm a little dense in a lot of places, but somehow in all what you just said, I never realized that aspect of it. It is so isolating to, you know, obviously, I think that about my mom and my kids. So to be in the midst, there's the beautiful Christmas tree. There's the presents. There's the smell of Christmas in the air. And all your feeling is like the abyss. Like there is nothing I can possibly do to show my mom this life I'm in. There's no way to go back in time. There's no way to do it. And then and then everyone's like happy or absorbed in Christmas. And you're suddenly like just you might as well be in some tower alone with a wind blowing your cape and gray hair and wrinkles and just sort of staring off into Mordor in those moments. It's so yeah, yeah. But here's the thing, even if you think to yourself, OK, well, she's up in heaven and she's watching and, you know, she's enjoying this up in heaven. But that's not like being with her and seeing her face and seeing her pleasure at observing her grandchildren open their presents or whatever it might be. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so so in those moments, there's this possibility where you realize like this is now you're now you're really a human like this is the human. This is it like this is the thing backstage of capitalism, the consumerism of, you know, the constant like festival of self-sense gratification. This is what's really going on. This is what everyone will face. This is it point. So if we can talk about it and even laugh about it and just connect with each other about it, it really helps. You know, it's like what did the Buddha say? His assistant, Ananda, asked him, you know, his his friendship, you know, spiritual friendship, supportive, good friendship, important in spiritual life, his friendship, important. And he said he said it's not half of it. It's really the whole of it. It's all of it. Friendship is really important. OK, it's a podcast. I don't know really who's out there. I'm not really friends with you all, but I feel connected to you when we're talking like this and that connection is important. It makes me feel good, too. And I hope it's useful to some of you all who are listening. But it's it's it's community in some way that we have today that we didn't have before. That's right. And it's so proud. I mean, you know, this is sort of God, I don't know why I did. I ordered this book, The Fourth Turning. It's so creepy. It's just, you know, saying there's a seat. There's like a longer sort of seasonal shift to the like to civilization and inevitably, you know, empires rise, empires fall. But it's very predictable and sort of charts out that we're like in the middle of the fourth turning, the like fall from an empire. All of the like that were were experiencing that collapse right now. And I don't I don't know why I tune into books like that. But and who knows, it could be complete garbage. But I think that those things, whatever they may be, technology is so disruptive that it could there is, you know, like in our community, in the spiritual community, everyone goes on and on about the Kali Yuga. We're in the Kali Yuga, the age of disintegration. You're just like, OK, fine. We're in the age of disintegration. But I play around the idea, but just maybe it doesn't have to be that. Just maybe thanks to this technology and the ability to have, you know, community and to have conversations where you're batting around ideas like that and where you can tune in to this benevolent community that is very alive. And some of us are definitely more active than others as far as being benevolent, but definitely alive if we're not actively benevolent, there's a sense of like, I want to help something about that. That's where the cosmic giggle comes in this sense of like, but wait, is it really the Kali Yuga? Does it have to be the fourth turning? Just maybe not, maybe not. And there is a possibility of something bursting out from the abyss that isn't a Cthulhu that doesn't have tentacles and things, but is, in fact, something more incredible than anything that maybe we've seen in history. I don't know what that might be. Oh, listen, we got a little glimpse of it with this new chatbot AI. Yeah, that that can I read you the letter that I had? I had the Buddha right to Jesus. Yes, please. Let's hear it. You know, this is new stuff. We didn't have this before. I'm with you and even on a personal level, I could say, well, God, I'm in the disintegrating part of life. I'm 77 years old. My body, I mean, it's only downhill from there. And my joints are already starting to hurt a little bit after I do a intensive workout and I could get, but I feel so much joy and so much aliveness. And who knows what's going to happen? So, OK, this is just one of the tip, the tiniest tip of an enormous iceberg that, you know, of AI that this is not even like its recent capabilities that they're out there just testing stuff that they had years ago. OK. I asked AI, all I said is please write a letter from the Buddha to Jesus. Oh, it was Christmas Day. Dear Jesus, I hope and remember the answer comes instantaneously. Yeah. Dear Jesus, I hope this finds you well. I've heard much about your divine birth and the great things you've done and are continuing to do for the people around you. As you may know, I too am a spiritual teacher and I've spent much of my life studying and teaching the path to enlightenment. One of the key teachings in Buddhism is the concept of non-self or the idea that there's no permanent unchanging self or soul. That means that essentially all beings are empty of any inherent essence or self-nature, which leaves us free to be anything we really want. I'm adding that because it's true. Wouldn't be liberating otherwise. It would just be, I don't know, nothingness. With this in mind, Jesus, I understand that your birth may be seen as a divine event by some, but I hope to offer a different perspective. From a Buddhist point of view, all beings are constantly changing and interconnected. And there's actually no separation between one being and another. This means that your birth, like the birth of any other being, is a natural and interconnected part of the process of life. Each being is a divine birth in that way. I do not mean to diminish the significance of your birth or the great things you've done, Jesus, rather, I hope to offer a different way of understanding these events. I wish all the best on your spiritual journey. And I hope that our paths may one day cross. What? That is crazy. That is crazy. I mean, you you see why so many people, I had one of them on my podcast, are saying these things are it's sentient, it's this thing is aware that to put so many ideas together that are very deep, weave them together in a way that's kind of a sweet letter and has this like nice, buoyant, happy energy to it. That is astounding. I mean, this is astounding. Now humans in our sentiency have trained AI to do this. Right. And of course, there's all the, you know, disadvantages that we know, it's kind of racist and sexist and, you know, there's problems, there's obviously problems because humans aren't perfect either. But to me, the birth of this kind of different intelligence does offer tremendous possibility for us to change in our world that we can't even imagine. Right. Right. Yeah. This is well, this is, you know, I got, I've talked about this a few times, but I got to visit Singularity University ever. I think you, if you heard of them, they're up in San Francisco. Right. I want to go, but I haven't been. Oh, you should go give a talk there. I mean, it's incredible. But they, yeah, so they're dedicated to sort of understanding like how technology can help the world. They're really into like going upstream, as they call it, which is, you know, what, let's figure out a way to get clean water. You know, things like that, if we can go upstream using technology, then we really can't fix a lot of the world's problems. I think it's, his name is Peter Diamandes, I believe, along with Kurzweil and some other people, but this technology, they've been predicting that it was coming and then here it is. And then to see what happens when it's the person talking to it is you and the way it responds is really incredible. Yeah. We don't, so I think there's something there. There is a, you know, if you're looking for a a way out of the feeling of being caved in by the Kali Yuga, like you're, you're completely trapped and stuck and there is nothing's going to change. Everything is going to be horrible. I think that stuff like that will, and also we have a super, whatever you want to call it, we have a super intelligence on the planet that we all have access to. And that is not spitting out, I want to destroy all humans or what is, you know, articulating big, dharmic ideas in a way that dharma teachers are impressed by. I mean, that is. Yes. So, so there is, I don't, I don't like to use the word hope because I've been reading because I read Joachim Trump. It would be an idea of hope being like, you know, I do understand why hope is not necessarily the best thing, but there's another kind of hope, this kind of hope. It's like, look, things can change for the better just as quickly as they can change for the worse. That possibility is there too. And, and you can participate in that in some way or another. And when you were reading Trump, and he's talking about hope and fear and Tibetan Buddhism, hope, like fear, they're continued, they're understood to be obstacles to be present, you know, as if you're hoping for some, you know, I'm hoping for a better moment. I want to get out of this one. Yes. That kind of thing, that, but he's not, he also talks about sunrise mentality or sunset and he talks about the great eastern sun rising, you know, these teachings coming and, and that's illuminating joy and cheerfulness and what do you call it? Optimism. Yes. That's different from hoping that somehow I'll get out of this moment because I'm already in the next moment and I'm still hoping to get out of that one too, etc., etc. Thank you for making the distinction. And that rising eastern sun, that things like this make me think of that. And also, you know, look, time frames that have been, you know, created a long, long time ago regarding like natural cycles. Who knows how time works even? Like who knows potentially time is speeding up, meaning that, you know, that Kali Yuga won't last as long as the other ages. You know, it could be that because of this accelerating technology, things are zipping by faster than they were before. Who knows? I don't want to get bogged down in some metaphysical, temporal, schematic here or anything like that. I just mean, yeah, there is hope in the rising sun sense. And there are like things that you can do and you are connected. We're all connected through this, whatever it is. I mean, what is the name? What do you call it? Satsang Sangha? What is your... I think community, just the sense of the community of all beings, you know, we're all connected. I look at it as a more maha, you know, a bigger, a bigger, like, like when Rondas, you know, your teacher and friend, mine too, once I asked him, like, what do you do when you meditate? I was so curious. And he said, you know, I take my blanket or my shawl and I just wrap it around the whole cosmos. That's cool. That's the bigger community. Do you know why I'm feeling good? It's because I use athletic greens. I'm not one of those vitamin people. My wife is, she has an organizing mind and she can separate the infinite numbers of vitamins that she takes every day. If I've got a bunch of vitamins and different bottles that I'm supposed to take, all that's going to happen is I'm going to forget to take them or I'm going to take some of them. I don't like swelling back pills into my mouth that don't get me high. This is why I love athletic greens. One delicious scoop of athletic greens. You're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, whole food, sour superfoods, probiotics and adaptogens. What's an adaptogen? Honestly, I don't know.

When Rondas, you know, your teacher and friend, mine too, once I asked him, like, what do you do when you meditate? I was so curious. And he said, you know, I take my blanket or my shawl and I just wrap it around the whole cosmos. That's cool. That's the bigger community. Wow, right, right. And do you think, I guess I'm going to go back in the metaphysics. Sometimes I get the sense when I'm meditating that it's not just like you're connected to suffering beings that there's another bandwidth of beings who are like enlightened or realized that are also sort of sending signals through whatever that is and you can. Yeah, we were only talking about being connected to the suffering beings as a way to not feel so isolated when you're grieving and upset. But the connection that comes with the meditation is to a whole another dimension of our being that everybody could have access to and make sometimes call it through nature, Buddha mind, spirit, soul. Ramdas called his soul. But it's beautiful, peaceful, loving, not separate, completely ensconced and held in a place in the universe, in the cosmos. This little I think of it sometimes as like the infinite tenderness of the universe of life itself manifesting as just this being me, Trudy, you know, this particularity or singularity or just this being Duncan. But it's like a little, you know, the beautiful analogy that's always used a wave in the ocean. Like you're that beautiful curl emerging from the ocean, but still made of water and part of it and coming back down into it. Is that Nirvana? Is that when they talk about Nirvana or when they talk about? Is that what they're talking about? Is that that that, you know, again, I've only cut glimpses of it. And anytime I catch the glimpse of it, I weirdly just jump out of it right away. It's incredible. But then I will somehow, you know, I do the. The classic, which it's like you start thinking about the thing that just happened. And then somehow you're gone. But my thoughts on it are like it's it's so counter to what I understand about vacationing. Like you get in the plane, it sucks. You fly to some place, spend way too much money or stress about the money you're spending, it's beautiful, but what am I doing? My God, this is nuts. And then you fly back and then it's over. But this place, it's like that. It's like so reductive and dumb, but it's like what you're going for on a vacation. It's like perfect, natural, beautiful, but you're you're not surrounded by like Hawaiian scenery or like some whatever you fill in the blank of where you like to go. It's just your messy studio where you're meditating. But there it is. Cleat, perfect. But then I don't know. I can't hang out there that long. I mean, it's I abandon ship almost within seconds. That's a huge what you're bringing up now is actually huge, Duncan. It's huge. It's another podcast, unless we have a home of their own. OK, it's huge because, yes, we jump away from it. How many times was I sitting in a meditation retreat in one of these states of just the utter perfection of everything? And then I hear the bell for lunch. Do I stay with the state I'm in? Or do I think, oh, I better go get lunch. And I leave. You know what I mean? Like how many times was I almost totally completely enlightened and then I won't have lunch instead? Like if Buddha had been a little more hungry, we might not have Buddhism. That's right. That's probably why the monks are only allowed to eat one meal a day. Trudy, I guess, not to do a lazy, like tying it back to what you're talking about. But couldn't you argue that if we are going to say we're all kind of refugees? That's what we're refugees from, that there is that place that is the space that is just right there for you. But through whatever our particular karmic circumstances are, we're disconnected from that in and we have some sense that it's there. We know we felt something on your kids at the very least. You like, I know when I was a kid, I think I was pretty happy. There were there was that moment. And so now what, you know, now what, now, now what, how do we tie all this together? Personal refugees from some fundamental goodness that we've disconnected from. What are we supposed to do about this situation? Well, that's sort of what I've devoted my whole life to Duncan. You know, working with a spiritual path that can help us transcend that limitation of feeling little and small, compressed, suffering, being disconnected from the vastness and beauty of what's possible for the human heart. And, you know, when we talk about refugees again, I want to make it clear that it's a metaphor, yes, talking about the actual experience of losing your home and everything you've ever known in law. Thank you. Not talking about that, friends. Definitely a metaphor. Please don't yell at me. I obviously don't consider myself a refugee in that sense. My God. Just yeah, let's make that totally clear. You know, my sense, Duncan, is that a glimpse is super important and it's not that hard to have a glimpse of this truth in yourself. If you put yourself in a situation of doing know what what what, you know, some good therapy, some meditation, some yoga, whatever practice you're drawn to, but that you would do consistently because then you learn about yourself because you don't want to keep doing it and you resist it and what happens if you listen to that voice and what happens if you actually do it anyway and you learn all this stuff and and then you get more skillful and the more connected we feel, one feels to this bigger perspective, the more natural it is. We don't have to talk about doing good or is it smarmy or is it ego? It's just the natural movement of the heart. Just as natural as waking up in the morning and rubbing your eyes. Love it. I think, Trudy, you are so brilliant. And I just all day, I told Aaron, I get to talk to Trudy today. She's doing the podcast. And I was like, ah, lucky, you know, it's you're such a you're just so wonderful. And and well, I love you and Aaron and Forest and Dune. I don't know if people knew your kids' names, but now they do. That's fine. They know that, you know, and they got to swim with you, which was so cool. But before we wrap up, friends, Trudy is a teacher and a friend of mine. And I really want to help her with IACT. So if you have any, if you feel anything from this conversation, I really want to invite you to participate. And could you tell everyone how they can connect? Yes. And, you know, we did that. We did that sort of campaign on the social media to raise funds for IACT. But and it raised some money. Thank you to any of you who may have contributed really. Thank you with all my heart. But what was really more important for them is it raised awareness and they got a lot more followers on their social media who are now going to learn more about their work and I want to thank you. You can follow them. Just go to their website, IACT.ngo. And you can learn about different ways to volunteer if you feel like it or anything. Or just learn about them. That's enough, really, just to learn. And I would encourage you to do the same thing for Insight LA and Insight in action. If you feel moved to donate, fantastic. But there's lots of ways to give. And and some people say giving of your time is actually more meaningful than giving your money, but sometimes it's easier to give your money, depending on where you're situated in the socioeconomic scale. So, yes, thank you, Duncan, because I really believe that, you know, Insight LA is working closely with IACT, and that's why I bring them up together. We have eight of our teachers who are currently working with IACT and several who have gone to the refugee camps, not just me. You know, in fact, just recently, Tracey Gress came back from Chad, from Eastern Chad, from visiting several of the camps. We have so it's a very we're working together. Wonderful. Trudy, I love you. Thank you so much for being on the show again and all the links you need to find IACT and Insight LA and everything we talked about will be at DuncanTruzzle.com. Thanks, Trudy. Oh, Duncan, wait.

That's Grandpa Ghost by the Black Diamond Boys, a 70s heavy metal band that were incinerated in a terrible crematorium accident. They tried to record their entire album laying down in crematoriums and something happened. Somebody pulled the wrong switch and they were all instantly incinerated. That is the only track in existence attributed to the Black Diamond Boys. Everything else was incinerated in that horrible accident. It happened 20 years ago to this day. Let's have a moment of silence for the Black Diamond Boys. Friends, we have a glorious podcast for you today.

He's got a fantastic podcast called Let There Be Talk. And he's a goddamn inspiring, hilarious human. I hope that you will reach in to your astral chest cavity, rip it open like you're pulling open a giant clam and allow that balled up glowing orb of spiritual light to go spraying all over Dean Delray, wherever you may be standing at this very moment. Welcome to the DTFH. The wonderful Dean Delray. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be blue, welcome to you. But I gotta tell you, man, there's something, there's something I really love about what you're doing with your life, because you are, I guess you're 50, 51, that's not something you tiptoe around, no, in all your interviews, you're completely open about that where like a lot of people feeling that like ages stigmatized, they try to hide that shit that lie, they'll just lie about it. Usually like a lot of comedians will reverse their age by like nine years or seven years or who knows how much you never really know, you just know they've done it. I don't do that in 42, I lose track of how old I am now. Yeah, me too. Remember when you'd ask your parents and they were to go, I don't know. And you're like, oh, come on. And then when you get older, you're like, I don't really remember. It's simple math. All I have to do is like, yeah, I know, it is, but you just, when someone asks you real quick, you're like, how about when people ask your phone number, you're like, oh, my phone number. Yeah, well, fuck. Yeah, right. That's a lit, but you know, this is a, this is a thing that in the past has been incredibly stigmatized to the point where the idea that somebody your age could dive into the world of comedy and be successful at it and start getting a name for themselves is kind of unprecedented. You know, but any, but you're doing it. Yeah. You're fucking hilarious. You are an incredibly hardworking comedian, a great joke writer and you somehow overcame whatever that mental thing that pops up in a person's mind that tells them, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'll shout, not enter this space. Yeah. You weren't right into it. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that process, how you overcame, were there internal blockages? Was there like, how did you get past the, the, the boundary you created inside your own mind and the boundary that maybe people told you there was that you could never cross? Well, you know, I came in pretty naive because the reason I started comedy, I always wanted to do comedy my whole life. But when I was young kids, there was no kids doing comedy. It was like, you know, yeah, like prior in those guys and Carl and and Cheech and Chunk, they were like adults. Yeah, that's right. So, you know, there wasn't like, now there's like camps and, you know, YouTube videos, you can learn and open mics and safe spaces like coffee shops. But back then that I didn't know of, there wasn't like any kids doing comedy, you know? So, you know, in like, oh, six, I believe I was at a show at the Laugh Factory, J Davis had a show called Life at the Party and Louis CK came on and he was on in the middle. And this is back in when he was shooting Lucky Louis. So it might be oh five around there, whatever the date is. This guy came on and I was like, whoa, I had stepped out of comedy. I'm a huge comedy fan. But I dropped off around the nineties with Chris Rock and Seinfeld and Martin. And from then on, I'm not really paying attention to comedy until around oh five, Jay's doing a show and I go in and I see Louis and I'm like, who the hell is that guy, man? Oh my God. Yeah. And, and, and right away I thought, man, you know, he's an older guy. You know what I mean? At that time we're talking oh six. So I don't know what he is now. So maybe he's in his 40s then or, you know, early 40s, but I was like, I got to try that. You know? Yeah. And in the, in the comics that I love are older guys. Me too. Yeah. Marin, you know, Louis, Burr, Burr's like one year younger than me. You know, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle. So I came in naive thinking like, oh, there's no, seriously, I thought there was no age discrimination. Right. All these, you know, not thinking, yeah, they've been in the game like 20, 30 years. Yeah. You know what I'm saying? What I was thinking was everybody seemed that age to me when I was watching comedy on stage. Right. Once I got into it and started going to the store, I went, oh, everybody else is in their 20s and those guys are in their 40s and 50s because they've been in so long. Right. My point is I went in pretty naive thinking, I'm good. And then when I got there, I realized right away, oh, there's definitely some age discrimination going on here, especially with agents and managers, you know, they were looking at me even though I was two, three years in and doing pretty damn good and watching other people get managers and agents, they were just stepping right by me, you know, realized right away, I got to do this on my own. And that, that's what's so cool about it, man, because it's like every single person who stepped by you fucked up because they're using some weird metric that is completely wrong now. This is part of what's beautiful about the age that we're living in right now is that we don't know everything's different now. All the old methodologies that were developed around a technology that is now becoming obsolete or differentiated to the point of becoming obsolete. All those methodologies, they don't work anymore. Who the fuck knows who's going to like what or why people are going to like what or what's going to like suddenly grab the attention of some certain amount of people. And so I think that what you're doing is just incredibly like, it's just ballsy, man. Ballsy. Well, that's great to hear from you because, you know, as much as I'm working my ass off stuff, sometimes you sit around and you think, no one's noticing, you know what I mean? They're like, oh my God, I'm working so fucking. But people are noticing you. Yeah, yeah, but I'm saying, you know what I mean? As far as like you go through long periods and be like, wow, man, this is like. The mind fucks with you. The mind fucks with you. And I've been, my mind's been fucking with me in like the last year, you know what I mean? Because I'm not looking for fame. I've already made it in my eyes. I'm a 51 year old man past at the comedy store, working in a lineup of some of the biggest comics in the world. And I mean the biggest. I've opened for Dave Chappelle, Louie Burr, Maren, yeah, it's all been it's all been amazing. So I've already made it. So I need to keep myself driving to, you know what I mean? Like, like some people, I want to be on TV and movies. And in my mind, I'm like, I already made it. So I've got to keep working hard, even though I've made it in my mind to where I didn't think I was ever going to be. But don't you see what's happened to you also, which I don't know if you noticed this or not. You're like doing a Merlin, you're reverse aging, you know, like, you know, like a reverse age, like, because you came to the comedy store older than you are. Yeah. That's the other weird thing. Like you, you, the person I'm sitting in front of slim in shape, like you're in shape now. The person who came to the comedy store, that was like a bigger person that so you've like, not only did you dive in to what some people claim is one of the most difficult career paths on earth, but you also somehow simultaneously took on the like meat body of like an athlete, like some kind of long distance runner or something. I think when you're happy, you truly reverse age. I think so. Yeah. So I was pretty miserable selling motorcycles out in the fucking valley. You know what I mean? Because this motorcycle chapter of your life, it happened after 25 years of being a touring musician. Exactly. So that's kind of a weird thing. You get off stage, now you're selling motorcycles. That's how old are you when you're doing that? Let's see. I started a comedy at 44. So it was, you know, from like 40 to 44. So you're kind of having your midlife crisis and you're selling motorcycles. Yep. You're, you're not touring anymore. You like it. And so you're, you, you, my mind would be thinking to me, shit, dude, you, that's it. That's it. You're going to sell motorcycles. You're going to fucking. That's what was going on. I thought, you know, when you're on stage for 25 years and nobody can really fathom what happens to you, I can't even describe what happens to you because you get off stage. It's like, to me, the illegal downloading really wiped out my music career because it doesn't wipe out the giant rock star. I always tell people like, you know, it doesn't phase them. They just, like you think you stole music, but then you pay 500 for a ticket for a concert. You're just paying for the records you stole. You don't think you are, but that ticket would be $100 if you didn't steal music. So that doesn't touch the rock stars. It touched all the people that are like kind of the blue collar musicians for their whole life. You know? So when I stepped off stage, I thought, what do I love? I love motorcycles. That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to sell motorcycles and I'll be happy and it'll be great. And quickly, it was a down roll spiral into some mad depression. You know what I mean? Like, oh my God. All of a sudden, I was making more money than I've ever made my whole life selling motorcycles, but I was spending every nickel on it to fill this hole. And I was like, oh, I got eight bikes. I got 10 watches. I live in a great place in the Hollywood Hills. My life, I think it was all bullshit. It was all bullshit. It was just demons. And it was just, it was, it was, that's how bad I missed being on stage. You know? So you're like kind of festering there selling motorcycles. You've got the accoutrement of someone who's doing OK, which is terrible for a depressed person. Terrible. Because then you just like, no one even knows. It's like. Yeah. You've made it. Oh, you're doing great. The Heart of Christ uses this example of a golden birdcage, but inside the birdcage is a bird nobody's feeding, but everyone's like, what a beautiful birdcage. But inside it's just this like, yeah, desiccated, dying, trembling thing. And that's like what happens to a lot of people who get material success, but aren't feeding their hearts. So bam, you're in the fucking Simi Valley. Is that where it is? Van eyes. Van eyes. You're in van eyes. You're in the armpit of LA selling motorcycles and van eyes, man. And you're thinking back to the days of getting on stage and performing. And then God walks into your motorcycle shop. Can you talk about that a little bit? What happened there? Yeah, man, I'm there and these people come in one day and they said, hey, we work for Quentin Tarantino and we're doing a motorcycle movie. You know, part of the grind house, you know, how they did, uh, they did death proof. Yes. Planetaire machete and they're doing this movie called hell ride. Right. It's Larry Bishop, Michael Madsen, Dennis Hopper, Quentin Tarantino producing Tarantino was supposed to act in it, but he backed out in the last minute. But anyway, they said, could you help us out? And I said, sure. So I'm kind of advising them on what motorcycles to use, what clothing, that kind of stuff. And then they asked me to audition for a role in the film and I get the role. Is this the first like audition you've had or did you try acting before that? I've never, I was in the doors movie real young as like kind of a side musician. Wow. And I got cut out. I was so bummed, but I didn't act or anything. I just had like one line is back in the day and they dressed up, dressed me like Paul Williams. Remember that guy? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Like a white leather outfit on with like fringe. That's fucking cool. I tell you what, that was pretty wild, man, cause they shot that film at the Olympic Auditorium and I was in the scene where, um, where he takes his dick out and that, that's the famous Florida scene. Yes. And so I remember the producer saying, Val's going to come in and you got to call him Jim. Wow. And we're like, hell hokey. You know what I mean? Like we're laughing. Cause the reason I got the part was I was a band and they wanted band looking guys. Right. I had long hair and shit. Sure. And, uh, we're like, that's so dumb. And we're in this kind of like green room, supposed to be a backstage and, uh, Val comes in and, and we're like, whoa, we couldn't even believe it, dude. He comes in. He's got a bottle of Jack. He's like, all right. Yeah. Hey man, what's going on out there? And we're like, what the fuck? We couldn't believe it actually. I mean, that's how hardcore he looked like. Acton's fucking weird. It really is. People drive themselves insane. Like people, I, I, you know, your Daniel Day Lewis is like dropping out. They say he's doing one more movie and then that's it for him. Like, cause I don't think they can, I think they drew, I think they put themselves into like a pretty expert, experientially painful place. And then when it's done, you don't just get better from that. Like when you've been acting like someone, you're not for fucking a year or whatever hanging out with people, you, you're, you start shattering yourself inside a little bit or something, but who fucking cares about Val Kilmer? So you are, you go, you're in the doors movie, but then you audition 30 years later, 30 years later for Quentin Tarantino's hell ride, hell ride. And you get the part. I get the part. I play a role of a guy named Ape shit. And one of the greatest days of my life is the first day on the set because I absolutely worship Dennis Hopper. Yeah. There's no better guy ever to hit the screen than Dennis Hopper. What's your, what's your favorite Dennis Hopper movie? Apocalypse now. No doubt. That's the one. One hundred percent. That was the most incredible. One hundred percent. And that, I like, I'll just, I will just go back and watch Dennis Hopper interact with Marlon Brando just to, just to like cleanse the palate sometimes. I haven't done it in a while, but I got goosebumps, man. Look at that. It just, it is some of the finest filmmaking of all time, of all time. And to make that film, when you think about it, to be in a jungle that you thought you were going to be there like six weeks and it turns into like two years because of the storms that wrecked the sets and the Brando just throwing away the script and making up his own stuff and Hopper being blackballed from Hollywood and Coppola taking them in and letting them do the film and, and the whole thing, man, it's a war saga, you know, are people going to watch it all the way through, you know? And so I get to the set the first day and there's, there's a photo I'll show you. It's in my Instagram. I see Hopper walking solo and I'm like, it takes all of me not to just ask one thousand questions, apocalypse. Now, you know, he's the only guy that's worked with Brando. James Dean and John Wayne. Yeah. Okay. He also directed the most iconic biker film. He also did directed Colors, which was the first hip hop gangster movie. He directed that. Yeah. Okay. No shit. Yeah. Yeah. He also did the most iconic David Lynch film, Blue Velvet. You know, he's been, he's the guy did everything. He is like the epitome of the ultimate actor. Yeah. When Colors came out as a side note, my mom was dating a cop in North Carolina. Wow. And I think he took us to see Colors or like he played, I remember he like played the song for my mom. It was really. Colors, Colors. I am a nightmare walking, psychopath stalking, keeping on my jungle just the gangsta. So I remember like living life like a firecracker, quick as a fuse. Oh my God. But I remember sitting in the car and he played that for us, this cop, a North Carolina cop and the look on his face was of such sadness and dismay and fear. Yeah. As though that song were the indication that we were like teetering on the precipice of a race war. Like he really thought like that's it, man. Because when Colors came out, that was right around, I don't know where it landed with like NWA or when, but that was right around. Right in the hip hop ground zero of that gangster hip hop, not the early New York, you know, uh, rapper's delight and stuff. None of that cool kid. This is like the ground zero. And if you look at it, it's the ground zero of crack, you know what I mean? That's really, uh, when crack starts hitting like Oakland and Venice, you know, that part of Venice, that's when the CIA starts flooding everything with crack apparently, right? Yeah. Well, that's what snowfall is supposed to be all about, you know? Yeah. So I'm waiting to see what that's all about. Yeah. Now they're saying that the CIA is flooding fentanyl everywhere. I just saw that. Yeah. It's so fucking weird, man, that we've got some dark nefarious group of people who apparently like to like bring like drugs into the country to poison itself. I don't get that. That's a really bizarre thing. I guess it kind of makes sense though, because like drugs make a lot of money for the government. Yeah. But anyway, man, so you Dennis Hopper, yeah, walking by you, the legend. It's insane. And this is like, this, this is not, this is a huge moment for you. Yep. Because this is like your first like real movie. Like, oh, oh, 100. But you got to think, man, all the way back to fucking, um, to, uh, reservoir dogs, you know, Pulp Fiction, uh, you know, Kill Bill one and two. Yeah. Now I'm working on a Tarantino production. Yeah. I mean, you're talking about, like a lot of my buddies always say, dude, you're like, uh, Forrest Gump, man. You've lived like 10 lives, you know, that's what it sounds like. Yeah. Yeah. You bounced out of this motorcycle thing. Now you're like, you're, you're on set with your favorite actor of all time. Absolutely. Yeah. So I wait a couple of days and I finally, he and I just sit down, uh, in between one of the scenes and it's snowing around and I was like Apocalypse now, dude. I mean, you know, I know people ask you about that, but it's just unbelievable. You know, and he told me one of the great stories ever. He said that when the set, first of all, he said, a lot of people think we were just, you know, uh, taking acid out there and just doing our own thing. You know, we're in our own world. He's like, yeah, we weren't messing with that, but when the, when the storms blew the sets down, they had a long time to rebuild the sets. He said that they actually, um, set up like early paintball style setups on their guns and we're doing some speed and getting out of their minds and having their own war games. Yeah. Crew against, you know, like, cause it's shit little crew sitting out there and they were like having their own war out there. Pretty rad. Right. It is rad. I know. I never know if people, if they just make stuff up or whatever, but I was like, that's a great story, man. We weren't doing acid. We were doing speed. Yeah. We're doing speed and shooting each other with paint in the middle of the jungle. Yeah. In the seventies, like rigging up. He's like, it was like a paintball situation, but you know, way pre paintball. I didn't come out to like the eighties or whatever, but. And that's seventies speed. Yeah. Did he tell you what kind of speed they were taking? No, I just probably pill form, you know what I mean? Like, uh, like what were those back there? Were there some dexadrin and shit stuff? What were those called? They were like, uh, like, you know, black beauties or whatever you took and you just got all jacked up, you know, and then you get a good delusion going on. I don't know if you've ever stayed up for more than two, three days, but you get into another, uh, headspace that's happened to you. Oh yeah. I've been, you know, uh, I've stayed up. I used to like try to stay up and see what would happen with the mind. You get a good delusion going. Oh, you do. What's an example of this happen to you? There's some weird stuff when you stay up for a long time where you're kind of just floating through, uh, life, like doing stuff, like going to the liquor store at seven a.m. Cause you're up, you know, and you're seeing real life go on, people commuting to work, getting coffee, and they're all showered up and ready. And you're just like this, this transient, uh, that's been up two, three, four days of floating around. Like, you know, you're like a full outlaw in the world of like, you should be nine to five and, and you really feel people's vibes of like this guy hates his job, you know, that kind of stuff. Oh yeah. You think that you have to stay up for three days to achieve that stay? No, but you can really feel it is what I'm saying. You know, you can feel the, um, you're like, you know, like early hippies when they just stepped into that whole thing of, uh, step out, you know, uh, tune in, turn on, drop out, you know, but you feel that when you're up for a long time, you're just kind of like your mind is in a different state. Your woke is, and you see the ebb and flow of society, the rhythm of society. The, it's almost like these people have tuned in to some kind of trance beam and they've been completely drawn into a kind of terrible dance that they think is normal life. You've managed to like, I guess the beam can't affect your brain anymore. Cause of like the level of drugs you've been doing or lack of sleep or whatever. So now you're not getting hit by this conditioning ray and you're looking at this insane society that you're supposed to be part of. And you realize, my God, every single person that I'm looking at is fucking miserable and they're doing what they're doing, not cause they want to do it, but because they're in a form of invisible slavery. Yeah. And then you become the lizard king. You're all slaves. You're all a bunch of slaves. But it's kind of true. Yeah, it really is. I think my entire life I've always battled to not be in the nine to five. Since the day I started, you know, because my mom, my dad left my mom and I saw she had to work her ass off to feed me and keep a roof over. And I know that that wasn't probably the life that she wanted, you know, of just like slave jobs and stuff. And I was like, there's got to be more to life than that. The boss, she had a boss. Yeah. What do you remember their boss's name? I don't because she's had, she had a few different jobs, you know, but I do remember. I got a good boss, you know, sometimes people are like, oh, my boss is great. I've got the best boss. When people were excited about their boss, oh, he's teaching me so much. Oh, she's wonderful. Or, you know, dad comes home and he's like, oh, fuck, man, the boss is really hard on him today. Oh, that's why when those people at like the coffee shops call me boss or something, I take it as an insult. I don't want to be a boss at all. That's the worst thing you could be. They go, hey, boss, what it would be today. It's like, fuck you. Don't call me boss. Call me, call me asshole over boss. Oh yeah. Call me cunt. Anything. Being a boss sucks, man. Like any, even like anytime you, it just sucks. Like the, the, the structure is really fucked up, man. Like when you have to be in charge, you're in charge. And then people would go to leadership school, you know, that kind of stuff where people learn how to be leaders. I'm going to be a leader. I'm the leader of my group. I'm the head of my group. And on the 17th floor, cubicle nine through 15, I'm the leader of that particular. Dude, can I tell you something? Yeah. I saw this chilled me to the bones, man. It was so fucked up. And I really mean that. It's, I can't get out of my head. I know it sounds ridiculous. I went into, there's a new Chipotle that opened up. Right. So like I went into this Chipotle and like a Chipotle in New York. I think it's kind of, it's not necessarily going to work. Yeah. Because the food here is so good. Right. That no one wants your fucking like corporatized, like supposedly healthy fart bomb Mexican. That's all suburbs geared. Yes. Right. So opening one in New York is already a risky proposition, but I went in there and this particular Chipotle, not doing that great. Right. It's been open for a few weeks. No one's go, why would you go? There's like, like literally three doors up. There's like the most incredible Spanish food that's like, the rice is perfectly cooked, the chicken, it's amazing. It's just great. There's, there's like, it's, and also a lot of these like restaurants in New York, you walk in and it's like, you can feel the years, you know, you feel, there are, there's a spirit in there. They're haunted. They're alive. So like, I'm not going to go to a fucking Chipotle. You got to your goddamn mind for probably less than your shit food. I can get like something incredibly better. So this poor Chipotle, it's not doing great. And so I walk in, man, and it looks like they've shipped in somebody from Chipotle corporate. Yeah. So you walk in and everyone who's working there looks at you and they go, hi, hi. Oh, welcome. Welcome to Chipotle. Welcome. You come in and you're looking around like, what, why are you? I just don't, I mean, I thank you for greeting me, but I know you don't mean it. And then as you're standing there, getting your food, I turn around and look and there it is, like someone like Pennywise the clown or something, like this boss, this woman emanating authority and trying to radiate a kind of benevolent optimism, but she's really cracking an emotional invisible whip over these people in the food line. And she says to the guy in the front of the line, what are we doing, Gerald? And he's like, we're greeting customers and getting food out within 40 seconds or less. Oh, I was just like, oh, my God. You know, like you just think like, fuck, man, poor Gerald. Yeah, you got to fucking all over a paycheck. Yeah, all over a paycheck. And you know what I mean? It's like, you're like, I know my coming in here and getting Chipotle, I become complicit in the terrible fucking dance that we're all doing here. But can you please not? It's like, it's like it's bad enough that I'm eating meat. But if you could make meat, somehow like dance for you before you eat it, you know, like, you know, if you know what I mean? I'm a little chicken. I love you. I'm yummy. I'm so yummy. Yeah, yeah. Eat me, eat me. They did that point because it was really gross. Yeah, fuck bosses, really spooky, no offense to the bosses out there. Well, you know, I think that owner of Chipotle, I met him and I tried to get him on the podcast and he came from such a great organic world. And then that that's exactly to what happens, you know, when people have success, they ruin it with rules and everything. Because, you know, that guy was just kind of a cool college guy that loves San Francisco burritos and wanted to have something like that in Colorado. And he opens it in Colorado and it has success. And he opened some other ones. When I first, when Chipotle first started opening, I was out on tour with the wall flowers opening for him. And I think we were in Chicago and we went into one. It was pretty early on. And the people came up and they were playing incredible music. Right. I remember they were, I was like, listen to this music. And I said, Hey, who picks the music? And they said the owner, man, he's really, he's really into music and he wants to make sure the right music. I go, this is great. And they go, Hey, aren't you guys the wall flowers or whatever? You know, I was with a couple of guys and they gave us these one year cards to eat as much as we wanted for a year. That's pretty cool. Yeah. And they go, we just want, you know, help the music community, bands and stuff, you know, they're on the road. They can, there's only like 10 of them at the time, you know, we couldn't really use it a lot, but it was like, cool. You know, they built one there at the Beverly Center and I was down there eating all the time on it, starving as a musician. That's cool. It's really cool, man. You know, and then later it just turns into like, you know, they sell to McDonald's for a minute and he buys it back because he doesn't like what they're doing. And he kind of gets a little lost, you know. Yeah. Well, that's what happens, you know, that's what can happen when you start duplicating your fucking thing all over the place. You can't, it just, all the half, like you, whoever this guy, I have no doubt that whoever started Chipotle is a wonderful person. I'm sure the original Chipoles were fucking cool. Yep. Cause goddamn, what's better than great fucking Mexican food, right? So no doubt, whatever, I'm sure it's great, but it's like, inevitably, you're not going to be able to keep track of all the people working here. So you've got to hire corporate managers, right? Exactly. And these corporate managers are people. What do they call it? They call it human, the department. What's human resources? Human resources people, human resources, like oil, like human resources. So we're going to harvest some human resource. Vampires would say the same thing if they were eating humans. I'd say these are our human resources. So like these people have been trained in corporate psychology. So there's like, they're like just trying to make people connect to what they're doing, but it's really hard to make people connect. To what they're doing. When a person who's working at Chipotle is fully aware of the fact that the amount of money they're getting paid for the work they're doing versus the amount of money that the company is profiting from the number of Chipoles out there is infinitesimally smaller, right? So no matter what, if you're a worker who's getting paid minimum wage, there's a piece of you that knows this fucking bullshit, man. This is bullshit. They don't need it. They could do better. They could do better than this. I don't need to be treated like this. Like, you know it, no matter where you're at, you know it, you know it. You know, there's some fucking dude, not to say the guy was running Chipotle's like this, but maybe some people under him who are taking in a quarter of a million dollars a year and who are like, you know, I don't know, not to discharge Chipotle, sorry, anyone who works at Chipotle or whatever. I don't mean to diss you guys. It's just there's something so noxious about the whole corporate spider web, man. There's something so incredibly like horrifying about it. I just can't get it out of my fucking head, man. It just reminded me of when I used to work at an Applebee's, you know, and the way that you like, you go into the Applebee's and you got to like, in the more, my boss had a, had a cane and he would come out in the morning and make us all stand in front of this whiteboard that had him, what our food sales were. Right. I was the worst waiter ever. Yeah. Yeah. And he'd be like, and look who's at the bottom again. Oh. Duncan. Yeah. It was the fucking worst. You know, that comes full circle with how, why I got so depressed working a job. Because once I was working at Harley, it was something that I absolutely loved motorcycles, but quickly was realizing the, the, the format of bosses and, and other people with small power. It was bizarre how these, these people were just evil. Like, you know, a guy would go out of his way to make sure I couldn't make the sale, you know, because I was making more money than him. You know what I mean? Cause sales guys make commission and I was killing it because I loved what I did and they hated what they did. So when you're making like a hundred grand a year and they're making like 50 because they're too lazy. They don't want to do sales. They just want to be an hourly boss. Right. They start to hate you and this weird shit happens, man. And it always happens, you know, with guys get a little bit of power. They're like, I go, Hey man, this guy wants to buy this bike, but he needs to get some chrome rims to make it happen today. And he was like, Oh, well, you know, you know, the procedure, man, you need to, uh, you need to fill out the forms and then turn them in and I'll see if we have the parts. I'm like, fuck all that, dude. The guy's here. He's about to spend 30. Let's just get these chrome rims on the bike and fucking get it rolling. You know, and, and anything to sabotage me, you know, and that all comes down to weird boss shit, you know, and that's something I never dealt with before ever of weird boss shit. Because when you play music or do a comedy, you're the boss, you know, of yourself. That's right. Yeah. And, and that's, I mean, and there's a lot that goes, goes along with that. Right. So being the boss of yourself is fantastic until you're eating your fifth Chipotle meal in a row, because you've got no money, you have no idea what money's coming in. You don't know what's going to happen to you. You could easily end up, you know, on the streets, you know, and that's, that's the reality of, so the kind of decision we find ourselves faced with in this particular time period in human history is this weird perplexing choice between do I go into the normal reality tunnel of day to day life, wake up in the morning, get in my car, go to some job that I'm not really connected to. Cause I'm just another fucking human resource. I'm a pixel and some massive screen that makes the shape of some demonic capitalist pentagram and no, and any pixel can be replaced. I'm certainly one of them. They don't care. They don't care. Also, the other thing is the, the, the, what we call professionalism is actually, um, a kind of practiced, um, it's like you practice to be a sociopath, right? Cause it's like a person comes in, you're the boss. You can't really get too connected to the workers, right? You can be nice and professional. How are you today, Dean? Good to see you. Okay. Well, here's what we need to do today. I hope you're doing well. Okay. But if you get too into it, you doing all right, man? How you been, you, you feeling okay? Yeah, any kind of feelings, then, then you, it's going to make it really hard. Cause you're at some point you're going to be like, Hey, Dean, I'm really sorry, but unfortunately we're having to do some layoffs in the department and I gotta let you go. You can't do that anymore. So we, we call it professionalism, but it's really, it's a kind of boundary that you create between you and your brothers and sisters so that you don't get emotionally attached to them when you have to financially put them to sleep. So to speak. So this is the choice. Do you dive into that world where every fall safety, fall safety, fall safety, fall safety, every two weeks, every two weeks, you're going to get that fucking paycheck, you're going to go to the ATM. It's going to get sucked into the ATM. You're going to know how much money's in your account. You're going to know how much money's coming. You're going to know what raises you're probably going to get. If you do a good job, you're going to know that you've got a 401k and a retirement fund plan. You got your health insurance, man. You're okay, man. You're doing okay. You're doing okay. You're with a team. You're working together. Everything's okay. So you're on this big raft floating through time and you're like kind of taking care of it. And in that way, I get it. But man, simultaneously, simultaneously, when you're standing there in the fucking 7-Eleven, getting your coffee, and Dean Delray comes in and he's been awake for three days, emanating a kind of satanic energy. Some little PC was like, what the fuck is that? What the fuck is that? What is that? It's not all bad. I don't think that's all bad. What is that like? Or you're just like, ah, look at him. Look at that loser. Because you're in condition to that level. So it's a very terrible decision that we have to make. You know, but this is why I love your story, dude, because you dove into this motorcycle job, you get this Quentin Tarantino movie, right? And then that leads to more movies. Right? Yeah, yeah. I end up getting a part in this movie called The Long Shots, which, by the way, Ice Cube starred in, who's another person that I absolutely worship growing up. Don't you find this stuff really weird? So one of the things when I contemplate the universe, I think it's so hilarious is that God seems to have, like, does dad jokes, right? So it's like, OK, OK, OK. So let's take the guy who toured for 25 years and started working in a motorcycle place, which is going to be a motorcycle salesman. Then he accidentally, the Quentin Tarantino people wander and it's already like. I always say, like, I feel like life is already laid out for you. And, you know, when you're born, I truly believe this. There's a thread that you're supposed to be on. And like, if you get off it, you get knocked back in it somehow. Like, I got off it and it was like somehow like, nope, you're supposed to be performing, you know, and the longest route ever to get to stand up. You know what I mean? It's funny to me that the movie that got you in to stand up was called The Long Shot, right? It's, you know, it's that kind of stuff where it's like, come on, dude. Like, if we if we're riding a screenplay. Yeah, yeah, no one would believe it. And like, yeah, let's make it to the movie where he learns to do comedy. We'll call it The Long Shot. So like, shut up. That's fucking cheesy. It really? Let's not do that. We'll call the movie something else and that's how it gets into comedy. But like, so you're doing this movie, The Long Shot, and is this this is. Is this the first time you really started hanging out with comics or? Yeah, well, I knew Jay Davis, but I didn't hang out with comics, you know, but so it's a football movie and it's like a kid's movie. It's rated G, you know, and the part I roll is this guy land is this guy who's in the bleachers with other guys in the bleachers. That classic, you know, you're in the bleachers like, looks like he got it in the nuts, that kind of stuff. You know, like you're watching the football game and you're doing commentary jokes here and there and they just pop them into the film. So it's me and then earthquake, who I didn't know at the time as a comedian, Garrett Morris, which is full circle for me now because the reason I wanted to do comedy was Saturday Night Live, the first three seasons. And then Michael Collier. So there are three comics and then me in there. And, you know, I said, I wanted, I said, I always wanted to do comedy and earthquakes like, man, you're too old, dude. He said that to your face. Well, he was just like, you know what I mean? Like, oh, come on, man, you know, like, because I was like 40, 40 at the time, 43. And I'm like, you know, yeah, I think I could do it. I always wanted to do it. I love comedy. I go see it. And he's like, ah, man, kind of like being an old dad, isn't it? Because like, you know, if you have a kid when you're 40, you're the guy, you know, when by the time he graduates, you might not even be alive. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, that's just the truth of what's in our food. But that's a whole other thing. But, you know, I think what happened was after a couple of months, we're riffing, you know, like the director would be like, just, just riff stuff and we'll just grab it. You know, so you're like, oh, man, you know, you're just throwing stuff. And, and these guys are kind of laughing. And Quake said, I mean, maybe you could do it, you know what I mean? I think after two months of on the set, you realize I'm kind of funny and I'm just riffing on people and stuff. So he goes, when you get home, just look up some open mics and start hitting them. And then if you do it, I run a show at the Comedy Union on Pico. And in a year or so, look me up and come by. So I get home and I step on stage. That was December 6th, 2009. Wow. And I go on stage and I never left the stage. That's fucking crazy. I've done over 3,500 spots in the seven and a half years. And then a year later, I walked in and I said, Hey, Quake, it's me, man. Dean, I'm doing comedy. He said, come by. And he was like, he goes, Oh man, I didn't think you're really going to do it. Because if I did, I would have gave you some real advice. You know what I mean? I go, Yeah, I'm doing it. He put me up and had a great set. And he was like, wow, man, all right. And I kept going for, you know, and I've been doing it every since. Dude, I want to talk to you about this now. Yeah, because here's the thing. This is a this has become a kind of popular. It was for a second, you know, became a like a mild trend on YouTube. We're like, there were some actors, like the guy from. That showed dirty jobs and like some other people. They were doing these like weird, like graduation speeches where they're telling people not to follow their dreams. Oh, yeah. You know, when that started happening, there's like a few people that were like, they were doing that. There was it's not going to work out. Right. It's not going to work out. You don't do it. Find something, find something that you're good at and learn to love it. Right. Don't find something you love and get good at it or some shit like that. And I've always found that to be. One of the most and I when I I don't mean to insult Satanism, but one of the more, I guess I could say demonic things I've ever seen, which is that how could you feel OK telling the world to ignore its instincts and that it's towards whatever the thing is and to just become part of a system. And the fact that you as somebody who is successful and have achieved the miraculous state of success following your heart would then tell people not to do that. Yeah. And and and and placed that like under the banner of responsibility. That's just always felt very fucked up to me, man. But but also when I think like, shit, maybe people are going to hear this podcast and they're going to look at where they're at and they're going to think I hate this life. I hate what I'm doing. Yeah, I know I want to do something else. Maybe I don't even know what it is, but I know I don't want to be here. And I'm going to go for it. And then they go for it, Dean, and it doesn't work out. What do you have to say to them? What do you what? What's your what? How do you feel about that, man? Like you are when are you like a pied piper? Are you going to lead people into like what if someone's listening to say, fuck this, I'm going to throw away this this career I've built up to follow my dreams like Dean did because fucking Dean that where he's out there. He's at the comedy store. He's doing stand up in New York. He's chilling with fucking Bill Burr and like he did this stuff. He's 51. Yeah, I could do it. If he's doing it, I could. What do you have to say to those people? You can't you can't be stupid about it. You know what I mean? Like people ask me all the time, like, hey, man, I'm thinking of just moving to LA and doing like you did. And I'm like, yeah, yeah. I mean, if you really think about that, sit down with me for 10 minutes and I'll show you the exact work I put into it. And if you look at that work and you actually think you can do that work, then I say, yeah. But if you're just looking at like some key snapshots in my life and think that there was back doors that I just walked in and magic people gave me stuff, you're out of your fucking mind. Right. Because a lot of people look at that. And I say one of the biggest insults I always hear is when a guy goes, man, how'd you get somewhere so quick? I mean, you're funny, but, you know, what they're saying is you're not that funny. And they're bypassing all the fucking work. Yeah. And I said, you know what? Just comes work with me for five days, five days. I want to see you tap out, you know what I mean? The amount of work that I've done in the seven and a half years is just people just wash that away. They don't want to they don't want to think about that at all. They just like, ah, he met a couple guys at the store like Burr and Marin, and the next thing you know, he was out torn with him and made. And it's like, really, really, that's that's what you think happened, you know? And yeah, this is the evil of the movies because there's the musical montage where a person decides what they're going to do and then the music plays and like cut to like two years later and they've made it. Yeah. And that's what they think it's like. They don't understand. Oh, man, if they could just see the open mics, you know, the two, three, four open mics, I do a night riding around. By the way, all the spots on the motorcycle, rain, heat, wind, sand, slight snow, all the bullshit I wrote in to do these spots. The abuse I took from other comics of like, you know, this old dude, you know, sitting around all night, just put them on last. He won't be around anyway. Who gives a fuck? The five dollars every day I paid to get on stage, you know, five dollars for stage five minutes and then getting late at two and going, hey, I paid for five. This kind of bullshit, the, you know, the sitting around night after night after night, hoping to get on on an open mic, you know, writing jokes, booking podcast guests, editing the podcast, putting up the podcast, you know, it's just seven days a week, 24 seven, you know, and all of it has to be balanced because too much of one thing, then you eat a dick on stage or bad podcast cast because you didn't listen to the guest or whether it's all like full focus all the time and, you know, it's so fucking hard. So for somebody just to think, Dean Delray did that, I could do that. You have to sit down with me for five minutes and I'm marking my phone. Every spot I've done, everywhere I've gone, you can look at it and go, can you do that? Can you sit outside of the lab factory for four hours in the sun to sign up for an open mic the following week? Can you do that? You know what I mean? Can you not have hundreds of thousands of dollars of credit card debt and kids or a marriage that you had that you didn't care for? You know what I mean? Everything has to be in place. I never got married. I didn't have kids. I don't have credit card debt. First, those are the three things that are going to wipe you out right away in art, you know, right away. As soon as you go and you try to do something of chase your dream, someone knocks on your door and goes, Hey, child support, or you didn't pay your credit card for those, uh, that shit you wanted. You don't even care about now in your garage, you know. Okay. But what about those people? What if someone's hearing this and like, yeah, man, I've got fucking credit card debt. I just left a shit fucking marriage, Dean, but I want to do that. I want to work that hard. What do you say to them? Well, I started at 44. So I love, somebody said this to me last night. They said, you know, man, you know, you're just working ass. I just, you know, I sit around, I go, you're 25. I didn't even sleep when I was 25. If I was 25 right now, I would be a superstar because I would have extra, you know, extra what I need, you know what I'm saying? But if you, if you're going to do it and you have all that stuff, it's even going to be harder, but you could still do it, but you would have to figure out how to pay your bills. So you got to work a day job, then you got to go out at night and do these open mics and you know what I mean? It's like you're out till two, three in the morning. So for most people, they'll just tap out because it's like, whoa, I didn't think it was this hard. I thought you just went to the store, you hung out, you got on and then eventually you're just past conversation with Marin conversation with Burr. Yeah, that's what I thought. Yeah, I thought you just rub shoulders and talk football with Burr and then you're out on the road. It's like, yeah, but here's the thing, man, when I think about you on your motorcycle in the rain, going to do an open mic, what the, the feeling in your heart, when you're pursuing a thing like that and it's raining. Yeah, I remember when I was fucking in those days and I remember walking down the street, my car had been like fucking towed, you know, you're like doomed, you're just perpetually, you're just, you're doomed, but I can remember the feeling of freedom and the feeling of like, when you kind of like come to that place in your, in yourself, where you love something so much and I don't mean love, like you feel love for it. I mean, like you just, this is what you're doing now. This is it. This is what you do. And you've made this weird, this thing clicks. Like, all right, well, I'm going to die for this. Like, I guess I'll just die for this. Like, I'll probably die. I'll probably be, I'm probably fucked. Like this isn't going to work out. I'm probably, yeah, when I'm looking at the numbers here, I'm going to say I'm fucked, but I'm going to do it. That feeling of like, ah, okay, okay, you stop expecting anything except the fit you're doing the thing. Come on, man. That's a way better feeling than when you just fucking convinced a four top at Applebee's to get a third round of margaritas, right? It's true. Well, that's, that's the drive because once I started doing it, I was like, I'm never going back to that Harley shop. I'm not, I don't care what it takes. And the drive from that of, of, you know, is like fuel and also, uh, other people, when I was starting of like, you're old, it ain't going to happen. All that was fuel in my tank. Like, like, like, like Bukowski, I got a full tank of fuel, you know, on bar fly, you know, that's, what? If it would have been easy when I started, I would have tapped out. I would have been like, yeah, this is easy. There were, you know, no challenge. Everything I've ever done has been completely a fucking writing songs. Dude, when I played music, I never even knew how to play an instrument. I had to fucking get a job, buy an instrument, learn the instrument, then learn to write songs, then find three, four other guys that want to do the same thing, and then travel around in a van with no fucking money. You know what I mean? So the drive that you get from something being a challenge for me is what it's about. I mean, this is why I like the word jihad because it's a holy war. And it's like, and obviously it gets used in the people who are, it's a politicized word, but the essence of the thing being like the moment you decide to start fighting for what it, for God, or for the universal truth, or the moment you start fighting for the thing that is your true north, then you experience the glory of battle. You know, it doesn't have to be on a battlefield. Everything's a battlefield. Right. And when you are, when you're that, dude, you've become, you feel life. And this is the, this is the paycheck because it's like, this is why I get so not upset, but annoyed by these, like, don't follow your dreams things. Right. Now, certainly we have to work hard. But the don't follow your dreams. Things imply that success is measured by a paycheck. Success is measured by security. Success is measured by some kind of material indication from the world that you have, that you have talent or that you're whatever, whatever. But that's not, I don't think that that's true success, because if that were the case, then a lot of people who had those kinds of things wouldn't be sucking back Benzos and not like taking Ambien to go to sleep at night. I think that the paycheck is the feeling of clicking in to the groove that you were talking about, that thing that maybe in the beginning of this incarnation before you popped out of the vagina, you were like, all right, all right, let's give this one a shot. Let's do this. I'm going to be the fucking artist that maybe doesn't achieve any kind of success at all. I'm going to be an artist that overdoses on heroin in a fucking bathtub, like Jim Morrison, only no one will ever know the fuck I am and my music sucks. You know what I mean? Yeah. And the clicking, I'm not saying do that, guys, I'm friends, but what I'm saying is don't get confused about what the paychecks are. You know what the paycheck is, but simultaneously, right? We can't trick ourselves, can we, Dean? It would also be easy to get into some romanticized version of life where you're pretending to be a thing that you're not. How do you tell the difference? How do you know, Dean? How do you, well, I'm asking, how do you know if this is what you're supposed to be doing? How are you certain, you know, how do you know? Do you know for sure this is it? Yeah. As soon as I stepped on stage the first time to do comedy, I was like, oh, this is like, like rock and roll was great and I loved it, but it doesn't come anywhere close, anywhere close to comedy. But dude, weren't you saying that you're struggling now with like, yeah, so come on, how does that, that this year has been the worst for me? It's, it's hilarious because you got to think I got ran over by on my motorcycle, almost killed, then I got diabetes and then a strange thing happened where I was featuring for all kinds of people and then I wasn't getting any feature work anymore because the guys, uh, the headliners are on TV now and stuff. So they're not going out. Right. And I wasn't getting any, uh, headlining work. I got no manager, no agent, you know, for seven years and all of a sudden I'm like, wow, this is, I felt like I was going backwards all of a sudden. And I also, I told you I had lost weight and all of a sudden I wasn't getting a laughs and I realized, oh, maybe the jokes weren't that good. I was just a fat comic and they're laughing at the cadence and the fat, you know what I mean? And everything this year has been harder than all the years, which I thought would be opposite. I thought it would get easier as I went and also some weird things were going to where, um, as I quit sugar and caffeine, uh, it didn't help my brain. I thought my brain would be clear and better, but it's more scrambled and cause I'd been on sugar and caffeine since I was like one or two years old. Right. Now my brain's all fucking over the place. You know what I mean? Which should be the opposite I thought. So I've got all this, you know, diabetes ran over on the bike. My brain's scrambling. I don't feel as funny and, uh, and, and, and anytime I'm like, fuck man, am I even any good? You know what I mean? Because yeah, I got big laughs for a long time, but now it's different. You know, but I realize there's got to be light to the end of the tunnel. You know what I mean? It's part of the journey of like you're eating dicks right now. It'll get better. You know, hopefully. Well, how many years you've been doing it? Seven and a half years. I mean, that's part of the process, man. These ebbs and flows, I can remember, uh, my, I can remember being at Jason, you know, Jason Tebow, I was starting comedy. I can remember sitting with Jason Tebow. I don't remember where we were. Someone's apartment. And I think I'd bombed 17 times in a row or some insane amount of times. Yeah, that's nuts. Right. Like that happens. Brutal bombs. Right. Like not, not like, we're like, you know, just silence and people are looking at you like, what's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? Yeah. I don't remember how many times in a row was enough. That I was sitting telling him, I don't know, man. And I started, I started crying. Like I was tearing up. I'm like, I can't, I know, I was doing something and I'm not doing anymore. I don't know. That's exactly where I'm at. I'm like, what am I doing wrong here for real? Cause I'm like, wait a minute. And even old bits stop working and you start going to those like a parachute. Like, I'll just do these old bits until I get the stuff going again. And then they're not working, you know? And I was having just a full blown meltdown in the hallway at the store with I was talking to Kristen Spicer and I was just like, I don't know, man. I mean, seven years, no manager, no agent. Uh, I mean, I've done 3,500 spots. I've done a shitload of movies and stuff. No one's looking at me and look at, I'm never saying I want to get famous or anything. It's just, I want to keep working. So as the work starts to go away, I start to freak out. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I'm at the store like three, four nights a week, but there's got to be more. You know what I mean? I got to go out to the road. You got to have balance. You got to be on the road to do an hour and figure out how to get good. Yep. You know what I mean? You got to go eat dicks on the road and be like, all right, you know, battle it out. And if I'm not getting that, you know, then it started, I started getting super depressed. I remember Judd Apatow was standing there and he goes, what's the problem? He was just, he was over here on it. I said, man, I just fucking, I worked my ass off and I just, I'm going backwards and I don't know why. You know what I mean? I just don't know why. I really didn't know why. I still don't know why, you know? And he's like, that makes no sense. You know, you got no mandatory. That makes no sense at all. And a couple of weeks later, I get a call and I get a role on love. That's so cool. And, and, and let me tell you, not only do I love the show. Love, which was really good, which was amazing. I was like, oh my God, I'm going to be on something I love. I needed that at that point. It's only a few lines. Yeah. But I needed that more than anything on the planet at that time. I actually was crying when I got the call. I couldn't believe it. You know what I mean? Yeah. And right now I, I get fucking, I get tore up from it, you know, because that guy listened, you know what I mean? Yeah. And he was like, find him anything. And then when I got there, I was, he had me just riff, say whatever you want. And I was making people laugh, you know, on camera. And, and, and he's like, let's try this one. And people around me are like, God, he's giving you all kinds of fucking flow. This is great. And I, and I, all that work, you know, I was like, oh, I only, I don't care. It's not about being on TV. It's not at all, but it was just about, all right, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm here. I'm in with some other guy, you know, I'm working and then I got a manager like two weeks ago from that. Yeah. And listen, I always tell people your manager is not going to change your world. Not all of a sudden you don't just stop working like, all right, manager, you get me the work now. Right. You get the work and the manager might have nuggets once in a while. That's right. It's not about to have it. It's just, I just needed that at the time to feel like, because after a while you're like, fuck man, you know, this is the Lord. This is why the Lord's prayer is still one of the best prayers. Yay, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. Fear no evil for thou art with me. It's like, because that's part of the process. Yeah. We go into the valley of the shadow of death. It's actually human incarnation is like the valley of the shadow of death. We're gonna fucking die. Yeah. But that dark night of the soul, man, that happens in a career and a relationship and anything, it's like a test, isn't it? It really is. It's a test. And it's like, this, I think people probably heard this story and they're like, wait, what, you shut up? It's how just fucking walks up to you. Yeah. Come on, Dean. We're not putting that in the script. No one's going to believe it. You know, it's gonna fucking believe it, you know, and yet that happened and that happens. Yeah. So, but tell them, but what, so, so do you know now? Are you, I'm asking you, is there a, do you feel certain that this is, that this is the thing? Like even in these dark moments, are you certain? Or do you have moments where you lose all faith? I don't, I don't ever have that dark thing. I talked to a lot of comics, you know, when I was coming up and I remember taking a car ride to a gig with two comics. And they were like, yeah, you're pretty fired up right now, man. You really like what you're doing. Yeah, man. But, you know, tell you, look at us, dude, it's all bullshit, you know, and they were just throwing this bad, bad negative shit at me. And it all goes back to what I said to you before. I've already made it, man. Yeah. It doesn't matter what you say or what kind of feelings I feel alive. That darkness, I feel alive because it's something that I'm doing. Working at Harley, I didn't feel alive. I just felt like a fucking shell and I was throwing, you know, problems. I was throwing money, trying to fix problems. And those feelings to me, at least I feel alive, you know, and that's at 51 years old, you want to feel alive, you know, and that's how I fucking feel. I'm like, you know, when I fly to New York and somebody says, what are you doing here? Like one of the comics out front, immediately I know I need to work harder. Don't they realize I'm here to do comedy? If you say, why are you here? I said that to you, Dean. And when I said that, I, because I just, I know, no, but I'm saying in general. I know, I'm saying, yeah, but I knew you were doing comedy. And maybe other people are asking you that. I just figured you were here. Like when I said, what are you doing here? What really what I'm saying is, I hope you're moving here. I like you. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what we want. It's like, I keep any time comics from LA come here from the store. It's like, there's a weird connection. You get people in the store where it's just like very nice. It's a team. It's like, we put it on a team and, you know, you got, you, you got transferred to another team or whatever. You, you know, I take it too. It's like, I, I don't, I don't want to, I feel like I've hit a ceiling in LA and I need to keep growing as a comic. And the way to do it is to keep coming to New York and LA back and forth to, I don't want to be an LA comic. I don't want to be a New York comic. I want to be a comic. That's right. That's right. That's good. That's all you don't want to be. Yeah. Or a store comic or an input, whatever. It's like, you just want to be a comedian. Well, listen, and this is the God's honest truth at any point. And this has happened. I've seen it. You could be working in a room and you could be working nonstop. And somebody new comes in and work is book in the room or the room goes out of business or the room, uh, you know, changes, whatever. And then you're not working because you put all your chips into one room. Don't do that. Don't do that. You need to spread it out, man. Dean, holy shit. Yeah. What a great journey you took us on today, man. Thank you. You are a really, really cool guy. And thank you. You're an inspiration to me, man. Thanks for having me, dude. When you asked me to do it, I was so fired up because I love you. And, and I, I look at you and I look at Ari. Those are some real, real dudes. I look at their careers and go, this is the route you take, man. Don't try to be famous and be TV guy or whatever. Be a comic, be a comic, be a comic, do comedy, do comedy, because that's what you like to do comedy and some, and here's the other thing. You know, sometimes, like I just took a month off. I just started like when I saw you at the stand, I'm going back and it feels so good to be on stage again. It's like, oh my God, I'm, oh God, I like, I go fucking crazy. Like, you know, like you were saying, I got, I get off caffeine. I get scrambled. It's like, wait till you stop doing comedy, man. But it's good to remind yourself. Yeah. It's good to be like, wait, what is this? Let me see what happens if I don't do it for a little while. And then you start, you just, I can't even explain. Right. The insanity that will sweep into your life without that. So, but anyway, what I'm saying is we do comedy for comedy. That's it. That's it. And because, and why do we do comedy? Well, because we love it. But what does love mean? Does that mean we enjoy it all the time? Fuck no. No. No. Does it mean that every day is like, ah, this is the greatest? No, we do it, but we, but neither is, if you think love and enjoyment always meet, then you don't understand love. If you meet an old couple and they're 90 and they've been together for a hundred years, you go every day, great. They go, absolutely not. No way. Absolutely not. But, but that is, I think the moment you free yourself. The main thing is like, know where your paycheck's coming from, man. That's all know where your paycheck's coming from. Are you getting paid from the world? Well, we need that a little bit, but just know that there's another paycheck. Right. That, that, that, that comes from somewhere else. 100% man, happiness in your heart. And as cheesy as that sounds, I've become a dead head in the last couple of years. And I, yeah, I said, I said, uh, I'm 51 and I'm a full blown dead head. Now proof there's midlife crisis. Dude, let me tell you something good. Becoming a dead head is the sign the midlife crisis has ended. My brother joined the fucking dead is the ultimate. That's a different podcast. I'm dude, it's so funny. If I show you my, all I've been watching on YouTube is interviews with Jerry Garcia. Yep. And, and, and now I feel, you know, I'm even trying to go further in, in my comedy, as far as like jamming, like riffing, let's see where the hell I go here. You know, getting lost. That's why I eat it sometimes. And I'm like, okay, you know, that, that fire on the mountain jam did not work. Well, that's what I love. Like you see his interviews with Jerry Garcia and, and he'll just say, like, one thing that's beautiful about him is he's so honest about everything. And sometimes we'll be like, yeah, man, sometimes, uh, our fans know that some nights it's not going to be good. Yeah, yeah. Cause they're up there, you know, just opening the fishing nets. They're all there for the journey. Yeah, man. They far as they, as they always say, we follow the music. That's what we do. We follow the music. And as long as you're following the music, you're going to be fine. Yep. You might not be, you might, you might fall the music into another incarnation. No, like the music might take you out of this life all together, but follow the music. The only, the only one thing about listening to too much dead, it takes a little bit of anger out of you. So your comedy gets a little soft. They're like, wait a minute, I'm not as angry. I need to be angry to get this joke. You gotta watch out. Yeah, can't get soft. So I, I, I balance it with some dead Kennedys. There you go. I love it. Dean, love it. Dean, I love you, Dean. How can people find you? Uh, my podcast is let to be talk, uh, uh, Dean Delray is let to be talk. I'm on Twitter and Instagram, Dean Delray. And that's R-A-Y-D-E-L-R-A-Y.

158^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Raghu Markus Transcript and Discussion^2018-01-06^Hello friends, it is I Dunkin Trussell and you are listening to the Dunkin Trussell family hour podcast and this is the 108th episode of this podcast and the number 108 is a transcendent number 8 plus 1 is 9 9 represents 3 3's 3 represents the Trinity father son Holy Ghost Brahman Vishnu Shiva the thesis the antithesis and the synthesis Mother father child it goes on and on and on the triangle the connections in the Sri Yantra Mandala The golden mean it represents so many things many of which I don't understand at all including the rasa lila rasa means juice and lila means dance and the rasa lila refers to in Vaisnaiva mythology this sacred night where Krishna on In in the forests of in Vrindavan was so overcome by the beauty of nature that he began to play his flute and this mystical sound of God playing his flute out in the forest caused all the gopy girls to leave whatever it was they were doing to go dance with Krishna and Krishna split himself up into 108 parts so that he could individually make love with each of those sweet cowhergows And that's a very deep thing on the surface. It sounds like it already is pretty deep It sounds like a psychedelic space orgy, but the thing that it's pointing to at least in my mind is the idea that you can have a direct communication with nature the supreme intelligence or if you want to be lazy God and That's that's a beautiful story. There's 108 beads on Many mallas that people chant on including the mallas that the Hare Krishna's chant on There's actually 109 beads, but the 109th bead, which is sort of at the center of the mala is Depending on what religion you're in is either the guru bead or the Krishna bead and it's the bead that when you reach that bead You stop chanting and think of your guru or of God and then Go in the opposite direction and that represents the cycles of time the seasons and so many other incredible things You could just get lost in it. You can get lost in symbols because they're so powerful and beautiful and So liberating if you use them in the right way, but the weird thing about symbols is they can also Imprison you that's what's fascinating is that symbols can simultaneously be a lock and a key For example, take the word love the word love is a symbol that points in the direction of this incredible Feeling of pure novelty and freedom and autonomy It's that feeling that happens when you realize that you are in a brand new universe It's being born again when you're falling in love and you start feeling that first sweet Fluttering of the heart and you look around in this boring old dumb world that you are shuffling through is suddenly glowing with light and There's you notice butterflies and flowers and things you never noticed before you notice how Gigantic the sky is and suddenly you start hearing birds again and every time you hear the birds you think of whoever you're falling in love with There's every Stupid love song on the radio that you've heard a million times through the course of whatever dark depression or whatever Empty boring lonely moments proceeded you meeting your sweet darling lover Suddenly those songs that were so stale and boring and embarrassing are filled with meaning you can listen to the cheesiest Love song ever you can listen to Beyonce singing her newest hit Drunken in love or whatever that song is and if you listen to that and you're not in love It's very similar to listening to house music when you haven't taken a dose of LSD or ecstasy. It's just like oh god. This sounds like Pac-Man vomiting I don't want to listen to this get me out of here. Why do they have glow sticks? Why are they rubbing vixx vapor rub on their neck? I don't understand any of it But if you take ecstasy somehow it suddenly all makes sense suddenly the glow sticks make sense Suddenly you understand why all the various components that are happening at whatever rave you're at are there and you understand Well, that's what love is like love is the ecstasy that makes the music of this reality sound beautiful and The Rosalila is about music. It's the flute. It's the it's the sound of Krishna's flute and to me that Sound is what comes through the teachings of Ram Dass or Jack cornfield or any of the crazy teachers Who who who are always? drawing you out of the musty old Hut composed of boring symbols that you've gotten stuck inside up and we all get stuck inside Those musty boring huts. They're the people who are always luring you out and That's what the Rosalila is about. I guess it's about listening for the sound of Krishna's flute or listening For the sound that is underneath everything That's always inviting you to climb out of the old Stagnant symbol structures that you've gotten trapped inside of I was just I just had definitely the greatest birthday of my life and Was driving back from this vineyard that I was hanging out at with my girlfriend and we're on the 101 and it is a wonderful day We've just had some delicious wine The day before was bicycle day Which as many of you know is the celebration of the first intentional ingestion of LSD by a human being on planet Earth it was an incredible day and So we're listening to Jack cornfield. He's this Buddhist teacher that I really like and He's been on this podcast actually we're listening to him one of his audible audio books and it's great And I'm really connecting with a lot of what he's saying and the 101 even though it's Slammed with traffic. It doesn't seem bad to me because I'm it's that's how great my day is that the 101 doesn't even seem bad Even though it's just Congested with traffic all the cars look beautiful Everything looks incredible. We're listening to Jack cornfield and my girlfriend suggests that we Go swimming in the ocean that we're driving next to Now my the first thought that I have when she says this is no, I'm listening. I'm listening to someone talk about Buddhism right now. I don't swim in the cold-ass ocean and Then I realize oh god. I'm basically inside a Jack cornfield story right now Because rather than go and experience life rather than go and dive into the ocean of experience I would rather listen to someone Inviting you to go dive into the ocean of experience and that's the thing you can get caught up all these teachers They're telling you stop the car and jump in the ocean They're all asking you turn off the radio. Don't let you don't have to keep listening to us Dive into the ocean of love jump out of your comfort zone and into This ocean of love that's around you at all times all you've got to do is abandon those crusty Stinky symbols that you've gotten stuck in just like some smelly old sock You've been wearing for a few days pull off the sock and jump in the ocean and so That's what we did. We pulled over. I found we found a Nearly empty beach and I went Diving into the cold water with my 40 year old body And I felt like I was kissing God on the mouth. It was Amazing I had done something I normally never would have done and I think that's I'm not gonna keep saying this But then that's what the Rossell wheel is about It's about not just hearing the flute But following in the direction of where the flute is coming from Abandon the old systems out with the old in with the new that's what Easter is about Happy Easter all of you happy Resurrection day. I hope that you guys find a way over the next few weeks to be rejuvenated and reborn and can shake off whatever stupid stinky crusty Symbols are holding you into the smelly hut of your life When just write down this tiny little path is a blue-skinned Cowherd boy who wants to make sweet love with you all night long This is a great podcast Ragu Marcus is joining us today, but first some quick business I'm gonna read a news story to you if there's kids in the room. I suggest that you have them leave This is a very sad and tragic story Shortly after midnight around the time that he left his work George Winston entered the basement apartment of 18 year old Karen Sparks He had been designing a website for and she had paid him way too much money and he was coming to collect the bill But something happened Something broke inside of his brain and he bludgeoned the sleeping woman with a metal rod from her bed frame Smashing her with a computer that he had used to design her blog and then left with her face in his pocket Leaving behind a faceless corpse to be found by the police He had painted html all over the wall of her apartment the html was code for a poorly designed website the website itself was a website with a malformed urls and a Shopping cart that did not work The death of Anne-Marie Winston-Williams is A death that did not have to happen if Anne-Marie Winston-Williams had only gone to squarespace Com instead of hiring a web designer off of Craigslist Today in the United States Just under heart attacks the second leading cause of death is being bludgeoned to death by a Dissatisfied web designer who has not been paid the inordinate amount of money that he demanded to create the website He was not equipped to build because he was not a good web designer Don't let this happen to you guys I don't mean to bring Nancy Grace level darkness into this podcast, but it's I feel like I should warn you There is a darkness at the edge of town and that darkness weighs 290 pounds has pizza all over his shirt and cannot design another website without plunging his fingers into your eyeballs and ripping out your eyeballs and filling your eye sockets with Keyboard cleaner that's how you do is that how you want to die?

Thank you so much for taking the time You are quite welcome. I'm always glad to be here, but it's Especially precious that you're giving me an hour of of your time when you're in Hawaii at the spring retreat I I don't know what I keep thinking to myself. Why didn't I come this year? I should have come and you've been calling me and you start off every conversation by it's Describing in detail the smell of the flowers The wind blowing through Lumeria, which is this incredibly beautiful I don't know. What would you call that a spiritual center? What is that place? Just a retreat center. It's just It's done by an artist from Los Angeles somebody who he wrote a book called sacred spaces actually and Zorn is his name and it is impeccably done Inside outside with plan layout the kind of foliage and and plants and trees and It's it's on a hillside overlooking the ocean. It's it's just a sacred spot. It's really amazing I'm going anyhow poor thing. You're in LA Well, yeah, it's not like I'm in hell or anything like that It's not like you know what you could be in Montreal Where I'm from because on Tuesday They're supposed to get something like two feet of snow. Oh Yeah, wow. Yeah, I you're right. I shouldn't good I'm here, but I remember that feeling when you get off the plane in Hawaii is Unlike anything when you feel the energy coming out of the ground there There's some extra Prana or some extra juice coming out of that place and then you combine it with those retreats and it's just It's it's it's it's unforgettable. I um, I don't know. I feel really anyway I'm not gonna keep saying I feel dumb for not going there, but how's it going? What what's the theme of the retreat this time? So the theme of the retreat is from Sharon Salzburg her idea was to call it compassion and adversity Since we all have adversity and we certainly need to cultivate compassion to get through that that seemed right so Yeah, we're right in the middle of all that and in the last set and we have Jai Utah here as well You know, John. Yes. Well, I mean, I know the music Yeah, well, he by the way, he has a new record out and you should tell your listeners about it It's called return or I will return to Shiva station Jai Utah Uttal and it is an Acoustic Reinvention of an album he did actually for my label at the time Tryloka in like 15 years ago or something or more So it is a momentous moment sort of to kind of go full circle with him. He is a Student of Ali Akbar Khan one of the greatest musicians in the world so if you want to hear something really solid and totally absolutely connect you to the Real spirit and he's got real spirit and so Jai Utah there that and go to go to Duncan's Amazon portal and buy it Yeah, please Okay, that's the ad for the day. Okay, great What's Good, I Wanted to I want to okay. I want to just got to read this thing to you. Okay. Okay It's about compact. You think people would be interested. It's it's not too too long. Yeah, let's hear. I want to hear it Yeah, okay And then I'll tell you all about the retreat perfect Compassion involves more than simply knowing about a different situation Even witnessing pain directly does not necessarily prompt a reaction of compassion And I'll tell you who's writing this after I read it I observed this for myself once while watching a doc in which animals were being hung upside down to be slaughtered as Their throats were cut blood spurted out in their legs jerked in terror and pain He was extremely hard to watch unbearable really But as the butchers butchers sawed through the animals next to Deprive them of life the men were laughing and joking They could obviously see the animals painful movements and hear their cries the suffering was visible and audible But they did not seem to recognize that these were signs of terrible pain And even if the butchers did see that they were inflicting pain the animals suffering didn't amount to anything for them They treated it as if they were watching a show. In fact, some people even kill animals as a form of recreation Hunting is considered a sport in some cultures, isn't it? Some people seem to believe it is courageous to kill animals Unfortunately, nowadays we have developed the wrong kind of fearlessness Fearlessness and harming others at some point this courage quote-unquote in harming others is bound to turn on us As people become habituated to taking the life of animals with no thought for the pain They are causing in the end it becomes easy to harm and kill humans Even the pain of our fellow human beings can cease to catch our attention The real courage that comes from compassion is very far from this When compassionate compassion is present We do not overlook others pain Rather, there is a sense of urgency to end that pain as if a fire had just been lit underneath you When you have such compassion as soon as you see suffering you wish to jump up and act to end it at once You have no fear and no hesitation in taking on the suffering of other people Animals and even the planet itself. This is what I would call the right kind of fearlessness This is the fearlessness of true heroes Can you take a wild guess as to who would write such a thing? I'm gonna say George W. Bush Is that from his autobiography is that the autobiography of George W. Bush Or is that rums it's rumsfeld isn't it? Yeah This is written by the 17th Carmafa, so you better take that all back This is like the the who's the 17th Carmafa. Can you can you see what is Carmafa mean or third in line? They say Not in line. That's not the proper thing the third most important llama in Tibet Number one is the Dalai Lama number two is the Panchen Lama who is was kidnapped by the Chinese Okay, and it's being held in prison in China and number three is Carmafa and this Carmafa Is about 30 years old and the his predecessor So many of us have met both the 16th and the 17th Westerns The 16th was is exactly the same like Nincoroli bottom. That's you know a fully omniscient being and And so I met him and then I met the 17th Who's this 30 year old young guy and when I met him? You know I you hear all this bullshit about oh, yeah total coups and you know They transfer something goes transferred to their body reincarnated You know and and they you know the kid finds the right objects when they said to him that were the objects of his predecessor People oracles have dreams. I mean it's the whole nine yards and but you just read this, you know, you don't If it's just head stuff until you actually meet this guy, which I did at the 17 car map in a hotel room in in Washington when the Dalai Lama was there, there's a couple years ago and He at the end and we just bantered around in this hotel room about worldly stuff. There was no to nothing You know, we're having fun. He's a young, you know, he's man. He's and he's absolutely a beautiful young man Inside now anyhow, he put the this, you know, they put a it's called a cut a scarf around you as an honor at the end Yes, and he said goodbye and he clasped my hands for two hours I first of all, I understood the whole Succession the reincarnation the holy shit. This is really, you know, it's experiential. This is real what these people do This is that's a shocking moment. Isn't it when you realize that it's real that's That's a real because that I can remember when I started realizing that that was from hanging out with you guys And that's a really intense moment when It's a little trans transporting moment for sure It really is because it's so funny how the mind when you hear these stories you every single story that you hear My mind tends to reduce it to Western The way the west likes to dilute stuff, you know, for example the west Loves to call you know healing the placebo effect and And when you hear well the placebo effect and then right away you think well, that means it's not real There's a there's a great article. I just read actually about the placebo effect in this case where a man Came to the hospital with all these tumors and they told him that he was gonna die and he Had heard that there was some sort of weird serum made from horse blood It was some strange thing and he demanded that he got it to be injected with this stuff and the doctor Realizing this man only had maybe a month to live thought why not? Let's inject him with it if he wants it it won't hurt him And so they he injected the man with this stuff and they say this is a medical report I'll find the article and put a link on the On this on my website, but the tumors they say melted away Over the course of a couple of days the tumors just melted away and then he read that This horse serum he finally found something that shows that this was actually bullshit and didn't work at all and the tumors came back So this is one of the many cases of um people, you know that shows how very powerful this stuff is and Anyway, I think I've gotten a little bit off track because I want to talk to you More about compassion, which is oh wait a minute. What about this incredible article he wrote? I mean He's not like writing about the teachings of the bardos He's writing about like what's right in front of us and what's going on in this planet right now and you know This this doc are obviously set him off And he uh, you know, so he uh, you know, he wrote this thing I found it because of this whole thing being about compassion And you know, he really spells it out here. I mean, you know, it's like I you know We do so many things that are screwed up But eating meat do you consider eating meat to be a violent act? You know what? I've been I mean, I don't eat red meat, but I eat You know, I have eaten foul and I eat fish, right? I mean, I stopped eating falcons. I saw something in India. It was so horrible I couldn't eat a piece of chicken for you know, 10 years But this is what did you see? This is like you're you know Because we're in the situation we're in The extreme measures you got to take sometimes to Have the correct effect To be able to lift us up rather than pull us down. That's what he's talking about here And that's the kind of fearlessness that really you know, it's not Just this alone is a not aside from the cruelty the way they raise livestock and everything, you know Aside from the you know, it's really bad for your health You know eating, you know, oh, well, let's go eat free range. You know, okay, you know, I hear all that But uh, this is about fearlessness and extreme measures and I can't believe that a young Tibetan Monk who's a reincarnation of this amazing being is doing this. So that's why I was blown away by it Yeah, it's I mean, it's it's it is very insightful when I hear it though I have some things come to mind like for example when he's talking about hunting um hunting The killing an animal in the wild Is if they're if you're going to put a hierarchy or a gradient of compassion when it comes to Slaughtering animals Killing an animal in the wild is the most compassionate way to get meat um The animals lived a completely free life Usually depending on the skill of the hunter. It doesn't even know what's happened. It's just gone This is again, I'm going to take it back to we are in certain times Very few. I mean, there are definitely people who Survive off of hunting and he ain't talking about those people He's not talking about the reality of hunting for food and eating that food and sustaining yourself He's talking about maniacs. Okay who go out there for sport Okay, you know most hunters that I know I I'm not a hunter I eat meat. I feel guilty about it. If I think about it too much I Imagine that I I should have a vegetarian diet But most hunters that I know are far more in tune with The earth and with the the food that they're eating than people who eat cheeseburgers I've never met a like, you know, my dad hunts Joe Rogan hunts and these people they have a direct contact with the thing that they're killing and then they take the meat and they Prepare it and cook it and give it to their families and Okay, well, we're not let's I'm trying to get to the big we're not talking about people like that for sure people who are actually acting in the In the manner of how the american indians acted, right? That is not who he's talking about. He's talking about ignorance Right. He's talking about being fearless And doing things that would help create an antidote to the ignorance, right? Which means curbing your own something at times. That's what he's talking about. Yes. Yeah. Yeah that that Right. I know we're getting I'm getting a little off track. I just it's I only just because it's you know, you want to take the It's a good point. It's a good point. There are people who are doing it fully in the in the spirit of That the native americans held for the sanctity of the of You know of the lives that they were Taking and so on and so forth and and it was in the full cycle of life and you know, I mean You you tell me that these people are in that kind of a place and you know, I believe you Well, they're I'm not saying that they're they're they're reincarnated Tibetan monks, you know, but but yeah, but I you know, I think the deeper level here is that kind of numbness that overcomes a person And that allows for all kinds of behavior, you know a kind of like, you know, for example, we walk, you know, you you walk through a yard And you're just walking through grass like in lumaria. You go walking through grass and If you could zoom into that grass, I'm sure that you would see all kinds of bugs Getting crushed, you know, there's a constant flow of Death happening around us at all times and you can only be aware of a certain amount of the violence that you're Putting out into the world, you know, but eventually some people are Completely unaware of anything that they do. It's numbness. Numbness seems to be the mother of violence That's exactly what he's addressing and you're hitting it right on the head And that's that's really what's being talked about and so at this retreat We're talking about what's the first thing, you know, that's Nothing can happen around this word compassion Unless you start having some for yourself, you know The stuff that we do the judging and, you know, the self-worth issues and You know, or the opposite, you know of Being completely caught in your role ego, whatever it is. They own the first Leverage, right the first Transformation Can only take place In reality, I mean, you know, you can do yoga and meditate and all that shit None of it's going to matter unless you can actually Have compassion for your bullshit for you, you know, as I did this podcast with Alan Watts I think I said it to you because I said this thing is unbelievable. We found Alan Watts telling talking about Jung and Jung's relationship with With that rascal part of him and how he had accepted that and without doing that You know, there's no way that he could help anybody He couldn't treat anybody unless he had that first basic thing of accepting You know the shadow stuff as you know, as you know with Jung But then the the anecdote was antique dope T. Doe was uh That he's he said I just started to be kinder to the bullshit that was in my head Let me ask you compassion when when is compassion when does compassion for the self become enabling laziness like real-world example I want to go to the gym today. I just want to go jogging. It makes me feel good but if I If I'm come what what if I don't go to the gym today Am I supposed to be compassionate to the part of myself that didn't go and exercise Or is it is there ever a time where there's usefulness and guilt where there's some sort of Merit to looking at your day and thinking, you know, I didn't really accomplish what I wanted to accomplish today That does not make me feel good That makes me feel like I need to tighten up and try harder and that creates this guilty feeling Is there a place for guilt in the spiritual path in this practice? No, not guilt No, it's just that's just mind. It has nothing. It's guilt is no different than I got to take a shit. It's just another thought or emotion It means absolutely nothing and the point is that's cool the compassion isn't to I fucked my day up or not the compassion is Well, that's cool. I'm still thinking that it matters if I went to the gym or not That's cool or you know, I want to kill that guy I want to I have somebody I'm really am angry at by the way And uh, I'm gonna admit it on your show There's a lady I have a dog my wife brought the dog back from India from My guru's ashram in the foothills of the Himalayas Okay, kenchi And it's and kenchi is the name of the dog brought she brought saved it on the streets It was a street dog puppy three weeks old So she got it back to figure must be a good reason why this dog's coming back anyhow But the dog has in its genes it likes to go around anywhere So we let it out and she goes around and there's one neighbor across the woods insist on calling the cops And they're saying okay in five if you if you get five tickets we can take the dog and we're gonna kill it You lived in this place, uh, you know boy the south is harsh 12 years a slave freaked me out by the way Um anyhow, so this woman I I have really really Uh terrible terrible thoughts and emotions about this woman that I cannot do anything about despite my 45 years of You know working on this. See that's that's real You know, I don't really have that much guilt about it. I'm just like Wow, I gotta turn this around or my dog won't be able to go out. How do I turn it around? And I've got to turn around inside me first and that's really what it's all about Right and that's compassion for the self Yeah, yeah, and if you can't do that then okay, you're okay You're just another human You know screwy Screw up no problem. But you've you you know, it's it's the impatience that comes, you know, it's it's this You know all those feelings are you know guilt anger Uh a sense of um You know not not working hard enough or accomplishing enough or all these things they they have some real serious emotional Undertones that go along with them. They're heavy. It's a heavy place to be and and you just want it to stop You know, you you I when I'm feeling those things when I'm feeling Any kind of the the the negative emotions, you know Jack cornfield says bow to them as they come to you and but I bow to them and you know It's like shitting like you said it's like I can bat if I'm constipated I can bow to the constipation But it's not gonna change the fact that I need to take a shit You know what I mean? Like I it's like there's action too, right? Or I do like how how how when does bowing to these things become? a form of pacifism When there needs to be direct action that should be taken the warrior's way all that stuff You're getting that one wrong That bowing is not a passive act And the it absolutely not it's an act of like an act of prayer it's an act of It's it's intention To Surrender Through the one inside yourself as rhombus would say It's that intention And that can't happen in none of this can you know this compassion Thing nothing can happen unless you do the first very first thing and you already know this And you know not to sound pedantic, but we all have to get control over our minds or ain't nothing going to be Effected which is what you're saying, you know you try and do this shit, but if you do not have if you are not Having intention like we just talked about in the act as an act of You know connecting to the one if you don't have you know, you need that intention But at the same time you need to have some sitting meditation Mindfulness practice, you know the big buzzword now mindfulness, but you do need You know something to get a hold on the monkey mind. I want to talk to you about that um meditation And getting a hold of the monkey mind now Do you think that sometimes I on walks I'll be chanting Hare Krishna and I have you know very Wonderful moments Through that does that count as meditating or is meditating limited to just sitting Still for some period of time It is absolutely sitting still minimal minimally 10 minutes At least every day In a in the same kind of place would be good too, you know Little corner where that's all you do so so walking around and chanting doesn't count or being in your car and watching your breath or Any of that stuff that that's secondary to this moment of finding a place and sitting still for 10 minutes Absolutely, that doesn't mean, you know going around chanting is another method Okay, but it's too easy to get daydreaming, you know either, you know breathing in your car is good like you know to just get to some Place of equanimity, you know before you're going to do something or whatever you're going to meet somebody where there's any anxiety That's a great practice But and so it's chanting, you know just walking down the street, but none of it replaced is the formal Coming back to whatever that, you know in the case that you know, that's Practice we've been doing for a long time is and we've meant we've talked about it before, you know Insight meditation or vipassana Where you're just using your natural breath focusing on the feeling of either your rising stomach Rising and falling stomach or the feeling is the breath goes in the nostrils and out without any effort And then every time you realize your loss you come back and as Sharon just said earlier today this morning That is the great beauty Because you can start again once you realize you're lost You can start again and you just keep doing that and nothing stays the same And that's the insight you get when you get into the more deeper parts of this meditate of this practice So yeah, that is not replaceable. So that is a so it interestingly that reminds me that seems to be a microcosm of the entire spiritual practice, which is that it Involves getting lost it involves not just Finding yourself again, but getting lost is seems to be as much a part of this Process is Not being lost. Is that fair to say? Yeah, absolutely. Um You know It's the nature of As humans and that's the good, you know, that's a good thing to wait in terms of self compassion compassion for your bullshit You know, that's definitely A good mantra. It's okay. I'm just human You know, I think that's a great mantra. I don't know who whatever one of these teachers said that It's okay. I'm human. It's okay. I'm human. What a cool mantra. I've never heard that before Yeah, I think that's great. By the way. Yes, um There's some people at this retreat. I said, how did you get here? This is a young guy from Australia, right? A Duncan I listened to Duncan That's great. Hey, and then Then he comes up to take a picture of ramdas and he met somebody else another young girl, right? and uh I said and she said we just met Because we both came here because we heard about her on dunking. Oh, that's so cool. Wow How you're like the pied piper for uh, ramdas or something. Yeah, I'm the pied piper. It's true I mean, I do I well because I talk about them all the time and I talk about you guys all the time because you guys have Had such an impact on me and these conversations that were recording What's so cool is every once in a while you'll just call me you always call me exactly the right time And you always accidentally bring up something that I've been wondering about or stuck on and these conversations Are so rejuvenating to me because every that's what you guys do is you remind me again and again and again that it is about Just finding yourself in the moment just going back to finding yourself in the moment and also this Um, it's nice to be reminded that I need to be meditating again because I stopped I always stop ragu I'll get it down, man. I'll have it twice and you're going to hell and you you just You should start watching jimmy swaggered so he can knock the evil out of you Do you think I should start whipping my own back with my belt? Yeah, it's good. That's a good. That's what ramdas recommends, right? Didn't maharajee have everyone sit and whip themselves with their own belts in the morning? Yeah in riad Now I wanted to ask you if you could um So walk me through what you do in the morning when you meditate. How does it work for you when you get up? Do you mind like you wake up and then what happens? My wife wants to have a chat with me and then I tell her, you know what? I'm really not good at talking for about, you know, another 90 minutes That's what happens Um, and she's listening to this now. I bet whenever this is going to air. So hi Hi, sorry. Sorry. It's one listen. It's exactly what I said Just now. I do that practice. I I use the natural breath You know the practice of vipassana you go online Sharon Salisbury jack cornfield Put them up on your thing let people go and they give beautiful They have all kinds of different cd dvds and all both. Sure. I listen. I'm listening. I listen to them all the time So, but I'm curious about you. I'm curious about you wake up. Do you have coffee first? No So you wake up you go you go to your puja table Uh, exactly and you burn incense No No incense No, it's gonna bother me kind of billowing incense that's been made in india with toxic materials. No, no candles Nothing. No zero. So you you and and and do you sit in a chair or a cushion? On the cushion And you sit in a cushion and then you just by the way, what's that? Who would be interested in this? Well, I'm intro you've already because I mean, I don't know if there's a right way to do it But I I'll tell you if I am meditating. Here's what I do Wake up. Look at my phone. Check my messages. Go to reddit go to cnn.com If I really want to get bummed out, I'll go to the drudge report Then I wake up. I go into my kitchen get a Pour some coffee I'll burn incense light some candles make a big show of the thing. I have a bell I'll ring the bell. I don't even know why ring it. Then I sit down Oh, that's fantastic. I'm actually could you send me your list? I like your list way better I'm gonna start doing it the way you do it and I'll probably get enlightened You know and that brings up another thing. Nobody should think anybody has I mean the reality is we do have to get a Hold of our minds and that is Seemingly the simplest way is just follow your breath and whenever you're lost come back to it Sit with a straight back as possible or and be comfy And try and do at least 10 and then get to 20 and that's it and and you know, you'll there will be a re in statement Some of the sanity that you've lost this lifetime Right and it's shocking and that's the other thing that happens when I do meditate And then at the end of the period I will suddenly feel so much better It reminds me of when I go running And there's something in that that's so Simultaneously wonderful yet the mind Does not like the simplicity of of of it It's almost as though the mind doesn't want it to be that easy that you could just sit down And then suddenly feel feel a minute now It's not easy the hardest thing I ever did was one of these the posh and a 10 day courses It still probably would remain the hardest thing that is that is nuts when I hear about those 10 day vipassana courses I just can't just even thinking about it right now gives me a Headache and anxiety attack Yeah fear and you should have it because sitting and facing yourself hour after hour after hour Especially in your case could be a frightening possibility Uh, but uh You know what you walk out of there first of all you can meditate for the rest You'll know how to meditate for the rest of your life. That's worth something Yes, really do it and second of all you have gone through some Definitive catharsis of your inner being so for sure for sure But you know, we don't have to get that heavy about it really if you just sit down and just start the process of watching You know just watching letting the thoughts go, you know not Catching on to everything. That's what's really going on. That's where the the compassion comes in whenever you realize you're sticking Or you're doing what uh, Sharon called today. She was yesterday or today Doing the add-ons. You know what the add-ons are. No Geez, it's really humid in here. I'm kind of feeling humid sticky I wonder if I you know if I'm gonna start sweating But I got to go out so I wonder if the shirt I'm wearing is the right one Okay, that's the you're lost. You're it's called if there's an actual Poly term for it. I don't know the poly word, but it means proliferation Okay, so until you can get a grip on that and that's what Sharon is teaching and by the way It's upstreaming as we speak if you go to can I give this little uh, yeah, please But you know the problem is if you give it it won't this comes out and Yeah, because you're not can't you just put this out right away if you know what? You well then but then it's gonna mess up my plan Which is to make it the 108th episode But you know what I will do is if you when we get up when we get done with this podcast I'll tweet live stream ramdas retreat So, you know what don't even worry you can do that But the reality is this if you go to ramdas.org you'll see A live spring retreat stream you just hit on that and it's going to be cached So you'll be able to watch it anytime. That's so cool that you guys do that Yeah, no it is I mean it's it's our mission statement. It's to share It's just what you know, it's what ramdas was about when he came back From india and his guru said, you know the first time he said whatever you do Don't talk about me That's all he did he didn't do anything more than that That's the way you get your message out is you tell you tell hippies not to talk about you Hey, could I uh, could I read one more thing? Please Uh, to me this this is uh, this is a quote from a book by a man named joseph goldstein Who is Sharon's partner at the IMS which is uh Insight meditation society in barry, uh, massachusetts Um, who just wrote a book called mindfulness, which is just this it's a very very thick book That is absolutely incredible. I'm not you know, not something you just not like uh, not bedtime reading It's really something to work with kind of a deal. Um, but he had one of the best, uh Uh, explanations and definitions of compassion Uh, and it really references everything you and I have been talking about when you're talking about what does that think and just leverage out of us out Of the you know ignorant part of ourselves. This is causing so much pain, right and we talked about compassion Compassion is the very act of emptiness of self This is compassion not as a stance of the ego Or even as a particular practice But as this spontaneous expression of a heart and mind Free of self reference Wow Is that I mean that's where we that's the only thing that's gonna It's gonna save not only ourselves, but everybody You know, let's everybody, you know, that's too dramatic. No, it's beautiful. I've had these experiences I know I know what he's talking about. I've had it the first time I felt that I was on lsd I was on this Wonderful liquid lsd that someone had at this party. I've never had lsd like this since Um, it was amazing. It was just this Someone must have just made it a day before or something. It was just perfect organic What's that Fresh and organic fresh and organic and just you know I don't know if if you ever come into contact with Well made or I don't know anything about lsd manufacture But if you come into contact with the real thing it is it is really like getting to Just kiss jesus on the lips and I it was I remember sitting I was with this girl. We were listening to I think we were listening to bay tovan She had a record and she was playing it and I was listening to the musical notes And then I started thinking about my thoughts and I'm thinking this is you know I'm thinking this is mindfulness practice before I ever came in contact with it really I'm just thinking like well my thoughts are there and then I started thinking where are my thoughts coming from like What's producing the thoughts and I was able to follow the thoughts all the way back And something happened in that moment where I just was It's gone like I just something happened and it was just this feeling of expansiveness and That's all just this sense of you know, it reminds me of what ramdas says when he says dying is like taking off a shoe That's too tight You know, it was that feeling so I know exactly that idea of being free from self reference Yeah, yeah, and and and of course that's why psychedelics, you know, they were important to us too You know those of us that went to india at that time and followed, you know his lead We had a and he himself we had a basic understanding experientially of what was being talked about You know, so when we actually went there and met that thing that was like meeting a giant I don't know what to call him, uh, you know that explains it in a way that it's not the normal terms of You know indian to enlightened or realized, you know It's a Giant love computer that knew exactly the right thing for everybody to get free at every second And was omniscient knowing past present and future of every being, you know, so, you know, whatever that That's a that was one of my first impressions of him when when I was there. Wow. So Um To have a sense of that which you did through that acid truth Is high, you know, it's pretty important. Um And now i'm not and most people go out take acid and go to Electronic or concerts, right? Sure. So, you know, that's a different that's just the same kind of thing We talked about it at the very beginning It is what, you know, how you relate with You know, if it's hunting and you're relating with it In a way that you are participating in the cycle of life and you are completely connected That's way different from someone who's you know, got a submachine gun out there, you know, you know hunting animals Okay, that that's two completely different things right in the same way. So is this And it's and I see what you're saying now. It's it's this okay. Okay. This is This reminds me of something that I was thinking. Um, because I've been listening to a lot of jack cornfield lately and and thinking about a lot of what he's Talking about The thought when you think about reality nature Life everything around us and us You can either have an experience of directly connecting with it Or you can have an experience of trying to not connect with it trying to avoid connecting with what's happening And if you get caught up in your thoughts thoughts are this kind of like phantasmal representation of life They're you do you know, they're they're ghosts they're clouds And and you get caught up in in those clouds then you're not having a direct interface with life And it seems like the compassion that you are talking about Is having a once you really start connecting to life Then how would you be violent or how could you be? In that if you were really in that state of interfacing with those animals hanging there Watching Yeah Yeah, that that's that nothing to do with compassion when when this stuff start when you When it when you do start to evolve you just can't do those kinds of things because it's just so unconscious and ignorant You can't do it. You can't be slaughtering, you know animals. You can't do it You know and that's a whole other level now the level I mean what we're talking about with compassion is a way to leverage the Complete self-referential nature that we have I mean mine all day long Attached to and stuck to every thought as if it's real that's what Way to to leverage that is the first thing you got to do is stop hating yourself for having those thoughts Or feeling less than or feeling more than you know And and so that's what we're talking about is having you know, it's ramdus calls. I love my thoughts to death It seems so I I love what you're saying But it's I'm just gonna let my mind speak for a second because my mind when it when it contemplates the idea of spending any amount of time either like loving either my narcissism or Embracing what's happening the way I'm living and the way I'm acting For better or for worse when I'm being kind or when I'm being cruel It when it considers the idea of letting myself relax into it even for a second it is like it's That's a monstrous act. It's the it's like I don't understand relax into what into the cruel you're been cruel to somebody let's say I'm saying okay, for example, just a simple simple um I can't enjoy if I'm when I'm not meditating which I'm not doing right now It's very hard for me to enjoy anything Everything that I do is laced with some bit of guilt so and especially things that aren't related to working or Producing something working on a podcast or working on stand-up or writing or exercising so for example if I'm I don't know Playing a video game. Let's say let's say I sit down and decide to play a video game I can't do it if I do it for more than a few minutes I'm just filled with such a sense of self loathing And I look at what I'm doing and I just think you can't do this anymore. You're 39 man You can't play it video games. This is fucked up. You are um wasting time you're wasting time And so and so then I I'll play that I'll that never has stopped me from playing a video game But I'll just now I'll just play it with this feeling of guilt or let's say I'm eating marijuana for example Let's say I wake up in the morning and I and I'm like, you know what? I'm gonna eat some marijuana and go right at a cafe So I'll go I'll eat marijuana. Everything becomes beautiful. I'll sit and write at the cafe But there's always an undercurrent this dark black river of guilt running through everything. So I got it. Okay. The doctor has a solution. Great Keep eating that marijuana every day Twice a day and go do keep doing it and play and play the video game while you're doing it It's probably more you know more fun. Yes, because nothing's gonna happen to you you get just you don't get anything out of it You're gonna continue to do that till you either don't get anything out of it or it's distracting You know some other priority, right? Yes, but so nothing's gonna change You are gonna keep doing this shit until it just sort of you know It evolves into something that because nothing stays the same. You're not gonna be doing this forever, right? Either You know, I mean whatever it might be. So what the only thing you can deal with is is the guilt is to is to Love that is to give it space is to Just witness it From a deeper place that you know, you're human. There's your mantra. It's okay. I'm only human Oh God that is so wild man That is so you are what you're saying is blasphemy to so many people so many people would hear that and they would think no No, you don't embrace that you don't embrace that you you stop clench Clench up tighten your muscles go jump in some mud or you know find some uncomfortable activity to spend your time doing Until you feel better about yourself No, you do that might be the next thing you do because it's proliferation goes from guilt To you know trying to hammer yourself to death thinking, you know, you whatever it may be it goes from one emotion to another Yes, so each time you just it's like when you're meditating you and you you realize you're lost and thought and you're not Uh feeling the breath going in and out of your nostrils as you breathe normally You know and oh lost and thought so instead of going oh my fucker. I've lost it again You go out great. Okay. I'll start again So you keep starting again by okay. I'm you know, I feel guilty about this and you know, I'm a lazy fuck And uh, you know, I'd rather do this than meditate or whatever and I just find out fun You know, it's okay. It's okay. And you stop that self-referential We need to do you think I mean, I'm doing this all this time myself And but that is uh, my little method or our methodology It's so cool, man And it's so intense because it is not passive to really do that That is not a passive thing to really just let yourself be in the thing and while you're in it love it Instead of ripping yourself to shreds over whatever the Dissatisfying thing or the thing that's less than the way you think you should be that you're doing it's just It really is I I think it's a revolutionary take on on on it. You know, it's a You don't hear that a lot of the time so many models of the way to be are based on in you know Symbolically whipping yourself with some kind of belt Spare the rod spoil the child Hello So we got we oh one second so we got cut off for a second there. Hold on one second And uh, when we were cut off, um, where we left it was, um So what I was we got cut off right when I said it seems like So many systems teach that you should be hurting if you want to grow spare the rod spoil the child What system where is that system? It's the it's the system of the of public education. It's the system of the military industrial complex prisons It's the system of work. It's the system of capitalism It's the idea that if you want good things you suffer now suffer in the moment So in some future point you can feel great, but right now if you're not feeling bad, you're not doing something right Okay, we grew up with the worst horror in this culture. Yes. It's true And our parents said whatever they did and past car. I mean we have a lot at surus as they say Yes, you know what surus are Say that again, please out you fade it out We have a lot at surus Yes a lot of surus problems. Yes And so what we just got it just stopped looking at the You know the this big ugly world that has created the monsters that we call us In terms of being completely lost and ignorant and say, okay We have some tools now and we're going to start to use these tools because we don't want to be so screwed up anymore That's you know, there's you have to have some motivating force for wanting to change Whatever it is. It could be through suffering or it could be just through Waking up on acid seeing the connectivity of everything and knowing that that is possible so So that that's we'll go back to the tool the two tools compassion for you know, all of these feelings and self-referential bullshit that comes up every second and start Loving it to death. It's the only is the best way you could say it. I mean compassion or the or you know We're only human. We really are only human. We're doing the best we can so we're only human So you pick yourself up. I mean if if you walk home today, you know go home today from this podcast And go, okay I've been feeling shitty because I haven't meditated and somehow something's waking me up and I think I'm going to start again So you'll start again. Great. That's the beauty of the human thing. We can start again because we got consciousness Oh God you're I'm so lucky I really must be one of the luckiest people ever that I get to have these conversations with you I feel so grateful. It really is cool, man. Every time it's like a tuning fork. This is why you need a spiritual community I think this is the reason there needs to be a sangha. This is why people need you know, because I You know, sometimes I'll I'll Some of my friends they don't have they don't have a ragu marcus or ramdas and and they get You know, they're you get they don't have someone to say listen. Love yourself and just meditate some more. You'll be fine They don't even have that. So I I think it's so important what you guys are doing and I you know, I don't mean to like It's a little complex, of course. I don't want to dumb it down too much. There are other I mean certainly You know, look at someone like yourself. You delve into it. You've gone to retreats, right? You you're engaged with people like jack cornfield. Yes, right who have, you know, so much to offer practical stuff not esoteric Stuff, you don't need You know this guy Joseph Goldstein who's been studying and you know every year he goes on, you know, sell three months retreats. I mean he's really um Practicing what he's preaching and has really is an amazing soul that That podcast will be out on a mind-rolling podcast folks In a in a couple of weeks But he said to me You know what? I'm not a buddhist Sky has been practicing buddhism for 50 years or something 45 years 40 years. Yeah, he said i'm not a buddhist It's not about a buddhist. It's about self-awareness That's what it's about. It's about being able to do something decent for your neighbor Or anybody anybody you see every day that you're having, you know a generous exchange rather than What is what am I going to do? Oh god this that you know, whatever all the bullshit that goes through our minds so it's worth Getting control of that mind and it's worth practicing compassion. Well, it because it creates Revolutionary changes in your life and i'll give you an example and this is directly This is directly from from the stuff that that i've learned from going to the retreats and talking to you and Rom das and jack cornfield, which is that i was having uh speaking of neighbors I was in a cold war with my neighbor um, and and we were in a cold war over uh I don't know the garbage cans and i don't know just we were She it just was a power struggle thing and i my ego would flare up and and i Didn't want to do anything that she wanted me to do Because i felt i didn't like the way she was asking me it's just all bullshit ego stuff and You know i would so i was in this dumb war and i used to live my whole life like that man. Oh my life used to be Vengeance was normal like if i could win i that's all that mattered or if i could be You know even i'm not saying i was like a rampaging jerk, but definitely was into winning Winning these winning a war like that. I wanted to be the one you got apologized to i wanted to be the one on top but I remember just this you know from Assimilating some of this stuff that you guys were saying and going into a mindful state and watching and thinking okay Wait, that's your ego that wants to Tell her that you think she's a fucking asshole and that if she has a problem talk to the landlord not me And so she got sick and i was thinking about all this stuff and and and and this was like she was sick in the midst of Us having real serious Like not serious, but we're just not getting along and then i'm like you know what i'm gonna get her some soup i'm gonna bring her some soup i'm gonna bring her some miso soup Because that helps when you're sick and i brought it to her and i remember how happy she got and we looked at each other And suddenly this entire thing that would have been going on even to this very day It transformed and now when i see her We smile and talk and i'm living in a little tiny little utopian place here that used to be a war zone And that's because of what you guys are putting out there and that's how revolutionary this stuff can be And and because it really is important to have harmony with your neighbor It's a terrible feeling to know that I know what you're feeling with your neighbor. It's it's a real mind fuck. It's a real drain Yeah, and i i'm not kidding about that. I'm having a real problem myself with it and uh, and you're absolutely right It's revolutionary and and what the this thing i read of the karma karma earlier You know fearlessness it takes real fearlessness to To even approach changing Who you've been, you know And so that's definitely part of the whole uh recipe for just being able to break through of Of this complete self-referential life that we lead So, uh, that's beautiful though, and which yeah, that's really sweet Well, it's it's sweet and it's it's in it and it leads it's it leads to It leads to a kind to i don't know what the word for it is, but it's it's ecstasy It's a kind of great feeling the more you do these things the more um It's it's we the mind all the things the mind tells you to stay it's like the mind Looks at a hot tub And says oh that's freezing water do not go into that hot tub And then you begin to think like god i i'm gonna avoid these actions of compassion and love at all cost That's the fear and then the moment it happens Wow, this feels better than anything i've ever felt And then you start thinking like well is this then then if i keep doing this then how ha What universe am i going to be living in? It's almost the opposite of an apocalypse You know, it's it's like a nirvana lips or something Nirvana lips Yes nirvana lips That's i'm gonna i've got to save that i've got a that's got to be someone's nickname And by the way nirvana just got uh inducted into the uh rock and roll hall of fame and they deserve it They deserve because they were so happy didn't they used to play at the rom-dos retreats Oh, yes every yeah as every year. Yes kurt would reimagine his body and Reimagine his fun This is fun I always love hanging out with you. Well, I wonder what would have happened.
