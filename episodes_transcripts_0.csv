It's dog trembling day so don't forget to create some kind of safe space for your freaked out meth head dog to gallop into when the boomers start exploding. They don't know what's going on. They're wolf descendants who have managed to survive for millennia, gradually shrinking down into cute little things that still have stored inside of them the incredibly sad understanding of the fragility of life. So while you're slurping back Budweiser's and grilling your beef kebabs, the dogs are listening to these explosions and accessing their epigenetic memories of all the various stupid terrible wars that humans have inflicted upon each other. And so for you what is just a spectacular show of beautiful lights up into the sky is for your dog a reminder of the terrible never ending truth that at any moment their human companions can be exploded by bombs or ripped apart by wild animals. Make a safe space for your dog. Make a little tent, make a little dark safe beautiful fort that your freaked out dog can run into and if you're a scientist see if you can connect some kind of energy harvesting device to your dog connect that to one of those new Tesla batteries and you could theoretically power your house on the fear of your dog and that's a wonderful gift from our special canine friends. Pals, you're a matrix of atoms binding together in a perfect way to create a temporary sentient net filled with thousands of microscopic biomes consisting of varying beings who form the cloud that is your special self, a temporary transient cloud of meat gradually dissipating into infinity, a precious thing. And why would you want to bring your cloud of thinking meat into a chain store? Why would you want to spend your precious life hours? Why would you want to spend your precious out breaths and in breaths and some maze of material bullshit lit by fluorescent lights and filled with workers who don't want to be there when you could simply go to amazon.com and have whatever special bit of plastic you're itching for delivered to your doorstep. Go to amazon.com and go through our portal located in the comments section of any of these episodes. If you go through our Amazon portal, then Amazon will give us a very small percentage of anything you buy and it will cost you nothing. It's a great way for you to support this podcast while avoiding the existential horror that is the modern day chain store. It would be better for you to go and sit in front of the gates of hell and gaze through those terrible gates into the never ending rows and rows of howling souls that populate Hades than to spend even a few moments wandering through the toxic philosophical minefield that is a modern day target. Don't go there. Go through our Amazon portal. Give yourself from the terrible realization that there are a large number of people who still spend their precious life hours risking being infected by some kind of as of yet undiscovered disease being exploded out of the vile mucusy mouth of some toddler being pushed through that dismal hell maze of a target by their stressed out mother. Do you want to get sneezed on by a Zika baby when you could be spending your time in the precious outdoors smelling pine cones and making love to a wild beast? Come on friends, go through our Amazon portal won't you? We just restocked our shop. We've got a lot of, we've got new posters there, newer on Regie posters. We've restocked it with some mugs and shirts. We have a very limited amount of mugs. So if you tried to go to the store and wanted a DTFH mug and they were gone, you can get one now. Oh my God, that's it. That's the intro. Four minutes and 40 seconds. That may be a brand new record. Man, before I dive into this episode, I'm very excited. Next week, I'm going to be interviewing one of my favorite people in the world, George Norrie. It actually happened. So if you have any questions that you would like to ask the host of Coast to Coast, then go to dunkintrustle.com and let me know on the forum. I'm really excited about this interview. I have so many questions for him. And as far as I'm concerned, he's one of the great interviewers living today and I can't wait to talk to him. All right, that's it. Let's just jump right into this episode. Today's guest is the host of a wonderful podcast on the Keith and the Girl Network called Hang Out With Me. You've also probably seen him on Conan or Letterman or maybe you've been lucky enough to catch him live. Everybody please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, the great Mike Kaplan. It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. Mike. Duncan. Thank you so much for coming out here. Oh, thank you. Braving. What appears to be some kind of apocalyptic fire. Absolutely. I didn't know until I got here that there was one. Have you ever seen a wildfire that big? No, I haven't seen many. I live in New York. We don't have as many. We have mostly domesticated fires. Yeah, and terrorist attacks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I hear a lot of sirens. There's certainly strife happening. Yeah. That's the New York... Don't worry. Yeah. I know. And the thing about New York is because the buildings echo the sirens. So it sounds a billion times worse. It can just be a simple ambulance going down. Oh, sure. And it sounds like some hell band she... A modest, humble ambulance. Yeah. And that's it. Yep. So you just came into town hanging out with friends? Yes. Friends, comedy, you know, life. Do you look forward to coming out to LA? I do. I love it. I started comedy in Boston in 2002-ish and then I moved to New York in 2008. I think the first time I came to LA was like 2007 and then I came out here for Last Comic Standing in 2010 and so I was out here like once a week for a few days and, you know, that was... I was here for a purpose every time but I have friends out here, I got to do fun shows and after that I was like, I'm just gonna... I mean, it's... Oh, there's some comedy to be done here. Yeah. So yeah, I like to have, you know, quote unquote reasons but if I don't, like I had a girlfriend who lived out here and now she lives with me in New York but I would come every couple months to visit her and now that she's not there, I guess it seems weirder to be like, I'm just going to see a person who's not my girlfriend, you know, my friend and other friends and other... But you know, I didn't have anything scheduled for this weekend and I got a cheap enough flight that it made sense to do it. Reasons are so annoying. Yeah. No thanks. Hey, for fun enjoyment, but what else? Yeah. This is the worst. That's one of the plagues of the modern age. Is there... Everyone has to have a fucking reason to do something. I mean, I'm already trying to find out the reason that we're all here. That... Yeah, that one. God forbid we ever figured that out because guaranteed it's a letdown, whatever they finally discover if they ever was a reason, I guarantee it's something really embarrassing and humiliating to humans. I mean, maybe it's just what you... Everybody does learn it, like right before you die would be nice, you know, you're like, oh, that's it. And then, bye. Yeah, that's the... Or you just sort of... I mean, the... If you get into the idea that we're sort of like part of a cosmic seeding program or something. Oh, I get that idea, yeah. And then it's just like, oh no, you guys don't understand, we just made you to clean the toilet section of our interdimensional ships here. This was an accident. You're not even supposed... Something like that. Humans are so puffed up with themselves. That's true. I mean, I've been lately thinking that, I mean, we are all, like, you know, sometimes if you're standardly religious, you know, the conventional, you know, God is everywhere, but also the idea that seemingly God is separate. But if God is everywhere, then God is, you know, then we are like walking through God all the time. You know, we, like God is inside our bodies and like in every cell. So we are, if God is there, that then we are all parts, like God is the universe and we're part of the universe. So like when people say, you know, God will punish you, I'm like, well, people will punish people for, you know, with their attitudes and with their things and the idea that there are contradictions of like the loving God, the God to be feared, I mean, yeah, that's just different aspects. It's like, oh, are you a nice person? I mean, sometimes I'm nice to some people and to other people. Maybe I've been a jerk and wronged people. And you know, if we were made in God's image, I mean, literally we, you know, we are God's image slash manifestation. So you know, parts of it, it's like, you know, the human body is a made up of many things. Like, you know, am I a toenail? No, but a toenail is part of me. And sometimes it gets clipped and then new, new grows and then there's, we're made up different molecules and skin cells all the time. And sometimes, yeah, you ever, you ever see, you know, or like, like a dog sees its tail, but doesn't know it's its tail and it chases it. That's like what, like, you know, that's war, you know, that's, you know, hey, get, get those guys. Right. That thing. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, you're talking about this idea called, the Hare Krishna's call it something along the lines of a Sink-a-sink-a-beta tatha. Have you heard that? Oh no, I like it though. It's cool. It sounds cool. Sure. It's the idea for what God is. So it's sort of like human consciousness is the sort of embodied spark of a inner dimensional super sun, which is the Godhead. And we're all these little sort of God photons that are embodied in our, in flesh temporarily. And so this is actually CS Lewis talks about this a little bit to this concept. And then I've heard another way it's put is that, you know, it was looking for God, just right here. Yeah. And this is the crest of the wave of Godness and we're kind of God creating God right now. So when you're looking for God, you're looking for the perfect God, you're actually maybe thinking of a future version of what we're becoming, which hasn't happened yet, but the moment that that happens, the singularity, pure union, pure emerging machines and the atomic level of all things, then at that point you transcend time and space, meaning that that God does actually exist. It's just not at this particular node in the time space continuum, but you can still pray to that thing. Sure. You can, you can do whatever you want. I like people looking for God and it's like, God's your eyes, you can't, you can't. It's like, sometimes I was always confused, like looking at the Milky Way in the sky when I was told that we're in the Milky, I'm like, how can we see the milk, how can you look at it? Like I can't see my body. Right. Like I can see parts of my body. I can't see all of my body because I have to use part of my body to see some of my body. Yeah, right, right. So I guess I'm not, I know I'm not seeing all of the Milky Way. So I get it. It makes sense. You're seeing a little piece that you're floating in. Yes. Um, this, that, that, I've heard like, it's not a conspiracy theory, but people say that because of light pollution, the wisdom of our species has been diminished because we no longer recognize the insane, infinite, beautiful thing that we're floating in. So light itself serves this censorship purpose and reducing wonder when, you know, now if I want to see how beautiful this. Let there be less light. Right. Light pollution is the great nullifier of the connection that early people used to feel when they looked at the sky. Ironic that light used to be for and is often for illuminating, showing people things and now the very thing that was to show us that which was in the darkness is now obscuring that very thing. Isn't that nuts and not, isn't that the metaphor that's the moment you shine your light on one specific thing, whatever it is, you immediately sort of diminish everything else that isn't in that circumference of light. And even some, you know, on a, I think a microscopic or, you know, subatomic level, the, I might be getting this wrong, but maybe the Heisenberg uncertainty principle or the observer effect is that, you know, when nothing can be observed without changing it, like if you shine a light, you're like, oh, I want to see that darkness. You can't shine a light on darkness and then see it because the light will make it go away. The same thing with like certain molecules. If you, if they get hit with light, you know, if photons or whatever it is, then those molecules are so small that, or the atomic particles or whatever it is, they're so small that like they get bounced away and you're like, oh, well, the light's here now is like, well, what was there a second ago? You can't find it. You can't see it. Yeah. That's the, that's the wonderful and amazing thing. People get confused about that observer effect and they think it means that you can gaze upon a thing and then from some exertion of the mind create an instantaneous shift in it, which is with the misunderstanding of it, I think, but it is an effect. Definitely there is an effect gazing upon a thing and who knows how powerful that effect really is. We'll never know. There's no way to tell, but that isn't, this is, I heard it. There's an essay I read by some, I can't remember the philosopher. I've talked about it in the podcast before. I barely understood it, but it's the concept of nothing and how the concept of nothing is hilarious because in the same way, if you want to observe darkness and any kind of thing you use to study that darkness is going to make it a non-darkness and impossible to study in this original state. So in that same way, the term nothing, nothing, the moment you say nothing, whatever you are referring to becomes a something. That's like, I've been just getting into Ram Dass's podcast recently and that resonates with the idea that he talks about of trying to get down into, you have your doing self, your being self and then your thinking self and then trying to keep going layers and layers deep until you're not doing, reflecting, thinking, almost even just being the is-ness that is at the deepest level of all of us that is the same that we all spring from or are. It's talking about the idea of what is God or what is the universe or what is consciousness, what are these things. Different people, different groups have different names and some of things that are myths and some are like, oh yeah, we believe this and then mine, I just like, I like a lot of the things and I'm just like, oh, that's something, you said that the syncopated situation that I don't remember, syncopated. Syncopated Tatfa. Yeah, well I'm like, you teach me a lot of these words, I think last time you were on my podcast like Satsang and Songha. Oh yeah, right, and you taught me the ship of Theseus. Oh yeah, yeah. Which is cool. But this, yeah, and I think that's one of the real frustrating things going on right now on the planet is that people are really in a war over symbols. Yes. And it's one of the saddest situations to be in when the symbols themselves, what they're pointing to, is the most beautiful potential. Oh yeah. But instead of recognizing that, people are just completely caught up in the words themselves and that's where we're, it seems like we're kind of fucked. And words can be, as long as you're having fun, then great, like here's, I say for myself very self-servingly as, because of the thing I'm about to say, like do you know the thing how, like, you know, the moon is the moon and whether you call it the moon or you don't call it the moon, you call it something in another language, you don't even have a word for it, you point it, some people point at the moon and then, you know, people, my girlfriend has this joke, she's not a comedian, but she came up with this joke about religion and how most religion starts from positive motivations, like, you know, kindness, be kind to people. And then that's like throwing a ball for a dog and the ball is the religion and then the dog didn't see you throw it, so then you pointed it and then everybody else is trying to be like, point and the dog's just staring at your finger and the dog won't go to where the ball is because it's just like, oh the finger, that's the thing that's moving, that's the thing in my face and she's like, and that's religious dogma. And so the idea that, you know, pointing a finger at the moon, obviously the finger's not the moon, but the idea of pointing at the moon is a thing that seems like philosophically relevant and a friend, Zach Sherwin and I, a good friend, we're driving to a wedding in New Hampshire and we passed a road called Mooney Point. Yeah, that's cool. I'm like, that's fun. But yeah, certainly the idea that I was thinking about how, when you're a child, you're taught to not say shut up, like that's mean, don't say shut up, but sometimes the way that children are told to not to be like, hey, don't say, we don't say that, like it's like meaner than the thing. Yeah, right. I'm like, that's so many of the jokes that I end, I'm like, I've written so many jokes, I'm like, oh, that's that joke, that's that same thing. Just, oh right, yeah, if we're going to talk about this in particular, it's like people for peace, who are like peace, peace, peace, that thing. Yelling at people not to yell, you know. Well, I think this is why I like the symbol of Jesus, because it really is the ultimate response, which is, oh, I guess just kill me. It's that, just like, well, instead, it's the most illogical response to a violent universe, which is instead of resisting violently, it's a response of like, yeah, I guess you'll just have to kill all of us. And that seems to be the most effective method for creating lasting change in the world. Yeah, I mean, being willing to die, as opposed to, like, you know, if Jesus, if you, the idea of him being able to have done anything, you know, if he had either magical powers or just human powers of, he could have resisted. Who was it that took all the miracles out? Ben Franklin? Oh, that's, or Jefferson? Jefferson. I think Jefferson read the Bible. Yeah. He's like, yeah, fuck this, this didn't happen. Yeah. And he went and just marked out all the miracles, just to find the moral truth behind it, or the ethical idea behind it. And I'm about that. Like, I've been also talking on stage some about being like, I'm definitely, I would get murdered before I would murder. Right. Like, you know, say, eliminate, you know, would you, certainly I wouldn't, I wouldn't kill an innocent person and they're like, well, what, what about to save, you know, not just yourself, but your family, you're going, and that's where, you know, eventually that turns into preemptive, you know, drone strikes on people that like, what, they probably wouldn't, they were gonna, you know, and if we all, like, if we all just, if everybody agreed to get murdered instead of murder, like if you, if everybody literally was like, what would Jesus do? He would get murdered. So if we would all get murdered, then there will literally be nobody who could murder us because we're all going to get murdered. But there'd be one very exhausted murderer. Yes. Yeah. I tried to wipe out an entire planet of pacifists. And then, I mean, but of course there are people that won't sign up for this that are like, I don't think everybody's gonna do it. So if there's some murderers out there, we need to also have, we need to have, you know, like murder for good, you know, or... Well, this is it. The problem with that, you know, and clearly you're talking about gun control, it sounds like, or some version of that, which is the logic. I just heard this great NPR story on guns and I was raised in the South. I've never had a superstition of guns. But man, when I was listening to this story, it's nuts because, do you know the name of the company? Okay, so the company that produces like the Bushmaster, the AR-15s, the assault rifles is known as the Freedom Group. Have you ever heard of this? I didn't. So it's called the Freedom Group, of course, the Freedom Group. Yeah. So the Freedom Group, they make all the guns, but the Freedom Group is owned by another company and the name of the company is Sarah Barris, the, I don't know how you pronounce it, the name of the mythological... Oh, the dog. Yeah. So the company, the major, billion dollar company that owns the company that produces all, most of the guns that are used in all the slaughters that we're dealing with is named after the dog. That guards the gates of hell. They keep souls in hell. That is so fucking crazy to me. Wow. It's really just, come on, is that an accident? That can't be an accident. And that, when you get to that level of things, and actually, you know, after hearing that and making sure that was the case, and then realizing, my God, that's the case. This is bad, right? Like, if we, you and I were writing some kind of action movie about an evil company making guns and I was like, hell dog. Yeah. Let's call it hell dog. You go like, no, it's a little, a little on the nose. Yeah, maybe you don't call it that, but it's actually, that's what it's called. So like, if there's ever, like, if you're wondering to yourself, well, is the company that owns the Freedom Group a good company? Remember, they're named after a three-headed devil dog. Now it's a mythological dog, but this got me thinking. What if in this dimension, corporations are the manifestation of gods? The way gods appear in this dimension is in the form of corporations. Oh, sure. Have you, I'm a big fan of Jess Whedon. I've watched like, Buffy, Buffy's one of my favorite shows. And I don't know if you've. I've only seen a few episodes of that. In, so Angel, the spin-off, in, I won't, this isn't the most important thing, but just a coincidence, the main big villain in the Angel series world is a law firm. And it is basically what you're talking about. It's a law firm that is the representative of and for and the manifestation of, you know, evil in this earthly dimension. And it's called Wolfram and Heart. And then they're represented in, you know, historically, they've been around since the Wolf, the Ram and the Heart, which is a kind of deer. And so it's cool. You know, another just fun example of, you know, like words, these words don't have any inherent, you know, like the sounds are arbitrary, but then there's fun coincidences within them. Like one time when the play, I guess I, this is fine. I actually just realized I was about to say a thing that would reveal a confidence. So a real fun other thing. Guys, I had a good time in my head. But, you know, this is the, so it's, it's the idea that there are these, I mean, it's a weird idea, but there's sort of these preexisting forms that language is like, you know, when you throw paint on the invisible man, sort of illuminates these preexisting forms, the forms preceded the vocal utterance. And so the idea of Sarah Barris or Baphomet or any of the mythological symbols are actually the high tech for the time. They were like a high tech way of shining a light on a thing that has existed eternally, which is what they say about mantras, for example. Like these, these words like Hari Kushnade, Kushnade, Kushnade, Kushnade, all these words are sort of the, I guess you could say that the clothing around or another way you could say is that the words have been inflated with a preexisting infinite energy that has been around way before people were able to even talk. Right. Like you, where you could see the ghost outline in the rain or, you know, throw a sheet over it. Yeah, that is, that makes, that makes sense. I'm on board. Like, I mean, words are, I've been playing music my whole life. And you studied linguistics. I did, yes. And so I feel like, you know, you learn language in your first few years and you learn, like, you know, without trying, you know, people are just talking and your brain knows what it has to do. And like, you know, obviously learning a second language years and years later can be difficult, but everybody learned. If you're around language, you learn it. And like music was the same for me. I started learning music when I was four. Wow. And, you know, certain, just different people have different tastes in music and certain things resonate, you know, whether we're, forget about lyrics. The idea that, you know, the, the sound wave, certain, you know, certain instruments and certain timbres, certain harmonies, certain scales, certain chords and combinations, you know, make feelings. You know, they, they go into your brain and you're like, well, that, you know, like it has, right. Music also has no, you know, inherent, like logical, like. So let me ask you about that. Sure. So, like when we hear, we hear like a discordant song, minor keys. Sure. There's a sense of foreboding or danger or something sad or depending on how they put it together. Has anyone studied this? Is there, do people say this is the kind of thing built into humans? Or is it that we learn that these sounds generally point to some bad thing about to happen because they're used in entertainment? That, I probably, there is some cultural, you know, association between like, you know, the idea of a minor chord even being sad is, I think my, my girlfriend teaches music and I think she doesn't think of it like that and she doesn't like teach her students, like this kind of, these two notes together are happy and these ones are sad, but that, you know, they can be used that way. But the thing that I do want to say, oh yeah, the idea that like, you know, our bodies, like, you know, the heartbeat was sort of like kind of the first drum, you know, the first rhythmic thing that anybody experiences and hears. And like there are some, you know, some cultures that like you have music sort of, you know, all throughout it where it's just like, and we, in ours as well, like I remember reading about a specific, I don't know who it was, but some, you know, type of some land, some village, some community, some people where they didn't even necessarily have a concept of music. They didn't have a word for music because music was just infused in their daily life in the way that like, you know, if you go to, if you got a ticket or something, you'd go to court in this war, in this village and then the judge would be like, oh please do the, you know, and he would have like his little song and there'd be like a call and response and you'd do your part, which is sort of like in our court system where the judge comes in and the bailiff's like, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, like that's not a quote unquote normal. It's normal because it's what we do, but that doesn't happen in most other, you go to the DMV and they're like, all right, stand in line, you know, like, That'd be great if they did. Yeah. I mean, and so it kind of seems like a cool, you know, like either it's both sad and happy, it's, you know, it's both things. Like with that, they don't have music. I mean, like they only have music in, in that other place. Well, can you explain it a little bit to me that, so, because I don't really understand it that well, I know, isn't it Chomsky or some people have this idea that wired into the human brain is language that somehow language is already inside of us neurologically or something. Yeah, there, I mean, we've evolutionarily developed, as I understand, to have like in our heads, a thing that when I learned it, it was called a language acquisition device that, you know, other obviously most animals that aren't humans don't have this thing. So the letters aren't already in there. No, no, like, especially because, I mean, if you look at different languages, like there are different sounds. There are sounds that we can't say at, because we learned English and there are sounds that French people can't say. Like when, you know, the French accent where they were like, you know, that's sort of stereotypical. But the reason that they say is they don't have that sound. That sounds not one of the things in their brain because, like, it's almost like it's hard for them to learn. Yeah, I mean, certain, there's certain people who can't do it. The same way that some people, I mean, a sound that's in, that's not in our language that some people can't do that and some people can is, you know, like, like, is in Hebrew and Arabic and other languages, I'm sure as well. But some people are just like, huh, you know, like, is it a, is it a, is it a and it's a, it's a specific other sound. Like there's in Korean, there's, I think, two different kinds of bees and we only have one of them and there's two different kinds of D's. There's like, there's like this harder, like that. Like, I don't know that I'm even necessarily doing it, right? Because they don't specifically have meaning to me because I didn't learn those languages, you know, young enough or fluently. So it's sort of like all the possibilities are in the brain. And then if you're raised around people that speak Chinese, then those ones get highlighted, those ones like bulge into existence in your brain. It's the light thing or it's, it's sort of the, the language is a light that burns its imprint into your mind when you're a kid and all the other possibilities get blanked out just because you're not using them. Eventually. And if you do keep learning different languages, they say like, you know, it's up until maybe like between five and seven, I think, different for everybody. But somewhere there is where you stop being able to do it as easily. Unless they, I think they've shown that you can, if you keep learning languages, say you learn English when you're two and then you learn like Japanese when you're four and then you learn, if you keep learning a different language, then you'll keep that language acquisition device operating and those lights can keep like they won't burn out. Are there any theories as to why it becomes more difficult after when you're five? Uh, it's, I'll tell you, there's this theory that I have that I'm coming up with now off the, uh, off the top of my head slash out of my ass, you know, opposites, uh, that I mean, your brain is just, you know, as you get, as you grow older, uh, connections are made between things and those connections, like, you know, uh, sort of met metaphorically, children are, or conceptually children are trying to be like, okay, this is the, this is a thing. And this goes with that. Like this is how you say this, this is what that, that is a dog, that is a cat. And like these parts of the brain are like just associating different things. And then they're, they're like, okay, hold that there. Uh, but the earlier it is, like the less connections there are, so just the more like open and fluid and the more options there are, uh, but eventually like the more things that you have in there to keep them in there, they have to be like, you know, more solidified, like, like glass, like molten glass, you know, is like liquid when it's super hot. Uh, but then like, you can't like use it until it's like cooled into a certain shape. So the brain after time, like, after like, well now, now it's usable. Now we can drink out of it. Uh, but we, and we could shatter it and reform it again, but, uh, that's, now I think the metaphor, don't, don't shatter your brain and try to learn another language. But the idea is we want to shatter. Is that, I mean, isn't this where psychedelics are being explored right now as a kind of, as a potential means of reliqu, temporarily reliquifying the brain, allowing the formation of new connections. You're right. And I, I don't remember what the specific, uh, shattering effect, uh, or the method was in this situation, but you, maybe you read about this, some, like some of the people will either have a stroke or have some sort of, you know, brain event and then they wake up and then they're speaking in a different language that they never learned, which is like, doesn't, and they, then there's, they have no explanation for how that was, or they can play the piano and they never could play the piano or suddenly they, they're, they're incredibly good at math. Yeah, just they, they have a visual understanding of numbers that they didn't have before. Or worst case, like some, you know, somebody gets a spike through their head and then it goes through a particular part of the brain that, you know, was their person that, like, you know, had their personality being kind. That makes more sense. Like if there's a huge injury to the brain, then okay, it becomes worse, but it's weird when it becomes like better and can do more. This is, um, when you, I know that you are someone who takes psychedelics and I wonder, have you ever on psychedelics seen the strange letters that can appear everywhere or seen a kind of like geometric thing that seems similar to a language that you've never seen before? That makes sense. Uh, let me, I'm trying because the experiences that I've had, uh, like with, I smoked DMT once, uh, and then I've done since then, ayahuasca some number of times. And the first time I, when I did DMT, uh, there was definitely like swirling, like it seemed like, you know, like runes, tablets, like hieroglyphics. Definitely. There was definitely these like multicolored multi, you know, symbols that I certainly, I've seen, you know, like when, if you look up DMT art or ayahuasca art, you can, I'll see like, oh yeah, something, something like that. Like people see similar things apparently, but it's so like, again, like dream like it, it's, it fires so brightly while it's happening. And then like you wake up and you're like, okay, quick. And you try to, you know, grab it maybe and like write it down or, or, you know, you retain some of it. You retain overall, like the, the shape, but not the specific, uh, you know, the ghost, the ghost's energy, but not the sheet around it made of language. Have you heard of any theories about that in linguistics? Does, if any, has anyone looked into the, it's a, it's a pretty common experience for people under the influence of psychedelics. I haven't witnessed shapes that appear to be a language, but then they don't know the, so I mean, I remember when I've seen those things, I've always thought, oh, that, you know, this must be a language. I don't speak, but it's still a language. But then with this conversation that we're having, it makes me think, are you witnessing this sort of pre-linguistic, geometric formations that will fit into whatever culture you're born into? I'm going to, I'm going to ask my, uh, my old linguistics advisor if she knows anything. Yeah, definitely. Have you heard, you've probably talked to Shane Moss about some of this stuff. Shane told me once, I don't know if you know this story, that, you know, so do it when he, when he smokes DMT, he has certain music that he listens to usually. Yes. Like there's a particular band that plays DMT, uh, like specific, like they write it for those trips. But he was with somebody else and that person was like, can I put on this music for you? And Shane's like, yeah, sure. And like the reason that the music that he likes is good for that purpose is that it's not like a song that he knows. It doesn't have lyrics that will help, that like alter the direction that will make suggestions. It's just like it, you know, helps amplify the experience that you're having. And so he's listening to this guy's music and he hears lyrics and he's like, oh, I don't want to be affected by them. So let me not, I'm going to try to focus away from that. Try purposefully to put those out of my head. And then afterwards the guy's like, how, how was it? How did it go? And he's like, uh, it was, it was good, pretty good. But, uh, uh, the lyrics were like a little hard to ignore. I tried to try to not listen to the lyrics that much. And the guy was like, there were no lyrics to that song. And he's like, what, what were those lyrics? And I was trying to remember what, what he didn't, what he purposefully tried to ignore. You, you on your Wikipedia page, you are described, you're, you describe yourself as atheistic. I, so I didn't write my Wikipedia page, but I definitely did call myself an atheist for many years, but, you know, like the same way that when a word, you know, the word leaves the mouth and then, oh, now there's associations and connotations with it that I definitely used to very strongly. Well, I think Shane would consider himself to be one too. He's a scientific, materialist, no, I'm not where you stand there. So, and I don't think any of it's bad. I'm just, it's always curious to me because whenever I take a psychedelic, particularly DMT, but mushrooms, yeah, there is such an encounter with a field of data that seems to be alive. He's certainly, yeah, I'll, I mean, not to speak for Shane, but I, the conversations I've had with him, he was certainly a hard line atheist before he did DMT and certainly had, we've had conversations about that, not necessarily being the case since. Oh, okay. So it would be, I'm sure it would be interesting for you guys to talk about it. But if for me, like sometimes Zach Sherwin and I have done ayahuasca ceremonies together and some of them, like when people ask, what do you get out of these things? Like the broad categories of things that we get out of it, one is what one might call life coaching. Like Zach's very first time, he thought about his mother a lot and it's like the conversations that he has with her where sometimes, you know, our mothers can frustrate us, the way that, like they, that we love them and they're wonderful people and they care about us. But sometimes for whatever, you know, because of who we are and who they are and our relationship, it's hard. It's hard. And he was thinking about that and it was just giving him sort of like methodologies to be like, oh, when I, when I talk to my mom, try to keep this, like the love, be, be grateful for like everything else. Like forget about like the tiny little bit that is amplified so much that we're like mom and be like the rest of it. That is like completely like this mom love entity. Just, and so, you know, be nice to your mom, if, if your mom's nice and deserves you being nice to her, like, so that was like a life coaching thing. And then the other aspects are things that I think my girlfriend who, who does it as well, uh, she called it death coaching. And so it's like the way that obviously DMT is the substance that floods our brain when we are dying. So the experience of this ceremony is something that maybe is similar to the experience of dying, which is sort of disassociating, like not leaving your body, but having, you know, the consciousness sort of spread, alter, get jumbled, get shattered. Uh, and, you know, sometimes there's imagery. Sometimes it's just feelings. Sometimes, you know, it's a huge, a weird combination of you're like, oh, like I am this point in the universe. I am the whole universe. And, uh, so the, oh yeah, the, the point that I'm getting to is like, when's Zach and I have talked about the idea, uh, that we have these feelings, like, you know, we, the things that you're talking about, this, this living, you know, like sort of communion that we're experiencing that like it, like the idea is that like none of the words are, none of the words can capture it all. The, oh, we're all one. Of course. Like the first guy who introduced me to ayahuasca, he like was a not at all, like the opposite of a hippie dude. He was just like an angry dude, like, and he's now like the nicest, calmest, sweetest dude. And, and he's like, I'm done. Like one time doing it, he's like, my dad was a sociopath, but I love him. And I'm, you know, he tried to kill me, but I, I'm gonna try to reach him because he just pushes people away. And he's like, it's so crazy. Like I don't, I didn't believe in Auras or like we're all like the same guy, but, but we are, and I saw them. And, uh, and so similarly, like I was a person who, uh, would, I was like, okay, Auras, you know, wha, wha, whatever. I mean, like I'm not going to tell people not, not to believe anything that they want to or do. And I don't have all the answers, of course. Right. Uh, but yeah, I was definitely a much more like, yeah, if I, if I see something, I'll believe something. If I can understand it, then I do. Yes. Uh, but now when Zach and I talk about this, we're like, it really, it certainly when you're under the influence of this substance, it feels like, oh, that there is not a separate God, but that you, that's the idea that you are part of this whole thing, this whole like process of the universe constantly reincarnating itself as now, now me, now other people, but, you know, me's not, you know, the energy and matter constantly being reformulated. And, you know, there's 95% of the universe that we don't even have any idea, you know, dark matter, dark energy, but just all this stuff. And so, you know, Zach put it, uh, that he called it the pattern, the, the, all the big tapestry that we would see of these colors and shapes and that the sort of representing the universe for God or whatever you want to say. God. Yeah. Sure. And, or, and then we, as our individual consciousnesses, you know, are not separate from it. We're sort of bulging forth from it the way that like language comes forth or light or whatever. Or hernias. Sure. Yeah. And so this, this bulge. The hernia of God is eternal. And so like, you know, there's this consciousness bulge here and this other consciousness bulge. This is me. This is you. They can touch each other and like, you know, connect through laughter and love. And like we're all connected at the root because we're all springing forth from the same thing. And then death of, you know, this version of us, death of this consciousness is not, the consciousness doesn't die. It just recedes back into the everythingness of the pattern. So. Can I ask you something? Sure. Quickly. So, you know, what you're describing is beautiful in the way articulating is very beautiful. Thank you. So, uh, just something really kind of bothered me, man. I've been listening to the screw tape letters by C.S. Lewis. Okay. Have you ever read? Not familiar. Oh, they're good. Okay. You know, but they're a little dogmatic. You know, C.S. Lewis is a Christian apologist. Oh yeah. It gets a little dogmatic. That's kind of Christian. Yeah, but it's cool, man. And it's, so basically it's kind of tongue in cheek letters from an older demon to an apprentice demon on how to tempt a human being. I gotcha. So, from the Christian paradigm, it's a very severe line that we're walking, man, which is either you're moving towards the light or you're getting sucked into hell. And so the sort of in Buddhism and in more Eastern religions, these aspects of the human personality, which may be in Western psychology, they call neurosis. In Buddhism, they might just call it the sort of projections of aspects of yourself, but in Christianity, it's fucking demons. And the demons are actively trying to fuck up your life. And so this is an older demon writing to a younger demon who's been assigned to some guy about how to fuck up his life. So, the older demon at one point talks about how the best thing that can happen when you're human comes to a realization that there is God, is for that human, when they're around their friends who are scientific materialists, just stay quiet about this realization because just be quiet, but inside they can feel like they're in a weird way rubbing off on their friends, maybe. And then when they're around their other friends who maybe do believe in this idea of God, don't talk about your scientific materialist friends or these ideas because, you know, your friends really believe in God, they wouldn't understand. So he's like, if you can get this into their head, then you get them lying to everyone. You know what I mean? If you can make it happen. And it's something where it's like, I think now that we're in the psychedelic revolution, and so many people are experiencing ayahuasca and mushrooms and having these divine revelations, it's put us all in a really interesting predicament, which is, let's face it, man, it's not cool to use the G word. It makes you sound like a fucking idiot, man. And so, but what do we do? What do you do? This is something I had Amber Lyon on. She said, don't make any plans when you go to take ayahuasca. Don't make any plans for the next month. But what happens when the things that you're realizing from these substances are so real that it causes you to either continue living a lie or to reshape your life? How do you deal with that? What is your solution to the people who've had these realizations and yet are surrounded by friends who are going to think you're off your fucking rocker if you start talking about it? That's a great question. Number one, I mean, the short answer is I reshape my life. The second, the longer answer is I, when you're, when you, when you were describing, I forgot for a second that you were describing it in the context of this is a demon describing to another demon how you get humans. Because I'm like, oh yeah, that's what I do. That's the, that's exactly what I do. I mean, like if I have, I mean, I don't hide the fact that I care about this thing and that I, and I'll get, actually, I'll get back to this in a second because the finish, the, to the story that I was about to tell or the, the path that I was moving towards is when Zach and I talk about like, we don't know, we don't, we don't have any to fit like the idea that religious faith, you know, that when people are like, I know, like we're human, we're, this is a human body and it's flawed and it's impossible to have any degree of certainty. Like what I believed 10 years ago is not what I believe now. Like who knows what I'll believe in 10 years. Like I'm, I think I'm wiser now, but also, you know, I complete, I'm continually being filled and emptied and refilled with different physical parts and met, you know, mental emotional experiences. But the Zach put it like, either Zach put it like this or I, this is now my read. This is Zach's like the, the, the, the prophet and I'm like just whoever tells the story about the prophet and it's probably just my own story. But I think this is based on, I don't want to do him a disservice, but like, he's like, if somebody asked me, like, do you know what happens when we die or like, what do you, what do you think happens when we die or like, you know, what is your idea? And he'd say like, I definitely don't know what happens, but if I do know it's exactly like this and it's like the, and then we could describe like the visual and sensory experience that we have when we're going through this experience that, you know, the human body or mind or brain does go through when this chemical is in there. So I, the idea of even the word like belief, like none of the words, none of the words work perfectly. So like when I say like, do I, the, the idea of being that person who has this feeling of like, oh yeah, I'm a, I mean, whatever, whatever God means, I'm a part of it. Yeah. I'm a, and if you're like, you believe in like, I'm like, oh, didn't, you know, create like the universe seems to be here. Like, I don't know what I, none of us knows how, if the big bang did the thing that science is like, yeah, that seems like the thing. Yeah. Uh, yeah, that something it was all in one point and now it's all over the place. And yeah, I don't, I, there's so many answers I don't have, but I'm like, I'm here. And I do have this feeling when I was in college, I took some, you know, I was a philosophy major and my personally, I was like, okay, I don't know if there's an afterlife. Like certainly the idea that like God is a, a being that cares and loves like, well, couldn't, then why doesn't God like make it so that everybody's feeling good more? You know, like that, that's like the, the classic. Like, yeah, I saw someone on Reddit posted a great debate and the debate uses an example, like you're trying to, okay. So the idea is, if we have a God that has any kind of ethical or moral sense at all, then let's imagine, I think they tried to pick, they tried to create the most extreme version of absurd suffering that they could come up with. And I think it was like a animal dying in a, after a forest fire. I can't remember, they just described this like thing that dies for no reason. Yeah. A baby and, you know, is alive only suffers and then dies. And so then like, and so if you, there was some creative outflow that had any kind of intelligence and was somehow omniscient. Why'd you do that? Yeah. You would want to ask that, like, if I'm like, hey man, look at this thing I made. Yeah. And somewhere in there, you're like, hey dude, are you aware that there's a baby? And you must be aware. That's getting, yeah. You know, why did you put the baby getting its foot chewed off by the dog in the house that it can't get out of? Why did you put that in there? Are you feeling okay? Yeah. And so of course, like, I forget the exact phrase that I had Ramin Nazar on my podcast a separate time then when you were there. And he used the phrase like the phrase of not God, but like sort of the universal cohesiveness or some, some combination of, you know, a couple words that was just like the, the everythingness that we're all a part of that, you know, we like, as humans, we're fallible. And we are part of what makes up God. So God is fallible. Like because if God is everywhere and we're part of it, then there's parts of it that are fallible. There's parts of it that are going to, there's going to be accidents. There's, I mean, from our perspective, we almost have to become like, or you could, you could look at it more of like, you know, what if there was some kind of super advanced simulation where you don't just experience one character in the simulation, but you go into the simulation. And for some period of time, you experience every single avatar in the simulation, its birth, its death, and the higher the level, the more intense the rush. Then you realize that this planet would be almost like a drug that a higher consciousness would experience through all manifestations of life or something. And that way, it's not so much that the thing is evil. It's that it just wanted to get off on this. Get all the experiences. Yeah. And that's the thing that reminds me of, I think when I listened to Bo Burnham on Pete Holmes' podcast, I think Bo presented, he said that he'd read a story where every, again, this might be my retelling of it, but my understanding wasn't that like, after, you know, each person, each consciousness, each being in the universe, ultimately we were only like, say there was only one soul, and then it continually was reincarnated as each and every other being at all times in all places. So that eventually, you know, this soul, like right now we're us. And it's not like, not say that like, if you're good, you get to be a better thing. And if you're bad, you get to be a worse thing, just you get, you are everything. You will eventually be Hitler. You will be every Jew and gay person that Hitler murdered. You will be, you know, every victim, every victimizer, every, you know, every, every experience. And that's just every idiot making Hitler memes. Oh yeah. You'll be all of them. So the idea of when, similar to, you know, the question that's asked of my hypothetical Zach Prophet, like if somebody says to me like, what do I believe? Like belief isn't important to me. I mean, I have beliefs and they can be wrong and they can be fallible. But believe, one of my beliefs is that belief isn't even the important thing. Like so many people who care about a specific dogmatic version of like a religion, like Christianity or Catholicism is like somehow belief in the thing becomes the important thing. And that's the finger pointing at the moon. Like the moon has to be kindness. The moon has to be what Jesus would do, not whether or not he was actually magic or God's son. You mean like faith? Like yes. We believe, how does it go? God damn it. It goes on the third day. It's called the Nicene Creed. Have you ever heard this before? No, I'll look it up. It goes something on the lines. If I don't remember it, I used to have to say it when I went to my parents took me to church, but it's like everyone chants it in this really monotone way. And it goes, you know, why don't I just read it right now? Oh, sure. It goes, and you have to chant it in this really Nicene Creed. It goes, let me find it. Nicene Creed. Let's see. Of course, I won't build up. Let me just pause it really quickly and find. Okay, here it is. I found it. It goes, we believe in one God, the Father Almighty, maker of all things visible and invisible. And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, begotten of the Father, the only begotten that is of the essence of the Father, God of God, light of light, very God, a very God, very God, very God of you. Begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made, who for us men and for ourselves, not women, who for us men and for our salvation came down and was incarnate and was made man. He suffered and the third day he rose again, ascended into heaven, from thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead. What the fuck? Oh, yeah. That is so psychedelic and weird. No, but look, I don't know what any, I bear, and I had to say it over and over again. The quick and the fucking dead, what does that mean? As a Sharon Stone western movie. That's what it is, do you know what that means, the quick and the dead? I mean, it sounds like all of us, like we're all quickly dead. I mean, that's the thing, if the idea that Jesus is the Son of God, like we're all, you know, if we're all created by God, we're all the children of God, like we're all, like I'm not saying Jesus, like we all suffer, we all have sins, like we're all constantly, like the same way that God's in all of us, that we're all constantly suffering and dying for our sins, other people's sins, not even sins, just like, that's experiences. But it's annoying when you get like some shit like that, and you're like, believe this. You just believe this, and you're going to be fine. And this is, that's annoying, and it's because there's a lot to swallow in that motherfucker, and it's not fair that you're going to make us believe every single piece of this weird echo that's been muttered in churches for a long time. Of course, like the way that, I forget who put this to me, but like, when I was saying what I was saying, it was like, oh yeah, I mean, to you. And so I'll say, to me, like, ethics is more important than metaphysics. Like, if you have to be either, here are your two choices. You can believe in a specific God and not do anything right, or you can do all the kind things, like do all the things that the Bible does say to do, or that your moral code, everything that people agree on, hey, this is the way to be a good person, do nice things, care for others, sacrifice yourself. But then like, I don't know about the belief. Like, you'd rather everybody be the person who does good things, and I'd rather everybody not believe and do good things than believe and not do good things. Right, well, yes, but the answer is, I think that if, so if you, well, I think, well, the problem is all this shit, it gets really distracting. Whereas when you take ayahuasca, or smoke DMT, or take a nice mushroom trip, or whatever the access point may be, holotrophic breath work, and you make contact with the thing itself, then all the words that these people are using to try to talk about it become completely irrelevant. But yet from that contact, you're going to change. That's the idea. So it's like, it's almost as though that I, the belief thing has somehow supplanted the connection. Yes. When the connection is all that matters. If you make the connection, if I plug my phone into the wall, it charges. If I don't, it doesn't charge. And a lot of people, I think, metaphysically, their phones are dead. Oh yeah. But they're looking at it, and they're like, yeah, it's a great phone. It's working just fine. And there's nothing, there's nothing there. It's a flat line. And because the plug-in sucks, if you're, if, this is the other thing in that C.S. Lewis book, that he says, to really deal with the fact that we live in a living universe, you know this, you're a vegan, to really deal with the fact, to really deal with the fact that the things that we eat have suffered for us. And not only that, but to deal with the fact that we have deeply impacted so many people that we've come across in our life, many of them maybe not in a good way because we were angry or blind or bored or stupid or young or whatever. That sucks. That produces a very unpopular feeling known as guilt. Oh yeah. Right? And so to deal with that fucking, to turn your eyes to the fact like, no man, this isn't just some random roll of fucking dice. You're not some sentient cloud of vapor that's just bumbling around the universe into you liquefying a bunch of mucky gray pulp. No, it's not like that. This is an interconnected living web that, that where pieces of the web like to feel love, and you're not, and you're not putting that shit out. You haven't been putting it out, not you, but you know what I mean? Yes. That's an uncomfortable feeling to deal with. And so many of us don't want to start going down the path at all because it involves initially being like, fuck, I heard a lot of people's feelings. Oh yeah. That's what ayahuasca shows you, right? Oh. That's what I've heard. It reveals that. Definitely. I like what, this one not unrelated idea, but the idea that like every animal that's eaten by a human is like Jesus dying for the sin of gluttony. Yeah. Or you know, just whatever that is. And I'm not saying like. The difference being the goddamn animal didn't get to walk on water and like get celebrated as a messiah, which is, by the way, meat. So I'm the biggest shit out of all time because I feel empathy in some way for these things, yet I'm still devouring them. I realized really like, god damn man, you might have to like get off this meat thing. We went to eat at this nice restaurant in Santa Monica and we ordered this thing called uni, which is a sea urchin. And usually they bring it out on a little, it's just a little orange mush that tastes really good. But they brought it out and it looked like a bean. They brought out the urchin and it was still alive. Oh sure. And the chef and this kind of proud or the waiter, the waiter and this proud way is like, it's still alive. Oh gosh. So now we're having to scoop this, I don't know what the uni part is. I don't know if it's brain, if it's digestive system, but it's like pulsating. You know, it's alive. You could see it like sort of like its last weird pulsations as we're scooping this goop out of it and eating it. And I, it, I was stoned and I like, I wanted to start crying into the fucking uni. Like it's just like, what, this can't be, and this is a vegetable, right? It's not supposed to feel at all, yet it seems to be alive. I mean, I think that sea urchins are, I mean, fish are animals. Like sea creatures are animals as well. I mean, according to some religions, you know, like, hey, don't eat meat on Friday, but also fish is fine. Like fish is just a swimming vegetable. Fish is not because they can't smile. Technically, according, but they can kind of walk on water. So we're back to Jesus. But yeah. Go ahead, man. I'm sort of all over the place here, man. Oh yeah. There is a question I want to ask you. Sure. Because you're a brilliant person. And this is something that I've been thinking a lot about and you seem to be inadvertently part of what I consider to be an emerging, unnamed global religion. Okay. As it's roots in ayahuasca. A lot of people don't realize that not just in ayahuasca, but in psychedelics, not just in psychedelics, but in a lot of, I don't know, very, very intelligent philosophical ideas that are floating around out there. But it hasn't, there is no profit for this thing yet. It hasn't congealed. Alistair Crowley talks about this. There might not be able to be one, like the same way that when a word is spoken, then it's not the right word. If a person's like, I'm the shaman, then they're not the thing, like you. Well, that's what I want to ask you about. Yeah. See, because there will be another world religion. Like if I had to bet money on it, there's going to be another world religion. Okay. Just as powerful as Christianity, just as powerful as Islam, just as powerful as Judaism, there's going to be another one because that's what we, there's a precedent set. In other words, like if we find life anywhere, if we find some DNA on a meteor, on a Mars anywhere, then it means it's fucking everywhere because, but right now, we've only found it here, so we have to just roll that. Okay. In the same way, religions appear on this planet. Yes. Massive society changing religions happen on this planet. And so my question for your genius is this, what will the next world religion look like? If you had to guess, even if you don't believe it's going to come, what would it look like? Who is the prophet and what does this thing manifest as? I mean, the thing that I like, the thing, if I'm a part of something, like it's not necessarily even, I think when people name things, we like to have, you know, we're big on like teams and the idea of like, you know, even like Eastern and Western religions or philosophies, like, but the idea, you know, there's Buddhism and Taoism and I don't necessarily have all the ways on which those are different things because there's things that I've read of each, then like, these seem to go together, but I'm certain that people who are more well-versed in either could point out the differences. Like, so I certainly, my brain, if I put all the stuff into it, maybe I could do the mechanical stuff necessary to have a more specific answer, though I do. Hold on. I'm making you the prophet. Okay. So, okay. Oh, then it's, then I got it. I'm John the Baptist. Yes. You're Jesus. I've anointed you the prophet of a new global religion. Yes. What does it look like, Lord Mike? Kindness is the thing. It's called kindness. It doesn't, if it has to have a name, kindness is the thing to do. The valuable, you know, actions to practice are, you know, forgiveness, self-forgiveness, forgiveness of others, basically, you know, gratitude, being thankful. Here, some, some prophets could be, I mean, like the Dalai Lama, he's big into kindness. You got your, Jesus would be on board. I like Ram Dass from what I've heard thus far, like he, because of him, I've started doing a thing that's kind of like saying grace before eating. What's that? Like, well, he says, he, he does a thing like, you know, before I eat, I take my food, my, the bowl of food in my hand and I like acknowledge that, you know, this food is part of the oneness of everything. I am part of the oneness of everything. This food will be a part of me. I will be eventually not this body part of everything. The hunger is part of me, part of the oneness of everything. This is all part of the oneness of everything, which you could call God if you want. And so then even like this prayer, this thanks, this thanks is part of everything and it's everything is connected and we're all this one thing. So the, the way that I do it now for as a, a shorthand kind of, but it's always some version of like, thank you, food God, thank you, me God, thank you, thank God, thank you, hunger God, thank you, fire of consumption of all this that will unify us. Thank you, everything God, thank you, thank God. And maybe I said that twice, but so the, and gratitude like through science, science shows that people who are more grateful are more likely to be happier. You're happy when you think about the things that you have rather than the things that you don't have, you know, when you're seeking that future God or anything, life, promotion, goal, thing, like you're thinking about what you lack as opposed to, you know, and it's not to say you should only be looking backward and be like, well, I'm happy with what I've done. You're moot, you're aimed forward and you're moving forward in time and you're taking actions that add up and do things. And so just every moment that you're existing, this, you know, in general or for this new religion, just be, you know, conscious, like, is this what I want to be doing now? Is this the direction I want to be facing? Like, what are the cons, the potential consequences of my actions? Like, are there, is it possible that I'll make a mistake? Have I hurt someone? Can I apologize? Can I undo it? Can I, the idea of, I thought about the movie Groundhog Day. I watched it with my girlfriend, she'd never seen it. We watched it right around Groundhog Day. This year. And then we did an ayahuasca ceremony, or I did at least later that week. And so Groundhog Day imagery was coming through my head and thinking about how, you know, he's living the same day over and over, eventually becoming a quote unquote better and better person because he's taking more and more helpful actions. By the end of it, he's like, oh, catch that kid. Don't let him fall. Help this person do the Heimlich. Every day, he's living it helping people, being helpful. And then I'm like, well, I can't do that. I don't live the same day over and over again, but I wronged somebody in the past. Oh, don't do that again. Next time that possibility comes up, don't do that. If, oh, I could, I didn't want to keep a monogamous commitment for more than a year. Well, then don't make a monogamous commitment, you know, make a commitment that isn't monogamous and see how that goes, you know, whatever. Or if somebody, somebody warns you that they're in a delicate state, please be careful with my feelings. And you're like, okay, I think, I think I'm doing that. And then you're like, oh, I wasn't doing that. Now, understand that other people's experiences are distinctly different than your own, just sort of, you know, caring, listening, trusting, believing, like believe other people. Like there's some people who are like, you know, when say there's a sexual assault and people like, well, what, how do you even know? Let's say it's a man and a woman. How do you even know that she's telling the truth? I'm like, doesn't matter. Like as far as forget about the person who did it, like if somebody says they were assaulted, if somebody says they were victimized, attacked, treat them like they're telling the truth and care for them and help them. And then at some point also we live in a society where we're like, oh, if, if we determine that, you know, if the legal system determines that she wants to move forward and find out and try to be like, is this, like, is this true? Then can we prove it? What are the consequences? Like, but the consequences on the doer are not as important initially as just believing, believing and caring. Like, So let me ask you, as the prophet of this new religion, what is the part of this self that when, for example, you will find yourself engaged in some bit of vileness, not in the massive way, but what you're saying is really true. Just here's a person who probably needs you to give them love and compassion. And yet you're playing some game of tough love with them, whatever, detective or some shit. Oh yeah. How and I think for some people, this game becomes their entire life. Yes, they go into a never ending series of shitty interactions with people because, Hey, this is who I am. But somewhere inside, there's a terrible awareness that what they're doing is no longer serving any purpose outside of generating more pain in the universe. So what do you do when you find yourself in the midst of that kind of life when you realize that you have been fucking shit up? And even when you know I shouldn't do this, the opportunity comes to give love and you don't give love. There you are again engaged in some minor form of stabbing somebody with an invisible linguistic knife or whatever. Or pulling a surgeon's brain out and eating it. Yes. How do we pull ourselves out of the nosedive of cruelty that's so easy to get sucked into, even if it's minor. I'm not talking about, okay, go. I have one suggestion as an answer. We like to, there are people, I think many people conceive of themselves as a certain being, a certain self, a certain type of being with certain characteristics. Of course, over the course of life, the characteristics can change. But at any given moment, we know everyone that we've been, we know everything that we've done that we have in our memory. And so we're like, Oh, I'm this kind of person. I'm the kind of person. Like when people talk to me about being vegan and I certainly about how they could never do it. I could never give up cheese or I don't want to. Like Louis CK had a great joke once where he's like, Oh, eating animals is wrong. I know that eating animals is wrong. I just don't care that it's wrong. And that's like the this, you know, beautiful, tragic dichotomy of human experience. Like, of course, people do things that they know are wrong, because they aren't that was like, But it's me. I don't care about the not me. I mean, one way is to conceive of like, as a comedian, sometimes you see other people achieve things you're like, Oh, if I, if only this body, if this consciousness could have achieved that, but thinking of us as all one, I'm like, Oh, I did it. You know, like we did it. Like the human race did it. You know, we did the horrible things. We did the great things. But specifically for an individual, you know, an individual, the human sheet over the electronic ghosts or whatever. Energy do here's the thing. Remember that you're not like, you're not the same skin cells even you're not you're not the same anything over and over. So the idea of who you of who you are, like, Oh, I'm a person who did that one bad thing. I'm a person who did 100. I guess I'm the kind of person that hurts people. And like, a reason that people don't become like vegans, like, I don't think I could do it all the time. Like, what if I fail like, so I couldn't, I can't look at what but so they think of it all or nothing. They're like, Well, I tried I failed the end. But so I would I encourage people to not think of anything as all or nothing, because that will often make you default to nothing. If you can't do all and no one can do all no one can do all of anything. What you can do is like the same way that you know, in Groundhog Day, life was infinite. You know, he he was a dick for a long time. He killed himself so many times before he was like, Well, I guess I'll just try to change one good thing at a time one little so try if there's something that you think you can do. You're like, I've been I did a vibe. I've been vile. Don't think I've been vile for so long. So I have to do it my whole life. All vile or no vile. And it's been it's been vile. So it can't be no vile. So it has to be all vile. So no, it's way, it's way better to be, you know, a dick for half your life and not a dick for the rest of your life than it is just feel well, I guess I'm just a dick forever. Yeah. Thank you, profit. I do what I can. Thank you very much. And thank you so much for coming on. Oh, thank you, man. I can't believe we've been talking now for over an hour. It feels like a second.

They think it was trying to communicate through vibration, but ultimately the family of Mackenzie decided to just pull the plug and the asshole perished. And now a prayer from Mackenzie by Rev. Oh great eternal spirit, please comfort us and bless our hearts. Allow us to see through the veils that we understand that that which is gone is but temporarily gone and that which is here shall not remain. Alighten us in a way that will give us the compassion and peace necessary to our poor neighbors and to forgive those who has harmed us. Most importantly may we not turn into quivering massive assholes on the floor of some Berlin apartment trembling and queefing away and eventually removed from life support. Let us understand that there is but one law of power and that is the law of love. It is the only law of power that offers us the hope of never mutating into a terrible, stinking, giant, quivering anus. Amen. For those who aren't familiar with Reverend Gertz, he lives on a 300 acre compound in Idaho and here's a note from Reverend Gertz to my listeners. The Lord has commanded me to send this message out to the seven nations and all the churches of the land. I am seeking a new wife, a wife who is fertile, young and ready to endure the awful burden of sex that must be unleashed upon her so that we can create more humans. Wife applicants must be of legal age and comfortable with the burden of oral sex. Sincerely Reverend Gertz. Well there you go folks, looks like a pretty great pandemic opportunity. If you feel the call, go ahead and apply and maybe you could end up being impregnated by one of the great reverends of our nation. We've got an incredible podcast for you today. Raghu Marcus is here.

Look, I don't need to remind you of what's going on out there. You know that some of the greatest musicians on our planet are being attacked by wild boars. And it's only a coincidence that if you sign up for the DTFH Patreon, then you could hang out with us for our weekly meditation group, which is called Journey into Boredom. Not B-O-A-R, dumb, but boredom. Look, I have to read this. My attorney's telling me to read this whenever I do the Patreon plug, which is we are not responsible for any of the wild animal attacks that have been happening across this planet. There is no correlation between these animal attacks and not subscribing to the DTFH Patreon. We do not have a device that we uncovered in an ancient burial site in Iraq. We do not know how to pronounce Iraq. So that's what I got to read. We hope you will join your family at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. I don't think it's too late to join us. We're actually working on an anthology of erotic cryptid stories right now and you could get in on that. Again, it's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. And now everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH, the person who literally brought me to Ram Dass. He drove me to Ram Dass' house where I got to hang out with him. He runs Ram Dass' foundation. The Love Serve Remember Foundation and they do incredible events, including the Ram Dass retreats in Maui that you always hear me yapping about. They've got one coming up. If you're lucky enough to be in LA, it's on Sunday, October 24th. Starts at 10 a.m. at Wisdom. You can find all the info at Ram Dass.org. It's a huge event, basically a festival that ends with an amazing evening concert with Krishna Das, John Forte, East Forest, and Justin Beretta from the Glitch Mob. So it sounds super fun. If you're not going to be in LA, they're going to be streaming it. So you can go to Ram Dass.org and register and watch it from wherever you may be. Alright everybody, now welcome to the DTFH. Raghu Marcus. Welcome! Raghu, welcome back. Duncan, thanks. I can't see you. Great to be here again. I smell because of COVID and I've been asking Aaron to like describe smells for me. What about taste? I still somehow have maintained my taste, which is really weird. I wonder what's better. I think having your taste is better than... I mean, you've got to lose one taste. Oh, gosh. For sure. Taste is way... I mean, with smell, it's more embarrassing, but you're not the one... You know what I mean? You can't smell yourself. So it's like just people are probably being polite around me. You know what I mean? Because I know sometimes I get... I come home from the studio and Aaron's like, you stink. And I'm like, oh, shit. And I can't tell. But this... It's fun to get people to describe smells. I'm realizing. And one question... I've asked you a lot of questions about meme curly baba over the years, but one question I've never asked you. And as I can recall, I've never heard anyone talk about it at the Ram Dass retreats. What did meme curly baba smell like? Out of all the questions that could be asked about such a thing. I mean, it is... I think very recently I did say to somebody, I don't know why it came up. Maybe same reason, COVID, losing your sense of smell. Yeah. And everybody that you would talk to, that you know from the retreats or whatever Ram Dass is friends, they will tell you the exact same thing. So it's not me and my subjective thing. It's basically a baby blanket. Wow. So when you got close and you had your head in that, if you managed to get, you know, and just the blanket was everywhere. So it was like not that hard to... Yeah. And yeah, it was amazing. Absolutely amazing that it had that, which you know so well with a baby and a small child. Luckily I could still, if I really shove my nose into Dune's hair and smell, I could smell that smell. And it is the, it has got to be the greatest, the baby's smell is got to be the greatest smell there is. That is amazing that he smelled like that. You know, this is something before I, I didn't know what you would say honestly. I thought maybe you might say incense or something, but this is something... There was not too much incense around him. I've heard this like, I've heard this before, that like certain beings that like, it's not just as though you like emanate something or it's not just like everything that comes out of your mouth is like authentically loving, but that your smell changes, that everything about them has shifted in some way. Now wait a minute. Okay. Can I tell, you just said, you know, like a being that's no longer caught in us and them. There's no polarization. Okay. That level of a being, you know, people might use the word enlightenment or whatever, but so, and that nothing would come out of him except just words of love and wisdom all the time, right? Yes. You just said that. Yeah. So, I mean, this is a weird kind of intersection with what you're talking about, but it so happens that I've been working on a film of one of our mentors. I think you know K.C. Tawari. Krishna talks about him all the time. You know, somebody who was a regular guy, who was a school master and wore his tie and jacket every day and yet was a knocked out yogi with powers that nobody knew about. Right. It's extraordinary. It's worth it. Hopefully, people enjoy it's worth a view. So, he, in this film, Tawari describes one day, it was a special day, one of the high holidays of Hinduism or whatever, maybe Durrapuja in the fall, which is coming up actually. And Tawari went, so they have a fire ceremony and in it you are offering up everything through different elements of yogurt and rice and fruit and so on. It's a, you know, and it just goes on like 12 hours and this constant swaha, you've heard swaha? Yes. It's the, here it is, swaha, swaha. So, Tawari told him suddenly, he hears this voice yelling out from across the courtyard. Right. And it's Nim Karoli Baba, it's Maharaj. And they had, I had to get this translated. I hope I can find the damn thing. Yeah, here it is. Would you like to hear what he says? You know, it's a little bit of, you know, putting it into idiosyncras terms. Yeah. Shall we say? Okay, so that's the picture. You get the picture, Tawari's out there. And Tawari, part of this. I can't see the picture. No, I'm telling you the picture. There's no picture. Oh, okay. In your mind's eye, you see this fire ceremony with people around it in this, in this small hut in the middle of the foothills of the Himalayas. Just imagine that. And then, so Tawari goes there, who I mentioned is really a knocked out yogi. In other words, whenever any kind of representation in any way of the divine presence comes around him, he goes into a deep absorbed state where he is not, there's no pulse, you hear about it, you read about it in books about, you know, these kinds of states, they're called samadhi. Yes. And so he would do that all the time. So he's out there, and as soon as he sits down, he's gone. And then, but he comes to, and he hears this voice screaming from across the courtyard of Nim Karoli Baba going, enough swaha, swaha. This jerk is dead, meaning he's in a trance. There's too much swaha. Swaha has been done too much. God is dead from hunger. While you, you jerk keep doing swaha, swaha. That's the exact, you know, pretty exact translation that we got of the Hindi, because we did, I knew a little bit of what he was saying because I speak enough Hindi, but yeah. So that's the words of love and wisdom from Maharaj. Which basically it is true, because what he's saying is, you can do these rituals from here to forever and repeat, you know, all these mantras. Unless it's coming from a place of real depth. This is me, by the way, talking. I'm interpreting this. This isn't him saying this, anything. But unless it's coming from a much deeper place, it's just like meditation or anything. You're just doing it and fulfilling a function that you have created on a day to day basis. So the only good thing is that one day you will wake up. We do wake up. You know, it might take 20, 30 years. I don't know. Or lifetimes. Yeah, or lifetimes. Well, certainly lifetime. But just to wake up enough to have awareness and any kind of spaciousness within the practice rather than I'm doing this is, so yeah. He was just hitting out it. You think you're doing, you're just doing these swahas, right? Great. Very good. You know, I found, I listened to you on Instagram, Neem Karoli Baba talking. I'd never heard this before. I've heard him chanting Ram. But he was talking to a family and I read the translation. And the translation was exactly as Ram Das talked about how he would get frustrated sometimes because Neem Karoli Baba would ask him what we would think of as mundane stuff. You know, I would want to talk about the news or I would want to talk about, you know, earth realm stuff. But you know, listening to his voice, it's just so powerful. And it helps not knowing what he's saying. A deep thank you to Amazon Music for sponsoring this episode. If you love listening to podcasts, you are going to love Amazon Music.

Just hearing the rhythm and the sweetness in his words, and then when the translation was, he was just like help advising a family. He was saying to a mother, he was asking if she still yells at her child. She was saying to him, not anymore. You told me not to be angry with him anymore. So I'm not anymore. And he's saying your son is a gentleman. And then, or whatever that translation is, and then asking her, do you eat at the table? Are you eating at the table? So it makes sense he smells like a child. It makes sense it's not incense. It makes sense that he just sounds like pure human before all the bullshit, I guess. Well, what we heard people, before the temples were built, is that you or me? That's me. I think I live near like someone who's very sick because the fire trucks are always going there. That's great. So he used to stay with families all the time. He did not... I mean, it's pretty terrific. He was just taking care. They told me, these people who he stayed with, he took care as if he was involved with everything, from the kid getting a cold and not being able to go to school. Actually, his own daughter, we said, what was he like as a father to you? And she said, all I know is he did things like, he would walk me to school and he would hold an umbrella over my head to protect me from the severe sun where they were. And that's all I remember. I only remember kindness and like that. Nothing else. It's all of it is very in opposition to each fact that you might find out like that. But it made sense to all... Who cares about any of this though, Duncan? Gee whiz, is this sounding like a... Well, it sounds like more of a conversation I might have privately with Christendass and we just talk about the old days. I just wanted to talk about Niam Koli Baba with you. And I think, yes. And I think people... I mean, because I love the stories and having a family now especially, before I had a family, it didn't hit quite as hard. But now having a family and hearing the stories and having had moments of like, wow, just taking care of Erin when she's sick, doing basic stuff around the house. How is this making me the same level of happy that before I would have to like go to Burning Man and be doing all kinds of drugs and like comping and like to not even... And it wouldn't even approximate that. And you know, this makes me think of Niam Koli Baba. And that sim... And also of Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche and his teaching on spiritual materialism, this idea of like, look, we can cut through all of this lofty bullshit and get to a really simple sort of place that isn't plagued by all the bells and whistles. So that's the... Yes! Be here now. There we are. You should write a book. That's a good title for a book. You can't see what I just did because he doesn't put this shit up on YouTube. Well, I was thinking actually about... Of course, this being the 50th anniversary of Be Here Now, the book was published in 71. Wow. And all the stories that are around that and how this has been such a, you know, definitive part of who Ram Dass is as a teacher, has been as a teacher till his death and as it goes on day to day. I used to laugh with him when you're not here. You know, nobody will know because we just keep putting the same shit out all the time. So we do develop new things because we have a lot of good friends that are great teachers from Jack Cornfield and on. And Christian Dass, so... But the reality is that... I started thinking about this is just a... Like we got the trademark for that term just. You know, who had it? An insurance company. Wait, you've trademarked the term Be Here Now? They trademarked Be Here Now. So they had control over its use. Oh, my God. So somebody found out, wait a minute, we can't let that happen. That's terrible. And we actually managed after a couple of years. They weren't really that interested in the bottom line. So then just... So you're talking about this being that we were so fortunate to be around all those years ago and the way that it was just complete present all the time and presence. So I started thinking about Be Here Now instead of just as an aphorism. But what are we really talking about in terms of the efficacy of it? And I started thinking of present, being in the present moment, the most obvious thing. We're not thinking about the future and not thinking about the past. And what happens when that stops, that back and forth and then maybe there's enough of a slowing down so that you actually start to feel something. So the feeling something is the presence. So it's like present slash presence is really what Be Here Now is. And that's what Ram Dass experienced the first time. He went to India with this being named Karoli Baba. It's what we all experienced as well. And it was invaluable to be around somebody who was no longer in time and space. In other words, no longer in polarity. No inner polarity. You know, this is actually in the UFO communities. One of the descriptors that is popping up now is extratemporal instead of extraterrestrial. Something outside of time coming into time to hang out with all of us timelings. So is that how you would describe him, extratemporal? In those terms, yeah, absolutely. It was not somebody that you could recognize that way. That thing didn't talk to you the way we can talk to each other. There was no teaching going on. It was more being. And of course he would say things that became aphorisms for him. Sub-ec, it's all one. There is only one thing going on. But he didn't say any of that. He'd point his finger and go, it's all one. So he was just driving out of this mind shit through those aphoristic, if that's a word, things that he said. But the level of it beyond the words and the simplicity of it is extraordinary. And by the way, of course we all did very mischievous and stupid things. Never mind just the shit that was in our heads. So everybody out there, Duncan and I did something one time in a retreat and they had let me play the harmonium they had and our friends and so on. Anyway, it was fantastic harmonium. And more expensive than anything you could ever dream of in India. But Ed German reads, it was really good. And so I was appreciating it a lot. So Duncan, through the goodness of his heart, actually gave it to me as a present later. It was based on a story of me with name Karoli Baba. One of us, one of the Westerners at one time had made a lot of stamps of pictures of him. Fun things and we all had them and he used to take them and then he'd give me those stamps and he'd give them out to people and everything. And of course he'd give all of them to the worst representative of the group or something, you know, some egomaniac guy you were judging, you know, whatever. And so one day I was across the courtyard and I did have some with me but I had already used a bunch of them so I didn't have much. And he yelled out, anybody got any stamps? Through the translator of course. Maharaj, you want some stamps? Oh, okay. And I took this sheet of stamps out of my bag and this is no fancy mind reading, nothing like that bullshit. I ripped the stamps, the sheet in half, right in front of him. And I gave him half. He looked at me like I had just done the worst thing that you could kill the guru or something. I mean, he looked like I really made a, I mean, are you serious? And then he threw them back at me. It's a good thing I didn't commit suicide right now. I was rather embarrassed and completely, you know, even as I repeat it, it's like horrible. Anyhow, I went back, I was back there with the same stamps a week later and anybody got any stamps? I gave them everything. He looked at them and he looked at the translator and then he looked back at me and he did the thing, you can see him in pictures, which is point his finger up. You know, it's either, it's all one or watch out Schmuck. It's more like that was. So, and then so Duncan wrote, thanks for the, well, thanks for the stamps. Thanks for the stamps on my harmonium, which is still there. Well, because ever since then you have been giving us stamps in the form of these incredible retreats and bringing everybody together and all the insane work you do to keep the stamps flowing. It's no simple thing to wrangle a bunch of boxy hippies. I'm sure and get somehow like get them to harmonize enough to do it. So yeah, a minute. Thanks for the stamps. I mean, I wouldn't be wondering how named Crowley Baba smelled if I didn't have you as a friend. That's a wonderful friendship qualification. It sure is. It is what it is though. It's called satsang and we're a community, so we're really fortunate. You become so nice though after all these years. What happened to that other guy? We had so much fun. He ruined me. I did. Doug, you catch me on, catch me on like a low blood sugar day. I'll be a complete fucking asshole. I just feel, I just feel happy today. Don't worry, Raku. I'll tell you what, I'll call you the next time I'm deeply angry and paranoid and yell at you. Now, but why the fuck are we so scared of this present moment thing? David Nickton was telling me it's called the fourth moment actually in the sense that really though by the time you're like, wow, I was just in the moment. You're not in the moment anymore, but there's this out of out of time and space place fourth moment, whatever you want to call it. But why the fuck are people seemingly so adverse to being in that place to the point that they had to travel to India to be around some being that allowed them to experience that or be in it or people have all kinds of quests they go on just for a taste of this thing that's theoretically in you is you all around you. Why are we always trying to evade the place where theoretically all things are like new and reborn and pure and everything smells like a baby. Well, the fact that it's already right there, it's there. You just got to, you know, jive with it. It's the advice. You'd become an advice a little bit or that's an advice question. It's already here within us completely. There's nothing to look for nowhere to go and nothing to do but realize that fact. And if anybody can, that's not a path that I have any real connectivity with that young path, honestly. Although I do believe that especially Tibetan Buddhists, you know, you and I have affection for Tibetan Buddhist philosophy and their version of reality jives best with whatever projections and beliefs that I've developed. Yeah. And so but the reason that all of us and we all do it where we turn away from the present and the presence is because it's and it's very analogous analogous to a psychedelic trip where at one point the letting go there is a letting go. There's a little trigger there. And the fear is that you won't be around to protect this eye. Me, me, me, me, me. Yes. You won't be around. Yes. Who the hell is going to manage this thing? You know, and already got a tremendous amount of events systems built in to protect everything, you know. So that the idea of losing separation, which is our habitual pattern is very scary. Yeah. Very scary. Now, in a moment to moment, like there are people who might get with. I won't, I won't say Maharaj in this case because it too set apart as somebody that you can't even get to without some tremendous karmic predilection, whatever I should suppose. I don't really know. But I'm talking just about like getting with somebody who like Ramdas. Yeah. And who's available, who was available and so on. And there's a way in with as soon as you get into that presence of somebody, he's just, he is just being here now. I mean, he then the being here now was completely tied to connecting in the love part of each of me, of you, from him. It was all one thing and it was all interconnected because he wasn't afraid to be there. And, you know, how he would just pull you in with his eyes and just stay there. I mean, many people though would advert. So you would virtualize because it's just, I don't know if I can go, you know. Yes. I just don't know. I don't, I don't feel enough trust. And that's how. So that we get back to what you and I have talked a lot about, which is the importance of trust absolutely need to find that intuitive trust inside ourselves when and then meeting any situations. David Nick turn would talk about then meeting with any phenomena takes on a completely different hue and a different relationship, a different perspective from that place. But okay, fear is real. And we all have tremendous ways in which we defend ourselves from all sorts of things related to our roles and identities and our relationships and all of that. So I think that what we all need to do is find that place where we can start to do as Trump or Rinpoche talks about a lot around meditation, create a gap. And if we can get that, that gap precludes chasing and believing these thoughts. So once that gap is there, we can create enough spaciousness so that we are way more open to the power of, in this case, using Ram Dass as an example, you would sit there and just, just become goo with him. And there wouldn't be any fear. Wow. I want to thank Blue Chew for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Fall is here, friends. The leaves are spiraling down from the beautiful trees.

Well, it's like, you know, it seems like we live in the age of not trusting. We live in an age of cynicism, bitterness, loneliness, and a kind of what you call deconstructive nihilism or something where it's like people are... just not trusting anything at all. Is this some projection or something? Like, I mean, surely it makes sense to not trust people. There are certainly people who are most definitely counting on you trusting them so they could exploit you. Certainly you shouldn't trust that. Like, and I think maybe people have had so many disappointments from, you know, the world that all of a sudden what? So I trust this guy, you know, Ram Dass or I'm supposed to trust this teacher, that teacher or whatever. How? How to overcome, you know, all the lifetime of gradual growing paranoia. At least, you know, having been like steeped in the global geopolitical climate that we've all been steeped in over the last probably our entire lifetimes. I'm going to say, well, how would you feel if you were locked in a room for a year and a half? Boy, it'd get paranoid and that's what's happened to a huge population, worldwide population. So looking at that is, it's good to have a way to look inside when you don't have nothing else going in after, you know, you can't watch that much TV. So it's good to have a way to look inside to see what is behind. Potentially, of course, you have to understand there is something that's behind our senses, thoughts, et cetera, et cetera. So unless that happens, unfortunately, that wheel will will continue and very difficult to get beyond that paranoia. And the polarization, well, we are living it. I mean, what we've done to the environment, which is part and parcel with what this virus is and the way it's behaving. It's like it's got its own personality or something. Oh, yeah, now we're going to feel, I just read something. Today, we're going to figure out the virus goes. How do we get this aerosol thing going a little bit better? So it's smaller and it's going to be harder for it to be warded off and much easier to transmit. I read that today. What do you mean? Someone's trying to do that? No, the virus is doing that. It is morphing so that it's the way in which the aerosols. Yeah, yeah. Any help? But wait, I want to, before I forget. And I, and in the, to go back to this concept, which is so incredibly simple yet, maybe because of its simplicity, incredibly confusing, the sub-ec idea, all one. Who is trusting here? If we're, you know, trust, and it's, we're talking about, I guess, when, when, when they talk about ignorance, they say it's actively ignoring. This kind of trust sounds like a verb to me. It's like, is it a verb? Is it like, in other words, and I like the closest I can come to it. I mean, I've certainly felt that around Ram Dass, and I've certainly felt that around the entire spiritual community, my own paranoia and fear, my own grudge holding, my own, like, I'm not going to let them in. I can't, I can't. I'll be destroyed feeling. But what is that that's, that's pushing back? What is the, what is the part that is not trusting? And what, if you had to describe the action of trusting, who is doing that action? If it's true trust, and it seems to me, there is, it's not a thought, it's a feeling. It's not a thought. Oh, I can trust him now. I mean, I go back to, I use Ram Dass as an example, because it's the most glaring example led me to India and all that, in terms of real trust. But it wasn't that. It was trusting. There was a place where I absolutely was 100% certain that his being in this field through, through his, you know, we were just engaging through eyes and being in that, that field. So once that started, I'm just thinking back to, you know, what it was. And I had it other times with other, with him and other people, but a certain kind of timelessness. Now it's okay, we can just, I can just be here. This is cool. Yeah. And unconditionality. He's not thinking about me. There's no judge. And there's nothing going on. He's just here. I don't, I don't know Ramda. I only met him that moment. So I had, there was no baggage in any way whatsoever. And I just, that was the moment. It was just that. So later on, I can tell this story and say, so that created tremendous trust, which is more of the thought. And that's after the fact. It's after the fact. Because we're talking about this. It's like, you know, I love reading about neutron stars, crazy shit, crazy shit. These things are so dense. Once something gets pulled into it, you're just, you're part of the star now. Like there's no whatever, whatever chunk of meteor asteroid or whatever, you're just in the new, you're in it. Maybe that's what truth is. Truth is a kind of neutron star that once you're in the truth, trust is an afterthought. Yeah. No, there's no thought. Yeah. That's just. You don't trust gravity. It's not like when I'm jumping up, I'm like, oh, are you going to let me come back down this time? Yeah. Yeah. That's a perfect example, I think gravity and being up in one of the ships that these people are all going up as tourists. And, you know, the feeling of, I have to imagine a floating like that, the freedom and letting go isness. Letting go, it must be exhilarating beyond anything. And that's a perfect example of being in the moment. Being in the presence is that, but everybody's had that, I think, at one time. It may get, you know, maybe when you were a kid and it got, then it got beaten out of yours. Yes. Or whatever, or you're crazy, whatever families do to each other. And, but I, and then eventually maybe, you know, you used psychedelic as a therapeutic thing. Yeah. And then that moment shows up. Once you, but once you get them, however you get them, for me, it was John Coltrane. It's my famous John Coltrane story of hearing him and going out of my little. 17, 18 year old body, whatever. So it can happen anyway. And once it happens, then, I mean, for me, and I know you as well, I don't want to be miserable. And I was miserable. So now I, there is a something. So how do I get that something? Right. And that's what led, you know, that's what that trust is in the moment, not the person or not the thing in the moment of where there isn't me and you. And there's just this gooey unconditionality. I would call it gooey unconditionality. Yeah. I probably, the heart Krishna founder used to really roast space programs in general. Really? He thought it was ridiculous that humans were so attached to their body that they were putting themselves in cans, as he would put it, to go out of the planet's atmosphere for a little bit and then come back. I thought that was ridiculous because it was a complete misunderstanding of what humans can do spiritually. And Terrence McKenna used to make a joke about one of these massive telescopes trying to find alien life because underneath one of them, I can't remember which one, psilocybin mushrooms grew. And he would say how funny it is that like they've spent all this money on this equipment to scan the skies for advanced life when just underneath these radio telescopes are something that if you eat them, you can talk to beings in the astral realm or whatever. I think there's something cool. I would never say no if someone invited me to go into space, but this state of consciousness or this ground of truth or fundamental goodness as it's described in Tibetan Buddhism. I think it would make the experience of being in an anti-gravity field pale in comparison to a simple reacquaintance with just where you're at right now. This is maybe one of the almost tragic qualities of humanity, right? That the problem is everyone's off to the races imagining what's on the other side of whatever. Or it's in this person's pants, or it's in this bag of powder, or it's in this whatever the fuck, very expensive house somewhere. And it brings me back to this thing I've just been speculating about, which is why the fuck? Aren't people, and I don't mean it in a sanctimonious judgmental way because I'm one of these people who, if I haven't taken enough acid, God forbid, so I'm there on the precipice of being annihilated and clinging to the, clinging like a dog being taken into the vet. You know what I mean? Like fuck this, I'm not going. Or even should I be at these retreats sometimes? And you know, during the kirtons, and even worse, I'm not on acid. But somehow there's that sudden like, what is this? I'm being vacuumed up into something, or I'm already part. If there's enough of me left, all it wants to do is go fuck this. So why argue? It's just a perplexing condition, I guess. You know, it's like, why would it be that there is accessible theoretically at any moment to anyone who happens to be in a human body this place that we're already at paradoxically? Why aren't we hanging out there more? You just go, whoever thought of the whole thing, talk to them, okay? So I don't know. I think it's all crazy. Come in, come in, just go through this raft of incarnations to get back to the one. And each one, you're running through all of the stuff that you hadn't quite run through in the previous incarnation. And you kind of realize it too. You know, realize Jesus, this didn't come from anywhere. Where the hell did this? I know this wasn't in my household, my parents. And boy, so you start to realize, you go, oh, for God's sake. And it's the ability to find the, this is Robert Thurman would talk like, find the bliss within the reality of being a human. And so the fact that we have, we reach, that's, and my favorite Raghas are the, are the reaching Raghas. Wait, will you tell folks what a Raghas is? A Raghas, sorry. You know, in India, they have so many different melodic patterns that represent, you know, waking up in the morning and having evening, calming down, getting more rhythmic and so on. They just have something for each season, for each moment in the day. I mean, Indian, just they're incredible. And so they, each one of these things is called a Raghas. And it just has its own unique melodic pattern, note pattern, shall we say. So there's one that's all about longing. And it's my favorite because, and then they use it in musicians like Jay Utah, he's been adept at you. In fact, I hear him still playing, just coming up with different things that have that particular pattern that does that particular thing, which is what we came here to do is longing to get back to that spacious, non-judgmental, loving, kind place. That's what it's all about. No escape. Now that's the brilliance of it, you know, is that once you, and I remember because, you know, Krishna Das just bombs me every once in a while. The most simple things out of the blue, right in my ear. Then I'll walk off and I'll think about it for years. One of them being when he told me the longing is the grace. And I just will never forget that moment. And because, you know, I think a lot of us, we get confused and we think we're depraved, profane, or we must have fucked up because all we can do is long. That's all that's left, you know. And to hear folks like you, or even to know now there's like actual melodies. Yeah. That's representing. Yeah. It's incredible because I don't know that people realize that is also a beautiful place to be. But would you say it's synonymous with being in the presence of Neem Koli Baba or sub below that experience? No, as he said, it's all one. You get to that place where you just aren't moving into reaction of all of your thoughts and emotions. You get to a place that's behind that, which does happen and this music will. What it does is it invokes this thing, deep thing in you that you remember. You remember the wholeness. Yeah. And your whole full intention goes into expressing that. And when you express that, and the expression, by the way, can be just listening. It's not, you don't have to be doing, but you have to get so far into the moment of listening, which is just another meditation. The thoughts just stop the daggering of your mind so that you grab onto and believe them. That stops. And that's why music is such a powerful thing. That's why Krishna Das has got the kind of following he has because music is so powerful. First, your thoughts stop and then there's this place that you're recognizing and you're just fully embracing and just allowing it to carry you on its rhythm, its notes and the power of the mantra. So that is a very, it is something that we brought back, you know, from India and is most represented by in our little tradition with Krishna Das and Jai Utah, I would say, in terms of the people that were in India. And that is exactly true. The longing and being in the moment where it's being expressed, either through listening or actually chanting or whatever you may do is the same moment that you can be with being like Ninkaroli Baba and Ramana Maharishi and all of the saints and siddhas of India. Yeah, it's the same, absolutely the same. And once we get that, then we can trust it and stop being so outrageously cynical and polarized. Because you can trust the longing. You might not be able to trust someone around you, a person or whatever because of your karma, but you sure as fuck know when you're longing for that specific thing. You know, and because it is the most and it is beautiful and it is powerful. And, you know, I just think that there's a paradoxical delight when you start realizing that somehow there's a connection. The longing is a connection. It's not a disconnect. The feeling of being disconnected, at least for me, is like a numb, cynical, shitty, bitter feeling. Whereas the feeling of longing to, you know, for me. It is the landing. Yeah! The land that, you know, the land that high board jump swimming thing. You're going to land it. Yeah. Or land, gymnastics, right? I know what you mean. Oh yeah, because they have to know. Right. I forgot the name for that. When you lose your, there's a name for when you don't know where the ground is anymore. And it's like, if you don't know it, you're going to wipe out. That's the disconnect, you know? And yeah, right. I see what you're saying. Wow. Holy shit. That is so cool. It's all in that. Yeah. It's just in that. It's not in what you think might happen once there is a landing in the way that you project. It's just not, it's so great to lose that whole attachment to thinking that we know anything. Yeah. Really good. It's a really good thing. Yeah. Be here now. Be here now. And we're going to do this at the Wisdom, which you already mentioned. That's right. Yeah. Wisdom. Yeah. October 24th.

There you will find commercial-free episodes of the DTFH, and at least once a month, I do the exact same thing I will be doing when I inevitably find myself wandering around on the streets of some unknown city, talking to the air. I do a long, hour-long, rambling thing as I try to connect the chaotic, strange tendrils of the octopoid creature that is my mind together in some coherent form, and it's all there for you. Just head over to patreon.com, floretslashdtfh, and subscribe. We also have a wonderful shop located at dunkintrustle.com, and also, I'm gonna start doing, if you wanna come and hang out in a kind of silent, probably boring way, the first Sunday of every month at Samarasah Yoga Studio starting in August, we're gonna just start doing a sitting meditation. I'm not really gonna do much talking. It's literally just gonna be us sitting there quietly together. Go to Samarasah's website, they'll be linked to it at dunkintrustle.com in this episode, and come and hang out quietly with us for a little bit of time. I just have been doing my own sort of solitary meditation practice, and every once in a while, I like to sit with a group of people just because it's weird, and it's cool, and it's fun, and it's weird. All right, we've got a fantastic podcast for you today. Philosopher, author, and psychonaut, and activist Daniel Pinschbeck is here with us today. My apologies that we recorded this in London. Well, he was in London, I was in the United States, and you're gonna hear that weird warping thing where suddenly it sounds like somebody has transformed into a robot or is using a really shitty vocoder. I kinda like it because we talk about Gnostic conspiracies, occult control mechanisms, Daniel's new book, and it really does seem like whenever we're getting to a point of really talking about something heavy, it just warps in this sort of demonic way. So again, my apologies, there is no way for me to fly to London and do this live, but I really did enjoy this conversation. So without further ado, everybody welcome back to the Ducket Trussell Family Hour podcast, Daniel Pinschbeck. [""Ducket Trussell Family Hour Podcast""] [""Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be moved, welcome to you."" It's the Ducket Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Mr. Pinschbeck, welcome back to the DTFH. It's good to see you, man. I gotta tell you, I'm on your email list and the book you just wrote, you called it an essay, popped up on my feed and it, man, it's right up my alley. And so I just wanna talk about this incredible book because it involves everything I love, occult conspiracies, the UFO phenomena, as people are calling it, and Gnosticism. So just for my own selfish desires, I wonder if you could start off by giving a very brief synopsis of Gnosticism as you understand it, because it's been really weird. It's hard for me to wrap my mind around it. Yeah, so I mentioned that a good source is this book by John Lim Lash, not in his image, but essentially this idea that, you know, some people think Gnosticism is a heretical sect of Christianity, but it's actually kind of a preexisting mystery school wisdom of the ancient world, the form that it took in the classical world until it was really persecuted pretty much out of existence like the fourth and fifth century. And the core belief, it's very different than Orthodox Christianity. They talk about a beautiful goddess who lived at the center of the universe called the Plurama, who began to have visions and dreams of this, you know, emerald green and blue planet floating, you know, in the universe, and which was the earth, and she became enraptured when she actually fell into matter and she incarnated as the earth. So for them, the earth is this goddess of fire. And in that fall into matter, it was a big event and it created these like ripples in the space-time fabric, and through those little rips and tears, these kind of devious evil beings called the Arkans came into this reality led by the ringmaster, who's known as the Demiurge. And essentially, they've, you know, I guess you could say that they live off of our energy, our fear, our devotion and so on. So they've kind of constructed a false reality, you know, sort of matrix reality that we're stuck in. So we don't actually get to connect with the true cosmic source. So for the Gnostics, like the myth of the Garden of Eden and the serpent and the garden, they don't see that as Satan. They see that as actually as the Christ is like coming as a messenger of the true cosmic power to, you know, help humanity awaken and gain knowledge again. Wow, you could see how that would infuriate modern stereotypical Christians. Cause that seems like definitely a thing that Satan cooked up. Like if you believe in that model, it's so amazing. And all, but essentially the Gnostics are saying, actually Christianity is clearly the thing Satan cooked up. Christianity is a Demiurgic deviation that kind of feeds on some of our, you know, psychology. It's very cuttingly constructed. I mean, this is, John Lash really goes into this very well in the not in his image. So like, you know, it has a lot of things and it really, it feeds on our desire to be perfect and to be good, but it uses these tendencies kind of against us, you know? So for instance, even the idea that we possess original sin is a deviation, you know? And if you look at Eastern religions or indigenous traditions, there isn't that idea at all. Like, you know, in the Eastern tradition, you know, we actually have basic goodness, you know, and then maybe things happen and karma intrudes and we fall into ignorance or delusion or whatever. But this idea that we start out tainted is part of how the Demiurge kind of manipulated us into a control system. Okay, yeah, sure. If you can make somebody feel evil, bad, whatever, you can control them, right? That's like a great way to control somebody is make them, also if someone thinks they're evil, they probably don't know themselves very well, right? Because they haven't gotten past the smog layer of karma into that fundamental goodness. And if you've got them there, then you've got them because you could tell them, oh, yeah, you're rotten, you're just fucked. So as Robert Anton Wilson says, this is related to authoritarian structures, right? That's the idea that the Demiurge manifests as fascism, essentially. Right, well, okay, but also, I guess the idea is that, like if they found the Gnostic gospels in the desert and Nagomite in like the 40s and, you know, some of them predated Christian scriptures and, you know, but I guess the idea is there was much more of the idea of like, open the door for yourself, like basically an esoteric path and Christ, you know, the idea that you save your soul by believing that having faith in Christ was not the Gnostic idea at all. The idea is that, you know, Christ was kind of like, you know, a holy figure or a perfected human that he was showing us a model to follow, to reach an illuminated condition, not like we just save our souls by believing and having faith in something. Right, yeah, this isn't like a, it's not some kind of cure-all medicine. But, whoa, how appealing is that idea, though? What a great way to just skip over all of the effort. All you gotta do is believe in this thing and imagine that you're saved somehow and then, voila, you're fixed or something. I have always gravitated towards Gnosticism. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by the wonderful Babies of Sound over at Raycon. You know what, I was in like a glasses store, sunglasses store the other day, and I was looking at like hyper-expensive glasses, specifically Gucci sunglasses. And for one dark second, I was on the precipice of spending like, I don't know, $600 on a pair of fucking sunglasses. And then I remembered that I have never kept a pair of sunglasses longer than two months before I sit on them, break them, or leave them somewhere else. Similarly, I once had a pair of super-expensive Apple fucking AirPods, and I left them in an Uber, and I decided, you know what, fuck it, I'm not doing that anymore. I'm not gonna buy another pair. I'm just not gonna have nice fucking earbuds because I lose them. And then I got sponsored by Raycon.

Support our sponsors because these sweeties support us. So to get into your book, I didn't finish it. I just skimmed it and like I told you on the phone yesterday, you know you've got a good book when you realize that you're just underlining everything but I wanna read a quote from it if I can find it here. And maybe you could explain it to me one second here. Sorry. Okay. And if you hear a baby, that's my baby. A likely story. Why would I even say that? Like you wouldn't think it was my baby. Why would I even say that? What's wrong with me? Okay. So, damn it, I lost my space. Here it is. Okay, this is it. It seems an invisible something presses down on us, contorting all of our efforts so that our best intentions lead to the worst outcomes or the repetition of old miseries. Of course, most would argue that this force is simply human greed and ignorance and they may be correct. But perhaps other forces are at play as well. Perhaps there are indeed off-planet, extra or infradimensional entities manipulating humanity, seeking to advance their own agendas. To be honest, I am quite certain this is the case. How are you so certain? Well, I guess it has to do with my own personal experiences and like trying to build counter institutions or alternatives. And yeah, it just feels that there's like, monkey wrenches get thrown in. Like something doesn't really want us to evolve in a positive direction. So I guess that's kind of where that came from, that idea. No, as I was saying, like any time I talk about Gnosticism running this shit, I will, I almost want to do a study and just like have a random generator tell me when to talk about Gnosticism on the podcast and see if it starts fusing out technically. Cause it does, I know what you're saying. I mean, on one level it sounds absolutely paranoid, crazy. Anyone listening who like considers themselves logical or rational, feel free to roll your fucking eyes. But it does appear that they're these invisible barriers that instantaneously spring up the moment you make a strong decision in the direction of anything other than consuming. The moment you do that, it's like your own personal shit will pop up. But then also other like stuff to the point where you think, oh, is this like a test? It has a quality of that. An initiatory feeling. Like this is- Was that Wilson called it like chapel perilous or something like that? Yeah. All the tests that suddenly pop up. Yeah, yeah, it's like, okay, if you want, if you really want to like do this thing, whatever it may be, your own personal betterment, some compassionate act, it's not going to just be that easy. Like you have to really- To be like maximum, maximum resistance. Right. Yeah. Yeah, obviously there's different ways to look at it. I mean, you know, one esoteric idea is that ultimately there's just one consciousness, you know, which you could transduce to say that we're all God on some level and have that type of capacity. But, you know, we, yeah, so in a sense, I mean, I did organize two retreats years ago with the Khoi and the Lumbia and, you know, they walked like 25 hours down to the mountains to hang out with us and talk about their spiritual philosophy. And that's the culture where like the young kids who are going to be the teachers spend like seven years or more in like a dark retreat and a cave. Jesus. They learn all the metaphysical traditions and ritual traditions without actually seeing the world and then they come out. So it's, you know, but basically the core nugget that they were hoping to convey to us and they were really happy when I finally kind of like repeated it back to them is that somehow, you know, what we experienced as the material world, the physical world, the natural world directly reflects our individual level of like spiritual development or consciousness development, you know? So in a way that on one level, if we get these, you know, negative attacks and reflections back, it probably just means that we have, you know, more work to do, like more development to do and we haven't really integrated like the shadow, you know? Yeah, but I talked about in that essay that you're involved with right now, the occult control system, you know, young, you know, wrote a book called The Flying Saucer Myth, which was his last work. He also believed that we were moving into the time that, you know, these religious traditions talked about as apocalypse, which for him, you know, I mean, the word apocalypse literally means unveiling of the hidden thing or the revealing or the uncovering. And actually what the ultimate positive meaning of it is, is a, you know, young talked about it as the coming of the self and the conscious realization. So, you know, our consciousness growing to the point where we're able to actually kind of integrate the unconscious and the shadow aspects of the psyche, you know? Sure. Yeah, yeah. So that maybe it's just necessarily part of this process. Like we can't really, you know, whatever leap we're trying to make individually and collectively, you know, requires these tests and these failures and then trying again and, you know, as Samuel Beckett said, you know, try, fail, try again and fail better, you know? Oh, fail better. Ha ha ha ha. But, but I've become an expert at failure, so that's good news. But I did, I want to, this... I think I could give you a run for your money though. Ha ha ha ha. We'll have a contest. The, the, the, there is a quality to it though, which, and, and you know, I don't want to get all paranoid here, but sometimes there is a sensation of feeling like, this is actually more than just, you know, I want to, I love the university or these cosmic university idea. We're all in some training, you know, academy for like young gods or whatever. And we're being taught some basic stuff here. We are in the cave, so to speak. This place is the cave. And we're being taught some, some, what seems to be something involving not don't be selfish or something. But there does feel like there's also a prison aspect to it, which is why I gravitate towards Gnosticism, that there is a sense of like, no, no, it's, it's not quite that. It's like you're, we're stuck in something here. And this is in Buddhism, Samsara, the repetition over and over and over and over again. It's Nietzsche talks about it a little bit. And in your book, but before I didn't have time to continue reading, you started talking about this idea of the multiverse. And I was, since I haven't finished, I'm authentically asking, are you, do you imply in this book that by changing our perceptions, we sort of transcend the soul prison or jump into some alternate timeline where this rotten shit isn't happening? Something like that might, might be possible. I mean, you know, yeah, I mean, it may, I mean, you know, I can't say, I mean, I've sort of like, so, you know, some of my trajectory has involved, like I wrote a book called 2012, The Return of Kessel Quaddle. And that book, I spent a lot of time studying the crop circles in England, which, you know, most people believe are made by human hoaxers. But, you know, the deeper I got into it, you know, the more, you know, kind of extraordinary it was. And the less likely it seemed to me that it's simply a human-made phenomenon for all sorts of reasons. I mean, there's like physicists who published papers and peer-reviewed science journals, like what happens to the crop in the pattern that it's actually somehow affected by some type of energy that comes down from below that, you know, blows out his nose and so on. Hello, I got to stop you there. That's a, that's, I, you know, when I'm thinking about crop circles, my brain goes to hoax, that's the easiest thing to believe. But also you're looking at that and you're like, what kind of maniac does this level of hoax, like you are, you've been snorting, that's three weeks of Adderall snorting to like, you know, I'm going to go to a complex, perfect geometry in my field overnight. But yeah, I never heard that this is coming. I always thought, you know, when I'm going, whoo, I always thought it was coming from space. I never... Yeah, yeah, sometimes what people have seen are like these balls of light that fly over and then the crop kind of falls down. So it's some type of like, you know, electromagnetic or, you know, some form of energy that we don't quite understand. And, you know, the individual crops are often affected where they have these kind of like blown nodes where they bend, you know. So something that wouldn't happen at all if they were just being knocked down with boards or whatever, you know. So, yeah, there's that. And as you said, the incredible perfection of some of them, the gigantic scale of some of them in relatively busy areas so that you really can't even figure out how somebody would have concocted this in one night. And, you know, there are hoaxers who then get, you know, now they get assignments from corporations who like logos in the fields, but they can't do, you know, as pristine or as amazing. And this is what the Demiurge would do. That's what's so funny about it. The Demiurge, the great imitator, the synthetic version of reality created by the universe. Of course, it sees a beautiful fucking crop circle and is like, let's put a Pepsi logo in that shit. Let's put a, you know, it's so satanic. So I'm sorry to cut you off. Crop, crop circles from the earth. But also your amazing book, which, by the way, I think you caught some flak because you basically predicted the apocalypse, right? Well, yeah, I mean, actually, in that book, I never said that anything in particular was gonna happen, you know, at or around December 21st, 2012. And actually, I feel that more and more if somebody was really paying attention, totally vindicated that we moved into, you know, kind of like a, you know, permanent, like semi-psychedelic reality, you know? Let me interject something here, because this for me was a thing like, well, Pinchback did it, man. He made a kind of end of the world prediction and those are very dangerous to do. And then now sometimes I'm like, holy shit, he was right. The end of the world isn't ending the way we thought it would end, you know? Like that's the thing, like people have within us an iconcept of the end of the world, which involves what? Volcanoes, tsunamis, explosions, nuclear holocaust, but no one predicted that the apocalypse or the interim state between the lifting of the veil would be a complete diffusion of all truth, like a hyper refracted warping funhouse mirror of literally everything, including the identity. Who would have called that? No one would have thought that. And so, yeah, now I do think, well, I think that if you were to take a person from the 80s and drop them into this dimension, they might think that this was, at the very least, some kind of dystopian dream and a weird nightmare they were having, but they wouldn't think things were doing okay. In the normal sense of the word, you know? I like it, it's a fun apocalypse, but it definitely seems to be, there doesn't seem to be an apocalyptic flavor in the air these days. Yeah, correct. I mean, but to say nobody would have predicted it, I mean, as a kind of a coda to the 2012 book, it's something I also discuss in the occult control system essay. A number of indigenous wisdom keepers now talk about sort of a period from 2012 to could be 2021 or 2025, and the 2021 is one that I've heard a bunch, is kind of the transition period. We're moving from kind of one world to the next. Right. And there's a Nwadol shaman, which is Nwadol is the Aztec tradition. Sergio Magada, who wrote a book called The Age of the Six Sun, and he argues that, yeah, 2012 to 2021 is this kind of transition. And what we're transitioning to and from is what he talks about as a son of light to a son of darkness. So I know that sounds scary, but essentially from their perspective, you know, the last thousands of years, we were under a son of light and the focus of human investigation, inquiry and activity was kind of the waking world, you know, the material world, through technology, through science, through agriculture, through rational thought and so on. When we move back towards a son of darkness, the focus becomes more on the world of the psyche, the dream world. So Burns is becoming more and more like a waking dream. It's more and more subtly, a psychically malleable and permeable. Yeah. And, you know, and that's happening on so many levels. Like for instance, our technologies, you know, so like, you know, 20 years ago, if we wanted to arrange this hangout, it would have been extremely difficult. Now it's like so simple. And expensive. You know, if you wanted, what's that? Yeah, if we wanted to, you know, if you wanted to make a sculpture, you would have had to learn, you know, how to make a sculpture, but now you could just draw something on a napkin and a 3D laser printer, it could create it for you. So that's sort of interplay between the psychic and the physical is becoming more malleable, you know? As all our existing structures are kind of breaking apart in some type of like, you know, trickster-esque, trickster-like cataclysm, you know? Ah, yes. So, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, so I find that. So, and by the way, also, when I, you know, when we talk about either the Gnostic kind of framing or this Aztec construct around the sixth son and the fifth son and sixth son, or, you know, Rudolf Steiner, or Waymore and Thompson, or Carl Jung, I think that it's really important because we've come from a very literal and dualistic way of understanding the nature of reality, we tend to grab onto some idea and be like, oh, that's the thing, you know? But actually, I feel when it comes to these things that are subtler and more esoteric, it's actually very good to really look at a whole bunch of them and then kind of like put the patterns on top of each other and it's almost like a weaving, you know, where you get like the patterns begin to make sense together. So, it's almost like learning how to listen to like a new kind of music, you know, or, yeah. So, it's like a truth emerges, but I think if you get too caught in one discourse or rhetoric, you kind of get caught in another belief system in a way. Sure, yeah, and if you want to embarrass yourself, that is a good way to do it is to become a true believer in any one thing. And these days, you know, probably that's, it's all up in the air now. It's the Buddha saying, it's already broken, it's shattered, the whole thing is shattered and it's shattering more and more and more. And as part of that shattering, there is this sudden emergence of news stories that had they come out in the 80s, would have caused riots, but now we're like, oh, whatever. UFOs, I'm watching CNN reporters talk about how the Air Force is picking up signals on this high-tech radar of these tic-tacs, and then that should be the news story, right? Like, wouldn't that just be the one of what we're all just talking about? It's like, wait, there's things flying around that are breaking the laws of physics? Some of them are like spheres rotating within cubes and stuff like that. But, you know, it's like shit, yes, but shit's so weird right now that people are like, I won't think about that later. You know, this to me is something that has really got me rubbing my head, wondering, like, well, I guess maybe there is no hope in the sense that the hypnosis that so many people are under right now is so intense that things breaking the laws of physics are being written off as we understand them. I mean, what I propose in the essay is that this is probably like a hyper-dimensional intervention. So, you know, we're living in like, you know, these sort of linear constructs of space-time, but from a higher dimension, you know, you could move through time, you know, as we move through space and kind of orchestrate it, you know, for certain results in the same way we might like make a painting or a sculpture or something like that. So, there may actually, and many people have talked about this idea of like a controlled disclosure. You know, the disclosure seems to be happening, you know, in correspondence with these other, you know, social and ecological breakdowns that are happening. And it may even be that there's, you know, agendas that are, you know, from these, say, hyper-dimensional forces that are not to our best interests or to our benefits, and that's also playing out. And, you know, it's very hard to accept that as something legitimate, because it's so wacky from the way we've been looking at reality, but then if you get into all the abduction accounts and, you know, these endless stories about people being taken aboard these ships where they're sperm and egg are extracted to make hybrid children, and they're brought back to play with the hybrid children, and they're shown films of like a future Earth where there's a lot of catastrophe for humans are walking arm in arm together enjoying, you know, the landscape. I mean, it almost seems as if we're being like set up or prepared for some type of, you know, crack in the structure or disruption. Or, you know, it's also possible that this is, you know, not going to go like that. And it'll continue to be bizarre and subtle, but somehow like ineffable and out of our grasp. You know, it's, could go either way, actually. Well, I mean, the, it seems that whatever these things are, and, you know, Occam's razor tells us that these are some kind of new military drone, maybe, you know, using alien technology or, you know, reverse engineered alien technology. Occam's boring fucking razor. But- I mean, if you're talking about reverse engineering alien technology, that's not so boring. Oh yeah, I guess you're right. One of the things that I think is really silly is this idea that there would be these, you know, these crashed alien ships and technologies that they didn't mean for us to recover. I mean, if these things, as they seem to be, are like, you know, hundreds, thousands, millions of years ahead of us, they're not going to be crashing into the rocks. So if we have recovered anything, it's because whatever's behind this thing wanted us to recover these things at these particular junctures. Right. As part of this unfolding narrative that they're constructing around us. Well, I mean, let's say that they're, let's say it is legitimately, and even, I'm sorry to say boring, no level of this is boring. It's all fascinating, but let's just imagine it's some kind of new drone. Like they figured out how to, you know, I don't know. I read about what an Air Force pilot or an engineer was talking about, well, here's what it would have to be, you know, or what we based on our understanding what it would be. And they were mentioning something to do with the superconductor, but one that operates at room temperature, generating a mass that was somehow more than the planet, meaning that you would not be pulled into the gravitational well, and then you would then be, it's anti-grav basically. And then, but not just that, you would have to have something within the fucking thing. If it were piloted by organic life, which, you know, probably wouldn't be, it'd probably be a computer, they would also allow the person inside to not fall asleep or die from the intense G-force that would happen if it was moving that fast. So, but let's just assume that is what it is. If that's what it is, we're still probably in trouble because that's a lot of power for a human being to have. That's an unstoppable thing. So, and it all just smacks of what McKenna was talking about with the, you know, the singularity, the sparks flying off of this event in the future that's going. Yeah, the shockwaves of history, kind of like reverberating backwards through time or something like that. And this is, I don't mean to go back to a question I already asked, but just because you are, you did mention with some confidence, which I respect that there is this ability to move through time the way we're able to move through space. To me, this is the thing that I keep, especially like in deep psychedelic moments is keeps coming to me as this notion of like, oh, our minds can in some way or another, we can leap through the dream, leap through time. We don't have to be here in this place, the way we think we have to be. And then in your book, you brought up Steiner talking about some kind of new moon. That the, can you talk about that a little bit? Because to me, it really does kind of resonate. The problem with the Steiner stuff, it's hard to talk about a little bit. You have to kind of go down the tunnel or not, because there's so many, I mean, from my perspective, Rudolf Steiner who lived from like 1861 to 1925 is like one of the most incredible philosophers, geniuses of the age. And the sense one gets is that he, when we experienced maybe on the high dose, ayahuasca or LSD was something that was just a natural state for him. And so when he went to bed at night, he would close his eyes, he would enter into all these other visionary realms. And then he realized that nobody around him had this ability. So he was careful not to really talk about it until he became like a philosopher, got a degree in philosophy was like, had a job studying Gerta's science papers. Then he got involved with the theosophists like Madame Blavatsky, and kind of looked at what they were doing. So he really waited a long time until he began to talk about the inner investigations that he'd made through his whole life. And essentially what Steiner claimed, at that point in time on the earth had a reason. And his mission was actually to bring the knowledge of reincarnation back to the West, which we'd lost with the rise of monotheism. Whereas like to better something, they know when to expect these sort of llamas to come back. They have tests like this person was this person, that person was that person. We've lost all that, but it's still continued. So he actually ended up writing a series of books from karmic relationships where he would trace different individualities in the West back through their past incarnations. But he also said that not only did human beings incarnate again and again, but the earth itself also reincarnates. And for him, the incarnations of the earth were really connected to human evolution and human consciousness. I mean, not just human. He also talked about, you know, plants and minerals undergoing kind of an evolution of consciousness, you know. And so then he talked about how we have a number of bodies right now. We have, you know, the physical body, the etheric body, the astral body and the eye or the ego. So we have like four bodies and we're moving towards the fifth incarnation of the earth where we receive a new body, or we develop a new body that he called the spirit self. Wow. And essentially the spirit self would be, you know, so where we are now, we have the four bodies, the physical body, the etheric body or the life body, you know, the astral body. When we go to sleep at night, then the eye and the ego connect to the astral body and they go into the astral worlds and sort of fly around and have adventures and they come back to the physical body, the etheric body. But the astral body is the realm of all the disincarnate spirits and entities. And a lot of them are, you know, really want to have sensory world experience. So they're trying to get back into the sensory world. And so they hitch a ride on us. That manifests in our lives as compulsions, depressions, addictions and so on. Inspiration too though, right? It's not all bad shit. Like sometimes they give us like talent or like suddenly you can play the piano when you couldn't before, things like that. They give you little gifts. I think it's where the whole selling your soul to the devil was just some grumpy ass dope who was like being offered some wonderful bobble from the spirit realm and was like, ah, you want my soul? Yeah, yeah. So basically, well, exactly. That's what Steiner talked about when he talked about Lucifer, like Luciferic spirits. Lucifer means light bringer. There was a kind of spirit that had evolved too far to be in a physical embodiment. But it could only evolve on its own path by making an alliance with the human being. So that's what like Arabs talk about, as Islamics talk about as the djin, or the Greeks talked about as the daimon, not the demon, but the daimon, which was your genie, the spirit of inspiration or influence, whatever. But anyway, so basically the fifth body that we're forming as we go into this next world incarnation is as we are able to transform the astral body. So it doesn't prey upon us in these destructive ways. We create this new body called the spirit self that gives us a more conscious capacity to experience the astral worlds. Wow. And that's actually what's happening for him. But he also said some people aren't gonna make this transition. Right, so he said that which other occult thinkers have also said, and it's not something that I really, that part of it that I prefer to dwell on or whatever, because then you also get cast like the doomsday thing again. But yeah, so when there are these evolutionary shifts, not everybody is ready to evolve in a certain direction. So they have to take other kind of incarnational pathways. And so he talked about some group of humans being like so degraded and their karma is so bad that they would ultimately form like a new planetary body, like a kind of diseased mood that they would take off in their own direction. Big Trump rally, just a fucking infinite Trump rally floating up there. Ha, ha, ha, ha, I like it. I'm sorry, I love it, man, I love that. I mean, it's such a fantasy idea. And again, you know, I don't mean to dehumanize anybody and I really mean that. But at some level, God, Jesus, don't you fantasize sometimes, man, about like, this is what I think sometimes. If suddenly the ability, it just happened that we could move into another dimension. Anyone had it, if you wanted to go, you could go. Maybe you couldn't come back. Say it's another planet, I don't know what it is. How many people would stick around here? You know, especially if that place had within it all the things, certain personality types with love, power, power. That's also kind of, you know, so many of these abduction accounts, they also talk about like Carla Turner with these books, where she talked about being, they go up there into these abductions. They're actually trained to operate the saucers. They're kind of told there's going to come like an ecological or military catastrophe moment. Then the aliens are going to scoop a lot of humans like onto these ships and like take them somewhere else. And I would say that if that is happening, it seems like what's an offer. I would definitely stay away from those ships. What? Who do you work for, pinchback? Well, anybody can make their own determination at that point. But I would prefer to go down with the ship than go up with their ship. You're not going to get on the ship. Come on. That's those particular aliens. Jesus, see, this reminds me of something one of my friends mind fucked me with a long time ago, which is like, when you die, don't go in the light. You'll regret it. Oh, really? Yeah, like the light like said. That's the opposite of the book of the dead, no? Oh, I know. I mean, this was the worst mind fuck of all time. Because A, it's like now you're going to give me another thing to be confused about when I die. How does he know? What's his specialized knowledge? I didn't ask. That's something you would ask. I didn't ask. I'm just, I was just like, oh, fuck, man, great. Now I'm going to have to roll the dice even then. But again, there is a sense of, well, one of my friends, Jason Lou, have said to me, if the Gnostic stuff is right, then you do have to be suspicious of potentially all ethics, all morality, all of what we consider to be right, at least from a sort of mundane sense, could potentially be a trick, not a trick UFO, but a sort of, I guess you could say, linguistic UFO or a codified UFO that people are jumping into, imagining there's some safety in these weird regulations, stipulations, and laws, particularly things involving like monogamy, all the standard shit that keeps people manacled into a specific type of life. You know what I'm saying? It's like people are already jumping on the wrong UFOs. Totally. Yeah, and that's actually, today I was preparing for a workshop and giving with a friend on the trickster. And then I was starting to think about how, because there's this guy, George Hansen, who wrote a book called The Trickster and the Paranormal. I interviewed him once. You should totally have him on your show. He's really fascinating. I would love to. Yeah. But he was talking about how we construct these like rigidified structures, bureaucracies, governments, monetary systems, education systems. And we keep trying to like banish and reject the trickster. But now we reached a certain point in doing that. And now the trickster has just like erupted into everything. It's like the ecological crisis, like Trump is like the lord of misrule, like the Loki. Like in a way, even that trickster energy has been now sort of co-opted for the far right in a way. Whereas in the 60s, the trickster was more the size of like the yippies, the counterculture. So that's a very interesting thing to think about, I think. I do too. I mean, this is what I, this to me is maybe a blasphemous thing for some people who don't want to admit it. But like with all the vileness of it from the, you know, the story, you know, the story of the coyote and like, I don't know, I'm going to fuck it up. But coyote is a rat. I don't know which creature, some wonderful creature, maybe a raccoon, I don't know, would leaves their kids with coyote. You know, this is a myth. Coyote somehow is like, I'll babysit these kids. And, you know, the coyote being the trickster symbol for a trickster, you know? And so this poor dumb raccoon goes wandering off. And while the raccoon's gone, the coyote decapitates the kids, puts their heads on sticks, and then holds them in the window. So it looks like they're like happy that the mother's coming home. But the fucking thing to catch, this is the trickster figure. Everyone thinks the trickster is like, I don't know what, man. Jim Carrey or some kind of like benevolent thing. This thing is like lava, magma, avalanches, the barbell, a weirdo throws from the overpass. It's not all like that what we know. And anytime you're around a true comic, a real comedian, like at the comedy store, the ones who hang out there till 3 AM, watch the fuck out, man. They're like, they will suck you in just for fun. They won't hurt you on purpose, but you might get hurt if you're egoic or you're stuck in some certain part of yourself. Anyway. I guess it would hurt if they decapitated you and put your head on the stick. Well, they'll decapitate your ego, or they'll decapitate, you know what I mean? They'll do a nice decapitation of the things that you love the most, and then do a little show with them and their corpses in front of you. But what I'm saying is, in that sense, to me, there is something beautiful about the American Trump right now, because it's so purely that chaos, just a crazy swirl of absolute, illogical, complete confusion and weird, penduluming things. So in that way, it's like, my god, I guess. In the same way we didn't, it's like the anti-Christ qualities in that are so amazing. Because we always thought it would be, you know, the anti-Christ is supposed to be the omen. It's supposed to be Damien or whatever the fuck it, right? There's this sophisticated guy drinking out of goblets, not some lunatic all blown out on Coke. What the fuck? So I mean, also the question is, you know, where does it go from here? That's a very interesting question. What do you think? Where do you think it goes? Well, I mean, you know, so the last book that I published, I mean, I also want to discuss the new book that's coming out in September about ayahuasca. It was this book called How Soon Is Now. And yeah, in that book, I was looking at the ecological crisis as something like a collective initiation, a rite of passage for humanity that is going to force us to move from kind of adolescent immaturity to adult responsibilities as species. And now I see that happening in like the children's movements in Greta Thunberg, who's basically seems like the voice of God right now. Wait, what's the, OK, can you wait, the children's movement. What is that? I missed that. All these kids in Europe who've been like striking and doing hypermarches and so on. Greta Thunberg is a 16-year-old Swedish schoolgirl, has a little bit of Asperger's, who's been speaking at, you know, she spoke to the UN, she spoke to the UK Parliament, and they declared a climate emergency. But she's a very, you know, focused voice who's somehow been given a lot of privacy right now. Actually, one of her ancestors, a brother was a scientist who discovered the greenhouse effect back in the 19th century, which is quite interesting. Yeah, so anyway, so yeah, so this ecological crisis is this kind of collective rite of passage for humanity. And I think the movement towards the regressive movement towards the right is very much caused by what's happening ecologically. Just as in the 30s, societies were getting crowded, and the Germans wanted more living room, the Libans realms that led to Nazism in some ways. Now people are beginning to fear about, you know, it's subconscious maybe, but resource depletion, peak oil, water, food sources, and immigrants, the threat that they posed, boundaries and borders. So the first movement is a regressive one towards authoritarianism. But that's obviously not going to work. I mean, so if we stick with that, we're all probably going to die in some horrible extinction event. I mean, in Brazil, they're cutting down seven football fields of the Amazon rainforest per minute, and the Amazon provides 20% of our oxygen, plus is like the center for the whole hydrological system of the planet. So we can't really go too much further down that road, and we're going to probably see in the next couple of years the massive blowback. So if it's not going to be an authoritarian system that takes us any further, it's going to have to be something else, which might be more local, bioregional, citizens, councils, like actually people really taking responsibility in their locality for their local situation, and also for the whole planetary situation, and potentially the tools that we've internet tools and social media, social networking tools could then be used to sort of transition into how we work together and communicate on the planet and make decisions together and so on. So it's going to have to be some kind of left field thing that emerges as a result of this collective realization that we can't go further in this direction. This children's movement actually kind of reminds me, I mean, I'm trying to think of a nice way to say it. You know, like when you're around, I don't know what your dad's like, if you, but you know that it's almost a trope. The middle-aged dude goes to the doctor, and the doctor's like, you can't keep eating like this. You can't keep smoking or drinking. You're going to fucking die. And then the middle-aged guy, out of so kind of like self-destructive, insane stubbornness, keeps doing it, doubles down on it even. Like fuck the doctor, you don't know what you're talking about. This is who I fucking am. To me, that's what we feel like collectively, is like some dude in his 60s who just found out he's got diabetes and is an alcoholic. And instead of being like, oh, I'm going to stop drinking, he's like, fuck that, he's at the bar, like this is my life. And so within it, there's this like almost, how would you put it, glorified, self-destructive attitude that's being sort of reflected in what people are calling climate denial, I think, you know, the sense of like, come on, the world is so big. It's so big, we're not affecting it at all. Anytime any kind of report comes out that even remotely alludes to things like, well, the CO2 is going to cause the greening of the planet, or things like that, people shoot it down. You know, they're like, you know, or rather jump on it because they're excited because it's like, actually, don't you see, the factories are going to make the planet greener. The factories are going to make things better. Who wants all that fucking ice anyway, you know, insanity? So I love your optimism. And I love how your book, though I will admit, when I read it, it bugged me, I didn't like it. In the same way you don't like hearing the truth, sometimes I got really pissed, man, but a lot of that stuff stuck with me, sent up to this very day, specifically, make where you're at a vacation, you know, don't you worry, whenever I go anywhere on a vacation, I always think of you telling me that and feel like an asshole. So thanks, at least that happened. But I love that idea of like, make your home where you're at a place you can relax in instead of having to go all the way across the fucking planet to not be relaxed. So anyway, I love your optimism, but man, I don't know. This children's movement sounds great. But there's a- I mean, I'm actually not, frankly, that optimistic at this point. Yeah, I mean, I've actually, if anything, I mean, the environmental data is so much worse even than it was a few years ago. You know, I'm, you know, I would say, I think it's highly likely that, you know, we'll see catastrophic breakdown, potentially even human extinction, you know, within some, you know, relatively short timeframe. However, I don't know. And as long as I don't know, I'll try to argue for what seems to me like the happier, you know, alternative, you know? Well, maybe you're ayahuasca, maybe it's ayahuasca. I'm sorry to cut you off. Maybe, you know, my, the hippie side of me, when it thinks about, well, what is the thing that's gonna push everyone, or enough of us collectively over into a place where it doesn't make sense anymore to buy fucking sparkling water in plastic or to use plastic cups or just to make the little changes that will add up over time. Sometimes, you know, many of us think, oh, it's clearly ayahuasca, it's psychedelics. Yeah, I mean, yeah, exactly. But also clearly, you know, it is true that individually, you know, it feels like pissing against the winds. You know, there would have to be a larger collective social movement that, and that's where, you know, I think, you know, extinction rebellion is only a piece of the puzzle because I think that movement also has to show us and make it clear to us like how much more awesome our lives will ultimately be if we actually, you know, redirects, you know, what we're doing. And that's where I think things like psychedelics and Tantra actually are crucial as part of like a new paradigm, you know, for the future. But yeah, and you mentioned ayahuasca. I did want to, you know, discuss the new book with you. Do we send you a copy? I can't remember. No, I didn't get, I, you, if you sent me the copy, I missed it. What happened is the PDF that you were going to send, I think I missed it, but then I got the link to this amazing book. You got all excited. Yes, that's what happened. Yeah, yeah. So the ayahuasca book is essentially the phenomenon of ayahuasca. I wrote it with a friend, a young woman, Sophia Rockland, who is amazing and is actually working as a coordinator of a program in Peru to sustainably grow and harvest ayahuasca for the benefit of local indigenous communities because there's already shortages of ayahuasca happening because of somebody Westerners going down there. Crazy. Yeah. But it takes like, you know, like three to seven years to grow, to be usable or even like more like 10 years or more to be really a mature vine. So try to figure out how it can benefit these local communities in the long-term way as it was really important. Yeah, so the book really looks at all the aspects of the ayahuasca phenomenon, like what we know about its history, its origins, the myths the tribes have, you know, personal transformation, spiritual transformation, it's connected to different religions, the legal issues around it, all around the world and all the research that's being done on it. Cool. Yeah, I'm really happy. It's a really good overview that hopefully, you know, following on the long tail of Michael Pollan's book will, you know, somehow, you know, break its way into the mainstream consciousness. What is your, how often do you do ayahuasca? I haven't done it for a few years now. Maybe I did it once a year and a half ago because the last time I really did it, I went down to Peru and worked with a master shaman down there and we did like six ceremonies in nine days, this was like three or four people. And that was like really, really powerful and transformative that it sort of made me feel less engaged in the idea of just doing it like once or twice for a weekend and I'm waiting to go down again and do it soon. But I want to do it in that immersive way, perhaps in Diana with another plant, which is a really big part of the shepibo tradition. Right. So yeah, I'm waiting to hear the call of it and I haven't heard it for a little bit of a while. I never heard, I have never done ayahuasca. I've smoked, I've done many psychedelics, but for some reason ayahuasca, I always have this sense of like an embarrassing sense of like, oh, you're not ready for that. You can't do it yet for some reason. It's quite annoying. I mean, I know I'm a, Ah, just do it. Okay, I got your permission. Just do it, shut up. Well, maybe I will. Man. Yeah, I mean, there's some great people I can connect you with. That would be awesome. Yeah, I would like that. I think maybe I am ready now that I have a son to probably help the family too. I know it heals. I mean, I know that because I've met people who have been healed by it. And so I know that much. I also know it throws some people into manic episodes too. Yeah, it's not a magic bullet or whatever. I mean, it can show you things, but then also you have to kind of do the work. It's not Jesus. Right. So thank you so much. I love chatting with you. And I really, really love this essay. You're calling it, it seems like a book, whatever. I love this. I love your writing. You're so talented. And I'm glad to hear that you have a new book coming out on ayahuasca. Can you tell people where they can find you? Got any events coming up or anything that people can go to? Sure. I mean, we will have lots of events in the fall. You know, I think September 10th in New York is when they get McNally Jackson down on South Street. And well, yeah, well, that stuff is still kind of being assembled and set up. People can find me in all the usual ways, like Instagram and Twitter and Facebook. And the books are on, you know, Amazon or at bookstores, you know, WebPlanetStream is the new one. And, you know, the occult control system is the one that we've been talking about a little bit too.

4^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Sam Tripoli Transcript and Discussion^2017-06-29^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, dear friends, and thank you for tuning in to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour. It is with great reservations that I play the following song. I consider it to be one of the most satanic anthems ever performed for human ears. It is a song that has within it a philosophy that if you follow it, it will drag your life into absolute and utter oblivion. If you're superstitious, if you're super stoned, if there's any part of you that easily falls prey to demonic influences, then I recommend that you stop and just jump ahead to the interview part of the podcast. Because this song can infiltrate your being and crush your life. It can fill your brain with the maggots of little life, maggots hissing lies. It can fill your brain with maggots that lie and vomit more lying maggots that dance around the inner corridors of your brain, infecting every part of you with mediocrity. You've been warned. I will now play this evil anthem in three, two, one. Just thinkin' about tomorrow clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow, till there's none. When I'm stuck with the day that's gray and lonely, I just stick out my chin and grin and say, Oh, this song will come out tomorrow, so you gotta hang on till tomorrow comes. That song is a recipe for destruction sung by an imp cast out by her parents because they wanted to be in the present moment. And all she would do is bellow out that siren song, inviting them to start worrying about what side of the rock they're on is facing the star it orbits around. Here's J. Krishnamurti's response to little orphan Annie. The future is now. We are the past. Right? All our memories which have been recorded in the brain, all that we have done, not only fifty years ago but yesterday, so the past is now. Right? And what is now, if there is not a radical change, will be tomorrow, which is time. The future is therefore in the now. Right? So where is becoming then? You are following? Please, it's very fascinating, very serious. But if you are interested, if you really want to discover for yourself a radical, psychological, deep change, the change cannot have time. It must happen now. You are now. Listen to the Indian man. Don't listen to the singing orphan. The singing orphan will destroy you. If you listen to the singing orphan, you will end up sucked into a vortex where you're always waiting until tomorrow to make the big change. The Indian man, J. Krishnamurti, the great sage and brilliant guru is saying, you have to do it this instant. Don't wait for tomorrow to come up to listen. He's saying, give up the past. The future is inside of you. The past is inside of you. You are a silkworm, but instead of silk, you make time. You make the future with every single action that you do. So he's giving us a reprieve from the past. It doesn't matter that you masturbated 15 times today. It doesn't matter that you said some shitty thing to whoever. He's saying, forget about all that and right now make the change through action. Did you say something shitty to someone that you actually love? Go tell them that you love them. Did you smoke a pack of cigarettes today and there's only one left in the pack? Go put that one last cigarette underneath the sink. Do it now. Start fighting the war today against entropy. You might lose. We all lose the war against entropy, but it's the fight that matters. We can't get caught up in tomorrow and this little ape descendant red haired Satanist is telling us that we should be that is lying to us and saying that if the rock that gravity has trapped our meat bodies on rotates one more time to face the sun, everything's going to be fine. Well, she's a lying bitch. Abandon that philosophy. It doesn't matter how many times this thing rotates around if you're an asshole. If you're an asshole, everything stinks. Doesn't matter what where the rock you're on is facing. In relation to the star, it happens to be stuck around. Make the change now. Don't listen to the orphan. Listen to Jay Krishnamurti. Hare Krishna. The Dunkin' Dressel Family Hour is brought to you by a t-shirt company that manufactures some of the softest t-shirts on Earth. And it's come about where, unfortunately, I have to give a warning in relation to this t-shirt company. These shirts are so soft, so incredibly soft that it's created a bit of a problem. It's not a big deal, but we have to say, if you are a mother and you have a child between the ages of zero and six months old, if you order one of these short design t-shirts you need to write on the baby in permanent marker, this is my baby. Because what's been happening is the shirts are so soft that people have been confusing their babies with the shirts. They end up breastfeeding the shirts. The babies go without food. Nothing bad has happened to a baby, but they got hungrier than usual. Because the mother goes into this soft trance, as we all know when you wear something very soft, you can go into the trance of the ancients and journey down that dark pathway into the place where the Lord of the Forest plays his flute for you and you end up mating with the Pequie Queen. This is an incredible experience and one that I partake of every day. I do drink of the nectar of that great sweet queen. But if you're a mother, you need to be focusing on your baby for a little while. It doesn't mean you can't wear the shirt. Just don't breastfeed the shirt because the baby will get hungry. Now, why are these shirts so soft? This is an email I got from Pope Benedict XIV a few days ago. The answer is, why are the shirts as soft as a baby? Well, because they're made of the softest thing on earth and that's baby skin. The folks over at Sure Design T-shirts have figured out a way to graft cells from the backs of bad babies and they use these cells and put it in a biochemical fungal dip, which causes baby skin to grow. No babies are hurt in the process. This is just pure unadulterated baby skin. I've seen pictures of the underground, plasmatic caves where the baby skin is hewn and it's incredible. Just stretches and stretches of fresh, sweet, smelling, clean baby skin. As the Sure Design T-shirts logo goes, there's nothing quite as soft as behind a baby's ear, so it's Sure Design T-shirts of which we wear. That's their saying and that's what they sing is they make these shirts and those sweet, sweet underground, plasmatic factories deep beneath the soils of Thailand, brewing baby skin so that we all can experience communion with the Lord of the Forest. Sure Design T-shirts, you'll know what I'm talking about if you order one of these shirts. Go to SureDesignT-shirts.com. If you put my name in, you'll get 10% off.

I started a practice a month or so ago and I must admit I found it delightful. The advantages are numerous. In addition to the water saved, no toilet splashes or piss hitting water noise, no missing the bowl and hitting the rim, no need to even lift up the seat. I've left the actual commode for number two, you know, poopies. And since urine comes out sterile, a quick turn of the faucet leaves everything pristine. Before you dismiss this practice as barbarian, give it the old college trot. In no time, you two will join the ranks of the proud, handsome sink pissers. A classic post from Kula Shaker, one of the members of the DuncanTrustle family, our forum. If you've pissed in the sinker, if you would like to continue that thread, why not go to DuncanTrustle.com, join the forum, get on on a conversation. We also have a Minecraft server that I just found out. There are secret celebrities that hang out in that Minecraft server. From what I've heard on the wind, whispered by the Moon Caterpillar. Go, DuncanTrustle.com, join the forum and please come see me live. If you live on the East Coast, I'm going to be doing a bunch of dates. I'm performing in Atlanta at the Laughing Skull. I'm going to be at the Knitting Factory in New York. I'm going to be in Virginia. I'm going to be in Boston. I'm going to be in Philadelphia. I'm going to be in a lot of places in between. So go to DuncanTrustle.com and check out the dates. All right, let's do this podcast. Sam Tripoli is today's guest. He is a brilliantly funny comedian, and he's also the host and producer of a podcast and a live show called The Naughty Show, which you can check out by going to SamTripoli.com. The Naughty Show is a hilarious comedy show. Jason Tebow is also on that show. Brian Redban is on that show, and also the show is often frequented by world-class porn stars. It's a hilarious mix. It's actually a very, very funny show, and it will cause you to redefine your idea of porn stars and porn in general. And we talked about that during this interview. It was really quite enlightening. I love Sam Tripoli. He's just one of the most unique people ever, and he's fearless and inspirational, and this podcast really got me thinking about a lot of cool stuff. So please, everybody, sit back, relax, sit down. You just should coat Sam Tripoli with as many blasts of your psychic semen as you can. Really soak him down. Drench him. Drench him like a Colombian cocktail prince. Really let him feel the blast. Everyone, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour my friend, comedian, Sam Tripoli. It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour. Sam Tripoli. You know, man, you basically, like, found this neat... You're the porn comedian. Yeah, I guess. I never started out to be that, but it just kind of... Let me tell you something, Dunkin'. Let's say you're protesting the world banks, right? Yes. And you have 10,000 people show up to your protest, and four of them are porn stars? Yes. The news will all be about how porn stars are protesting the world bank. Yes. There's just something about these chicks that people, they get excited. They just want to see, they either love them to death or hate them to death, and they have an opinion on them, and they want to see them. Yes. And when you do something, because like I do this naughty show, which, you know, I've asked you to get in, and when we do it in a different place, of course, you'll be able to do it. You know, like the porn star is just one part of this humongous thing that this naughty show is, but yet that's what everybody talks about. Well, the name is the naughty show. You give out sex toys. Yeah. You're sponsored by Flashlight. Yeah. The show is, I told just a whole area show. I've been to the show. I've went to the podcast festival is on the show, and it is funny, and it is more than... You are awesome. Thank you. But it is more than like talking about sex, but because of your, so you are embedded into the porn star community. Well, yeah, I will accept that answer. How many porn star friends do you have? I have tons. Countless. Yes. As many as comedians. I, it's up there. So you're, you're, it's the sex industry. I just enjoy the world of sexuality, and I just enjoy discovering what people are into and like why they're into that, and how'd you get into that, and what gets you off, and just all that different stuff that I think is like real. Yeah. Like I think that's, that nobody talks about. No one looks at it without judging it, and just is like kind of like, okay, you're into this, you like to get choked and spit on. What is that about? Right. And how'd you get into that, and when did that happen the first time? Yeah. How'd that make you feel, like I love to explore that stuff without making it some lowbrow stupid, like kind of conversation that like television tends to do. Like they're just a bunch of tits jumping around and some guy who's just collecting a check right and some lowbrow, lowbrow stupid kind of dick joke when it's like, let's really take a look at this thing and let's wire you into that. Like with the exception of like pedophilia. Yes. I'm pretty much going to be open to what you're saying. You're not judging people, and that brings something at that probably like creates a situation where, because that's a, that's part of being a porn star is, is porn stars are interesting in that they, but they're immediately ostracized and shut for their job. They're shoved into this category of society. Right. They're shunned essentially. There is a, there's a large, it's almost what we were just talking about. You know, it's like, you're going to go on something. 3% are going to like you. 97% aren't going to like you. But those 3% love you. Same things with these girls. They got a small percentage of the population that is infatuated with them. And it's just, it's, I, I, dude, I'll tell you, I say this a thousand times. You cannot tell the, if I listed all the characteristics of a, of a stand up comic and all the characteristics of an adult film star, and I didn't label them and I had made you guess which ones, which you'd have a really hard time. What are the characteristics? Kind of anti authority, little cuckoo in the head, have issues from their childhood, you know, doesn't want a lot of responsibility, wants as much money as possible for as little work as possible. I mean, we could just go down the whole list. Yes. Yeah. And I've heard that before. I strange, like I have, I have friends with one porn star, a gay porn star named Connor Habib, who's fucking a brilliant essayist and a philosopher, really cool guy. But I'm not, I'm not friends with it. Like all my, like you and red band or like your friends with these girls, but I don't know. I don't know. I guess I kind of know Dana Dermond. Yeah. But if you met them and you talk to them, they would be the most normal people you would ever meet. They're not, it's not like, Oh my God, I'm going on some cock crazy fest every time you hang out with them. They really are. There's just a lot of them. This is just business decisions. This is their art. That's their art as, as crazy as that sounds. Yeah. And I'm not saying it's for everybody. You know, I'm just saying that's just what they do. I mean, I could introduce you to a ton of porn stars. You'd be like, that chick is cool as shit. It's a, it's, I mean, it's like with other arts, it's, it's, it is definitely sex is a form of self-expression. Yes. No question about it. Right. Comedy is a form of self-expression. Sex is definitely a form of self-expression that has within it its own personality. Yeah. No one fucks the same way. Everyone fucks in a different way. It's like a snowflake. It's like a fuck, a fuckflake. It really is like a fuckflake. Everyone has fucks their own way. And porn stars are people who have refined that mode of self-expression so that you could even say porn stars have their own voice. Couldn't you? 100%. And they're, they're specialized in certain things. Like there's genres of comedy. There's genres of porn stars. Give me an example of these genres. Oh, there's like SM. There's like, I mean, there's this, this one website. I'm dying to interview these guys from kink.com. They're such interesting people. It's almost, they've created, they have this humongous building in San Francisco. And there's like this, supposedly the top level is where like only the masters make it to that. They have this like dom, sub like lifestyle. That's insane. Is it a dungeon? It's a dungeon. It's everything dude. They learn all aspects of just mastering sexuality. And it's just the stuff that they put out is so interesting. It's just an observational artistic point of view. It's like, it's not like this, what they call like a gonzo porn, which is get a camera and just do some weird shit and put it out. Like really like almost like a bad YouTube videos. Yeah. This is like well written, thought out, like fantasy pornography. And it's just such an interesting thing because like, I'm, you know, we just did a really big gay naughty show. 400 gay dudes in the main room at the comedy store. Most interesting dynamic ever, just how they interact and all that stuff. Cause it's almost like, I always said like weed is its own demographic. Like you got, you know, black comedy, Latino weed comedy. Yeah, for sure. Gay comedy is its own thing. It's its own culture and its own thing. I want to do a whole naughty show based on S and M because I think it's way bigger than anyone even understands. Oh, it's huge. I had, I got whipped by a dominatrix on this show. Mistress Justine Cross, you should have her on. She's awesome. Yeah. I went to the dungeon to get whipped by her because I thought maybe I'd be into it. I was kind of hoping I would be, you know, like, oh fuck yeah, this is going to be like a thing. But I wasn't really. I'm not in the pain, bro. I want my sex to feel good. But it's the, it's not pain. You know, I think that's a common misconception. Misconception about S and M as people think it's about pain when early it's about power dynamics. That's, that's nothing truer has ever been said. That's 100% what it's about. And if you talk to a lot of these SM girls, like they'll tell you like they get the richest guys out there. These super alpha male power brokers. Yeah. And they just want to be put in their place and just treated like shit because it's a vacation from responsibility. And it's, it's like at the deepest level because like sex is like, as far as the human gob stopper goes, sex is like pretty several cores down in there. Right. So if you can experience that kind of relief of any kind of responsibility, it's also kind of lazy. Like, you know what I mean? Like being submissive in a way. Well, there is something that they've been told like they don't want to think. They just want to be told what to do. They just want to be pleasure. Because you guys, these guys are like power brokers. These guys are running, they're CEOs of Fortune 500 company. Every minute that at work, like million dollar decisions are being made. Life's are, you know, lives and careers are made by one guy's thought. And he doesn't want, you know, he wants to go to this place and for an hour, he has no, no say in what's going to happen to him. Yeah. Complete surrender. Complete submission. Surrender. And it's like, man, we are in such an interesting time in the world of sexuality right now in this country. Like, you know, feminism's been around forever, the sexual revolution. But right now we're really seeing where it's like the age of where women can really do whatever they want and not be judged at all. Right. And it's a crazy time. You know, it's like, and like what women are into, like, I, I, you know, we have a lot of women on our show and just so many of them are into this kind of like that's really rough sex. It's like such an interesting thing. And the kind of fantasies they have, which go against everything that you hear in mainstream media and pop culture and just it's, it's such fantasies like what? Like, I mean, like, and of course, no means no, but you'd be amazed at how many girls have like rape fantasies. It's like, I have them on all the time and they just, they, they always, that's the one thing I guarantee. If I ask a girl, what's your fantasy? I don't know. Like really, what are you into? They'll, they'll say rape fantasy. And obviously everything's got to be agreed upon and no means no, you know. Yes. So, but there's just something about like somebody who wants you so badly that they just can't stop. You know what it is, man? My theory on rape fantasies is that women have been taught from the moment that they become sexual, that to have sex is, is like a bad transaction for them. Like there's kind of that business deal, bad business deal, no matter what, like, because it's the classic thing. The girl has sex all the time. What do we call her? Well, you know, here's the whole thing. Like that's kind of changing. But, but for most people that's what they came. The slut, the whore. The girl in high school who fucked all the guys was always looked down on. It's like something disgusting now. The, this is, you know, if you're at that book, Sex at Dawn, Dr. Chris. Yes, I have read that. So that book, you know, one of the, one of the things Chris Ryan says, which I like is that, you know, women are as sexual as men. Right. They're as, they have the exact same sex drive as men do. But women have been taught it's bad to have a sex drive. So the rape fantasy is something where you, you get to drop the aspect of shame that women, I think, have more of a feeling of shame when they have sex than men do. Well, I mean, I think a lot of the whole thing with the, you know, women being as, you know, as a promiscuous as men, I think the, the, the biggest fear and it's a will never change. And it's on the most primal level that you'll find that every, every form of animal and species is the ultimate betrayal is raising a child, thinking it's yours and it's not. Right. That's the ultimate. It's, it goes, it's as primal as anything out there. It's as primal as having to eat, breathe, drink water. Yeah. And you know, because the whole theory is that we are just vessels for our DNA to be passed on. Yes. That's why a man, you know, goes out and he tries to become as successful as he can so he can gain as much resources as possible. And, you know, the thought of spending your resources on offspring that isn't yours is the ultimate, you know, portrayal. So the whole thing was like the way to make sure the girl isn't cheating on you is that she only has sex with you and nobody else. Yes. Right. And that's where a lot of that comes from. Yeah. And that's the goddamn Christian shitting all over another fun thing. You know, he's got ruined something, right? They ruin everything. Dude, they like the, you know, this is like Chris Ryan's in that book. He talks about the reason the cock shaped like a plunger is because it creates a suction effect to pull out your competitor's jizz from the vagina. Really? Yeah. The implication being that like it wasn't just like when a woman, when a woman was having sex, she was having sex with like a lot of guys. It wasn't just one guy. Oh yeah. That's why they moan real loud to allow everybody. Yes. Some and somebody else. So this was a shared experience among like, it was a, you know, Terrence McKenna talks about this in just the most insanely beautiful way, which is like, imagine this like primordial past where there's no such thing as jealousy. There's no such thing as ownership. We're all sort of springing up out of the earth, eating psychedelic mushrooms and having these insane orgies at night in the middle of the forest, you know, tripping out and just merging with each other's bodies. And through that ritualistic sex, that's how children are born. Does anyone know who the fucking baby who owns the baby? No, no, no, you're right. No one cares. The baby like spring out of the tribe. The baby's spring from this insane, weird moaning primordial ritual that happens every once in a while. Who the fuck knows whose kid it is? Then it's like the goddamn ownership happens. The Christians come. The Christians are just a representation of the Roman Empire, of course. It's not, you know, the Roman, the whole story of modern day Christianity is constant. The Sun God people created put what's in the Bible. It's, you know, so it's such an interesting thing. The whole, you know, especially now it's like to be like super religious and believe you can't do all this. It's like we've seen through time that these taboo like acts really don't result in anything negative or bad. All this stuff that, you know, oh, if you do this, you're going to burn in hell. Over time we've seen none of that ever happens. I don't understand the notion of like condemning someone based on a sexual lifestyle that they live. It makes no fucking sense. I mean, I do this joke about like Canada, right? Yeah. Look at Canada. Anything we outlaw in America, they instantly green light up there. Yeah. Anything we're like, no, we can't do that. God hates that. Canada's like, whew, it's odd like Szechuan. And then, you know, nothing bad happens in Canada. They're the nicest people ever. Yeah. God, you, the shit that's legal in Canada, it should be fire and brimstone all over. Amsterdam should be just nothing but lightning bolts. Meteors. Yeah. Should just be fire. The place should be, if any, this is true. Demons springing out of the earth, dragging people down the hell. If you could take a step back from religion and look at it without emotion and you see like all these taboos, what you realize is they basically outlawed anything that doesn't create more of them. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes, man. It's a butt fucking jerking off, banging your buddy, you know, another dude. All those are taboo because they don't put out more of us. They don't make more. Yeah. But yeah, you can fuck a million chicks. The only rule is don't fuck your buddy's wife. Right. Don't, that's in, that's in, that's God put that in one of the commandments. Yeah. That shall not, what is it? That shall not cover that neighbor's wife. But here's the thing. I think the rule is she can't cheat on you, but you can cheat on her. That's the rule. If you really break it down, she can, the rule is like, don't have an affair. That's meaning a woman can cheat on her man. Yeah. This is, now this is all, all of this is like a, all of this is, I think, I think what you're kind of talking about is like, it seems like you think there's like another sexual revolution happening. I think right now there's a huge sexual revolution happening or at least just in this country. And maybe we're just getting to the point where Europe is kind of like, you know, you just got to think about Europe's been around forever. They've been through all this crazy shit. You know, all this religious armies, you know, oppressing people. Now they're kind of at the place where it's like, everything is just very open over there. They're very open with their sexuality. They don't overthink anything. And then you, you're looking at this country where the places are, are the most like fucking oppressive. There's like the weirdest sex stories come out like Florida. It's this very red state. You know, Utah, it's like these weird oppressions happen all through the South, you know, like you can't do this. Then they end up doing weird ass shit because they're so oppressed. You don't, you don't seem like you have any feelings of guilt attached to your sexuality at all. I don't know why you should. I mean, unless, you know, unless you're hurting, hurting other feelings. A lot of people do. Like you, you, when you're being raised, you know, when you're raised, a lot of people are raised in very religious families. And if you're raising a very fundamentalist family, then you're taught that the human body is filthy. The body is dirty. The body is something you cover up and that sex is kind of a byproduct of this. And you see this in a lot of different religions. People who wear sheets over their bodies when they have sex, very strict rules about when to have sex, how to have sex. So a lot of people are, I think this is something a lot of people struggle with. Like there's guilt attached to it. Like, man, I feel guilty if I jerk off to porn too much. Oh yeah. I mean, and I'm not telling you, I'm a master of, of my sexuality. I've dealt with like, uh, sex addicts, addictions and stuff like that. But to me that dealt with sex addiction. Yes. Yourself personally. Yeah. Pornography addiction. Yeah. I mean, but that, to me, that doesn't mean like everything's wrong. I haven't had the willpower to use it or do it in a responsible fashion that, you know, sometimes I got really like into it, you know, what do you mean, what do you mean really into it? Like, I mean, there were times where I was like, when I was partying, I was cranking out, like they say if you do something a thousand times at your master, I would have my black belt doctrine in pornography many years ago. You see, you would just sit in front of the computer looking at porn. Yeah. There were times. How, what's the longest stretch of time you ever looked at porn? Like a day. All day long, just looking at porn. And how many times would you masturbate during that time? Uh, well, you know, I was partying a lot at that time. So the whole time. So you, the whole time you'd just be jerking off. Yeah. Well, how do you do that? How do you keep that up? Well, again, man, it goes back to, uh, my, you know, addictions. I've had addictions across everything, you know, that I've, uh, just, I'm a guy who just, you know, when he enjoys something, he does it. And then, you know, I don't think, like to me, like, I don't think drugs should, uh, if you get busted with drugs, I don't think you should have to go to jail. I think it should be a treatment thing. I don't think it, you know, it's something where it's a crime being committed. If you steal something to get money for drugs, that's a whole different thing. So I mean, I just, because something you end up overindulging does not mean it's a crime for me. And you know, I've had some weird kind, you know, I've had problems with, uh, drugs, alcohol, and, uh, sex addiction. Right. What do you, what do you think was the most powerful addiction of those three? Well, the drugs and the sex addiction go hand in hand. You know, I've always said my superpower was I could fuck on Coke, you know, which a lot of people never could do. And so hardcore. Yeah. Oh yeah. That was a, that was, there was a time that's what I did. So you would snort cocaine and look at porn. Yeah. That's hardcore. So you would be in your house with like an eight ball. Yeah. Doing blow. Yeah. Watching pornography. There was a time. And you're hitting this place. Yeah. There's like a level that you're hitting when, when, when those two things are combining, I imagine that is so extra dimensional. Like you're, you're raising your. You're going for it. You're going for it. You're hitting this. You're exploring. You just, it's just a combination that just, is just kind of crazy. And is that, what do you, that, the reason. That's easier. Is it were you doing using pornography instead of like fucking girls? Because it's no, I was doing both. So you're doing, so you're doing both. I, you know, as I get a little older, the sex drive slows down a little bit. But like, man, I, I enjoyed women and I enjoyed it all. Dude, I, I mean, I like a lot of people call me dirty comic, but I'm just honest on stage with everything that I talk about and just, I just like that, man. I loved it. I love the party. I mean, I don't want you to think like I just get Coke and then I'd go home and I would just be like, turn on a computer door. It was just a crazy, you know, I hate to say it, crazy fun time I was in. It was fun. That led to a very destructive end. And, you know, and I, you know, and the reason I'm saying this is like, I don't know if anyone's listening out there that could have that problem, you know, and that, you know, they're going through it, but I went through that shit, man. And I got self-destructive. I fucked up a lot of part of my life, but now I'm kind of back. And it was going pretty good. You know, I mean, like, but that time was a crazy, fun time. Well, yeah, I mean, that is a, I mean, come on, man. It's like you, but you, this is the festival, you know, the festival of Dionysus. You know about this. This is like, well, it's the idea is that what happens is you. If you really go for it and see this is the, there used to be ritualized ways of going for it. It wasn't like now when people go for it, it's not ritualized, but you still have a sacrament, you still have, you're still invoking a spirit. It's just you're doing it instinctually rather than through this ritualistic way. But the idea was you would allow the spirit of wine, the spirit of celebration or the spirit of like that exuberant losing yourself to possess your body. And then when that thing came into you, you would just, that would be the, that, that possession. You see it in voodoo rituals where like their eyes go back in their head and they're not them anymore. And they'll be, they'll fuck in those states, right? Yeah. So the spirit comes into your life. You, it's a real thing, man. You, the, the, the sights that you're seeing are, you're almost peering into heaven or something. You're looking into through this keyhole into this temporary for you. Yes. Yes. And you can't fucking stay there, unfortunately. And, uh, and so the end result is your physical body begins to decay. And your life in this dimension begins to collapse around you. Every time you go into this alternate sex drug dimension, it's really quite unfortunate because, you know, ideally we would figure out a way to just always be in that state. Well, I've always been a guy who goes all in all the time on, you know, whatever I'm doing. I mean, at one time I was addicted to buying domain names. I couldn't, I couldn't stop buying domain names. I would just every day just thinking of a domain name acting up. That's just how I am. I'm, it's like all in all the time. I could see you like doing lines of blow buying domain names. That's right. It's just like how I am, man. And there was a time, you know, I'm just honest about it because I, you know, I'm just, I just want people to know that, you know, they're not alone and you can work through it, man. And it, it doesn't define you. And it was something you went through and you can get better. And that's where I'm at right now. God damn it. It's, see, this is the thing like, this is the beauty of honesty is it's like every time you expose yourself at that level and you don't have the, any shame going along with it. This is a beautiful thing because it makes people around you feel more relaxed. It makes people feel like, oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm not alone here. And you know, it's like the naughty show myself. It's not just sex. It's just like, I like to be real. I like to talk real shit that's really going on. You know, I, you know, I've always said people, uh, people want you to be honest until you, until you start getting really honest. You know what I'm saying? They don't, they say they want honesty, but they really don't. Like I want, I want, I want to go into that honest world about what is going on. Let's not dance around it. You know, you see it in comedy a lot where these comics are killing, but they're really just talking about things we all already agree upon. Yes. And they're like, oh, that's great. You know, because you're not taking chances. And this whole notion that being offended is the worst thing ever is like this. It's like this giant sin and it's almost a felony. If somebody's, if you offend me, you know what I'm saying? Oh, I'm offended. Oh, that's so angry. Why? Why? Why can we not agree? Why can I have a point? You disagree with me and hear out my point. And if you don't like it, move the fuck on. Don't like, don't, don't come see my next show. Don't buy my album. But why is it if I'm offending you because I'm being honest on stage? You know, is this the end of the fucking world? I've only seen you have good sets. I wish I've never seen like I mean that. I've never seen you not crush. Well, I'm a guy who's had, you know, I could be my worst nightmare. My own worst nightmare. I was having a conversation with Chris Delia the other day. He was talking about how he was listening to Bill Burr. Yes. And like, he's followed Bill Burr a thousand times and done really well. But this set was like Bill was killing and he got in his head and he just went up there and crushed it. And I used to be that guy who would overthink everything. And then just now is just go up. And if you like me, you like me. If you don't, you don't. And I got a million tools in the toolbox to get you on my side. And, you know, I mean, like you remember, you know, I've always said, I'm so thankful to you. You came up with a way to get me into the comedy store, which, you know, changed my life. And I would follow dice every day for a year, literally every day for a year. I get about four spots a week. And this is when dice was in town a lot and he would bump me and do an hour. And then you just got to find a way to survive. Yeah. And, you know, Comedy Central now is very interesting because if you're watching it, they're doing a lot of darker, dirtier shit. They're following kind of FX lead where they're going, which to me, I'm saying dark, dirtier, I'm calling it real. I mean, they're doing real stuff that you see in real life. They're not pulling any punches. And now I'm starting to see in the crowds, they're a lot more open to what I'm saying instead of this knee jerk, organ rejection of like these buzzwords that they hear, they're like automatically get offended. Yeah. Now they're like, oh, okay, I'm going to see where this goes. And it's completely the dynamic has changed and it's so fun to watch. Yeah, you're, yes, the dynamic is shifting right now. And it's definitely, it seems like the shift is a shift from phoniness into people articulating as honestly as they can, their own experience of reality. And that's a, that's a brand new thing because the, the, uh, it used to be, if you were a celebrity, just the slightest revelation about your personal life would create what was called a scandal at the time. And that could destroy you. That could destroy your, your ability to work as a TV actor, whatever. If it just came out, if it came out that you'd had anal sex with a stewardess or something, that could crush you. Right. So people had to hide it. Like, you know, I've heard that, like, I saw some, you know, what I feel is like there was a time where you could do whatever you want and no one talked about it. Yes. There was this kind of like, if you were a celebrity, you were kind of like, there was a little bit of respect that this personal life is kind of your own thing, like Frank Sinatra. Yes. I mean, the, the shit that guy used to do, no one ever reported on it because he was blue eyes and you showed him that respect. And you know, if you look at comedy back when it first started, Sam Kenneson, uh, uh, a dice, even, uh, Bill Hicks, it was a very raw kind of comedy because nobody knew what kind of standup was at the time. Yeah. And it was like, they couldn't build comedy clubs fast enough. Crowds didn't know what was going on and they would just come see these guys come up and say some crazy ass shit. And then like kind of right around, uh, and I could tell when art change was when Britney Spears made this cover of Rolling Stone, that in my mind, I'm like, I remember being young going, whoa, this is a little different. Something's changed. And from there it kind of came corporate where the corporate people, you know, all the corporations were controlling the message and it got really, really safe. Yes. Totally. And it was like, you didn't go, you know, everybody wanted to be Seinfeld, who is a great comic, but that's him. He, he's doing him and you're asking everyone to be him and you just can't do that. So then it got really tight and now we're in this magical place of if you're good enough and you got some crazy enough, you can get a little following going. Yes. Yeah. But it, yeah, it's still not going to be sanctioned by the networks generally. Like they're still like looking for, this is the, I've been thinking about this lately, sort of like the predicament that the networks are in, which is like the predicament, all the television networks are in, is that they have to appeal to the median because the median has the most number of people in it. You don't want to apply to the most dumb people because there's less, most dumb people than there are average people. And you certainly don't want to apply to appeal the smartest people because there's less of them. You want to apply, you want to, you have to appeal to the average. And the reason you have to appeal to the average is because you're selling advertisements and the advertisements want you to have the most number of viewers to justify paying the crazy amount of money they're paying for their fucking advertisements. Right. So if something comes to you, like for example, you would never, ever want to represent Vincent van Gogh, a few are a TV network. You never want that. Right. Like first of all, he wasn't, no one even knew what the fuck he was until way after he killed himself, but you would want someone like Vincent. Which I think is my career trajectory. You're not going to kill it. No, no, no. You're not going to kill yourself. And you know, you're, you'll see everything's shifting. But the, my point is the predicament of the networks is they don't want, they, they don't want Bill Hicks, but they want someone like Bill Hicks. They want Bill Hicks light. Yes. They want someone who's going to appeal to the most number of people. And the most number of people is always the least remarkable amount of people. And so what's been happening up until the, this awesome new, uh, the Netflix and podcasts and the ability for people to access their own content through secondary ways, other than the networks is that, uh, the networks have been creating these stars, but the stars are always safe. Well, what, what, what has happened though, and I always believe this is what the real point of reality television was, is that it's about getting rid of talent because you got to deal with talent, whereas you just make pretty people famous. You replace them with pretty people. Yes. People get an attitude. You're out. Here's another pretty person. You also, what sells reality shows is this self-destructiveness. Like that because self-destructiveness, it's not like just being trainwrecks of talent. Yes. Because it's like what they would like about Vincent Van Gogh. Yeah, it's not as painting. You can cut your air off somewhere during the show. They'd love that. They'd love it. They condemn it, but they would put it out pain as much as you want. But can you just cut your fucking ear off? That's what they like because that, and so there's people who imitate that. But yeah, man. So you end up, what, what ended up happening for all of our lives is unless you were lucky enough and you knew people who may be like, Hey, listen to this shit's fucking Bill Hicks, it's incredible. Or maybe like you would see him for four minutes on TV or something. But unless you got lucky enough, you were being exposed to like Jay Leno. Yeah. What's safer than Jay Leno? Yeah. Jay Leno is like a talking jam sandwich. Yeah. There's nothing safer. There's nothing just more in the middle of like grandma's apple pie. Just doing jokes. Yeah. Just as safe as you can get. He's there is nothing. And if he does get a little edgy, it's just the, it's like edgy in the way that like when you're, I totally agree with that, man. It's so funny and I can understand the point of that, but I don't understand why people don't want to be moved either. Like I'm like nothing would drive me crazier than when I spend $10 or $15 now to see a movie and it's something I think I could do by myself. You know, if I could write a script like that, I want someone to come in there and just rock me and I can be, it can make me angry, man. I don't know one that became a thing where I got a little fucking upset about what I've seen, why did that become something that's so bad? Yeah. Why can't I move you? Why can't I get you a little enraged? Bring it back. And you can, but it's not going to appeal to the, the median and the, the drive behind major movies and major TV shows is not to move people. The drive is to make money. Yes. That's it. And the way that you make money is to appeal to the most number of people. So many people's possible. So what you'll always get in the mainstream from now until infinity is this diluted version of truth. But, but what's happening is we're getting micro markets where people are like, which is what you're doing, which is what any, like podcasting or anything is appealing to a demographic that TV could give a fuck about anyway. Right. They're like, who cares? We don't, we don't, we don't care if you're podcast. Oh, you're getting 40,000 downloads an episode. Wow. That's great. We get billions, billions of billions, you know what I mean? So that, so they don't even fucking care, even think about it. They're just desperately trying to think of a way to print these things that are just the right amount of edgy, just the right amount of symmetrical, pump that shit out. And that used to be a satanic fucking thing because what it ended up doing is it ended up teaching the world that what was normal was this watered down, safe, yapping jam sandwich. Yeah, that is not normal. No, 100%. That's just fucking, that's just a shill. That's a, that's a lure that some network has thrown into the waters of television, desperately trying to catch green fish out of the pockets of bored geriatrics. Yeah, it is, but that's, you know, Jay Leno's like a big fat fucking big fat bobber out in the middle of the sea, just trying to catch. Catch as many deadly as catch, just carp, not even going for weird, deep fish down in the sand and completely agree with you. So, so yeah, so man, I think the shift that you're talking about is people have access or getting more and more access to people like you. They're getting more and more access to people who are, who are like, have absolutely zero inhibitions about saying in front of the world. Yeah, at one point I would watch porn all day while I was doing cocaine. Yeah, that's beautiful. That's what, hey, well, it's my story, man. The biggest thing is like, I don't, I don't want anyone to think that I think you should be defined by your sexuality. I'm really not for that. Like whenever like a TMZ gets mad, somebody, because they won't admit they're gay, I don't think you should have to come out that you're into something. You should just be okay with that's what I'm into. Yeah. And you're not alone, that there's other people into that shit. I don't think your sexuality should define you. I just think it's if you're in the weird shit or whatever it will say weird, not normal, that you're not alone. Man, the thing with weird shit and, and, and I, like God knows, I've done some weird fucking shit sexually, but like the thing about weird shit is it's all, it's like, I think you think I'm too in my head, man, because like whenever I have sex or like do some weird, really crazy fucking kinky thing, it's just like, it's not to my head. It's just this like ephemeral blip, you know, it's this thing suddenly in my life, like, wow, here's a person standing in front of me and I have my belt around her neck. I've collared her. I'm probably going to spank her. And, and then like, there's that moment that's happening. There's the ephemeral moment of happiness, which is like, well, this is fucking cool. That thing's cool. You're, wow, this fucking cool. You get lost in the moment of that. Yes. You fall into the thing. You're magnetized into the thing. And for maybe like the hour, however long the experience is, this thing happens anywhere from two minutes to an hour. Yeah. When I said an hour in my mind, I'm like, for that, that includes stretching and tea for that six minutes. Send me a couple of emails. I was like, yeah, I'm glad you picked up an hour. What am I fucking Lance Armstrong for like the three minutes that the event is taking place? Right. There's like this ephemeral, beautiful moment, but then it's gone. And all that goddamn energy it took to get to that fucking moment. Right. You know what I mean? You went to see the master. Well, that's anything, the Super Bowl, it's this build up and then it's over. And then it's like, okay, what now? Christmas, anything's like that. The biggest thing is you just can't make it everything. Right. I just don't think you should define you. And I just don't think that you should feel ashamed of what you're into. Right. I just, I can't stand when someone in the news loses their job because they like some weird shit in the bedroom. Like, it makes no sense to me when somebody gets fired for being busted doing something weird. Sexually. Sexually. Yes. As long as it's with consenting adults, well, first, first of all, man, let's take a real honest look at sex. It's already weird. Yeah. Like think about sex itself. Do you think anything beyond just trying to conceive children is that is that's primal, right? That's that's what's weirder than trying to conceive children. You want to talk about fucking kinky. How about trying to spray that white shit on the eggs to grow a baby? That's weird, dude. That's fucking weird. You're trying to make life. There's no way to make sex normal because sex is weird. Sex is weird. It's weird. You're dealing with your fucking crazy. You're dealing with your crazy body. You're dealing with your, your, your, your elongated blood and gorge member blasting into a self-secreting tunnel in the middle of some woman's legs who's making strange primordial guttural moans in the dark. You've turned the light off because you're ashamed of your body probably and you're fucking humping in your head. You're like, oh, Jesus Christ, don't come, don't come, don't come. The whole time you're like weird and freaked out and maybe she thinks that this is some like, you know, that because of this, it means a whole lot of other things and you think it means things and then you got to go get a fucking. You don't know if you've got AIDS now or if there's, there's so many crazy things that happened from fucking already. Yeah. And that's just missionary position. You know what I mean? 100% it's already weird. So yeah, when someone's like, oh my God, he likes butt plugs. So what? So what? It doesn't get weirder. Yeah, I'm with you on that. That's my whole point. It's like, so what? The guy likes butt plugs. Who cares? Doesn't mean he can't be a great realtor. Do you know what I'm saying? You're like, Hey, man, I just found my realtor loves butt plugs in his ass. I can't work with why. Who cares? He's defiled. He's defiled. The Satan's gotten into it. Now I'll tell you this, man, I have gone to SNM events. I've been on LSD watching men get whipped. I've seen it. I've seen it. I felt the vibe, the fucking SNM vibe. I know what it is. I like it. But the shocking thing is that if you go to a fundamentalist Christian church, I'm talking the homophobes, the right wing fucking Phelps family style snake handling fucking homophobic sons of bitches, those people, and that vibe there is 50,000 times creepier than the vibe you'll get at a dark ass club with techno music club. I completely agree with that. Do you know what you're dealing with? Idealism that is not real. They're putting out something that is anti people. It's you're, you're striving to something that does not fit naturally. So you're, so everybody's denying these natural urges that if you overindulge, yes, like me, it's bad, but you're denying your what make what you enjoy. Yes. For something that hopefully will happen. And I listen, I, my best friend from high school is the most religious dude in the world. Love him to death. That's his thing. He's happy. Okay. But I hate all anybody who lives in this world where it's idealism and they get mad if you don't see that world like that. And that's the conservatives. And that's the fucking progressives too. I'm both sides. I can't stand either side because it's not real. What you're pushing is not real. You want people to look at you. Keep going. Yeah. I just, I don't, I don't believe in idealism. I believe in realism. Stop right there. We're back. I just did one of my, when people do what I just did to Sam, I want to cut their throats out my fucking phone. But she happens. Sorry, Sam. Well, it's a couple calls. So it could have been commissioner Gordon or some shit. I had a friend call twice in her own something. Usually that means like somebody's foot got blown off. Well, that means that they really want to come to their show. Yeah, it's, yeah, it's my friend, Emo, where he's, he's in this band. But man, this is what I want to say to you. This woman, I know there's a woman who wants to have an all straight prom, right? You know about her, right? Yeah, I've heard. I haven't dove into the whole like the story of it, but I've seen clips of it. This woman is the most revolting human I've ever seen in my life. She's so fucking uptight and sick and like you want to talk about defensiveness or like perversion, that level of sexual perversion. That's what offensive there is darkness lurking in there. She's probably into something. You know, if you go into a lot of recovery programs, the most conservative, hardline recovery person is the person who always was in the most sickest, destructive lifestyle before they got in and they have to overdo it just to make sure that they never go back to that. And you see that a lot with these guys who are like, come out as the, you know, they're anti gay and it turns out they're totally gay. Always. Because they have to overreach so hard to convince not only everybody, but mostly themselves that they're not that person. Yes. Like, like I've always said, if you hate somebody, like if you like the gays, right, if you hate the gays, it's almost like people hate the New York Yankees. You hate them for a couple of reasons. One, they did something bad to you. You know, they, they beat the shit out of your team. Yeah. Or you want to be them so badly. Yeah. They drive you crazy. Yes. You want your team to be the Yankees. You want your team to buy all the players and get all the best players and win all the World Series that you get. You hate them so much because they got what you want. That's the same thing with these people who are so anti gay. They're like deep down side. The truth is that they're probably gay themselves and they hate the fact that they're like that. So the only way to do it is destroy what almost hurts them. They, you know what it is, man? I mean, I think I know a lot of them are gay, but I think there's another version of them too, which is they see people who have had the courage to fully be themselves and they've been living their entire lives in this state of repression, not just sexual repression. But they've like, you know, digested this teaching that is more than always saying, don't follow your instincts. Don't be yourself. The body is perverse. The desires of the body are tainted. Always be in control. Always be in control. And they see somebody who's like, this is me. You know, the whole fucking heaven thing. I don't, I'm not buying it. I'm going to just, I think this might be heaven. Yeah. And I think the only way for me to be in heaven is if I'm fully myself. I can completely agree. The whole notion that you go to heaven and like, what then? Like you go there and you just have all the hot gay sex you want for eternity. Like is heaven just this place where you, everything you couldn't do here, you can totally do up there. Every, all the drugs you want are free. Everybody's raw dogging. Nobody gets, if you get pregnant, angel gets its wings. Like what goes on in heaven? Like, I don't understand that, that we can't like, we can't be ourselves here in order to get there. Then what happens there? Well, that, yeah, right. Yeah. Exactly. Right. You cut yourself off here so you can go there and do it there. And just gack out on crack and math and fuck weird shit. They don't think of, they don't think about it. They don't think that far ahead. I think, you know, I think maybe in the most fundamentalist sense, they would say that it's not that you're ratifying the senses in heaven. It's that you're in the presence of God. And that's all that you want to be is in the presence of God. But what they can't accept is that when you're sitting in front of your illuminated computer, the strange light on your face, perhaps a nose bleed starting, your, your, your cock is sore from jerking off for the seventh time. What they can't accept was I call Thursday, Thursday. They can't accept that God's there too. Yeah. That God's shining in that too. And this is what I, this is the crazy thing about Hinduism, which is something that if you were perhaps, if you were into Hinduism, what they would say you or is a shy fight. And if you look up there, that Shiva, Shiva is the representation of the, what would be considered the, uh, uh, Tantra or the destructive element of the universe, which is the people who really, really are into Shiva. They like, they're fucking crazy. They're like Hindu Rastafarians. They have like dreadlocks. They smoke massive amounts of weed. They hang out in cemeteries. They eat corpse flesh. They cover their bodies in ashes and they have weird fucking sex. And like they do this because they believe that God is in everything and that that deep, deep, thick underlying, raw pulsation of life that is represented in the destructive aspects of life. Like when you're saying like it's strange that a lot of women are getting into like rough sex and like that aspect of sex that's just primordial and prime, I don't want to say violent because it's bigger than violent. I don't want to say it's, it's something deeper. It's just this like wild fucking dinosaurs fighting. Right. Fucking. Right. Primal. Primal. Well, that's Shiva. That's represent. That's the energy of Shiva, the energy of, of Kali. And so when you create a system like that, then all of a sudden you're not dealing with other Christians are always like fucking putting in their closet, which is like your God is a fucking freak. Right. You've got a freak God because your God is like supposed to know everything and be capable of everything and like be omniscient. Yet somehow the thing like created Satan and like knew that when you made these monkeys evolve into people, they're going to start fucking each other in the ass and that the P1 to fuck themselves in the ass are going to burn in hell forever and you created this whole fucking odd, why would you even create the asshole if you weren't going to allow the fuck it? Yeah, these are questions you would want to interview God. These are like the first questions you would ask the crazy Christian God. God, I'd love to get God on my podcast. How great would that be if you could interview God in your podcast? It'd be fucking awesome. Who do you think we get more downloads? God or Justin Bieber? It's going to be Bieber, probably. I mean, because what's yeah, I mean, it's going to be really close. Bieber's got to do something spectacular. Now, if God came on, right, and God's like, listen, man, I don't some got lost in translation here. I don't know where this whole hate the gays thing. Dude, all good, bro. I'm gay. Every guy's like, I'm gay. Yeah. I mean, dude, Jesus walked around with some dudes. He was gay. We're gay. We didn't hang out in the cave long enough with your buddy. Some get fucked. That would be the one of the greatest moments in human history. If verifiably it was God, we saw he's like, yeah, I'm definitely God. Watch he creates planets floating around the earth. We see him raise a dinosaur out of the La Brea targets and put it back down. He's like, undeniably, 100% God. And then somewhere like midway through an interview, he's like, oh, no, gays, I made humans. So they have gay sex with each other. It's the best. You guys should just be fucking. Yeah, I don't know. The question is how many people would reject him because all their teachings they got like, nah, nah, nah, this, this God's crazy. Where's cool God? Yeah, God, it doesn't want us to do anything. Maybe like that's Satan. Yeah, that's Satan. There'd be some business to be like, no, no, you don't want to buy it. Well, that that's that's what Satan does. And then Satan would appear the moment that God came out of the closet. Satan would appear and be like, I'm God. Yeah, that is an imposter. Yeah, the gays are evil. Yeah, and then they would totally run to him. And they would totally be like, hey, man, you know, well, that's this is like the Democrats used to be the racist before the Republicans were the open minded. And then some just flipped. Yeah, now the Republicans are the racist. The Democrats are the open minded. At some point they would switch that everyone be like, there's a time when God will everyone was behind God. Yeah, it's like, no way. Yeah, it's so evil. God, yeah. Well, this is the I mean, this is like a this is the idea. The idea is that like the moment that if you put in it's fun to think about like the Christian the way Christians deal with evil because their God can't be evil. So they have to embody evil and they embody evil in Satan. So you so so you've got to have this outcast being that's for whatever reason like really in in in the like creating evil activities. But the so that the real notion here's the crazy. The notion is that indeed there is a force of evil in the universe. And when when Jesus came to earth and started teaching people, listen, the only thing that matters is love. That's it. There's no other rules. Just love your neighbors yourself. Love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind and soul. You can hang all the other commandments on this. You don't need priests. You don't need preachers. You don't need anybody telling you how to be because the super intelligence of the universe is immediately accessible to everybody. And in fact, to really demonstrate that, look who I'm hanging out with a prostitute. I'm washing your feet and look who else I'm hanging out with drunks, tax collectors. Check it out. Doesn't matter. I'm God and I'm going around with you. You consider it to be the most vile and horrific aspects of society. These are my children. So that happens. And all of a sudden you have what I would consider to be a pretty awesome religion. You have a religion where a guy is hanging out with prostitutes saying all that matters is love, right? So the real force of evil in the universe sees this and it's like, oh, fuck. This ruins everything. Yeah, 100 percent. Yeah, the peace and the love always take a bullet to the brain. Yeah, we got to get rid of him. First of all, always get him out of the fucking casino. Get him out of the casino. They're pressing the buttons. Get that guy out of the casino. Get him out of the casino. Bang, crucify him. We got rid of him. You know, maybe they make something about up about him coming back, but it's like the motherfucker's gone now that he's gone. Let's let's redefine what all of your neighbors yourself think, you know, and that's the beginning of fucking modern day Christian and it's so crazy how people justify their hate as like for their religion. It's so interesting. But let me just say this, you know, religion is such an interesting thing because some people get like they get they get drove crazy by religious people. But then I also sometimes think, just imagine if there was no religion, how crazy people would just go. There's some psychopaths out there. The only reason they don't go on major killing spree is sorry about that. It's because they believe that if they do that, they're going to burn in hell for eternity. The only thing holding them back from going on a fucking rampage is this thought this dude in the sky is watching and he will go fucking nuts on him. Interestingly enough, there's a lot of people in the world who are currently on murderous rampages because they think a God is telling them. Oh, yeah, right. It's interesting. It's definitely interesting. I would say that if religion didn't exist, there would be less murderous rampages than religion existing because religion existing has been the source of, as we all know, and this has been said a million times, religion existing is pretty much one of the primary motivating factors for murderous rampages. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, organized murderous rampages in the form of crusades. Also, the murderous rampages in the form of the witch burnings, murderous rampages in the form of all the, the God. It's like, it's so interesting that people like their voice in their head, which tells them to do these evil shit. They, they say that's God. Isn't that crazy? Yeah. Well, it's the id, you know, and then that's the, it is crazy. And it's, it's, it's actually quite fucking depressing and it's sad. And, and, uh, but, you know, these things are shifting. And, uh, one way that they're shifting, I think, is the, uh, you know, every time, you know, the by sex becoming more mainstream, that's a great way to start a shift into, into, um, well, my whole thing with that is like, it's just like, you've seen that these things are all taboo forever. And here's this place where they're not taboo and people are being themselves and nothing bad is happening. Yes. So how can you hold on to that? See the whole notion that this thing on the other side is the, is the reward or the punishment is the most brilliant part of it. Cause there's no way to prove anything. Right. So you can hold on to that, but you can look at Canada. You can look at parts of Europe. You can look at parts of Brazil where people are very open and nothing is happening bad, but certain actions like killing somebody, bad things happen. Yeah. When you do that, a bad thing happens. When you're, when you're into certain things sexually and you do that, it's not the end of the world. You're not going to die. And then the guilt comes at the end when you do something nasty and then there comes that, that guilty moment. Yeah. It's like you're, it's like you're, you're training from childhood telling you that these acts are bad acts, not because something bad happens because simply because you've been told they're a bad act. You were, you were, you've been told they're a bad act by a freak. Yeah. You're told by someone who probably, probably at some point acted on those instincts, felt really bad about it again. And then is in, in turn, passing on the sickness generation and generation. I used to have a really, a joke I used to think was so good, but I could never get anyone to laugh at it. And it's about how religion is pretty much the only thing you accept from your parents to choose from you. Nothing else. Yeah. You would never let your parents choose your car, who you date, what job you take. Yeah. None of that stuff. But the explanation of the universe, perfectly happy about that. Well, you, yeah, well, you got it. Like, I, you know, that, yes, you're absolutely, that's a great joke. I've seen like, I'm Stan Hope, like, has this fucking joke about how like, you got it, like the reason that religion has to start with kids is because older people would never buy it. Like if you approach somebody with the story of the Bible when they were in their twenties and they'd never heard it before, they're like, yeah, I prefer Lord of the Rings. Yeah, that's really weird. Yeah, that is, but, but, you know, you tell a kid that and they're too, they have no control, so they, they absorb it and they believe it. But to go back into like the, the, uh, one thing you were saying made me think like, um, take marriage, right? Traditional classic marriage. I have a point. Can I say, yes, please. I had a friend of mine in a far distant land who taught at a very, uh, very, uh, conservative religious school and they were bringing up something about science and, uh, one of the kids raised her hand and goes, no, no, that's not true. God does that. And she's like, well, we've, science has proven that. No, no, God does this. And they basically had to call in like the head priest to come in and this adult watch this priest basically lie to this kid about what, what that was all about. The explanation of it was a full blown lie. Yeah. To continue them believing in what the scripture that they're trying to pass on, I mean, a full blow lie. Sure. Yeah, that's what they do. Yeah, it's crazy. Well, they've been trained to lie. Yeah. I mean, that's the, that's the idea they're trying to keep people in a trance. They're like the, the master hypnotist. And when people start falling out of the trance, they've got to come in and be like, no, no, no, no, no, 100% don't think that way. But it's fading away, man. I mean, all that stuff is fading away. And it will fade away and something new will be reborn. Something, this is a thing, man. It's like in every age, a new philosophy, a new religion springs up. And I always find that so interesting too. Like, like I always said, like Mormonism and Scientology is the, the, the UPN and the CW of religions, you know, these like kind of offshoots of these. Yeah. You know, and it's just like, it's so interesting that something could start like a hundred years ago, be like, this is how the universe started. You're like, but you're just a hundred years old. How do you know all that stuff? And it's just, it's interesting how fucking people getting doctorated into this stuff, you know, to continue the joke that I had before. It was, I was always talking about how they're, you know, at 18, there should be a religion fair. You go to a religion fair, all the religions, they push their product on you. At the end of the day, everyone's just going to choose Buddhism. Yeah, right. You know, it's just like, no shit, be cool, lay back, three other people. Fine. That's all I got to do. Yeah, it's all you got to do. And also Buddhism is like, I mean, there's the Dalai Lama in one of his books about science says, if science shows something that goes against Buddhism, then Buddhism has to change to science because Buddhism is always trying to like land on the truth. It's not trying to make shit up. It's just trying to land on the truth. And Buddha even said, don't just believe this because you hear it. Test it, study it. Is it real? Which is why in Buddhism, as opposed to like, you know, Christianity or some of the other like fun, not real Christianity, but like what it evolved into. The idea is you have faith. You must just have faith and believe this. Just have faith and believe it. Just have. Yeah, that's so interesting. Right. Yeah, it's not. Whereas in Buddhism, the invitation is you have to understand this to live it. You don't just believe it's real. You have to intellectually, logically, spiritually, on every single level, absorb the teaching and then you'll be a Buddhist. Yep. But it's not a faith based thing. Like imagine like if you're fucking doctor learned how to do brain surgery on faith, you just have faith. I can be a brain surgeon. No, I want the brain surgeon that fucking studied this shit. That's like, so, you know, the reason that you have, obviously the reason faith is like a major component in modern day Christianity is because fucking it's such crap, right? You know what, you can they have to adapt or it comes to an end. Well, I mean, you know, if it keeps, if you just go back to the real deal, that it is, it's an incredible religion. It's just like a very difficult religion to follow. And it's like, you know, what was Rogan's tweet? It doesn't suck that humans ruin everything. Right. Yeah. And it's just the truth. It's just human, like, like personal goals and drives and, and, and, uh, psyche, psychological problems ruin everything. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's, it's, uh, we are look at comedy. Look at comedy in Los Angeles. Okay. You know, you see all these guys who are hilarious and nothing's happening. You're like, why isn't something happening? Well, because the people who are the gatekeepers have these personal views of the world that these people don't fit into. So instead of being like, Hey, let's put out the best, they want to put out people that fit into their view of everything. Well, the median, the problem is the best in the median don't go together. Yep. That's true. Ever, ever. The median doesn't want the fucking best. They certainly don't. They were not going to be able to understand it. Nickelback's a bastard, right? There you go. Look at the median. Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Nickelback, name them, name them all. That's just, and what pissed me off about comedy is these guys who are like the Nickelback of comedy go around thinking they're Led Zeppelin. They like, they think that they're like revolutionizing everything. Yes. Like, I know their specials, the way they call it, like how they market them. Like he's not, he's taking chances. He may not survive this hour. You might see him die because he's taken all the risk. I was so drunk I put marshmallows on the grill. Right. That's totally out goes. I love watching that shit. It just like, he's an outlaw. He doesn't play by the rules. What's up with McDonald's, man? It's some crazy shit, right? It's hilarious. Online dating. It's blowing my mind. He's a rebel. Well, yeah, man. I mean, I used to get upset about that until I realized the predicament that the networks are in and now, you know, now you say that stuff. I just completely agree. They're, I mean, imagine this, dude, imagine if like you had to produce content that costs every minute, something like a hundred thousand dollars a minute or 80 or maybe more than that. I don't know how much it is. But let's just say, let's even just say it's $80,000 a minute. It's more than that. It's like probably a hundred thousand dollars a minute. So like, you know that you are investing in this thing. Two hundred and sixty thousand dollars, maybe for 20 minutes of content. And to get a return on your investment, that is, you don't want Mensa to like this shit, right? You don't want this to only appeal to Mensa or fucking gourmetes or like fucking people who have. Well, they tried that for a little while. Some of these channels went really like hipster, like crazy. And nobody watched it. Nobody watched it. You're like, yeah, great, fine. But guess what? I got to fucking get my two hundred and sixty thousand dollars back. And that's not going to happen by a guy talking, making jokes about the history of the Roman Empire. Right. I completely agree. That's going to happen by people talking about putting marshmallows on the grill and online dating and people who are like kind of cartoony and zany and safe. And that's how I make my money back. If you want to fucking broadcast your crazy, insane, out there, wild, satanic, sexual worldview, fucking do it. And I guarantee a lot of those people want you to be successful. They want you to be successful because that'll change the mean. Yeah, because these poor sons of bitches day after day, they have to say no to shit. They're probably in their heart. They like, God damn it, I love that. Yeah, this is so fucking funny. But brother, I got to fucking sell. You know, man, you've changed my views. You got to. I'm dead serious. Oh, that's cool, man. Yeah, I used to. I used to rage against the machine. Yeah, I agree. Then I thought about like, oh, they're just, you know, they got a job and it's not easy. They're investors. They're one. But I just want to be on channel 400, dude. You know what I'm saying? Like that's all I've ever wanted to do. I am not looking to get on network. I'm not looking to do any of that stuff. I don't really care to go on pilots. I'm not really that guy. I just want to be on like channel like 200. You have an awesome 400. You have an awesome podcast. Oh, thank you. I mean, like that. Wait, do you see what I got planned for you next week? Oh, Jesus, man, I'm working on. I'm having a meeting today to set it up. I don't want to get embarrassed, though. It's some embarrassing. Why would I ever do that? I don't know. I am the farthest thing I know from ambush entertainment. Okay, cool. That's always been my thing. My whole thing is have you come on. They're going, this is the best time I've ever had. Well, I, I, I, dude, I was already a little embarrassed because you said that I could request a porn star. And I requested Riley Reed and a media. And ever since then, I've been like sitting in my car. Sometimes like, why did you tell him that, man? Cause like, if he does get Riley Reed to appear, you're just going to feel like a creep. I don't think you would at all. I think you'd be very excited about it and you'd be very much into your, into your, uh, you'd be giddy about it. I don't want to be giddy about a porn star. Why? Why? I mean, okay. Listen, my whole thing about porn stars is like this whole thing, this push to make the mainstream. And like, dude, I don't want to see porn stars fucking win Oscars. I don't think that's what's about that takes away from, you know, gifted award winning actresses. Now, if there's a porn star who is like Meryl Streep acting, then that's a whole different thing. But this whole thing about taking these porn stars and putting them on like these mainstream, I'm not about that. Well, putting porn stars in the naughty show was more about keeping people away than bringing people in. Oh, that's cool. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah. Cause I, you know, back when it started like three years ago, the naughty show, you know, things were a little, I know it sounds crazy, but only three years ago, things were so much different, entertaining wise. And I just got tired of doing comedy and having people mean mugging me in the crowd because I was being honest on stage. So I say, if I put these porn stars on here, someone will go there and look at that, be like, Oh, I hate that. I'm like, okay, then it's not the show for you. Brilliant. That's brilliant. They're like, when you put that, when they're like, when you burn those candles to keep mosquitoes away, yeah, they keep assholes. Yeah. That's brilliant. But then the people that come love it, you keep the conservatives away and you get open minded people in there because there's only going to be open minded freaks who come to a show that's got porn stars. And when I finally get on television and I will, it will be even bigger because then people can watch it at home and I have to come to the show and have ever been like, Oh, I'm at a show with porn stars. People are going to think I'm weird. They can watch it at home. You will get it on TV. It's common, dude. I can feel it. It's going to be big. If you know, I mean, I have people jacket from me and try to do it on TV and they did it unsuccessfully because I have a formula I did. But that's the whole thing, man. It's not, you know, people, it's an, it's a very scientific thing I'm working on. Sam, where can people find the naughty show? The naughty show. If you go to naughty show.net, you can go there. Sam Tripoli.com. The naughty show podcast finally has gotten 5,000 followers on Twitter. I'm very excited about that. And you can see me on, and you can check me out on at Sam Tripoli. And I'm also, if I could plug my date that I'm going to do coming up here, I am going to be in, I'm very excited about this. I don't know if you've worked with these ladies, static dog. Entertainment. Yeah, I have worked with them. They're awesome. I'm going to be the 22nd, which is this Saturday or Friday coming up. I'm going to be at, oh yeah, Jessica Bogart.

Duncan, I gotta say something. I love you so much, buddy. I love you too. I love you so much. I'm so happy for your success. Thank you. I couldn't be happier. You were the nicest guy to me. I remember one time we were rehearsing for this, the stupid dummies and I yelled at you one day and I still to this day feel fucking awful. You know what's so funny? I don't even remember it. I'm sure you don't. But to me, I'm like, I remember yelling and I'm like, oh, why did I ever do that? But, you know, I don't remember your style. I love performing with you. You all your jokes are so smart and they crack me up. Thanks. And I couldn't be happier for your success. The feeling is mutual, Sam. And also, I think that you have inadvertently managed to like be a big part of a sexual revolution that's happening in the world. And that is so fucking cool. I hope so. And you're very articulate about it, man. And and and there is a the effect of hanging out with you. And the reason I like hanging out with you is because you you have a cathartic effect on me that makes me like that helps eradicate weird hangups and like guilty aspects of myself. And I think you're doing that with your podcast and with your comedy, too. And I love it. That's a damn gift. Thank you for being on the show. I hope you'll come back on. I'll come on anytime, dude. Beautiful. God bless Duncan Trestle. God bless Sam Tripoli. Thanks for listening, guys. That was Sam Tripoli. Go to his website at samtripoli.com and say hello. And also, if you like this podcast, go to iTunes and give us a rating and leave a little review because it helps push us up on the charts, which is actually quite meaningless. But for some reason, I mean, obviously I like it. It's stupid, but I like it. So do that. Go to iTunes. It's easy. Just leave a little comment and interact with it. And that's how they gauge the success of a podcast, I think, because they don't, they can't really track the numbers. But don't, don't even worry. Who cares? I want to do that. Speaking of iTunes, here's a great song. It's called The Mountain Low. It's from Palace Music. This is Will, one of Will Oldham's many bands. And it's from the album Viva Last Blues. It's called The Mountain Low. Please go check it out on iTunes. Definitely listen to Will Oldham. He's one of my faves. Okay, bye. In the valley. If she lives. In the valley. Oh, if she lives. In the valley. Oh, the mighty, mighty valley. Of the sun. Yes, if she lives. There quietly and goes to bed there nightly. Tower over peaks and in the sky. Well, she comes to me. It seems every night there for me with a different face. And makes that will not quit. Yes. If I ask him and his presence will tell me what I need to know, I will sell my belongings In the mountains where she's living, just to be there when she comes every morning

It is me, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. This is a special intro because I'm actually streaming myself recording it to an audience of 38 people right now. It's pretty incredible. 38 human beings, theoretically. 38 individuals have gathered together to watch me record this intro. And it looks like we have a question coming in from one of the stream viewers. Let's hear that question now. What is the reasoning behind the stream? Well, the reasoning behind the stream, and first of all, I just wanna say thank you so much for watching me record an intro to my podcast and not just the stream watcher who asked the question, but to all of you, thank you for being here. You know, what is the reasoning behind the stream? Is a great question that it's just not that easy to answer in less than 23 to 29 hours, but I'm gonna try. I was in Acapulco. I was at a restaurant in the evening with my consultants. I have 33, I had 33 consultants. I have 32 consultants now. And I don't know what I was thinking, but I had a pretty hefty block of gold. And I threw that gold into the aquarium where there was two great white sharks and a mako shark. Now, for all the people watching on YouTube, you're not gonna get an apology from me. I know that's what people do. They stream on here and they apologize. I'm not apologizing. When I threw that gold into the aquarium, I'll tell you what I was thinking. I was thinking how beautiful it would be to see the gold glimmering beneath the great white shark's beautiful body. I was not thinking that one of my consultants would jump into a shark-filled aquarium to try to retrieve the gold. I was not thinking that when he tried to climb over into the aquarium, he would cut his hand on my steak knife and that the blood would go into the water and would work the sharks up and do a horrible frenzy and that they would rip him, limb from limb, right there in front of all of my consultants, everyone in the restaurant. And when I laughed, I was not laughing. I wasn't, if you don't understand horror, sometimes people laugh when bad things happen. And so a video emerges soon that shows me laughing when one of my consultants is eaten by two makos and a great white. Please understand that like a lot of people, what sounds like laughter is weeping. So regardless, the other 32 consultants recommended that I start live streaming my intros and that maybe I could sort of work in the truth of what happened in Acapulco before it hits the interwebs, kind of get ahead of the curve. So thank you for that question. Let's see if we have any more. Okay, it looks like we have another question from one of our streamers. As I've been recording this stream, the viewership has diminished. We're down to two people watching this and this is a question coming in from Lewis. Why can't I get a girlfriend? I used to be like you, no one to treat my good. No one to beg me to hate Lewis. I used to be like you. Lewis, it's me, the carpenter and that climbed into your ear when you were a little boy. I burrowed down past your eardrum and I've made a little nest in your brain. I just want you to know, I love the way your brain tastes. Most importantly, I love you. And I know that if you go to a grave and cry a lot and pray, a lich will rise from the money pit and you'll be able to make a girlfriend of that lich and maybe marry it one day. Thanks for the great question, Lewis. Friends, if you want to participate in random DTFH YouTube streams, you can just subscribe to my YouTube. It's Duncan Tressel on YouTube. Links will be at DuncanTressel.com and now a word from our sponsors. I want to thank East Fork for supporting this episode of the DTFH. East Fork is a pottery company located in Asheville, North Carolina and they make some of the most beautiful, magical, incredible pottery that I have ever encountered. This is J.R.R. Tolkien level mystical stuff. There's a difference. When you are drinking tea or coffee from your handmade magical mug, there's a difference in the way it tastes compared to whatever your other mug is. I'm just telling you, this is stuff that seems like it was made by fairies but it wasn't made by fairies. It was made by human beings who are getting paid a living wage by the good people who are running East Fork. I spent a long time talking to them on the phone and they are awesome. They really care about the people working at their company but most importantly, they really care about the incredible pottery that they are putting out into the world. So if you want to get someone an amazing Christmas gift, if you want to get yourself like a nice new dinner wear set, EastFork.com, that's where you got to go. It's EastFork.com, check them out. The mugs are microwave safe and if someone can break a mug, it's me. If like I have one real talent in the world, it's destroying nice things. These things have not been shipped harmed at all by my rough handling of them and they're beautiful. Even better, EastFork has raised over a million dollars for social justice oriented activist groups and nonprofits but most importantly, their pots, their mugs, their plates are badass. Again, that's EastFork.com, check them out. Get yourself some nice pottery. Thank you, EastFork. And we're back. My Texas friends, come and see me. I'm gonna be at Hyena's Comedy Club in Dallas, in Houston on the 11th and 12th of November. In the next year, lots of dates coming in. I hope you will come and see me live. You can find all the dates at dunkintrustle.com. Finally, I would love it if you would subscribe to my Patreon. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. You'll get commercial free episodes and the opportunity to hang out with a throbbing, thriving genius community. We gather twice a week for a weekly meditation and our family gathering. We are currently writing a book together and we'd love for you to join us. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. And now with us today is the wildest human I've ever had a conversation with. This is a man who is not afraid to shove his hand into boxes filled with hornets. This is a man who has been stung, bitten, stabbed and poisoned by all varieties of insect and snake life out there. But most importantly, this is somebody who's got a really great heart and is trying to save the black rhino. He's just super cool and I love his show. You can find it on YouTube. It's called Brave Wilderness. It's highly entertaining. And I just, I don't know how I got so lucky to get to have a conversation with Coyote Peterson. But he's here today. So everybody welcome to the DTFH Coyote Peterson. Not just the black rhino, but I'll call him a planet and also he's super cool and fantastic. So but the thing that I don't know is our coyote. Coyote Peterson, welcome to the DTFH. It is really, really nice to meet you. How are you today? I'm great. Thank you so much for having me on the show. I'm greatly looking forward to this conversation. Thank you. So what is going right like right now in a week in the life? Coyote Peterson, you are in between what? Like you you've just left some. I watched your most recent video. You stranded yourself in some horrific place that no one should be that somehow a dog survived there for a month. You're out there in the heat and there's urchins. And now you're in between. What what are you? What's what's going on? He what are you looking for more miserable places? Do you have someone who works with you? He's like, I found a new kind of asp that you might want to get bitten by. How does it work? Well, you know, what's funny is it just so happens that this week you're you're connecting with me two days after having put my feet into a box with 300,000 maggots. I actually filmed that in this very room two days ago. What without question, the grossest thing we have ever filmed on the world in this channel. We were like, all right, how can we make maggots entertaining? And the idea was to take a turkey and put it out in the wild and get it filled with maggots and released like just like we knew we would ruin turkeys for everybody. So we contacted a maggot farm, Duncan, which is a real thing. And we bought 300,000 maggots, had them shipped to Ohio, and then we built it gets worse. It gets grosser. My amazing graphic designer, Emily, came up with the idea of creating something called a meat sock. And we sewed together chicken skin and bacon and put it on my foot. So I had one meat sock foot and one naked foot in a box with maggots for over three hours to find out whether or not they'd eat human flesh. Wow. Wow. What? OK. So run me through a meeting. Like, how does it work? Just run me through the meeting. Who pitches the ideas? Like, who's like, listen, I've got an idea. Cody, you ever heard of a meat sock? Well, they don't exist yet, but it's a way to get maggots to chew on your feet. Look, I'm just wondering if they eat human flesh eventually. Run me through a meeting, a pitch meeting. How does it work? So we'll have these monthly brainstorming meetings myself and the entire Brave Wilderness team. So we've got 17 people full time that work here in our Columbus office to mix myself, my production team, producers, editors, graphic designers, social media team. And you know, maggots are one of those things that just makes everybody's skin crawl. And we knew that we always wanted to do a maggot episode. And we connected with the Ohio State University, and they have some studies going on there where maggots are used for many medicinal purposes, specifically in the removal of scar tissue or necrotic tissue. And so we know that they will eat dying human flesh, but we're like, will they eat living human flesh? They can. They tell the difference between the two. And while we were pretty certain that I wasn't going to be eaten alive by maggots, we knew that we could make maggots entertaining in that sense. Now, what we did not predict was the smell that was going to come with the maggot. So they were raised on rotting salmon carcasses. And when we got them here to the office, they showed up in a Styrofoam box that was cooled and vacuum sealed. It smelled so bad. Our entire office reeked for an entire day as we then unpackaged these maggots, put them into the container, and then I had to keep my feet in there for three hours. But it was a total of a seven hour period that I was in this small room with these 300,000 maggots. It was awful, but hopefully it's going to be wildly entertaining. What's going through your head? What's going through your head an hour and a half in? What kind of things do you think it about to stay calm during that experience? Well, I guess the thing that I was most concerned about was my foot being encapsulated in a sock made from chicken skin and raw bacon. Yes. And whether or not I might actually absorb some sort of grossness from that. And then once the maggots started getting in between the sock and my foot, and I could just feel them all moving around, and we knew they were eating. We caught really cool behavior of them eating through what we called the bacon brim, because the brim of the sock was made of bacon. We could see them burrowing through that. And I did take a couple of little nibbles, but I think once they figured out that I was alive, they were not interested in eating me. And what was going through my mind is just please endure through this smell without vomiting into the container of 300,000 maggots, because it was bad. I mean, really bad. One of the worst things I've smelled in quite some time. You are famous for putting yourself in not just for this. You're famous because you have this incredible personality. You're inspiring. You make us all want to go outside of our boundaries, outside of the confines of what we're afraid of. You're doing that for us. It's like, and you're, I'm sorry, but you've figured it out. For some reason, human beings like to watch other human beings suffer. It's strange that way, but we do. And especially when we know you're probably going to be OK. But I'm curious about any techniques you have for calming yourself down when you find yourself in these dangerous situations that you keep putting yourself. And I'm fascinated by what you're talking about, because it seems like you really don't know what's going to happen. Like you kind of, you can bet that you're not going to be the first human that maggots figure out they can eat. You're not going to do that. If you did, you would usher in a kind of an apocalypse, wouldn't you? Like it would spread through the maggot kingdom. Maggots would be these new piranha. You would cause the end of the world to be like, that motherfucker, what? The maggots are eating my dog. So yeah, tell me what tricks do you have for finding calm within the storm? It's funny because they are always seemingly good ideas on paper, but they always don't work out the best. And a recent example in an episode that's coming up in November, if it could possibly get worse than the maggots, was the angry yellow jacket box, which is an episode that just finished going through post-production. And if your imagination runs wild, you can already probably begin to figure out what that is. But we found a massive yellow jacket nest. I put on a B-suit, first of all, to figure out whether or not yellow jackets can sink through a B-suit. Yes, they can. It took like 20 stings, just catching them. And we caught over 100 of them inside of this contraption we built that we called the angry yellow jacket box. And then my naked hand went into the box with the yellow jackets. Now, we were doing this as an experiment to find out if 15 minutes after being abducted from their nest, were they still angry at me? And within one second, we found out that, yes, they were. Within three seconds, I was tapping out to say I've taken too many stings. This is insane. Well, my hand got stuck in the box. It was in there for 10 seconds. And I took over 100 stings in 10 seconds. And it is the worst pain I have ever been through. So it has eclipsed as a whole the most pain I've been through from any one of my singular insect stings or creature bites. So over 100 yellow jacket stings in 10 seconds, and uncontrollable pain that lasted for over 24 hours. Bad idea. That one was a really, really bad idea. Episode comes out in November, and I promise it's also super entertaining. Wow. So obviously, you've got doctors on hand. You've got all kinds. Because you can die. And this is no joke. Like, people die from bee stings all the time. So yellow jackets specifically are known for sending people into anaphylactic shock. There is a component to their venom specifically that causes you to swell. And the pictures and the footage of my hand, just 15 minutes after the fact, it looks like two different humans because of the swollenness. Now, fortunately, I just had a normal, what we call a normal allergic reaction, I guess, to that many stings, where I didn't need to go to a doctor. But we do have an epinephrine pen on set for every one of these extreme stunts, just in case. So if I ever went into anaphylactic shock, boom, hit me with that EpiPen. It's going to drag me out to the point where I'll be able to seek medical attention. At least that's what we hope, or that's what we've been told by our doctors. But no, there's never any medical professionals behind the scenes. We have medical professionals that we contact in advance. My team is trained in basic survival for a stage. So we know that I'm going to probably be OK. So far, it's worked out OK. This is what I'm trying to get at, though. So in the midst of that, how are you calming yourself down? Or maybe you're not. Maybe you're just, I don't know. You're just get through it. You're white-knuckle it or whatever. But do you have any, like, anything you refer to, anything that pops into your mind, any breathing techniques? What is your trick for staying calm in these situations? The lead up to it really is not that difficult now that I've done so many of these things. Like, at first, your adrenaline is going to get rushing regardless. Any time that you, as a human, are like, oh, I am about to feel pain. And I know it's probably going to be pretty intense. The big thing you don't know is how long it's going to last. So the pain that came with this yellow jacket box specifically was on that level where, like, you can see in the video and the footage, like, man, like, he's messed up. Like, you can see it in my face. You can see in my eyes. I'm just trying to breathe. I'm trying to calm my heart rate. Like, the adrenaline was flowing so fast, I got an instantaneous, like, splitting headache. So we're like, you're dizzy. You're kind of, like, whiting out. And you're seeing, like, those white stars, like, if you've ever gotten hit in the head before. So all of that, it's just your body's reaction to the venom that is invading your system and the intense pain that your body's in, like, overdrive. And it's like, what have you done to me? And you do kind of have to put yourself in a meditative state. As you begin to realize this pain is not just, like, you know, bumping your toe on the corner of a table, you're going to have to endure here. And by the time I got nine hours into this, man, it was the worst 24 hours I've ever been through. Wow. Wow. Now, this, what you're doing is so curious to me. Because how frustrating for an animal, it has developed this incredible defense mechanism. And suddenly, you show up. And, you know what I mean? Like, how many millions of years of evolution to concoct the perfect poison to keep the apex predator away. And you're like, oh, no, no, no, no. I'm going to stick my hand right in a swarm of lots of you. Do you ever just marvel at how miraculous it is that creatures have figured out how to secrete their own poison? It's phenomenal. I mean, especially insects. What an interesting alien world that they have. Because with insects, so it's the female insect that has what's the stingers is scientifically really known as an oviposter, right? So it's used for laying eggs. Yet it also is connected to this venom sac that they use as a defense to ward off any attacker or invader of their nest that ultimately is going after their young, their larvae, or in the case of bees, it could be larvae and honey. And it's amazing how they've evolved to create these defense mechanisms that would drive any human running away screaming, usually in any instance, skunks, badgers, foxes, raccoons. I mean, you name it. Anything that takes a sting from a yellow jacket is like, whoa, I am out of here. I mean, you just match the soft, squishy nose of a raccoon rooting around in a yellow jacket nest. I mean, a couple of stings to the face, and that creature is in some serious trouble. So it's pretty amazing that the evolution that exists in our insects and arachnids on this planet. I want to thank Lumi Labs for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Say goodbye to those days of ODing on edibles and having that thing happen where you start wondering if you have a tapeworm inside of you from the catfish that you didn't cook enough. When you were at summer camp, no. Lumi Labs, they figured it out. I don't know how they figured it out, and I don't care because I like results. I like the security of knowing that if I eat one of their delicious microdust gummies, I'm not going to experience the dark wolf in my heart pissing all over my brain with a golden shower of paranoia. No, no, no, I'm gonna get a nice, happy, relaxing, in-the-moment buzz. That's what I like. Even better, you can travel with these gummies. They're available nationwide. I fly with them. It's the best. You can learn more about microdosing THC by going to microdose.com, use code DUNCAN to get free shipping and 30% off your first order.

I don't mean literal poisons, but what are your defense mechanisms? If they're, imagine this, there's an interdimensional version of you and an interdimensional YouTube channel that likes to trigger the defense mechanisms of Apex predators in a technological society. So what would your defense mechanism be if you found yourself kidnapped by some super advanced alien put in a box and then it shoves its hand in to see what you do to get revenge? Wow, that's a great question. Well, I think one of my defense mechanisms is more akin to like Wolverine from X-Men. I strangely heal very fast and I'm very resilient to a lot of things. One thing that a lot of people probably don't know is that I have strangely never had stitches and I've never had a broken bone despite all knock on wood. Despite all the crazy things that I've gone through, I don't get sick very often. My mom thinks that science should study my blood considering the number of venoms that I've taken over the years to be like, is there something special about your blood that just allows you to style these things off? But probably the thing that would defend me against any alien species would be my chattiness. I talk so much, they'd be like, well, we can't get this guy to shut up. So we're gonna go ahead and just let him go now because he's asking us too many questions. He's way too curious and everything we're poking him with, he's got way too high of a pain tolerance. This is not a good one to stun. This creature delivers ear beatings unlike anything I've ever experienced. They could be open and looking at stuff and I'd be watching and be like, hey, do you guys know this and this and this and this? And they'd be like, this is not how this was supposed to work out. I put 200 coyote beaters in my ears for 30 minutes and never experienced anything like a swarm of beaters. And this is, you know what? That's, I think your mom is onto something. I mean, isn't this, this is some sort of mythical idea, right? Like, oh God, what is it? The princess bride, right? He'd like been taking poison to train himself to be immune to poison. But this is like, this might not just be fiction. It might be that over time by exposing yourself to poisons, you gain some special power. Yeah, you know, there's a lot of people that ask that question and look in all seriousness, I do not believe there's anything special about my blood or my immunity. I think I'm just, I don't know, was born to live this role essentially and that's why I've been able to stive off any sort of infections. I guess infections are another interesting thing to note. Like, times I've been bitten or scratched by things and it just kind of gone about my day, continued to muck around in a swamp. I mean, there have been times where snapping turtles have locked off a piece of my finger. We've literally wrapped it up and I've gone right back to doing what I'm doing in the mud and the gun. A time specifically that comes to mind is we were filming an episode on Cayman in Brazil, in the Pantanal area. And like at Ding Dong, we caught a piranha on a fishing line and I was showing the piranha and with my thumb, I was, I'm sorry, my finger, I was opening up its lip like this to show its teeth and my finger slipped and went right into its mouth and it just went, oh, like that and just bit the tip of my finger off. And there was just, it was a bloodbath everywhere. I mean, we're in the middle of shooting this episode for Animal Planet. I mean, there was so much blood. It was amazing how much blood came out of my finger. And the medic that was on set, he was like freaking out because of the amount of blood and we're like, well, he's gotta get back in the water to swim with these crocodilians. Like we're not going all the way back to, you know, where our lodge was at. Like we just need to keep going. So they literally just wrapped my finger up, put it in a rubber glove and then I got back into the water. I mean, just ooze filled, disgusting, bacteria-ridden water in the Brazilian Pantanal with my open finger, I guess. And then we cleaned it out later, no infection. You know, I don't know. Maybe there is something there, but- There's something there. There's something there. There's gotta be. Maybe the aliens need to come and pull some of my bodily fluids and blood out and test that and use some value. I have an idea for how we can achieve that. I imagine you already have, by the way, but I was just, I was thinking to myself, wow, okay. So he's put himself through more difficult situations than most anyone like has ever experienced. I mean, I've been stung by a bee, a stingray got me on the foot when I was a kid. I'm just, I still remember it. That sucked. But have you ever considered like maybe branching off with another show where you take really like bad acid? It's an adult version of Brave Holders. We call that dark wilderness in the Wilderness Productions office. If it's just like, all right, let's experiment with Coyote Peterson and every drug that you could possibly feed into a human body and study the effects. It is a joke that's come up before to be like, man, how funny would it be if we just put you on a bunch of trippy things and just let you go to town with your chatty kathiness and see where that leads? I have a good argument for it. I mean, because these, think of it, like all these hippies, they're out there like, they're blasting MEO, DMT, bufatin, you know, this is a venom. And I think you could argue that the psilocybin is potentially a defense mechanism. These mushrooms are manifesting in the hopes to like keep things from eating them. Though I think people would argue with that. An exo pheromone, they're trying to teach us. I don't know. I find a guess. It's like, they're just trying to survive. But yeah, have you ever really seriously considered exposing yourself to psychoactive toxins so that it's not just the pain of the thing. It's that suddenly you're merging with the universe while being poisoned. So what's crazy is, okay, so to answer that question directly, if ever the Brave Wilderness brand goes away from a direction that's family and brand friendly, I will definitely bring this show concept to you and we will go, well, then I gospel with it all. I can be your guinea pig. A lot of the things that I've been stung by do actually have these secondary effects that, for example, after we did the Yellowjacket box, if that wasn't enough for this year, we were in Arizona and I did another episode on harvester ants. Now, harvester ants are a very famous ant species because they are one of the most venomous insects in the world, but they're yield of venom. So the amount of venom that they inject with the sting is not nearly as large as some of the things like a wasp or a hornet. But when I was there, so the whole insect sting pain index world comes from an entomologist by the name of Justin Schmidt. This guy is an absolute genius. I don't know if you've heard of him before, but he was the first guy to sort of get stung by all of these things. And we sort of Steven Spielberg, his book, Sting of the Wild, into everything we did in video form on the YouTube channel. But when I was in Arizona and did this harvester ant episode after filming the actual sting portion where I put my feet in the ant mound for seven straight minutes. I just stood there and took seven minutes worth of stings. And that was to get all the shots, the thumbnail for the YouTube video. I mean, it was absolutely agony. Like my feet were beyond on fire. But about 20 minutes after doing this, I started feeling really trippy. Like I was super out of it, almost not to love war. I was hallucinating by any means, but I felt almost out of body in a certain sense. Later that afternoon, when we went to Justin's house to do an interview with him, he told me specifically that indigenous people in the South, Western United States would take mounds, or they would dip things into harvester ant mounds and put them into their mouths and get the inside of their mouth stung and they would go on a trip, essentially. So there is a sort of a toxin in the ant venom that does give you some sort of a high. And I definitely experienced it. And so did my director of photography Trent because he was stung multiple times during the filming of that episode. And he's like, man, I'm feeling like super out of it right now. Like we both felt buzzed in a sense. Well, like how can you describe that high? What's it like? If you were to hyperventilate, so hyper with a non-substance induced sort of thing, if you were to hyperventilate, or if you've been hanging upside down too long and you stand up really fast and you kind of have that rush of blood to the head, it's like that where you almost feel like this pulled out nature of your ability to see, hear, and comprehend basic human functionality. Like my wildlife biologist, Mario, was talking to me and we were driving in the van on our way to Justin. So I'm like, dude, I think we've got to stop at a gas station. I need to get some Gatorade or some food or something. It's I am super out of it. I hear you talking to me, but I'm not putting together the words with the meaning of the sentence. You're really kind of out of it. And again, keep in mind that I took well over 100 stings. I mean, it's impossible even comprehend how many stings in that amount of time because they don't just sting once. They lock on with their mandibles, so they bite and then they sting repetitively until essentially they run out of venom. Now they don't lose their stingers, but eventually their venom sac does deplete and then it will fill back up after they continue to eat. Cause all of the toxicity from the venom comes from the microbial little world that they consume essentially. Wow. So do you try to not kill these creatures that are stinging you? Do you try to like? Oh yeah. That's incredible. We're super careful. When we even show with this harvestry ant video specifically, there were piles of ants under the curve of my feet. So when I went and stood on the nest initially, no ants were there. And then you breathe down at the nest or if you just kind of knock on it, once the first one comes up and it's like, oh, hold on, we've got an invader here. A single sting will release a pheromone that essentially tells the other guard ants, hey guys, we're going to the front line here. Something's not supposed to be here. It might try to get into the nest. They sting and sting and sting and sting it. And strangely enough, after a while, they were kind of like, this guy's not going anywhere, so we don't know if there's much of a point in stinging him anymore. And then they just kind of won it all over me. But yeah, it took a lot of stings. It was in between my toes that hurt the worst. If you've ever thought about getting stung in between your toes repetitively. No. Yeah, I've done this now. So this is curious to me. The idea that things in nature can sense aggression or can like get a vibe that, you know what? I don't think this thing's trying to hurt us. We've been stinging it over and over. Let's just relax. We'll work around this swollen foot filled with our venom. Have you noticed that in other species that just the very fact that you're intentionally inviting a sting might be changing their behavior somehow? So with the Harvester ants, I think it was a little more unique. For example, when we were talking about the yellow jackets, the yellow jackets would have just been stinging until I was dead. Like they were just angry. They're not angry because they don't like humans. They're angry if you've disturbed their nest. And when they're at the end of their life cycle, they've got nothing to lose. I mean, I imagine for a hornet, if you've gone your entire life cycle, because they die every year, if you've gone your whole life cycle and you've got the opportunity to go out on the front lines defending the nest, kind of pretty awesome way to go. Yeah, let's go to Valhalla, Valhalla of Ornans. Yeah, and yellow jackets don't die after they sting. So the only thing that necessarily loses its sting right after a sting is a honeybee or different bee species. So yellow jackets, like the Harvester ants, can sting again and again and again. And while I noticed more of a peaceful calm with the Harvester ants, if you're talking about fire ants, which are a much smaller species, they are more aggressive, and they will not stop stinging. They just go and go and go. But you're talking hundreds of Harvester ants to hundreds of thousands of fire ants in variants within a nest. So it's a different sort of onslaught. But most of the stings that I've taken have been individual stings, versus there being an entire swarm of something taking me over.

When you find shows that your kids can watch, it's the best. You know something that isn't like some of the stuff out there disguises itself as something your kids could watch, but it's like trying to sell a bunch of bullshit. Or it's, who knows? It just seemingly, I don't know. There's some weirdness in it. So tell me about how you figured out a way to create a family-friendly show that is also dangerous, that's also putting out there that could potentially make kids think that they could do something that's dangerous. Because when I watch your show, it's like, this is perfect for kids. Your energy is perfect for kids. It's awesome. So tell me about that. What are you summoning up there? What is that energy? What is the motivation behind that? Yeah, I love that question. Great question. I love getting to delve into that world. So I grew up in the golden era of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. I mean, I am a living product of those two men's and their team's brilliance. So Steven Spielberg was influencing me since before I even knew who Steven Spielberg was. I used to rent the Jaws VHS tape from the video store. My mom would pause the VHS recorder for me so I could trace the few images of Bruce the shark that actually popped up in the film because I loved sharks so much. The reason I mentioned that is I was absorbing Steven Spielberg culture because I like sharks. And then eventually became Jurassic Park, E.T., Indiana Jones, and Onward and Upward. But what I recognize George and Steven did with Jurassic and Star Wars, let's just use those two as an example, they found a way to make entertainment that was perfectly palatable for adults but managed to create that lunchbox vibe that was selling not necessarily merchandise but entertainment to a younger generation and you wanted to be a part of that culture. So for me, Jurassic Park was the biggest thing that could have ever happened in my childhood. I had all the toys. I mean, I thought I was in Jurassic Park. Hell, I practically think I still am at this point. So it was that influence that sort of helped myself and my entire team and my business partner, Mark, and I to say, OK, well, you're not going to recreate Jurassic Park. You're not going to recreate Star Wars. These are empires that have already been built. What can we do based on our interests and based on that influence? And we looked at the world of animals and recognized the fact that there were a couple of things that lined up strangely and sadly. Steve Irwin passed away in 2006 and he was a huge inspiration of mine. And we saw this huge gap in the marketplace for somebody really being that passionate about animals. Bear Grylls, who is also a massive influence on me, he was just starting to hit his stride with man versus wild. It was fast-paced editing, cool music, jumping out of helicopters and airplanes. But where he was catching animals, instead of educating people and celebrating them, he's eating them for survival purposes, which worked for that show. So we said, all right, how do we take the brand building of Spielberg and Lucas, the excitement and passion of education and conservation of Steve Irwin and mix it into that Bear Grylls fast-paced platform? And that is what we did. And that's how Brave Wilderness was born with those influences. And then we just went and did it. Because every television network out there told us it wouldn't work. And we landed on YouTube at a time when digital distribution was just beginning to hit its zenith. And between 2016 and 2019, those were the biggest heydays for us in the YouTube space. And we're a little over 20 million subscribers now. And we distribute through all sorts of different realms. But we launched in 2014. And once the Sting Index stuff started in 2016, people really started taking notice. And we used those extreme episodes. They do have that super adult draw-in vibe to them. Still friendly enough for kids, because I'm not swearing and I'm not smashing an animal because it stung me. And then we used those to draw people into our bigger conservation initiative episodes. And the big backbone to all of this was there has to be an education. The entertainment is always here, but you've got to have the education too. So even if you're just showing up to see me get stung and roll around on the ground in pain, at least you're going to walk away with knowing a couple things about this animal that you probably never even heard of. See, that is what I like about it, is because you draw people in with this cool, gory, juicy thing. But then within it, you're really articulating. You're teaching stuff, even in this conversation, you're teaching me things that I've never heard of before. And I think that must be the wind in your sails there. Because if you were just trying to do some kind of gory, edge-lordy thing, I don't think it would be anywhere as addictive as your show currently is. It's something about you that's lighting up everything behind it. And that's what I'm curious about. What is that? What's your deal, man? Coyote, what are you? Are you some kind of Buddhist? Are you a meditator? Are you a religious person? What's going on with you? No, I'd say I'm a perpetual child. I mean, I'm 41 years old, but I'm permanently stuck in that 13-year-old mindset that I'm interested in. It's so funny. People are like, oh, man, cool. So what are you and your friends into? I'm like, vintage sports cards, collecting dinosaur figurines, nose-leg teeth, legs, legos, and action figures. You should see our Brave Holders office is literally just filled with the different toys that we loved as children. Only now we're a bit older, and we have real jobs, and we can afford to buy these things we wanted as kids. So I think that's part of the magic, is I relate to a younger generation. And I hope that I always will because of my childlike curiosity and wonder for our planet. I have a huge appreciation for everything that is the world that we live in. And every time I get to spend time with an animal, whether it's admiring it from a distance or getting the chance to be gently hands-on with it, I look at that animal as a superstar. My responsibility is to try to make this animal, even though it may be scary or uncomfortable for it in the sense that, oh my gosh, I've been abducted by a human. The second that this animal realizes it's not being bitten, scratched, or essentially eaten, they calm down. And they're just kind of like, what's up, dude? What are we doing here? What are these weird devices? And why are you talking about me like this? And why are you so excited to hang out? Like that animal is going to hopefully be a star that's going to get millions of views. And in the grand encyclopedic nature of human existence, as long as Brave Holders can keep bringing people that quick form of entertainment and education about an animal, we feel like we're doing the right thing. So I think all collected together, it's the curiosity, the wonder, the appreciation, and this continued drive to want to make a successful brand inspired by the people that did it before me that keeps this train running. You are always out in the wilderness. You're out there in not just real wilderness. Not like the wilderness. Like I might go on a hike out here in Austin or something. I mean, you're out out there where you're seeing the world as people saw before. Electricity, I mean, maybe not everywhere, but a lot of places you've been. So forgive me for asking this. You see a lot of weird stuff out there. You see any UFOs? You see any weird stuff out there? I have had only a couple of experiences UFO oriented where I was like, I don't know what that was. And I'm like, I want to believe that it. I guess anything that is an unidentified flying object to the interpreter is a UFO. I've never seen anything where I was like, yep, that was definitely an alien ship. But I've seen some strange stuff definitely out west in the desert. And my mom lives out in the middle of nowhere outside, like 45 miles outside of Tucson, right close to the border of Mexico. And she has seen some weird stuff out there at night in the desert in the sky that she's not a skeptic by any means, but she's a lot based in science and reality. And she's like, I can't explain what I saw with certain lights or what certain lights did in the sky or were in one spot. And then boom, boom, boom, boom, they shot off in different directions. And she was just like, well, if they're coming for me, they're coming for me. I guess that's it. But nothing she said that was ever scary, just stuff that she's seen. And I've never seen anything to that extent, but I'm always looking and I'm always curious about it. Do you get into the cryptid stuff? Do you spend any time ruminating over that when you're out in the wilderness and you hear something in the woods that you haven't heard before? Does it ever cross your mind? Shit, that could be a Chupacabra, a Sasquatcher. I don't know, you know, any number of things. Well, what's funny is, so I love Bigfoot and Sasquatch. And I have since I was a super young kid, because when my friends and I were younger, we thought we saw a Bigfoot. I mean, I was like eight, nine, 10 years old. What it turned out we saw was a black bear. We lived in a small town called Newberry, Ohio in Jogger County where there are not black bears. So this was a black bear that was migrating through. But we came across it in the woods, and we know this for a fact because it ended up on the news that night, it was spotted in another area. We're like, holy cow, that has to be what we saw. Right. Well, after that, though, I got super into Bigfoot. And, you know, I don't know how long of a story we want to make this, but we tried to do a Bigfoot episode earlier this year that turned into a huge marketing debacle that was just the biggest blow up thus far in Brave Wilderness's existence. We did a Skull episode. I don't know if you caught wind of that or saw that anywhere. I did hear about that. OK. Yes. So here's the truth behind the Bigfoot Skull. While the entire time, this was always created as a what if scenario. The Blair Witch Project, which I thought was brilliant marketing back in the Blair Witch, we had this idea to be like, oh, to get ready for advertising the Bigfoot Skull what if episode, I dropped an Instagram post that also fed to Facebook and it was super cryptic, but was like Skull found, could be Bigfoot, smung the lit through TSA. And it just got way out of control. I bought it. All these organizations picked it up and it was just like, oh, no, what did we do? I bought it. You bought it. I was like, OK, it makes sense. He's out there all the time. I get it. He probably found a Bigfoot Skull. Finally, we know there's, oh, shit, you boy. You you Blair Witch does. I did. But here's what we did not anticipate, which was a huge learning curve for us. I mean, and as a brand, you always got to take your your foibles as a lesson into what are you not going to do next. Right. I think the big thing is we had huge internal conversations about this after the fact to say, OK, where did we go wrong there? And what we ultimately landed on is that because Brave Wilderness is so factual, so true to what we say we're going to do, like we're famous for being the channel that doesn't click bait. Right. If I tell you I'm going to put my arm in the mouth of an alligator, my arms going in the mouth of an alligator. So when people thought that Coyote Peterson and his team maybe found the skull of a primate in the Pacific Northwest, it was just like game over. This has to be real. We didn't have the foresight to be like, oh, marketing it like Blair Witch would blow it so out of proportion before the episode came out where it was clearly defined as a what if scenario that it was it was too late at that point. And unfortunately, it angered a lot of people. And we do we do feel feel bad about that. I mean, I love Bigfoot, but I can tell you now the Bigfoot community probably wants to burn me at the stake. So they're like, we'll be able to rectify all that with the right Bigfoot content. Look, you're forgiven. I get it, man. If I if I if I was at the helm of the type of ship that you have crafted, you want to do experiments. You want to do you want to see what what happens if we try this or that. And with that one, I get exactly why you did it. And I think anyone who loves the show has forgiven you already. We get it. It's like you were just trying something out. We just the thing is like we had so much fun making that episode. I watch all of the like my cadence of show watching is the Ghost Hunter shows, the Treasure Hunter shows, the solve mysteries, the unexplained like the ancient aliens. Like I love these shows. I love watching them myself. So we went after the let's make almost sort of like a mockumentary Bigfoot thing. We're going to go out there and look. This is what it could be. And then we definitively put a break in the episode where we're like everything moving forward is a what if scenario. But again, that got so overshadowed by the overly hilarious project posts that I made. That is what really gave us the context of how vast and how quickly social media can just roll a snowball off the hill that turns into an avalanche. Because we just didn't see it coming. I mean, we would have never marketed the episode like that if we thought it was going to do what it did. Look, I think anyone in their right mind is fine with what you did. Now is the time though. Again, here's the other spin off. It's like, look, OK, we're going to get through this family friendly thing. Once my kids are in high school, then we start our show. It's not just Psychedelics. We are going to take you and we are going to like send you to like Antarctica. We are going to get you up in one of those space planes so that you can tell us, is there a hole in the middle of Antarctica? How come people can't go there? Of all the people, I would like to enjoy watching traversing Antarctica to try to find out, is the Earth hollow? It would be you. It would be you. So cool. It's on the Earth? Do you get into that much, the Hollow Earth stuff, the idea that there's like some massive, weird hole in Antarctica that leads to some kind of other realm in the Earth? It's one of my favorite theories. I don't believe it, but I love it. I don't know. I don't know a whole lot about that theory. If someone were to say, look, we're going to give you a budget to go out and explore what that is, I would jump at it in a second. I'm all about learning or going places that are the unexplored, the unknown. And I think that's, for myself, it's like a hardcore adventure. My thing is always, what is the next thing that I can do, the next experience I can have, or the opportunity to see something that maybe somebody else hasn't seen. And there's not a whole lot of that left. So I try to really absorb and appreciate the things that I'm getting to see in my own lifetime that I think we are all beginning to recognize could be disappearing or quite arguably are disappearing off the face. I have yet to see a polar bear truly in the wild. And I mean, that's on my bucket list. And while I could do that in a number of places, I really want to go to a place called Ringle Island. I don't know if you've ever heard of that before. I have not. What's believed to be the last place where mammoth were walking the planet. And there are scientists that are still finding mammoth bones and tusks out in the riverbeds, not buried. Just they're out there. It is literally a lost world up near Russia. It's like the northern part of Russia. Whoa. Yes. Go. You got to go. That would be so cool. It's hard to get to. And unfortunately, it's controlled by Russia right now. So I think that's going to make it even more difficult to get to. But not a good time. Maybe not the best time to try to get a visa to go look at mammoth bones. You might have to wait a little bit longer. Yeah, well, I mean, that's what I love about. You know, I think we have a shared interest there. And I think maybe we both have a kind of shared healthy skepticism too, like we're able to kind of ponder these things, but not get swept up in them or get lost in them. But yeah, I'm always fascinated by the phenomena where out of the blue, a creature that they were sure had gone extinct just shows up, like a parrot they thought had been wiped out or some insect or whatever. And I always wonder, where did it come from? Like, how did it just suddenly appear on the landscape like that? And my stoner conclusion is clearly it wobbled up from the hollow earth. Like, there must be some some other like biome underneath us that these things kind of come out of every once in a while. But yeah, and you never know. You know, I think the ocean is another one of those places filled with so much mystery and things that are down there that maybe we have never seen every once in a while. These crazy or fish get like washed ashore and people are like, oh, my God, it's a sea dragon. You know, there's there's so many weird things out there that we as humans are so busy being wrapped up in our day to day lives and social media and the 24 hour cycle of work, sleep, eat, work out, do whatever that sometimes we forget to look around at the things that are here on our planet. And that's one of the reasons I love getting to explore different environments, especially on other continents, because you can see an assimilation between different species in different regions. But also just placing yourself out there in the middle of the wild to see these animals in their natural environment acting and interacting with each other in the way that the universe meant them to be. And that's something that I always try to absorb and remember, regardless of getting it on camera, I try to keep it in my mental hard drive up there to be like, cool, I got to experience that in my lifetime. Isn't it kind of sad? You know, like the the I don't know. I know you remember this. I mean, at least if I had to roll the dice, remember when. It crossed your mind when you're a kid. The first time that you would never see a dinosaur that you would never see. Do you remember that pain, that heartbreak when it like dawned on you? I will never get to see a Tyrannosaurus Rex, except in these weird paintings. I'll never witness one. I it still bothers me. Why am I acting like it still bugs me? You know, anytime you hear about, oh, they're going to bring a mammoth back to life or anything, I get excited. I was showing my kid an ostrich and like I was about to get into. And this is was a dinosaur at one point. But I didn't know how to articulate it in a way. But isn't it kind of sad when you're out there and you're seeing these creatures? Some part of you is realizing like I might be one of the last people to see these things out here in the wild like this. It's kind of heartbreaking, isn't it? Yeah, you know, I think the thing that's heartbreaking is how do we get people to really want to make a difference for these things? We did a big project or so in the midst of it this year. We launched a fundraising campaign called Save the Horns, that is with a couple of different partnerships surrounding a wildlife reserve in South Africa. And we filmed a really cool rhino episode there earlier this year that featured white rhinos and black rhinos. And for context, black rhinos are the most endangered rhino species left on our planet. So there is barely five thousand of them left in the wild. And the reason they're disappearing is because of the poaching of horns. It's taken for false medicinal purposes. So there's absolutely no value to taking a rhino home. But these animals are being poached and we're working on a project now that is creating a expanding a reserve on rewilded habitat that will create a stronghold population of these animals for generations to come. Because we don't effectively eliminate poaching in the next decade, which we're not going to do. Don't let anybody fool you like we're not going to stop that. Like eventually black rhinos in their natural range now are going to be wiped out. So we're working on that reserve population that is far away from where the majority of poaching is happening to make sure that there is a future for this species. And until you get out there and you're working with these animals, I mean, I was hands on with a black rhino. And these things are these things are like dinosaurs. You feel like working with a triceratops when you're next to one. And until people really have that experience and can see it, it's understandable why people may not take much time to think about a rhino. It's like, oh, cool. I've seen one in a zoo. I've seen one on TV. I've seen them in cartoons. But until you recognize what an important part of an environment they are and how few of them there really are left based on something as ridiculous as horn poaching, it does kind of hurt your heart a bit. Yeah. It I mean, don't this is probably the most naive question ever. But don't the poachers like don't they realize what they're doing? Like, doesn't it cross their minds that they are participating in the elimination of a creature from the planet they're on? Or are they? Oh, they know. But it's a very complicated structure, the whole hierarchy of these essentially kingpins that are running this industry that are selling these horns on the black market to southeastern Asian countries. You've got really, really low income poverty stricken areas. And if some of these poachers are actually put into a position where they've got sort of the gangsters, if you will, of these horn circuits will come in and say to somebody, you're going to either go get us these rhino horns or we're just going to go ahead and kill your family. I mean, to these people, it's like, well, I guess I'm better. Go kill those rhinos and get those horns. And that's not it in every instance. But the value of a rhino horn is worth more than gold, oil or diamonds on the black market at this point. Is that not crazy? Rhino horn is the most valuable, like natural material on our planet per. I believe it's per ounce of ground up rhino horn. It's insane. You know what rhino horns made out of? Keratin, our dead, our dead hair cells, essentially. If the rhino horn is just compacted hair, what does it do? What do they think it does? What do they what does it do? What do they think it does? Nothing. They the false medicinal purposes. Rhino horn will be ground down and cut together with other things. It could be anything from like sexual stimulation through the curing of cancer. It doesn't matter what they market it as rhino horn will cure this. Rhino horn will cure that zero medical proof that rhino horn does anything. And honestly, the biggest problem is that you're never getting pure rhino horn. Anyways, whoever is making pills with rhino horn, yeah, they're putting a small percentage of rhino horn mixed in with a concoction of other things. And then it gives somebody like, oh, maybe I'm getting better or more. Yeah, the rhino horn I've been the rhino horn. I've been getting lately is really not great. No, it's not like you used to be the old days. Remember that it's not like my mama's rhino horn. So because it's being cut with gummy bears. Yeah, that's what it is. Yeah, it's kind of sweet. But they left them in the back of the cars. They're melted a little bit. My least favorite kind. So wait, let me get this straight. We've got a few more minutes. You're you're going to take rhinos. Where are you? Wait, where are you taking them again? You're taking rhinos to a protected reserve. Where is this? So myself and Global Conservation Force, which is a group based out of California, Bear Grylls, who's a partner of mine in this project. I'm not sure you're familiar. Yes, we are working to establish this reserve population at a place called the Carricka Game Reserve in the eastern Cape of South Africa. And we have this big vision. It's a five phase plan. We're now moving from phase two to phase three. Wow. We went into 2023, where we will be moving a new coalition of Cheetahs and new pride of lions and expanding territory for elephants. But the most important thing about this whole campaign is that we recently dropped several fence lines and opened up several others that take this rewilded habitat, important point being rewilded. So it used to be farmland and that's been re-designated over the past 30 years into pristine habitat specifically for black rhinos. And the size of this property will allow for us to bring in a population of breeding black rhinos. So you need between eight and 12 black rhinos for the population to be diverse enough to breed. And we have hit all those marks. We've gotten the permits at Carricka Game Reserve. So it's all happening. It's really exciting. And it's a campaign that it's called Save the Horns. It's still going now. We launched it about six months ago. We've raised quite a bit in just the past six months. And we're going to keep going until we get through phase five, which we essentially connect these two big reserves together. And it would be the largest wildlife corridor in the eastern Cape once these two reserves are connected together. Wow. How are you going to keep the poachers out, though? How are you going to keep the poachers out? That comes with Global Conservation Force and having the right anti-poaching unit ranger teams in place and also technology. So there's a lot of technology being implemented into this specifically with how we're tracking the presence or the awareness and the wherewithal of every single animal that goes onto this reserve. So for example, let's say, just think of it as like a tracking beacon for a very simple explanation sake on one black rhino. Let's say that that beacon has not moved in multiple days. It's kind of like, okay, so many might have gone on and poached that rhino. But here's the ticker is that based on where that tracker might be, that tracker may have gotten taken with the poachers and could ultimately help take down poaching circuits based on the fact that these poachers have no idea that horn very well may have a tracking transmitter in it, which can then lead anti-poaching unit rangers to take down a bigger syndicate. So there's a lot of technology, a lot of science and a lot of like stuff linked into it that I don't want to reveal too much, but it's very well thought out for sure. We got to figure out a way to make these rhino horns venomous. You see, that's the move. That's the move to bio engineer these creatures to the horns explode. The horns are filled with snakes, something that I'd like where you're going with this, if we could just get snake eggs inside of the horn. So if the horn is removed, it explodes and everybody gets covered in snakes. They would still figure it. They'd figure out a way around it. Wouldn't they? The big thing is, is we need to make rhino horns valueless. That's the problem because there's such a high value on them based off of this false medicine until you, and it begins with education, right? So a big part of our job is to educate people that there is no value to these horns, taking these horns from rhinos is not helping any human sustain. We need to stop the poaching by devaluing and educating the next generation of people to say, you know, I don't need rhino horns for my, you know, medicinal purposes here. It's not working. We got to synthetically grow these things. You have to create the diamel of rhino horn. Like some rhino horn that is, you couldn't tell the difference between the two. If you did that, you would destroy the whole industry, right? Like, could you theoretically, synthetically grow a rhino horn? Well, I mean, here's the thing. It's like, why couldn't you just take, you know, go to the barber shop and take a bunch of human hair and collect it off the floor? I mean, it's keratin, it's skin cells. I mean, you know, I don't know what the difference is between why rhino horn is perceived as more value versus, you know, the beard grown off of my face. I know there have been farms before, and this is not something that I believe is by any means legal, but there have been black market farms of people raising rhinos, cutting the horns and selling the horns on the black market. I think there's some syndicates that have tried that before that have ultimately been taken down. But again, it really roots down to just making people realize that there's no value to a rhino. It's pubes, you're eating expensive pubes. Yes, that's it. It's pubes. There's nothing special about them. That's for sure. Just compacted hair. I've been hands on with one. I mean, it just, it looked like if you were like, take a magnifying glass, look at it. Oh, it's a gazillion hairs seemingly all glued together into a shape that, you know, rhinos used to rub on stuff and battle and defend themselves. And yeah, it's their facial ornament. I've eaten pubes. It doesn't do anything. You're one step ahead of me. Maybe a future episode. Save the rhinos by eating pubes. It's like the ice bucket challenge, but with pubes, right? Coyote, thank you so much. This has been such a thrilling conversation. It's so nice to meet you. Thank you so much for putting out such incredible content and for saving the rhinos and for giving my kids something they love to watch. Thank you so much for being on the show. You are amazing. How can people connect with the rhino conservation? Or is there anything you can I can send my listeners to? Yeah, no, lots of great stuff happening in the Brave Wilderness universe. Of course, the first place to stop, if you're looking to just go down the rabbit hole of entertaining edutainment, the Brave Wilderness YouTube channel, just search Brave Wilderness on the internet or on YouTube. If you're interested in getting involved with rhino conservation, just go to savethehorns.com and you can find how to get involved with that initiative. But don't get it with so much fun being on the show. I'm a huge fan of the work you've done. So it was a true honor to be here today. Thank you. And yeah, looking forward to hopefully maybe being back on the show at some point or any future collaboration, you just let me know I am all about it. I love you. Thank you. I'm going to take you up on that coyote and stay safe out there. We need you. So please take it easy. You don't want no more hornet hand stuff. You're the best. Have a wonderful day. Thank you. Thanks, man. You too. That was Coyote Peterson, everybody. All the links you need to find Coyote will be at DuncanTrestle.com. Much thanks to our sponsors and much thanks to you for listening.

That's the rules of deer season. And that's bad news for the deer. Any person hunting deer during a deer farm season shall wear hunter-horned, visible from all sides. This includes hunting with archery equipment on Sundays. You can't go out there in your tracksuit. You can't go out there in your dating shoes. You can't go out there with your spearman shoes. You can't go out there with your William Bully Yates blues. Most importantly, you can't catch the deer and suck it stick. I didn't write the rules. That's just the way of it. You gotta kill it. And that's the rules of deer season by John James. And that's a deep crate pick for you. You can find that in a lot of deep crates. Welcome, friends. This is the DTFH. My name is Duncan Tressel. I'm so fortunate that you've decided to tune into this podcast. Maybe you're on your way to a wedding right now, getting a hand job from a couple of your friends. And I can't tell you how exciting it is to be some small part of that. I love you, and I'm glad you're here. And we have an awesome podcast for you today. When I came to LA, this was one of my very first friends. Jason Tebow, we started a sketch improv group together. We did a lot of acid together. Jason encouraged me to keep doing stand-up. And Jason was someone I literally tiered up in front of. After bombing for, I don't know, 11 times in a row, 15 times, 20 times. Who knows how many? Jason is a dear, sweet friend of mine. He's already been on the podcast once, but it's been too long, and now he's back. So hang on and get ready for one of the funniest humans to ever crawl out of a dolphin.

He is going to be performing with Steve Ranizizi at The Market in Indiana. All the links you need to find that are going to be at DunkinTrustle.com. All right, here we go. Everybody, welcome back to the DTFH. Jason Tebow. Welcome back to the DTFH. We are here mid-apocalypse. Who would have thought that I would be up in North Carolina? Where are you? I'm right outside Chicago. You would be right outside of Chicago in Indiana, and we would be experiencing this weirdness. I mean, my god, it just seems like yesterday that we're in Culver City on acid. Now, we didn't technically meet on acid, but our first blind date was doing acid together. Triples and triples, like, you've got to meet this guy, Doug. When did you move to LA? What year? I was trying to figure this out this morning. I don't remember. I was in the 90s, though, wasn't it? To add to that, I don't remember our blind date on acid. And in fact, I don't remember much of the Culver City stupid dummies era as much as I'd like to. And I don't know if that's because of the acid or some combination of things. Man, isn't it so odd to watch the sort of diaspora of comedy store comedians drift out across the country after the shift in Los Angeles, the pandemic shift? Man, and our whole subculture of all of us that grew up together pretty much at the store and all that kind of stuff, it's just great. It's like a cue ball just hitting a hole, and everybody just kind of went everywhere. And then once you realize, hey, man, I don't have to have a $3,000 one-bedroom apartment that I can barely maintain financially to do what I do. I can live anywhere and do a podcast and not live in chaos. Yeah, right. Yeah, I mean, it's like the comedy store is like some kind of satanic egg sack. Like you see those egg sacks with spiders in it, and it just exploded and sent all of us skittering across the state. But yeah, I think there was a sort of dawning realization, not just with the comedians, but with most people. Like why the fuck do I need to live in that hyper-expensive place when I could, with the money I'm spending on an apartment in Los Angeles, I could get like in most places an incredible situation. Live much better than most of your friends that live well. Yeah, but God, that's where you really realize like fuck, but it is all just, it's a bit of a stage. Without your friends, you're like, yeah, now you're on a nice stage in some weird show in a different town, but your friends are all not around. So you know what I mean? You just start realizing what matters. Yeah, and it kind of becomes more like work, because you would be at the comedy store improv or hanging out anywhere. It's kind of where we just hung out. It's kind of like the bars that we hung out at. Yeah. If you didn't have a gig, you would just hang out at the store and have funny laughs and play jokes on people and shit like that. And now you're just like, you don't know anybody at the club. You just show up, you do your set, you maybe talk to a few people, and then you just go home. Yeah, it's almost like a dream, isn't it? It feels like some bizarre shared dream that we all had that we all kind of woke up from into completely different dreams. So what's your dream right now? What's your day like, Tebe? I mean, what are you doing now? How are you making life make sense during this weird period in our history? I mean, I think for like a lot, like the first six months of it, I think, I was like, oh yeah, this'll be over by the fall or whatever, and then it was a weird six months. Now it's almost a year and a half later, and it kind of becomes like, how they say it, it becomes just the new normal. Like I just kind of, it took a while for me to let go that things are gonna go back to the way they were. Oh, this'll blow, you know, I lost the sense of this will blow over soon into this is now, at least in a sense of a catalyst, sort of a way. This is going to be a long period of time that is gonna be almost evolutionary for a lot of people. It's gonna make people evolve into different people in a way, you know what I mean? And I'm not just talking about, oh, I wear a mask, or I don't wear a mask, or I'm not talking about the line in the sand between science deniers, and, but I think it's gonna mature people in a really fast way. I think people in their 20s are gonna be much more mature through this, and I think people that were just sort of, myself, for example, I just feel like I was sort of in a way, in just sort of a rut, and it was almost like Groundhog's Day. I mean, the weather was every day the same in LA, you know, there was never really a sense of change coming that I didn't even feel. I just kind of felt like it was the same day over and over and over again, seeing the same people going to the same places, and this kind of fractured that sort of thing and makes you kind of take a big step back, kind of like, you know, seeing a tree, you just stand at the same tree and kind of made you pan back like a drone shot and go, oh man, look at this giant forest. I don't have to be right in front of this one tree, like. You know? You know, we would, it's like, yeah, we're getting a real look at history, like what it means to be part of history, and I remember Jason, old people, like when I was a kid, my grandparents, who went through history, you know, and who understood the topsy's every nature of living on a planet with a shit ton of other people, and thinking like, why are they so, what's wrong with them? They, you know what I mean? Like old people have this like aspect to them, the aspect of like, you don't understand what happens here on this planet sometimes, like sometimes massive shit happens, massive up evils, or if you've ever met anyone who has lived in another country during a revolution like a refugee, they have the same look of like, you don't get it, man. You don't get it, and you're like, relax, you're in America, baby, what could go wrong here? You know, we're safe with everything, and so I think that post pandemic, whenever that may be, the next generation is gonna look at all of us, and we'll all have this like, that same look in our eyes of like, you don't get it, man. It happens so fast. We were just walking around, sitting around, having our drinks, doing our shows, fucking each other, and all of a sudden, over the course of about three weeks to four weeks, everything changed completely for a long time, and they'll be like, come on, grandpa, shut up about the pandemic. So tell me about this perspective that you're seeing now, like, how is it causing you to, how has it caused you to change? Like, do you, if you had to describe the difference between you now and you pre-pandemic, how would you describe it? I think the things that I put all my value into were, I don't wanna say shallow, but just in the light of eternity, not important. You know what I mean? Oh, I have to do this, or I have to be a part of this show, or I have to, you know, and then you realize, oh, and also like, my sister lost her best friend to her in a car accident during the pandemic, her best friend, Tara, who I grew up with, she was like a sister to me. And then Jeff Scott died just randomly, who, you know, the piano player at the comedy store, who's, you know, we saw every day for 20 years, we say, and you worked with him forever when you worked at the store. And then you start going, oh, man, what the fuck is going on? You know, you start to pee, and you go, shit, man, you know, I'm not, I'm no spring chicken, and I've been anything but kind to my body, I've been anything but kind to my space suit that I get to rent for 89 laps around a star. I haven't been, you know what I mean? I'm put some bad gas in this motherfucker, you know what I mean? And not that it made me change, you know, I mean, I'm literally smoking pot right now and drinking fucking tea, but. Drinking tea. Yeah, yeah, but it's a, it's all right. What the fuck's in the tea? Mm, I'm roofing myself. It's the only way I can beat off anymore, though. I'm kicked off so much in the pandemic, I have to knock myself out and wake up with just a mess all over the room. I go, all right, I guess I did it again. Are you sure it's you? You never know. I don't know, no, I'm hoping. I actually, I don't even really care at this point. Do you ever remember me? No, no, actually, I don't, but the window is always open. This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp. Is there something interfering with your happiness that's preventing you from achieving your goals?

But that's why I just think it kind of in a way, I think it made me just slow down. It made all those little things that were so important and not as important. And I think a lot of the, you know, my parents, my mothers are both getting older. My, you know, I got, you know, I just, it just made me kind of going, okay, man, what's really important here? And that's getting somebody pregnant, Duncan. You know how it goes. Yeah, yeah, man. I totally, that's the answer. If you wanna feel younger, go have some kids. Yeah, uh-huh. Oh my God, ever since I've had kids, I'm getting the best sleep in my life. I've got so much energy and my anxiety. You know, back when I was down, oh my God, when I was living by myself. Yeah, all the anxiety, just, it was a little late. I was, wake up, just clenched in a ball of anxiety, but now, it's like, Jonathan Livingston-Siegel over here, flying above the ocean, free as a bird. And all the free time you must have, which is why we're doing this podcast, the date and the morning. No, actually, it's, honestly, I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not. I'm guessing you are, but yeah. No. All the cliches are absolutely true about having a kid, man. It's like, it's the best thing ever, but yeah, everything requires sacrifice. The gods require sacrifice, they do. You must sacrifice something to get something, and there's just no way around that, man. But that really, the death thing in particular, you know, I think that's the other thing people are experiencing and, you know, becoming acquainted with something that most of us just didn't really think that we would have to become acquainted with at the age that we're at. A lot of young people are suddenly confronting loss at a level unlike anything anyone would have thought. Like, you know, my dad has passed on, my mom has passed on, and then all the people, you know, all of our comedian friends who have left us, Brody, you know what I mean? And like- Eric Meyers, Eric Meyers this year, some of you know, so many people. You start really seeing reality as it is instead of the very wonderful narcotic illusion of reality that we get, that we've been being fed by almost every single data source that isn't like the news or Dateline. You know, you watch Dateline as a novelty, right? You watch these shows about murdering, you're like, God, shit can really get bad out there. Then all of a sudden, you know, people just start disappearing, you know, and from your life. And then you start realizing, oh, okay, this is truth. This is the truth of life, which is- Well, and I think to that extent too, you know, when Norm McDonald just passed, and man, he was just the funniest guy, but also the nicest, sweetest guy. Yeah. And, you know, our Adam E. gets one of, you know, very good friends, and I know him and Norm were super close. Yeah. He and I were kind of texting about the same thing when Norm passed us, you know, told him just, and I think it's to the point where I was saying, you know, I'm not as concerned. I mean, both of my moms, their health was great. And, you know, so I'm not like, oh, I gotta be, take care of my parents, you know, I'm not even anywhere close to that. But what this has caused is, and in losing so many friends in just a two-year period, it's kind of made me go, oh, man, I gotta really value this time when I'm talking to Duncan right now. Or, you know, when I'm on the phone with a buddy, I gotta be like, okay, don't be, you know, when someone's talking to you, you go, man, this might be the last time, you know, we get to hang out, you never know, man, it's so random and you go, because that's the first thing people always say when somebody dies like that. Not when it's somebody really old, you know, with fighting cancer, and you go, oh man, thank God he's finally no longer in pain. Like a real, no way, you know, everyone's always like, I was just talking to her. I just saw him yesterday. Their first reaction is, how can they be gone? I literally had lunch with them yesterday. I go, but that was yesterday. That was, you know what I mean? The past doesn't exist. Oh, we were gonna go see a movie tomorrow. No, you're not, not anymore, because your plans with them were in the future, which is no guarantee. And the past doesn't matter anymore, you know? So I think, in a sense, I think it made me kind of stress and importance on being present and being in the moment. I really have found myself really concentrating on doing that, even if I'm just watching a movie by myself, you know what I mean? If I'm sitting there watching, I'm like, all right, I'm not getting on my iPad. I'm not gonna be playing Blackjack on the phone. While, you know, I'm just gonna watch this 90 minute movie and then, you know what I mean? Yeah man. And before I was always doing 11 different things, you know? I would joke about Tripoli, because I go, he's the worst driver. And I go, whenever Tripoli is driving a car, driving is the fourth thing that he's doing. You know what I mean? I swear to God, one time me and him were going to a basketball game. We went to a clipper game and he's driving and every time the light would turn green, I'd have to tell him, the light's green, man. He's driving. Then I look, he was making a flyer for a show that was like a week away. What? On his phone, he's making a flyer for, I go, motherfucker, that show is next week. You are driving right now. Yeah. You know? And I think that's kind of like a microcosm of what I'm saying where it's like, okay, I'm just going, you know, I'm going to be doing this right now. And you and I were talking a lot about this, but I think golf, the only thing I could do during the pandemic was golf. And I think that kind of really, I go, okay, I'm just gonna turn my phone off. I'm playing by myself. And maybe I'll listen to a podcast and I'm only doing this for three and a half hours. Yeah. And when I would get done, I go, man, I feel really great. It's not because I play good. It's not because I, you know, got hammered when I golf or anything. It's because I literally just spent three and a half hours not disturbed by anything and just being present. You know, it's why meditating is so key to it. Everybody says it and everybody scoffs at it. Yeah, okay, whatever. But I'm like, it's, you know, nobody's ever been like, man, I'm meditating and I fucking felt like shit. And then I'd fucking punch somebody in the face right after this. My life started falling apart when I began to meditate. People do, but there is a thing that can happen when you start meditating. That is, you definitely won't hear it when people are pitching that you should start meditating, which is that kind of sensitivity to reality emerges. It's pretty, pretty intense for people, you know, like. Right. It can be intense. Like the, I think I was just reading an Alan Watts quote that, you know, if you're- Yeah, of course you were. If you're expecting higher states of ecstasy or happiness, then you should also expect, you know, that your capacity for suffering is going to increase. You're, you start loosening whatever that invisible wall is around your heart. And I think that's what meditation, one of the things that it begins to happen with it. And then you got to start dealing with like the really brutal reality that other people aren't just as important as you. That other people experience life just the way you do. That other people wake up in the morning and feel the same feelings that you feel, you know? And I think, I'm, I think that really is like for some people an alien experience to really connect with that. Not like, like in your head connect with it, but you know, it connect with like that fucking stranger and the grocery store you're looking at. That person wakes up in the morning exactly like you, gets sad just like you, has heartbreaks just like you. And that for a lot of people I think is really crushing to deal with that much joy and horror in the world. Right? Like you, how do you, so when you start like meditating, you get a little bit more of a capacity. Even if it's a, even if it's just like you turn that, whatever that radio volume is up, just a little bit, man. That's enough to make people when they're sitting, just tears, just start pouring out their eyes as they like taste the thing that generally you only taste when you get the phone call. You know, when you get the thing of like, yeah, they were in a car accident and they're gone. But that can also happen. That doesn't have to happen. That's happening right now. You know what I mean? The phones are lighting up all around the planet with those phone calls every single second. Phones buzzing with, hey, yeah, we're, you know, and then like, what? So that's one layer of reality that I think there's, it's good to be acquainted with. Sure. Yeah. And I think everybody, you know, I was talking about Tate Fletcher, not too long ago, and he was, we were kind of talking about the same shit. And he said something, I go, man, that's interesting that he goes, every single person that you ever met or ever know or ever will know, including just people you pass on the street and including yourself has a completely different version of who you are. Yes, that's it. So you're never the same to anybody. I mean, there's a lot of people that think I'm the biggest asshole in the world cause they only met me one time. Yeah. Or I was in a bad mood when they walked by me and I brushed up against them. I went to watch where you're fucking going. Something like that. I'm the biggest asshole in the world to that guy. And because that's all he ever knew about me. You know what I mean? So it's just like, you know, are you talking about, wait, you're talking about David Leslie, that dude who you used to stalk? Well, no, no, no, I killed him, by the way. And I also got to make the phone call. You know, these people think this about you because it's not just like you're brushing against them, man. No, no, no. You're breaking into their house, wearing their clothes, leaving pictures. Well, he was getting up to pee in the middle of the night and he'd be brushing against me in his hallway. And he goes, who, why are you in my house? I go, get the fuck off me, bro. So that's 60 to part, 60 to part asshole. He goes, who are you? Put on a mask. That guy thinks I'm a fucking asshole, Duncan. You can't do that, man. You're not supposed to go into people's houses. You know, but- Yeah, now I know that. And now I'm a better person, but that's COVID has changed that a little bit. You know, I gotta tell you, gifts to the pandemic. You know, it used to be my favorite thing to go into a stranger's house, you know this, get some apples, get whatever fruit they have around, some bananas, you know, smash them up in a bowl and just- Feed the dog, feed the dog extra. Well, feed the dog, you know, after I rest my cock in the pulp of the fruit, I just, you know, it would relax me. I just like to sit on their couch with my cock resting in a bowl, they're smashed up fruit and then feed it to their dog. And you know- Sure. Now, when I do it, like I really try to be in the moment because I used to sit on and look at my phone when I was doing it, but this is the gift of the pandemic. Seeing how many likes you got while you're in the middle of doing something important. That's so funny. There's probably literally serial killers who are like, you know, when I was strangling the life out of somebody, I'd be thinking about the next person I was gonna kill and now I'm fully there with them when I kill them, you know, appreciating every bit of that wonderful moment. Thanks to the pandemic. Do you think you could kill somebody? Yeah, sure. How often do you think about it? You know, technically, I'm not supposed to talk about it. Like my lawyer said, I shouldn't talk about that, but I don't think about killing people that much, man. I really don't, but I do think I like to fantasize that should it be down to the, I mean, like, I do think that's one of the weird violent qualities of becoming a parent is like, I would insta-kill someone who was like- You immediately have that animal instinct in you to do anything it takes to protect your offspring kicks in. Yeah. That's what I was gonna get at because in all seriousness, because I know you and I have talked about murdering a lot of times, but off record. But when you become a parent, that immediately, it's like a light switch that comes on on you. And you would agree, I would, I assume, you did not have that in you before. That fantasy like, man, if somebody came at these, I would have fucking have to fucking kill somebody. Well, I didn't have the thing, the thing you have as a parent, which is like, if it came down to me dying or the child, my kids dying, it wouldn't, I wouldn't spend any time thinking about that. You know, like I would just die for my kids. There wouldn't be a quantum, there wouldn't be like, it's like an instantaneous like, oh yeah, you are the thing that is more important. So theoretically, I guess you could extrapolate that. Yeah. If like, it can't part of defending them or something involved like hurting someone else who's trying to hurt them. Yeah. I think that's a pretty obvious reality that is probably a primordial thing. Like, I mean, what's the number one thing you're supposed to do when you see baby bears in the woods? Hug them. Go up and hug them. Isn't that right? Comb their hair really technically, but hug them. Not even a brush, a nice comb. Oh yeah, you're like so sweet. No, because their hair gets all snaggly, you know. And then if the mother bear comes out and sees you combing the baby bears, the mother bear will generally bring you like gifts from the forest, like a rabbit, pelt or gold. They'll do tricks. I thought they did. They'll do tricks for you. They'll do tricks. Yep. And you're supposed to get, to fend, I could be wrong about this, but to fend off a angry mother bear, but you know what it's supposed to do? Cause I'm out here in the woods. Well, so are you. You should know that you have mountains. You put your nose as close to their nose as you can and you make loud noises. But, it's not noise, it's butt. If to scare it off, you have to make loud noise. Is that what you're saying? If you scare off the bear? Yeah, you got to get right in their ass and like blow or make noises in their ass. It scares the shit out of them, man. Okay, so you get real, you make a lot of loud noises as you approach them and then you just blow into their butt. Yeah, spread. You got to spread the cheeks and they go, man. They will launch into the woods. Yeah. I'm a jot, I'm jotting that down. Save your life, man. That's what got Grizzly Man killed as he was like blowing in their face. Well, I noticed scare off alligators. You're supposed to lay really still in the water. Yeah, I think it's so terrified, dude, by that. Yeah, it's the opposite of what you would think. Yeah. When you're traveling to a destination where you don't know the language, it can be challenging to accomplish even the simplest of tasks. I went to Paris once, I'm very proud of that. One day I'll go back, but people were so pissed at my shoddy, lame, awful attempt to speak French. It just was clear that I hadn't even taken the slightest amount of time to learn how to speak their language because I was going into my phone and looking at it and then mispronouncing things. It was embarrassing and I had a fantasy of just how incredible it would be if I had been at least mildly fluent in French. Who knows, maybe my relationship wouldn't have fallen apart.

Now, how many times have you, in the course of your life, how many times have you been attacked by an animal? A punch of goose in the face once. I just slapped it. I just slapped the goose because it was like I was mowing the lawn. And this, you know, geese, especially Canadian geese, they'll come flying at you with their heads in the air. And it kept doing that, kept doing it. And it doesn't, they don't bite you. They don't do anything. But finally, I just slapped it across its face. And it died, it died. No, it did not. No, no, it didn't die. I don't think I've ever been attacked to goose to death. That would be badass. Let's see. I mean, you know, dogs here and there, not a lot. Oh, I have a funny story about you. Speaking of, you know what it is? The message I left for you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Duncan used to always leave me these voicemail messages and he would be sick. It would just be improv off the cuff, just like he does on the show, like the stupidest fucking song. And it would just, and he would just sing. He would sing a song all the way until it just beeped and it would end. So you would never know how the song would end. He would just sing the whole time. He calls me one time and this is your song for data. I never forgot it because I listened to it so much. This is the exact message that Duncan leaves me. She's the oldest witch in the forest. And she's casting a spell on you. And she's, oh shit, there's that dog again. And then the message just ends. So you must have been attacked by a dog at least once because in the middle of a song, you were terrified of a dog again. Again, it was the key word. Yeah, there was so like, that was when I was living in that fucking puke palace by the comedies. By the comedies? Yeah. Everybody that lived in there were just complete fuckwads. You lived in there. Ari Shapiro was your neighbor. Yep. Holtzman lived in there. Eric Marino lived in there. Yep. Somebody else, it was just all the, no offense, I mean, it's in a nice way. The shittiest fucking people you can fucking name. So there was no parking there. And this is in fucking West Hollywood. So if you wanted to park, you had to drive way up the hill by all these mansions. And they hated you parking up there. They fucking hated you. And like I had this shitty car that I would park in front of this mansion and it would just leak oil all over the fucking road. They hated me. And I was walking, so I'd walk from there to the apartment. And I think probably is part of a way to discourage people from parking up there. I don't know, there's these like assholes who had dobermans or like, not do- There were just- There was one? There was one people who had a cobra pit. I remember the cobra pit. Yep. Yeah, they had a fucking cobra, wild cobra pit, which sucked in- Yeah, it really sucked in. Yeah, we lost a lot of comics to that pit. And there, we, yeah. But yeah, so I'm just, like I, there was a dog that would just get out and just chase chase me. Yeah. So I'm like, I'm wifely walking down the fucking road. Like a total dumbass singing some song to you. And then this fucking streak of darkness rushes out of the fucking, like this yard and just, just tried to attack me. The thing it nipped me in the ass once. Oh, okay. So there's one animal you got attacked by. Yep, that's one animal I've been attacked by, for sure. I got it, you know, I've, you know, I don't know if it categorizes as like an attack. You know- Here it comes. It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- It's- You know, I was, I, you know, prior to the pandemic, when my surfing career was really taken off, I was doing that. I was like in Hawaii. And I- I remember. Yeah. And I got pretty injured. A fucking orca just like jumped out. And I think it was intentional. Knocked me right off my board on a 30 foot wave. And like, you know, right into another whale. So it was like a set up or something like one, one. Yeah. One guy- Then I got the orca set up. So that, you see those whales and you- They do that though, because they attack in twos. Exactly. They're, yeah, they're like- Yeah. And one of them knocks it off and then the other one, when you get in the water and then it pats you down at the bottom of the sea with his tail. Yep. And you, so you, they're not as soft as they look. You see them and they look like, you think it'd be like a trampoline or something, but it's really fucking hard and really cold. And it chills you when you smack into it, which sort of knocks the breath out of you. And yeah, and I just got super lucky and grabbed onto my friend's surfboard who had just caught a wave and he pulled me in or I would have died. Wow. And that, that was the end of your surfing though, right? No, I can, in my book, I say that's when my surfing career really started. Oh, well that makes sense, I guess. Yeah. I mean, all of your chokies and whatnot. I'm not going to let a whale incident get me out of the sea. What was the name of that book? The whale incident? They say it's the next end of thin air. It's getting great reviews. Oh, how about it? So, when we were friends, were you into golf? You were, weren't you? Are we not, I'll be not friends. No, I mean, I know what you mean. I know what you mean. I, you know, just like, not in the same way that I understand it now. And, and appreciate it for what it's for. I was, I was a, you know, five, six time a year golfer who would just, you know, drink 10 beers and knock it around a little bit and not really care too much.

Do you think it's the of all the sports and maybe this is just a lame question. Do you think it's the most psychedelic sport? In that sense, yeah, I mean, I think mentally you can really get deep into it. You know, it's also probably the only sport where you could do psychedelics while you still play. You think you could microdose mushrooms. No problem and have a great time. I don't think you could do fucking three hits of acid and do anything functionally. No, I don't either. I think you would be completely destroyed. I think that would be a waste of acid. But I think you could, you know, I love smoking pot and playing golf because I think it just kind of chills me out that I'm just like I said, I just put headphones on. I don't usually I play alone. So I'm not talking to anybody. I'm just kind of, by the way, I'm baffled that you're, you're golfing. I think it's post midlife crisis. I think it's a lot of us. Maybe that's why all of us are doing it. I think it's a sign you're on the other side of your midlife crisis because you're like, once you start playing golf, you're like, I'm not cool. And you're like, I'm just not going to be cool now. I'm not, you know what I mean? I'm like lame. They make you dress like I'm having to dress like all my fucking dads, friends. Like you just want to go out there. You got to put on these stupid fucking taggy pants and like a dumb shirt. And you're like, what am I fucking doing out here? But then also that I think what's interesting about golf is on the outside. It looks like the most boring thing you've ever seen in your life. You watch people doing that. And I spent the longest time thinking about it, putting it on the TV, analyzing it, trying to like understand what the fuck are they doing? It looks like a mistake. It looks like something that, you know what I mean? It looks like a job. It looks like a shitty job where someone's like, I need you to move this ball way down my lawn, way down the fucking lawn. And and and but I need you to use the most stupid tool to move that I'm going to give you this weird fucking hammer thing. And I want you to move this fucking ball for four hours down my ridiculously fucking long lawn. And so I would watch it and just think, wow, I guess it's like, you know, some kind of hysteria like in in in, you know, the costuming and all of it just struck me as a kind of like failure of humanity as a whole. Just a complete like just like one ant death spiral. You know, like you see these, no. But then I would think I'd take the golf cart. Like I would love to get stoned and ride around in a fucking golf cart. And I considered getting tea times with friends and pantomiming playing golf without clubs, just to go ride around on the field. To one time, one time I was playing golf with Steve Reynolds, easy. This is a long time ago and Pete C. Steve Reynolds, easy. My buddy Jay Rogers, Ari and something. And Jason Delearn came along and did just that. And he was in like the group behind us. He pantomimed. He just was along and just was in a golf cart, drinking beer and smoking pot. And just went for it was like that Uber ride through the woods. And so we didn't see him for like three or four holes. And then finally we got kind of jammed up and then their cart pulls up to learn as only a shorts on his shoes and socks are gone. His shirt is off and his arms are like way in the back of his head like this and he has a beer in his hand. And he goes, dude, this is fucking golf. This is fucking incredible. I go, no, you're being driven around through the woods drinking and somehow losing clothes. We are golfing. You are getting drunk in the woods and driven around and somehow losing garments left and right. Yes, as I saw you had shoes and a shirt on. Yes. I mean, this is the what's somebody someone just told me. Let me look it up. The Mark Twain. You know the Mark Twain? Oh, yeah. That golf is a it's a good walk ruined. Yeah, golf is a good walk ruined. But so but I think again, it's like from the outside. Every bad thing someone would think about it makes sense. Also, you know, when I was coming up, it's like my dad desperately wanted to get me golf lessons. And I was just going to ask if your dad golfed. I love your dad. Your dad is a wonderful guy. Yeah, he golfed. Thank you. And he he loved it. But, you know, it's like you see you're a kid and you're like, God, Jesus, you're he's going out with these fucking, you know, shopping center developers. You know what I mean? You're you're wearing these pastel. You there, T.P. Uh, can you hear me? Yeah, it's OK. I can hear you now. Anyway, the point is, you know, like you would see I just got a negative connection with golf and like, you know, fucking. I did too forever. I hated my past. Dells shirts. Yeah. And I always hated a lot of people with, you know, I always had it like this, like my problem with golf wasn't golf. It's almost like kind of like, yeah, you say, like I'm almost like I don't hate the Dave Matthews band as like their music. Yeah. If you hear one of the songs, you go, OK, I hate their fans. I hate, you know, it's like those are the people that give them the bad name. So I hated all the people that were associated with golf more so than I did, than I didn't like golf. But then once I realized, hey, man, I can play alone and make this my own fucking thing in my own fucking way. And then it became really quite enjoyable to me. And then after a while, then I started kind of like with certain I like playing with certain people, you know, there's a lot of people. There's more people I wouldn't want to golf with than there are. I would want to go. Well, yeah, but you know what, like the couple of lessons I've taken once you get underneath that, like, whatever the fuck the golf thing is, you just realize, oh, this is a junkie. Oh, I'm just hanging out with a junkie. Like in the jungle, you know, it's like they're just like the healthiest junkie you'll ever meet because they have the exact same addiction. But it's for like being outside and playing this game. But the frenzied, like once you let once they start talking about it, it's crazy how how like how much these are like, go take a golf lesson. And just just if you've ever met a junkie, think about them and then look at the person you're with is they're like, you know, expounding upon like they're basically talking like somebody you about like like anyone like who's seen an angel or something. You know what I mean? They're like, you don't understand if this is the metaphor for existence itself. This is more than the greens. It's a pathway to liberation. You know, they're the funniest, the funniest tax where you were texting me about golf and that you're golfing. Oh, man, I can't believe you're playing golf with me. Yeah, it's fucking super cheap. So cheap about that for this. It's very expensive. That's what I think is great about it. Yeah, it's like very cheap. It's very accessible. They make it really accessible. But yeah, I don't know, man. I'm just like like at this point in my life, especially with kids, I need an addictive thing that is going to get me outside and like, you know, it's so I and also I think just like in general, like always having something you're trying to get better at, you know, is so it is a personal thing where you're kind of like through time, you see progress and you go, oh, man. And then once you kind of, you know, everybody, everybody's style is sort of different. I kind of, you know, a lot of ways you can almost equate it like MMA or something. You know, what I would do in a situation isn't what you would do in a situation. Yeah, right. You know, yeah, it's the same means to an end. And it's fucking hard. And it's like, it's really hard. So it's like that. So that I think like the always like having a thing in your life that is. On paper, kind of like meaningless, you know, or just sort of like not related at all to what it, whatever it is you may do, having a completely different thing that you for the only because of some weird thing your heart is telling you, you start messing around with it and then trying to get better at it. I think that improves all the other qualities of your life, too. Right. It bleeds and everything else. Yeah, you know, yeah, it's a commitment towards something, which if you have zero commitment towards anything, you don't have a relationship with commitment. And then once you have a relate relationship with commitment, then it becomes then it becomes applicable to other aspects of your life, but you can't you can't have it something if you don't have something. If that makes any fucking sense. I'm playing. Well, I'm doing it. Let me do a quick plug here, Duncan, and then we'll take a quick commercial break. But only to bring it up. Ren is easy. And I are doing a gig together September 26th. He rent is easy, which is a Sunday night, early show, seven o'clock and Valparaiso, Indiana at the Comedy Lounge, Market Lounge and Comedy Club. So a big 400 seater. So get tickets to that. Duncan will tweak the link to that or whatever. Or you can just look on any of my social media for that. But the next day he and I are, yeah, so please come to that. If anybody's in the Chicagoland area, me and Ren is easy. But the next day, he and I are golfing at this place where I'm a member. That's why I get to golf the most of a member in a place. I could play every single day. Yeah. And he and I are going to golf and he he's in that group of all of our friends. That's fantastic. He's fantastic. Court and account is unbeatable. I mean, he's going to shoot in the 60s at any course. Jesus. But Ren is easy. He's going to shoot in the 70s. He's really, really good. So we're going to play. He's going to give me 18 strokes. So he has to beat me by more than 18. That's double what it usually takes for you, right? Sure, of course. Oh yeah, usually. I'm a nine stroke kind of guy. But, and then here's what I propose is, what do you think about this? This is what the bet I say the bet is. Loser can't talk to his two sons for one year. That's so stupid. That is what I said to him. I go, dude, but that's, I mean, think about it. I couldn't talk to your kids for a year. Did that would be fucking so fucked up? I haven't talked to his kids in the last three years. It's so dumb. That's funny, man. Look, do you need, do you need to take a break? No, I was just joking. I was giving you a little wind out for a commercial. Hey, we are. It's our, we're already past the halfway mark. So wait. So, but like to get back to the, and we'll plug that up front, if you remind me, to get back to the, um, this idea, the other thing that I think is interesting about golf, at least for someone like me is there's no possibility of it being anything more than me hitting a ball. You know what I mean? So it's got the perfect meaninglessness to it. Or you know what I mean? There's, in other words, like, you know, some things you're, you, you're trying to get good at, you might have some financial reason. You know what I mean? Some career ambition with the thing like, all those people are 12 years old. All those people that have any ambition of making money at this are already good and they're already 13 years old. Exactly. So all of that bullshit right out the window. So that means that you, there's a purity to the fuck it. Like there's like an existential purity to the activity, which makes it like almost a holy activity. And I don't mean golf. I mean, any fucking thing that you begin to pursue and you've abandoned all the notion of receiving something from it. Yes. Yes. Which is even can be a claim. It even can be everybody talking about how great you are at it. Even that is something that people, I want everybody to be really impressed with this. You are solely doing this for the act of doing it. And in that way, it's an act of kindness towards yourself. Yes. Towards you getting outside, towards you breathing good oxygen, towards you getting away from all of your devices that are just melting your fucking mind from you to stop playing video games for fucking three hours for you to get away from everything and just connect to really earth. All it is is a game of not going to ball around the planet and making you go out and do it. Yeah. Yeah. I think like you, every single person should have not golf necessarily, but something in their life like that, you know, like, or like, you know, um, like even fucking gardening, even gardening, which I think is another great example. It's a great example, but you're still getting a profit for you're still getting food out of it. You know, like having a thing like I'm thinking you're getting a connection with the planet. You're getting a, you know, I'm, I'm more the thing I like the most about, about it was what I'll play in the morning by myself. There's nobody out there but me, nobody but me. And it's all the deer running by and the beavers and the fucking all the different kind of plants and birds. And I'm always taking pictures of these trees that are like, fuck, 300 years old and they've been on that property forever. And you go, fuck man, this is fucking so cool to be out. I mean, when else do you get to do shit like that? Not to mention you get to drive the fuck go card around. Yeah. The go card though is still for me, the theoretically the best thing about it. I'm not even like, I don't even know when I'm ever going to actually play go play the game itself. I'm just like learning how to hit the balls, the fucking, I'm sorry, y'all. We're talking about God, the stance is fucking so like, that's the other thing. When I took my first lesson was like, this is kind of painful. And then the other thing it's awkward and also it is exercise. Like I would watch golf and think that's not fucking exercise. What is like pool? It's like calling pool exercise. You know what I mean? But it's fucking exercise too. Like you actually you were contorting your body in this like strange position that's so awkward. Yeah, it sucks. You know, it sucks. Now that I think about it, it sucks. I'm done with it. Are you going to quit? No, after we just said that, I'm going to fucking you got me, you got me fucking bonered out just to get back into my surfing game. Yeah, for me, that's always going to be my first love is like, you know, putting on the wax and the board, you know, when I met you, you were you were at a big thing about you were like, oh, I'm the best sword swallower in Asheville. And then you were always swallowing swords. I remember you remember that shit? Yeah, you had a big sword swallowing thing for like a long time. Yeah. And you know what? I that title was taken away from me. Yeah, by who? That's when I left Asheville, actually, is just because at the time my ego just couldn't stand it. You ever think about getting back in the game with that fucking mouth ears? Well, yeah, you know, actually, and I mean, I don't I'm not trying to like I'm my condolences to their family. But yeah, you know, Peaky Martinson rest in peace. He was the number one sword swallower in Asheville. And he like got an over sharpened cemetery. Oh, yeah. And yeah, I mean, that's why they made those illegal. That's why they made those illegal. No, he wasn't. It wasn't swallowing at the got him. Oh, he was cleaning it and he got it. Um, his wife was cleaning it for him. And I guess it accidentally like slid into the other room from her hand or something. I don't know. I don't know all the details, but yeah, apparently like, yeah, like she accidentally stabbed him three times with it in the chest. Very simple. Yeah. Some of the thing happened to my grandfather. But let me say your grandfather. There's Elliot Smith. Yeah. Remember when we went and saw him back that day before he died? Remember when we started that fake fight? Yes. We went and saw Elliot Smith at this place in Los Angeles. I feel so blasphemous about that. I didn't know what I was doing. Well, and he'd wound up dying, you know, you know how he died. But when we're sharpened cemetery, but he, uh, was playing and he was playing. You know, I think it was on heroin. I was like, I'm almost nodding off. I think he was on heroin. Maybe he just, maybe just had some of my tea. Maybe he just had some of my tea. Oh, yeah. I don't feel like roofing himself backstage. It could have been super hungover, but, um, he wasn't right. I'll say that. But, and then, but you would go upstairs to the out. There's like a patio upstairs and it was projected onto this giant wall. So if you went upstairs and there's a bar upstairs and here we just need to be in the outside air and you could smoke pot or smoke cigarettes up there and then, but you wouldn't miss the show. But you could see into the first, maybe 10 rows of people on of where this camera was shooting the stage. And you and I had everybody up there on the patio. I'd convinced you and I had to go into that section and start a fake fight with each other so that everybody, everybody upstairs could watch would see us have this fake fight and share his shit. Man, man, you walk. Got about right where we thought we would be in the view of the camera. Started pushing each other, got each other in headlocks and all this sort of shit. And I don't think he was playing at the time. I think it was like an intermission heroin break or something, but you could still see that crowd and there was like, Oh, DJ players and shit. And you and I got into this fake little scuffle wrestling match. And then we went back up to the patio wondering if they had all seen us. And really feeling like idiots. And then right when we walked out onto the patio, everybody was clapping for us. We were like, yeah, yeah, yeah, it worked. It worked. That show is so fucked up. Like the, the, I forgot about that. I told you. The one thing that I took away from it is like that the, how like his self destruction that he had romanticized in his music was fueling his audience. Like his audience wanted him to kill himself subconsciously or something. You know what I mean? Like they liked, you know what I mean? Like he couldn't stand up. He, I remember he had to sit on a chair. Like I can't remember what it was. Some weird fumbling with the guitar, the things that make us suspect shit. He might have been high. Even though at that time apparently it's over. Well, yeah, he didn't look like, I mean, it's got to be just an insurmountable amount of stress and pain when your sadness becomes your identity, because then if you ever get happy, then who the fuck are you? God, if only, but that would have been, if suddenly his music had become super happy and like it would have been the funniest, coolest thing. But, but like that, that relationship between that particular sort of artist and their audience being able to, I mean, he, any buddy that is feeling more or feeling any like sadness or any, you know, you get to you go, man, this music really scores my life right now. I'm going to identify with this. And then you put it, you kind of put that music away a lot of times when you, when you're not in that sort of dark place. But, you know, when you reside in that dark place, when that's all you know is that dark place and on top of it, if you ever venture to try to leave from that dark place, well, then what am I going to create? Well, then who will I be? Well, then, you know, so you almost get a Stockholm syndrome in your own creative endeavors when those, when the, when the soil that that art is planted is darkness and sadness and suicidal thoughts. Well, of course, that's the fruit that's going to grow out of it. But if that's the only thing you know how to plant, you, you, you don't even know who you are. If you were, we're, we're going to try to find peace or try to find happiness or try to, you know, you can't, you can't, um, people, I think, always, um, try to make synonyms, the life experience and an art artistic experience and whatever your life experiences is, is where you're going to create art. Yeah. So don't think that, oh, I started creating from this point when I was super happy. So I have to be super happy to be creative. No, right. You just have to be human and present. Right. And I think he, he just thought I have to be this guy. And that's it, you know, that's a, it's a, it's a, it's a perishable product. Dude, it's bad enough to be addicted to fucking heroin. Like, you don't need your money. Yeah, you know, it's bad enough to be addicted, but then tied into that addiction is an actual like business model that you're fucking, it's not just you. It's like all the people you're sustaining probably from the commissions and stuff. You know what I mean? It's like, you know, so, so no one's going to go to somebody like that and be like, you know, I think you should do more heroin for this album. No one's going to like overtly say it, but you are going to know, like, well, the people really love the album that was clearly just a love song to my addiction. And so in the new newer shit, doesn't quite have that resonance. So now you've got the perfect excuse to like, if you did sober up to start getting fucked up again, it's so sad. It's such a tragic thing, man. And also, I just think like that's the other. I remember on that fucking Elliot Smith mural that so many people like that would inevitably get defaced. Somebody had written on it. So his music is a trap. And like that, I agree with that, man. Like it's like, it's so sweet. It's so beautiful. But you know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of that fucking Cobra Pit that was up there. It was up by the apartments I used to live at because yep, yep. The Cobra Pit was just surrounded by like, you know, they put different shit out all the time and, you know, cigarettes, doubloons, just the kind of shit that you want to go pick up. And then the next thing you know, you've got a fucking Cobra in your face. You know, yeah, you don't fucking is that a doubloon? And then you go down and it's like fucking the next thing you know, you got copers all up on you. It's like Bacowski, the same fucking thing, man. You really shit and the message behind it is you can be a great fucking writer and just dissolving your bones with booze. Or, you know, like there's so many different versions of it out there that are all just complete fucking lies, man. It's like these are human anomalies. It's it's really hard, I think, to to pull off. Successful addiction, you know, like, I think, you know, I think it's really hard. Well, like I said, I think it's I think it's you got if that's what you're trying to do, you've got to get in and get out. Because I mean, it's inherently you're talking about being creative from a toxic place in life. So I'm doing something that's going to kill me. I mean, you know, I can write a book about what it's what's the experience to be at a fucking radioactive fucking meltdown. But I probably only got about two books in me before it's a rap. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You want to extend it a little bit, you know? Yeah, you you can also write a book about what it was like to be at a radioactive meltdown and what it was like to fucking beat cancer. There you go. That's a great spit off. You don't got to stay at the fucking meltdown the whole time. We keep writing the same book. So this shit ends when it ends. I think you'll go back to LA. Oh, no, man, you know, I've been kind of stuck here for like the last fucking 14 months, and I think I kind of want to do the opposite of that. I think I'm going to go to LA for, you know, a couple of weeks here, weeks there. My buddy Jay just moved to Seattle. You know, Jay, yeah, he just moved to Seattle. So I'm going to go up there and see him. I'm going to come see you and my buddy, you know, John Rapone just bought a house and guess where where Asheville. What him and his wife, what's your John Rapone and his wife just bought a house in Asheville. Yeah, they move in in November. What? Yeah. What's what you give your address? What's your address? Seven 17 American Breastway way. Right. Come Street Street. Yeah, that's he's I think he's 19. I think he's a 19 American Breastway. Come Street, six, six, seven. No, we're going to be neighbors. That's awesome. I think so. I think I think so. But yeah, he is moving to Asheville. He just bought a house in Asheville. I mean, his wife. Wow. That's no easy feat out here, man. It's hard to find a place that's paid for with the balloons. He played paid for with the balloons. You've got to connect us, man. And you definitely need to come visit. You've got to come up. Yes, I'm going to go there. I'm going to go come to you and go to New York. So I'm going to kind of got to just going to, you know, obviously I'm going to go to Austin to get COVID just like everybody else did. Don't forget to pick up your COVID in Austin. I know. Um, did now do you think that's where you got it? Because you went and did those gigs. Yes, where I fucking got it. Dude, I don't know if you did something else. That's a funny thing about it is like so. You sound like you got really sick, though, buddy. I listen to your I love your show that I'm on right now. I listen to you. I should do love to listen to your podcast. When I bought the stuff, it's kind of when I listen to pots and I was listening to the one with you in court and you were talking about, about that. Sounds like you got, I mean, cause some people, you know, vaccinated or whatever and they had it and they were just like, oh, I was kind of sick for two days, but you sound like you were really sick, buddy. Well, I got, it was weird, man. I, it wasn't like I was super sick. It was like, uh, it was just weird. Like I, I, I, I got. What were some of your symptoms? Couldn't stop, couldn't stop lying. Couldn't stop lying. I know I stopped. Oh, you stopped lying. No, I stopped lying for the, for about three days. And so I couldn't lie. And then, yeah, and then once I was able to start lying again, my come, I couldn't taste my come anymore or anyone else's for that matter. So now that's what you were seeing then, or that's what you were seeing. Cause I could have been your first. When I was able to start lying again, that's when I lost my ability to taste come rough, really rough, man, really rough. Like he's sorry about that. I'm sure it offers someone like me. It's probably equivalent to like, you know, a bat losing it to, you know, sonar or whatever they use. You know, it's like, it's like, I can't spy myself around the lights. I used to be able to, you know, tasting come, you know, where to go. You know, you know, you don't get lost when the lights go out and gals. Sure. I'm not limiting it to any particular gender. I'm just saying like, you know, anybody out there who's like, you know, experienced any, you know, subterranean. I was just fucking saying the other day to Ari Shafir. I go, Hey dude, we're kind of talking about the same thing. And I go, Hey buddy, uh, if you ever want to fucking find come, you give me Duncan, you give me lights out. You'll find the come. Yeah. No, I know. And you know, I, so I get back up here to the mountains and there's this wonderful cave up in Pizga where they have these great orgies. So I go out there down Pizga. Okay. Yeah. Deep in the down, like deep in the cave and you know, lights go out. Time to fuck. And so I'm like, you know, thinking like, okay, this is, I'm tasting come, I'm following it down. And you know, and I, and I, you know, I think I'm getting, you know, where I want to be, which is where I can get some more come. Then I hit a fucking wall, pull out my phone, turn on the light. I'm nowhere near the fucking orgy. I'd followed a little underground stream way, way down into the cave. And I know I've been near the calm, not even close. I wasn't even around a person. It was just a little creek. It's a little is in your mouth. Just fish, like I guess I'd like a cave, cave fish all the way down. Very similar taste, you know, by the way, but yeah, so, you know, it is coming back a little bit. Thank God. Um, but yeah, that was a rough, I just got like, you know, the, so what happened to me was the onset was like allergies. So that, you know, I had a show, I was going to do a show that night. Got tested to be safe. Just cause it didn't seem like anything, man. It was just like, but fucking Austin at the time was like a hotbed. So I'm like, all right, let's just make sure. Got fucking tested positive COVID tests. So you probably have more guns in that room than masks. Dude. Yeah. Well, that's the, that's the real, like for me, the real depressing part is I think like I was Aaron and I were like, look, we can't live in fear anymore. Let's get back to Austin. I'll do some shows, get back in the standup. We're not going to fucking live in fear. And then two days into not living in fear or so three days in, I had fucking COVID from not living in, you know, cause we sort of disregarded some of the as safe as what we were trying, where we were trying to be safe. I mean, we're being idiots or anything like that. But just like we lowered our guard a little bit. And that was enough for me vaccinated to get a fucking breakthrough case. But yeah, it was like the after the allergy thing for I started getting like the beginning symptoms of what people report had a joints hurting. And then a little bit of shortness of breath. But the real mind fuck of vaccinated COVID is you're probably. You're probably going to be okay. I mean, the mind fuck of COVID itself is that you don't know because the motherfucker treats everyone differently. So it might decide it likes the way your lungs taste. It might not. And so any so you have to keep taking your oxygen because you know, you don't know when your oxygen is dropping. And that's when they sent you to the fucking hospital. And I had these like nurses coming and giving me fucking IV drips. For the whole time. So they were monitoring that. And if your oxygen drops under a certain amount, they're like insta emergency room, because you start getting hypoxia, I think is what it's called. And then you, you know, you can just fucking die. So yeah, it was scary. It wasn't like it was a brutal experience, but mentally it was brutal being separated from my kids. It was fucking brutal being stuck in a fucking hotel room for 10 days is a mind fuck, man. That was the most brutal part is like just like the isolation. And, you know, Aaron would come to bring me like clothes and shit. She would try to come every day and like we would double mask. But just like it felt so gross and alien would not recommend it. Wouldn't I recommend getting COVID for anybody? It's it fucking sucks. And I would not want if there is an unvaccinated if like, and I do think the vaccine did what they say it does, because my, you know, I was around my family when I was probably the most contagious and nobody else got it. And, you know, and so that was that, that to me is like, that's good news. But yeah, but it's, but still, you know, I've got like, you know, a very um, you remember what my cum tasted like? Yeah, yeah. Like, uh, like if someone put a cough drop in butterscotch. Man, I remember the first time he told me that I like made my, made my ear. But yeah, birthday card. Yeah. Yeah, man. But, you know, so that I love that taste myself. I don't think it's like narcissistic to like the taste of your own cum. And, you know, just to wake me up in the morning, I would have a taste. How can I give somebody else something I wouldn't put in my own? No. Exactly. It's just not, yeah. Dude, I love it. That's my favorite verse, Mark 13, seven. But yeah, yeah. And yeah. So, but I have faith that it'll, it'll, you know, it'll return. Like I, I don't know if it's just placebo or something, but every once while I'm like, there's that cough syrup taste, but, you know, yeah, it'll come back. It'll come back. Thanks. You know what? And the only way you'll get it back is if you just keep this, you know, taking test falls, first of all, first of all, first of all, first of all. Thank you, man. Yeah. I'm joking. Yeah. It's all right. No, no, I get it. I mean, there's anything I would mess with you to taste my own cum. Well, hold on. Let's cut. I'm going to take a break. Jason, what a joy it's been reconnecting with you, man. Can you let my listeners know where they can find you? I'll, I'll post teams tour dates at duckatrustle.com. Yeah.

And then after that, I'm headed to Portland back to Helium. And I would love to see you there. All right, everybody, let's do this. Welcome back to the DTFH, William Montgomery. DUNCAN earthenware, YouTub3 Welcome. Welcome to You That You Are With Us It's the Duncanhussle妖lluje. William Montgomery, welcome back to the show. How are you doing? Duncan, it is so nice to be here again, I'm doing good. When I walked to the potbelly sandwich shop though, I saw somebody to my left sitting on the ground and I wasn't paying too much attention. They were begging or something and I looked and it looked like a burn victim and their whole face was like green. Like a green color and I wasn't paying anything. I know. That's horrible. So I just kept on walking. I kept on walking. You didn't stop, you didn't offer them help? I didn't, I couldn't. I ended up tipping the lady at the sandwich shop a little because I felt bad back. Like green, like infection? No idea. I don't know. It was literally, it looked like it was some sort of airbrush face paint, but I don't think it was like a green airbrush. It was probably face paint, man. It could have been. Probably like really cool face paint. But it was like on top of a bad burn thing, which is totally very sympathetic to that, but yeah, I looked on it. You don't sound it. Yeah, it scared me. I was trying to listen to my Beethoven six symphony while I was walking down the street. You listen to the six. Man, yeah, you know, whenever I'm listening to Beethoven and I'm interrupted by the peasantry. Yeah, it's unbelievable what has happened to our country. It's bullshit. I'm being sarcastic. Yeah, me too. I've been, I'm exhausted because last night I was tending to wounded animals. Were you really? Yeah, when I go on the road, I go out at night and I find like wounded animals, birds with broken wings. Last night a hyena, I guess it got out of a zoo. Downtown Cleveland. Yeah, there was a hyena. Gosh, its paw had a thorn in it. So, and a lot of times when you pull thorns out of the paws of a wounded animal, they'll lead you to treasure. That's what I've always heard. Is that why you did it? Or are you just normally you're doing it? The treasure is a side effect. If they don't lead me to treasure, well, if they don't lead me to treasure, I actually will have them euthanized. But that's not because the treasure is, it's an indication that they're probably, their brains are fucked up. So, yeah, I bring a youth kit out with me and give them a chance. But yeah, the hyena did lead me to treasure. Damn, what'd you find last night? Butt plugs. Ooh, like a cache or cash. How do you say a cache of butt plugs? Was it in that cool-looking museum they have out there? Did you notice that museum? It's like for sailors or something. Was it in, where was it? Under the museum. Under the museum. Yeah, it was a tunnel that the hyena had. Like hyena crows, for example. A lot of people don't know what crows. Yeah. If you feed them, they'll bring you little gifts. They'll bring you like shiny things. I've heard about that. Like stuff like that. But yeah, with hyenas, it's sex toys. And then, so when a hyena is in the wild, it naturally like seeks out butt plugs, vibrators, dildos. And just stashes them. And burrows under a building. And that's, yeah. I had no idea. I noticed some weird like laughing noises or something. And I was wondering if it was a laughing hyena. Yeah, it was laughing. Oh my gosh. And that could have been you taking the thorn out. I was thinking, what is going on in Cleveland, Ohio, where there's a hyena? I pulled the thorn out and started laughing. And then it did that nod that they do. Or it's like, follow me. So you earned it. And yeah, it was pretty good. Good butt plugs, like very well made. One of them seems to have been handmade. I always have wanted to get into butt plugs. But sometimes when I do do, and it's like too big, I've been eating weird or something. And it's like a real solid piece of shit. It just hurts so bad. And I'll just have to be pretty much laying on the toilet. See, this is why a lot of people think, I don't do butt plugs for sexual stuff. I think that's really fucked up. When I use my plugs, it's 100% for health and athleticism. Great way to. It's basically the same as the Wemhoff stuff, except it's a butt plug. Yeah, it sounds like the people stretching their ears. What do you slowly just get to bigger butt plugs? No, I didn't start slow. You started big. Pretty big one. Big, big. Yeah, I went in deep right away. And I know, but my bowel movements are incredible. I could imagine. I chill them. Ooh. That's a little life hack right there so you can chill the butt plugs. Yeah, people don't know that. I don't like room temperature. Interesting. Yeah. Maybe the first time, because maybe if it's a little icy or something, it could help. Look, let's pause. I'll let you put a starter plug in that I've got some chilling right now. And then let's come back and see how you feel. Okay, let's do it.

I can't guarantee your mitochondrial DNA will ohm, but you will feel good. And we're back. Damn. What do you think? I love it. It's in there right now. You can tell I'm sitting kind of weird on the chair. Yeah. That's in there right now. Could you tell that I have a giant butt plug in right now? No. You look so comfortable. Yeah, I can see it's something you have to get used to. You look like you do not have a butt plug in. I know. It's impossible to tell. You couldn't tell. You couldn't tell. And so, yeah, it's like, talk about how you feel, like what compared to before and after. How did you feel before? I feel, well, before I felt pretty constrained. I don't know, I was feeling kind of, ever since I saw that person out front that was green, kind of, I was feeling very melodramatic, kind of. And now I feel, I don't know, more powerful. I don't know if it's the coldness. You get those things really cold. Great for stress. I still feel it up there. And that's kind of mainly what I'm focusing on. So it really does help in getting my thoughts away from these bigger issues I was having in my brain before. Because now it's like all I can think of is, is it going to eventually loosen up? And like it loosens up, is my butt all going to get used to this? Because this, it kind of hurts, but it's kind of a good feeling. Yeah, you will get used to it. It's like, there's a little bit of discomfort at first, but then for me, like if I don't have one in, it's, I feel like I'm naked. Gosh, I feel like I'm going to get used to that. Is it normal for blood? When I was putting it in there, a little blood was coming in. Yup, good sign. Okay, okay. That's a good sign. It means it's kind of stressing the anus. It's a cleansing. It's a purge. It's like a lot of our dark energies are stored down there and the darker the blood, the more the blood. Like I've had friends who like you, they're like, I think I'm hemorrhaging. And you just, I just say, ride it out. Like, yeah, you are hemorrhaging. It's your ego. It's your power. It's like all the stuff you've been clinging to in your life. How do they feel afterwards? Do they feel a lot better? Well, one of my friends had to go to the hospital and the doctors are gonna bullshit you because they don't want people to find out about this stuff. And so they were like, it's a hemorrhage. But it wasn't. And he was fine. Honestly, I don't want, I hate being this guy, but when he was bleeding like that, I just kept thinking like, what have you done in your life? Yeah, he's probably, could have been a bad person. Not that you want to think about that, someone could be a bad person, but he could have been just a nasty. You could think about it. I thought about it. I said it. I'm like, are you a bad person? I don't talk to him anymore. Was he just like on the floor when all the blood's coming out or is he still in the toilet? He stood up. And I'd warn, you know, I told him, the whole thing I told you, read him that prayer. And he, did he stand up too fast? That was one of the first things you told me. You're like, don't, you're gonna want to, don't stand up too fast. He stood right up. That's how you faint. Big burst of his purge blood and he slipped on it. Damn, yeah. That initial bit of blood coming out was a little scary. Yeah. That initial bit. Yeah. It's scary. I've never seen that much coming out of my butt. Like I'd seen a little blood before coming out of my bottom, but nothing like that. It's joy. It's, that's the way, I mean, I, I consider it a form of tears. They say that when you cry, that your body is releasing some stress. That your body is releasing some stress, chemicals, which is why you feel better after a good cry. You cried. I did cry. I was crying. So it's like from both ends, you're purging. And it's just the tears of the butt by Stanford Tanslin on Amazon. That's how I got into this stuff. And he just talks about it. Oh, Stanford Tanslin? Yeah, Stanford Tanslin. Oh my gosh. How is he? Not great. He's in a super max. He made it to super max. Super max prison. I thought you're talking about the super max Walmart. No, it's just a super Walmart. Oh, oh prison. Yeah, they locked is that they locked him up. They don't want this stuff out there, man. They are in such control of the, you know, everything. Who, Amazon or Amazon is one ahead of the Hydra. For sure. They're in charge of it. I mean, you know, the Stanford Tanslin book, it's incredible. They still sell it on Amazon. It costs $400. That's expensive. Worth it. But it's worth it, I know. Yeah, just think how much it would cost for like all the surgeries that most people have to get in their life. Hundreds and thousands, if not millions of dollars and this is gonna bankrupt you and just read Stanford Tanslin's. It's a seminal work. Seminal work. It's a seminal piece of work. Combo sort of biography. The whole thing to me, like I know a lot of people look down and probably some of you listening right now, look down on it. But to me, what's really fascinating about his story and you know, when I hear that, I get it. If you hear, like you go to the, you hear the story, you went to the pyramids, had a vision, saw one of the pharaohs putting a pyramid inside of him. The pharaoh said, this is how he built the pyramids. This is how we did the whole Egypt thing. So, you know, and then he goes back to his hotel room. He had found a stone that like stood out from the others, a pyramid shaped stone. And he put that into his butt. That's, I know it's so weird. That's kind of how it started. If you really look back at it, that's... He could hear again. He was deaf. And like as soon as that thing went in. He couldn't start hearing. He said he heard a bird chirping. Could you imagine? It started weeping. Could you even imagine? No. I know his story is so crazy. Yeah. He was 19 when he first played basketball. That's just weird. He talks a lot about sports stuff with them. And it's like, man, we want to know about the pyramids. We want to know how you got this, just pretty much philosophy going. We don't really care about your, your adolescent experiences playing athletics. Basketball, I don't care. I did find that part of the book, like really weird. It's strange to me that it's like the last 10 pages or the pyramid experiment. Yep. The butt plug and then the whole entirety of the book or these like detailed stories about like playing. Yeah, the teams he was on. Yeah, horse, a lot of horse. It's like, if you're even gonna talk about playing basketball, talk about the games you played in. Don't talk about the little side things you were doing. Talk about playing horse. And that other one would knock out, I think, where it's two basketballs and it's a lineup. People like who's really good at knockout. I'll give them that. But it's like... I mean, according to the book, honestly, I believe the pyramid stuff more than I do the basketball stuff. Me too, because you see the pictures of them on the back of the book and he's like this. He wasn't good at basketball. He looked like not somebody that I would be betting on. No, not at all. To be good at basketball. Yeah, and especially that knockout game. I do miss that. That was a pretty fun basketball game. Knockout? Yeah, it was a line of people and you have two basketballs and the guy at the very front of the line had to shoot it. And if they made it, they go to the back, but if they missed it and the guy behind them made the basket, you're out. Oh, so it's like standing in the back of the line, you feel stressed out. Yeah, yeah. Freed out. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know, when like, I played basketball in college and... I had heard that. Yeah. Yeah, we would do knockout. I didn't like it because like, I was all like, I don't want to brag. I don't do it anymore, but you know, it just felt bad. The person in the back of the line was always like getting knocked out by my shots. I know, that would probably be embarrassing. I know, it's just... I hate it. I hated playing college basketball. I hated the stress of it. I hated the way it distracted me from my studies. And you were a starter for what? All four years, weren't you? Yeah, all four years. I didn't want it, but the team, like, they demanded it. They were like, you have to do this for us. You know, you're on a scholarship. So who was it? Wally Russell? Was he your coach? Yeah. Yeah, Wally. Yeah, Wally. Wally the Wally. Great guy. Great guy. I don't, I try on the podcast and not like throw shade, but... Yeah, he seemed weird. The articles I read. Coach. Did he not? No. Y'all were like coaching yourselves. Weren't you pretty much? I was the coach. You were? Yeah, I was the coach. Wally had a cot in the back. Like he would just send us out and be like, you know, play ball boys and we'd go out there and fucking like work our asses off. And he was back there snoozing. God, I don't know. I caught the nerve of that. The nerve, like in the locker room. We had a cot in the locker room. I can't imagine. It's the cot and you couldn't wake him up. Like I think he was, I don't know. I mean, again, I have no idea, but was he on pills? Like, how are you sleeping like that? Like we'd come back there. I'd be cracking them with a wet towel, smacking them in. Yeah, the rat tail. That's a classic locker room. I would rat tail the shit out of them and we would like, we would do dances, you know, all the classic locker room stuff. Yeah, yeah. Snoring. What a piece of shit. I hate to hear that. I want to calm a piece of, I mean, I think his philosophy, he said he was a, he was quote, dream coaching. That he was like, like coach, he wouldn't, he would be asleep. He'd be coaching you on this. He was like astrally projecting and onto the court. Well, it's good if y'all are winning, but if y'all start losing, people are going to second guess that method. Dream coaching, that is a, seems like a controversial. We were winning, but it's like, okay. You know, you could say that about anything. Like I could just be like, oh yeah. I'm, I'm dream presidenting right now or I'm dream, what, name it. You know, I'm going to start a company called Enron. Yeah. I'm running Enron in my sleep. It's so, it's such bullshit. It really is. I wish I could have dreams like that. I never have dreams where I'm like, run it. I've, I've been working on it. I've, it's part of the book, but I haven't been able to yet. Yeah. Well, I mean, look, I know people who say they're running companies in their sleep. My friend runs Amazon, he says. Seriously? Well, I'll tell you. That's a big one. I did, I mean, I did, I wanted a PS5 and they were hard to get. And so I asked him, can you like dream a PS5? Like that we can buy some online on Amazon. Yeah. I was like, yeah, sure. And he dreamed up an offer code. Did it work? It worked. Yeah. It's almost demonic sounding. Yeah. I mean, no, he openly says it's demonic. Seriously? Yeah. He says that, yeah, you, the way, like, I guess when you're doing this shit, I wouldn't recommend it for anybody to mess with demons. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, you, apparently you, you fall asleep. And if you do this right, this breathing pattern, you wake up and you're in this corporate office, office. Yeah. And like sitting on your desk will be the company that you're running. And then every once in a while, a demon will come in in a suit and just like flare at you. Where are my reports? Yeah. Where are my fucking reports? Yeah, where are the reports? Yeah. Your soul. I smell your soul. Yeah. Yeah. And like, he just says, you got to break a few eggs to make it omelet, but fuck, dude. That sounds like a nightmare to me. So many people are messing with demons, right? These days, like it's all over. They need to stop. Tick tock. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by better, I love therapy. My life is significantly better because of therapy. It is shocking how little we know about ourselves, how lodged in the invisible teeth of your brain are all these rotting bits of the past that you haven't fully digested. And they emerge from you in a kind of behavioral flatulence, that thing you do that surprises you. Why am I acting like that today? That doesn't make sense. It's because you've got a withered bit of your past just stuck up there. And a great therapist helps you digest that stuff, reducing your psychic flatulence. Better help. I hope it's okay. I'm saying this. This is definitely not in the sheet that you gave me. But truly, therapy is one of the best things that ever happened to me. If you're thinking of starting therapy, you should give BetterHelp a try. It's entirely online. It's designed to be convenient, flexible, and suited to your schedule. All you gotta do is fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist, and you can switch therapists anytime for no additional charge. I will add to what they're saying. Sometimes you really do need to do that. It's not dating, obviously, but sometimes the therapist, it doesn't mean they're a bad therapist, it's just not your therapist. So that's one of the great things about BetterHelp is you don't have to move from one office to the next, to the next. It's all online, and that is incredibly convenient.

[""Tick Tock Song""] That sounds like a nightmare to me. So many people are messing with demons right these days. Like, it's all over TikTok. They need to stop. Those dances, you think anyone could invent those? Like, have you seen some of these incredible dances they do? I wish more than anything, Duncan. I knew how to dance like that. That's what I think, and that's the devil or something telling me that, I think. Definitely, because I wish I could dance like that. I don't know how they do it, how they pop their bodies and move around like that. Well, they don't, they don't do it. They're possessed. It's a devil thing in them. In them, like a demon, the demon of dancing gets into them and like makes it seem like it's possible that these dances are extraordinary. They're extraordinary, I agree. They've studied them. They've studied them. Stanford is doing a study on them right now because it's like, just based on Newtonian physics, some of these dances are important for like, oh yeah, a group of people. Yeah, how did they all do it together? Right, I'm not buying that. Perfectly synchronized. I'm not buying that. I'm not buying that. I'm glad Stanford is doing a study on that because somebody needs to be doing a study on that. Look, if we don't come to terms with the reality that there are legions of demonic entities, of all shapes, all sizes, all color, all genders, all of them just trying to break through the veil, get into our dimension, get us dancing, get us dreaming, it's fucked up. Yeah, I can't even imagine it really. I mean, I can't either and it's sad that you're tempted. Oh, I'm so tempted. I've actually started practicing a little bit in front of a mirror at night. Okay, I know, that's what I'm thinking. I was almost scared to tell you that but I've literally dug in, I've been practicing. I stand probably 10 feet away from the mirror to get a real good view of the room and I can look smaller in the mirror but yeah. What dance are you working on? It's one where you start out where you're kind of smiling and you kind of bob back and forth on either leg and then you start moving your right arm some. Sounds impossible. You start moving your right arm now that I'm thinking about it like a snake a little bit and then that's what kind of got me and then you start moving your left arm and then they start doing these things where they're moving their body and it's looking like they're popping and locking and yeah, I practice that. I practice it for 30 minutes past couple nights. Are you getting better? A little bit. You really, you gotta watch out. But I need to stop it sounds like. I just watched the New Ted Bundy documentary on HBO Max and I don't think people even knew that he was doing dances before like his family was really concerned because they'd walk in on him and he'd be working on like a dance and guess what? Here's a big surprise. Shocker, the dance from the documentary all the kids are now doing it on TikTok. See, people don't know that. People need to know that. They need to be getting rid of TikTok not because of China spying potentially. It is because of that demonic stuff. Yeah, people don't know that about Ted Bundy. I'd heard that in passing the other day that people thought he was looking at porn or something but yeah, it was really the dances he was doing. He was looking at the porn because I guess like the way that people were fucking in the magazines would inspire dances in it. I see. That was the only reason. She is a little creative. I'm not gonna give him any credit for that but it is, what a wild mind that is. That's a wild mind. I mean, look, not everyone, I guess he's not all bad. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I don't look, if I'm looking at porn it's not for the like sex. Right, I'm looking for milk, dominatrix sometimes, hand jobs, a lot of hand jobs. That's the most accurate thing. Edging hand jobs. And then sometimes it's only penis and I'm like, uh, William, what are you watching? What's going on here? I mean, but you learn a lot from the penises. So without a doubt, that's why I watch them. You learn a lot about architecture. You learn a lot about like physics. You learn a lot about blood pressure stuff. Blood pressure stuff for sure. I found out I had high blood pressure. I'm about to actually start getting high blood pressure medicine but I found that from one of the videos. How? Not that long ago. How? I was just watching it and then the guy in the video said something about, hold on, y'all have to stop. My chest is hurting. And I was actually realizing at that moment that my chest was kind of hurting. And I thought, this is too much of a coincidence. Something has had, what is, why am I hearing my heart beating in my ear? Is this a blood pressure problem? Then I did a WebMD thing and sure enough, I think it was a... Yeah, I diagnosed myself with thyroid stuff from watching bisexual porn. Cause I was like watching it. I was doing a study on Vincendio, Diego, the... Ooh, Mr. Diego. Yeah, incredible violinist. And I just wanted to know what world he lived in. So I'm watching that and I'm getting an erection. So I go to the doctor. I bring the porn I was looking at. It's smart. It's a heterosexual male. Why would I be getting off on this? And he, he's like a thyroid. His thyroid. Checked everything. Checked my prostate. Like multiple tests on that. That's in your bottom. Yeah. And he was... Could he tell you had been doing the blood plug stuff up there when he was up there? Yeah, I had one in. It probably helps with getting checked down there cause it's already so kind of open up. Kinda. I would imagine. Yeah. And he was like thrilled cause I already had, I had like put a special one in for like with his picture on the base of it. And he thought it was so funny. You're probably the best patient he had had. He loves being... He's still laying out. We like, we go out, we do like all kinds of stuff. I've been helping him like work around his house. He's cool. That's always fun meeting a doctor friend like that at the hospital. Wasn't at the hospital. Oh, it wasn't. No, I don't get, I do not. I found him on Craigslist. Oh, cool. Yeah, I've heard of people. Finding healthcare professionals on Craigslist. Yeah. Yeah. He didn't have to use any equipment at all. He was just able to like from examining, yeah, from like examining me thoroughly, you know, over the course of a weekend, he like determined it's like some kind of thyroid thing. And that's how you know it's a good doctor if it's multi-day thing where they're able to watch. Multi-day, multi-night. Watch you win, yeah. Check my sperm count. Ooh. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, thyroid thing. What does that make your eyes pop out of your head kinda? Have you seen those people where it looks like their eyes are popping out of their head? Is that a thyroid issue? Yeah, it's either, it goes one or two ways. Either your eyes start bulging out of your head or you get like very powerful erections when you're watching by porn. By porn. Yeah, if you're straight. I was thinking maybe I had that as well, but it's just maybe my eyes popping out of my head. Just for my eyes, I hope it's so big when I'm watching that. Yeah. And stuff you're describing. It's just, I mean, there's erectile tissue in your eyes. That, well, that would make sense. Cause yeah, I mean, it's like, I can't, I'm blinking probably once in a couple minutes, yeah. Yeah, that's thyroid. Yeah, and your eyes get all dry, but you can't blink. You can't shut your eyes. You can't. You can't look away. Yeah, like a typical like gay or bisexual man, and they're watching that. They can blink, they can look away. They'll get up and get a coffee, which I can't even fathom. Cause when I'm watching it, it is all hands on deck, all eyes on screen. It's like, I'm not, I'm blinking once. By the way, that's so funny. You mentioned all hands on deck because that was what I was watching. Oh my gosh, you've seen that. Yes. All hands on deck. Yeah. That's a classic. Oh my gosh. It's so, so good, man. For folks who haven't seen it and again, like, look, don't be afraid to watch this stuff because you're straight. Don't be afraid. And I know why a lot of people don't want to watch like straight porn movies is cause the plots suck. All hands on deck is like, it's reminiscent of. There will be blood. There will be blood. The abyss. The abyss. It's like a combo of there will be blood and the abyss. It's like, you know, early America, they're looking for oil. They break through into some kind of subterranean. Yeah. I don't want to spoil it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's weird. There's other stuff down there. There's a lot of stuff down there. There's a lot of stuff down there. There's a lot to deal with down there. Yeah, they have to handle so many things to like get the oil, to get to the oil. Yeah. Goblins. Goblins, ghouls, demons. And the tests that pass each of the gates to get to the oil. Ooh, they get hotter. Hotter and hotter and hotter. The higher gate you get to. That last gate. Woo. Yeah. Yeah, we don't need to give any spoilers, but that is, it's like something I've never seen. I didn't blink at all watching that part. I was just as hard as a rock. I mean, that was before I was taking my, the medication my doctor prescribes to me. Oh, that was just right before? Just a little before when you were watching that? Well, I was testing the medication to see if it was working. And actually, it didn't really work, man. It's like, it didn't work. Just not even a placebo, with the fact just nothing was working with it? Nothing. And you know, some of my family is a doctor and I did mention to them, do poppers treat thyroid disorders? And he was like, yeah, usually they do. But my doctor said, just keep doing poppers when you're watching this stuff and it will eventually, you'll like. Yeah. And for those listening, we're not talking about the things you get around July 4th that you throw on the ground and pop on the ground. We're not talking about those. No, that might, I wouldn't be surprised. I mean, that would at least distract you. Or something like that. No, this is the poppers. I don't even like the name. It's video head cleaner is a better name for it. It's like the same stuff, I guess you used to use to clean VCRs and nobody realized it was a thyroid. Is that really what you have? Yeah, cleaning VCRs and stuff. Yeah, poppers sounds like a. It sounds like a cereal or something. Or a street drug, cereal poppers. It just sounds, I don't like that. It's video head cleaner. Yeah. Video cassette cleaner. Video cassette cleaner. Medicine. It's like medicine. So how are you liking Cleveland? We forgot to say folks, we're out here in Cleveland doing stand up and we're in a hotel room right now looking out. It's like one of these. I don't know what this is. It's like it's kind of weird. Every once while you land in a hotel that is a mall or something like it looks out on a, I don't know what it looks like. We're inside of a giant Zeppelin balloon or something. Like a steam punky looking. Some of the designs look like that. Yeah, and there's a wedding. People are getting married down there tonight. People are getting married. A beautiful bride was getting her picture taken across from my hotel. And I could see the plug coming out of her. She was tripping. Yeah, I could see that. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, like it's amazing how much this is catching on. And it's thrilling. Like you just want to find the reason that things are off a little bit. I know. Yeah, one of the bridesmaids, I saw it. It was kind of, she was a little embarrassed, I could tell. But one of the bridesmaids was like, started pulling at her own dress like, look, look. And then you can tell the plug was up there. Her dress was coming up a little because of the plug. Yeah, I could tell some of them, it was like first, second time, third time. You can always tell. Walking like a penguin, just walking where you're at walk. Yeah, yeah, but it's the walk of healing. Yeah, it is. And yeah, I really hope that y'all look into it because the, I think 90% of the problems in the world that are happening right now are from unplugged leaders. Without a doubt, just stick one in in the morning time. Like at the beginning, I mean, I'm still so brand new to it, but at the beginning I was like, what do you do it in the afternoon, the evening? It's like, just put it in the morning, get it really cold overnight. Is what I've totally learned from you. Yeah, yeah. Get it super cold and then put it in in the morning. You put it in, I recommend if you're a hot sleeper, put a cold one in. Do it in the night before you go to sleep. And you will sleep like a baby. Whoa, cause I get super hot when I sleep at night. I always have to get the covers off of me. I'm a real hot sleeper. It cools you down. And then in the morning, you can take coffee grinds and just spit on it, dump or put it, I put it in the coffee bag, pull it out and then. Put that up there. Oh, and that's like drinking a cup of coffee. Yeah, you will wake up. That's probably super power. That's probably powerful. Clear as a bell. Woo, Abe Lincoln used to do that. Really? Yeah. He used to do that in the morning with like a wooden dowel. Damn. I know. That's why his teeth were brown. I think it can affect like the enamel in your teeth. It will. If you put too much coffee up there, so be kind of careful. Yeah, there's a connection. But you know, there's definitely, if you use ethically sourced coffee, that won't happen.

Okay, like for me, the OBI, I think that's a good answer. The reason his teeth got like that was because he was getting his coffee from George Washington. Yeah, you don't get your coffee from George Washington. You're the number one slave owner. That's an awful coffee. Yeah, that sounds like a nightmare. Ooh, what kind of, do you care if I have one of those? I don't know. I have a, do you wanna, ooh, do you wanna switch one? I have a coffee one. Do you wanna see what a coffee mint tastes like? Yeah. How many do you put in your mouth? What? How many do you put in your mouth at a time? Three. Uh-uh. Guys, we're doing these lip beetle things to everybody since you know. It's the Galexa dinorius green beetle. But a lot of people are using these to quit nicotine because they create almost the exact same experience as nicotine. Whoa, that's a big one. Look at that. Jesus, God, those things look dangerous. I would not wanna run into these things when they hadn't been dried. Ooh, I just put a mint and coffee. Let's see how this goes. Hmm. So, William, it has been the coolest thing touring around with you, man. You are so funny. Yeah, well, it's been such a pleasure. I'm glad you haven't minded it. I'm glad it's been all right. It's been such a pleasure. It's so, it's so fun. You are not only, you're killing it when you perform, but the audiences, they know you. Like, they're excited when you get on stage. Like, you clearly have this kind of homegrown, which is the best kind, momentum happening. What, why? Where is that coming from? I don't know. I mean, it could be from my dance videos on TikTok. Like, I've been able to get a bunch of fun. No, I'm kidding. It could be. Could be. I know, that's why I gotta get better at it. I don't know. It's all the Kill Tony stuff. Kill Tony has been such a pleasure. I think that's 100%. People just would know me from that. It seems like there's people in all the places. It seems like there's normally some nice people in all the places. Last night I met, I was starstruck. There's a dude who does a YouTube page called Gas Station Encounters. And I was thinking about going there today and acting like I was stealing shit out of the thing, but I just slept in and I didn't go do it. How many people are robbing that guy that he has a YouTube channel about it? That's what I asked him. He said it's heavy editing, but yeah, I don't know. Now people know about it, so less people are stealing out of his Gas Station south of Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah, it's funny. Like just shop lifters and stuff? Shop lifters, people stealing liquor, people stealing candy bars, just all kinds of bullshit. But he's so funny where he dubs his voice over it and he's so funny, it was fun to talk to him for probably an hour last night after the thing. We went to some bar and then there were a bunch of weirdos in there I was talking to. No, I'm kidding, people were nice. But yeah, oh my gosh, it's been fun. And Kansas City was fun, that's the last place we were, but I have liked it. I personally have liked it here a little better. Kansas City was great though, but just this hotel has been fun and the Indians or the Guardians or whatever their first game was yesterday. So there was fun walking around and just tons of people being out. There's another game tonight, so we'll see. I wonder if like drunk people or people will come to like the second show since the stadium is literally right by the comedy. Flooded with baseball people, flooded. Like the streets just flooded with baseball people. It's a sports town. I didn't know what to expect. I've never been here before, I had no idea what to expect. Actually, you know, my expectations were sort of not good because I think I'd heard the armpit of America thing that you hear about it. Oh, it's Cleveland, Ohio. Yeah, somebody here, by the way, that's not, I didn't make that up. Somebody here was like, you know, it's the armpit. But I think we came in good weather. Yes, it's been cold, but sunny, which is very nice. Kansas City was cold and raining that first night. Remember, it just felt like... Yeah, it was dreary. A dreary, yeah, it was kind of a, which just happens, obviously, I guess, but yeah, it generally doesn't, but there it felt kind of dreary. I mean, like, it's a big part of America. Is dreary half the year? Half the year, it's gray and dead and rainy and shitty. Like, you forget that when you're living in Texas because we have like a pretty mild winter. It still gets a little dreary. It hasn't been bad. In LA, it's like... I know, I went to, I think I texted you yesterday, I'd never been to an MLB game before, but I had, because I went to a couple of the LA games and that just made me realize how nice that weather was because I was walking around, thinking about going to the game yesterday and it was just like fucking freezing cold. And I was like, I'm sure in LA, the first game there, it's just probably wonderful weather. Yeah, beautiful. Stalled at a time. Now, you spent time in LA. Three years, so a little bit. So you were doing stand-up in LA for three years? Yes. Where were you performing? At the very beginning, just a bunch of open mics. There was this wonderful, when I was living in Hollywood with Angie Hernandez, some girl I met off Craigslist, and then there was some good open mic at a place called Next Stage Theater and they had a liquor store underneath it and you could bring your own alcohol into the Next Stage Theater. So I go there and just get wasted and do a bunch of shows. It was just a bunch of open mics and then slowly getting on some shows. And then at the beginning, I went to the comedy store because I heard that was the place to go. I'd obviously heard of the comedy store, but I wasn't overly familiar with it at all, but I totally heard of it. And I signed up for the Kill Tony thing and then I was like, fuck this, I'll never get on it, just because so many people were signing up. And I started going to some open mic by... That's where you met Tony? Kill Tony? You just met him? That's where I met him. Whoa, that's so wild, man. Yeah, just from that. Well, I stopped signing up for Kill Tony and I started going, this lady who was in porn, because I looked her up on time and she sure enough was in porn. She was doing some open mic at some bar on Hollywood Boulevard. And I was going at that and it just sucked. And I was like, ah, the comedy store seems fun. I'll just fucking go back there. And then literally the first time I go there, I had a 12 pack of PBR in my backpack because that was my go-to move, was taking alcohol into wherever I was going because I didn't want to buy the drinks. And I had to act like I got a phone call and I left and hit all the beers in a bush. But I was that close probably from getting kicked out of that fucking place just at the very beginning. Wow, it scared me a little bit. What a crazy time we're in, man. When you think about the normal trajectory of a comic, like how it would work in the old days is you would, like when I first came to LA, people were still using pagers. Yeah, yeah. So you would get a commercial agent and you'd have this pager and it would buzz you and then you'd have to go to a pay phone and you'd call your agent and he'd give you an address for some commercial audition. Then people had these things called Thomas Guides. Do you remember those? No, what is that? So a Thomas guide was like some way you could flip through and it would give you directions to where you wanted to go. It's a map, it's like a big book, but it's like constructed to be- Oh yes. I think I know what you're talking about. So all the comics had Thomas Guides in their trunks or in their glove boxes or seats and they would get pages from their commercial agent go on the audition after reading the Thomas guide and then during that time you were like, oh, just praying you book a commercial and then if you could book a commercial that would go on your tape. That's what everyone, I regret it so much. People would send these audition tapes to the comedy store and there were just piles and piles and piles of people auditioning in front of their camcorders, doing standup in front of their camcorders. How long would a typical thing be just all different lengths? Just depended on how insane the person was. Oh yeah. Some of them would be like really long, some would be short, but I don't know what happened to those tapes, man. I just- Did you watch them? Cause you were the talent person at the comedy store at one point, were you watching stuff like that? Well, it didn't matter. It wouldn't have mattered if the funniest person on earth did stand up in front of a camcorder. It's not, it's gonna seem like 3% is funny. And not only that, it didn't matter because Mitzi didn't give a shit. She's not watching tapes. Like you have to come there and get in front of her. That was the only way in, but like the roadmap to success as a comic in those days was so limited. Your options were so fucking limited and it produced horrific imbalances in power. Like club owners are still powerful, but in those days, God, they had so much juice because like the comedy store, the improv, the laugh factory, if they didn't like you, where are you gonna- Right, what would you do? You gotta get an agent, you want an agent. You get the agent, the agent's gonna help you maybe get on the tonight show or get on some TV show, get on the TV show, get some fame, then you could sell tickets and that's how it worked. And so in those days, comics would go out on the road and they would leave like cards on the table to get people to put their emails in. Oh. And they would create email lists of every state that they went to so they could send out email blast to let people know- When they were coming into town. That they were coming. Yeah, and then Dane Cook used MySpace, figured it out and started promoting himself through MySpace and like all the comics watched. What is that, mid 2000s or something? Yeah, I guess so, yeah. I can't get over the map thing. I'm just thinking my dumb ass, I'm so addicted to my map thing on my phone, even though I've been in Austin now for almost two years, I still look up directions to a lot of places where you pretty good at using the map. No, yeah, that sounds horrible. I'm not great with directions. Like I rely 100% on my phone to get most places. I don't even remember how the fuck I got around back then to be honest, like I can't believe I did. Like it's crazy. And like I remember when cell phones started getting popular and affordable, like I can remember one of my friends got a, like the first cell phone in our friendship group and another of my friends like nicknamed him constant contact and was like making fun of him because he had a cell phone. Like really you think you need to have a cell phone? You think you really need that? You need to, you're doing so great. You just must, everyone's calling you all the time. Like, and we would laugh, it just seemed so funny. Why would you get a cell phone? And now they are everywhere and everybody's always on their cell phone all the time. Yeah. Everywhere. But like, you know, I don't think comics like us, I don't think we would have had the success that we've had in those days. Like, yeah, I mean, I would 100% and I was very prepared. Like for the past six months I was living, I was living in Denver for three years in the NLA for three years in the final six months. I was in Denver, I was wearing some stupid neck brace every time I went on stage. And it was fun. I was able to kind of develop a character doing that. So when he called me up, I think I had done a little cocaine that night and I was totally drinking some, but I had my, I heard my name and I just had my neck brace in my backpack and I strapped it on and it was like putting on my Superman cape. Not really, but kind of, I was prepared though. I was ready for it, but it's been, yeah, I have everything to owe up to this point to getting on that show and Tony's ass be a nice. I mean, it is so cool. It's, to me, that's, it's the best thing ever because those gatekeeper models, even though that is a gatekeeper model, but it's a meritocracy gatekeeper model. It's random. If your name gets called and you go out there. But like the, when you get these gatekeepers positioned, like they used to be at the entrance to where you had to go, if you wanted to sell tickets, if you wanted to be a comic, it warps people and it produces a very bizarre politic around it. Like, I could only imagine, I'm sure. Because then it's like friends of the gatekeepers become, and what if they're not all that funny or right? What if they're annoyed with you? What if you- What if one of them doesn't like you, then you're screwed. Then they go and talk to the gatekeeper. Yeah. And they'll throw you under the fucking bus, man. Like they would- I believe it. That would, the comedy story that system was in place, like, you know, it's your big showcase. It's like kill Tony in a way. And the sense that just to get in front of her, you were on a wait list that could be as long as like six months. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. What was that? Once a week, people would perform in front of the mixer? But she was getting sick. So like, she would stop being once a week and became like the once a month or twice a month. And then it, and then, you know, you would showcase for, and she would like ask you to come back. She wouldn't give you anything, but she'd want to see you again. And or- How many people would be showcasing like for that show when they told you to come back? Like, how many people are doing that? How many people would she normally talk to after the fact? She'd totally depend on that. Very rare that you would talk to anybody. Oh, whoa. You know, but so you've been waiting for this, but also you've been hanging out the comedy story you pissed off the wrong person. So you get up there to do your showcase and the comic you pissed off would go up to Mitzi and start talking to her. Distracting her from watching you. And then you would have to like start the whole process over again. And so it was terrible. So that was really happening to people where somebody would do shit like that? Oh yeah. Yikes. Yeah, that would be stressful. People would do shit like that, man. They would. Like, it's the craziest thing. You know, I don't, you don't see it. Do you hold grudges? You don't seem like you hold grudges. No, not really. I mean, no, I generally, luckily feel like I don't have too many enemies. There's maybe, yeah, that's where I will keep it. Yeah, I mean, I can't, nothing's popping into my head. Yeah, I don't. You know, like, I think it's normal to be annoyed with people. It's normal that people you avoid. Yes, there are probably some people, not many, but there's probably a couple of people I avoid. But some people, they're not like that. They're not like, I'm just gonna avoid that person. That was annoying. That person's a dick. Yeah. They're like, I'm going to destroy that person's life because it's my job, because I've been slighted, and they will do shit that you see on a soap opera. And those people, they thrived in that gatekeeper environment. Imagine, because you meet nice people doing comedy, but you totally meet. There's a bunch of characters too, especially at lower level or any level, but you meet some characters. And you don't know who you're meeting. Like, that's the other thing. Like, you might meet somebody, and you don't even realize you've offended them. You don't even, or maybe you're drunk. That's the problem. That's what was happening to me personally at the comedy store. I think I kind of worried people at times at that place. When did you quit drinking? Two years ago in May. Wow, man. What about you? It's been a little while for you, Hadner. It has, it's almost a year. Nice. Yeah, I remember we were in Phoenix or some, or Denver, and there was a bottle of- I have to look it up. Yeah. Something, there was a bottle of like vodka, and you were- Denver's where I was, Denver, I was drinking still. But Denver, it was after Denver when I realized, like, this is not sustainable. I can't, if I'm going to be going on the road a lot. Yeah, could you imagine like, of woken up today and woken up? Why couldn't I say that? Woken up. Could you imagine being all hungover? I don't miss that at all. Every now and again, like, if I'm socializing, I'm like, ah, maybe it'd be fun to be drinking some beer, but it's like, I would have continued to drink beer last night, I'm sure, and- It's just too easy. Yeah, you can just buy it right there. You get so hammered if you're not careful, and it's fun, and you feel like, because you are around people who are partying, it's fun, it's their night out. Every time, right. But you, they're doing it, theoretically, that's not every, that's not their job. Imagine any other job where you were drinking like that. We should be drinking for free if we wanted to, and it looks like they had a very nice beer selection. I know, I know. We'd be drinking a beer right now, I'd have some here. We'd be slurping back booze before the shop. I know. Yeah, I mean, some people can do it, I just can't. Like some people- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Successfully drink, like their metabolism and their DNA lets them do it, I just- Yeah, I can't. I can't do it. Neither can I, I had a pretty good run, and I had some fun times, but then yeah, it just was too much. Right, if I would have, right, if I was still drinking, which I can't even imagine at this point, right, I'm sure I would be drinking right now. I'm sure I would have been drinking pretty heavily before the shit yesterday, and then there's a very good chance. I probably wouldn't have been going out with your ass in the first place, because I probably would have bothered you, because I think I was bothering people when I'd be drinking at shit. But it just wouldn't have been sustainable, because you know, just even last night, I'm sure the show's wouldn't have gone great. I don't know. Well, that's the thing, is like you don't even realize what you're missing out on, because you don't- You just had no idea, right? You're just torching bridges. You didn't even know it was a bridge. Yeah. You're just incinerating bridges. For sure. And you think, when you're drink, when you're alcoholic, when you're drinking, your mindset is usually one of like, you have to reframe it at first. So you reframe it into thinking, well, I'm a rebel, or this is a, you know, a wildlife, man. I'm the party guy. I'm the party guy. So you start painting this picture of yourself. It isn't what's happening at all. You're the guy who is like hard to understand when they talk. Right. You're the gay and articulate guy moaning in the corner, are saying shit that doesn't make sense, that you're getting offended when people are like, what, what? Yeah, I know. But some people can pull it off. I don't want to seem like a fucking prude. I mean, look, yeah, yeah, I don't give a shit. And I'm kind of high right now. I bought a funny bag of weed from one of the guys when I got here. You can say what you're actually, so he's on fentanyl. Yeah, I'm on fentanyl right now. But yeah, that's the other thing about it. It's like fentanyl, it's so much cheaper than booze. Yeah, super cheap. And it's so much more powerful. Yes, just a tiny grain. I just do a grain. Dude, there's no fucking way I would have the butt plug the size of what I have inside of me right now with just beer. Fair enough. Yeah, yeah, I mean, you probably have to be pretty relaxed. Completely relaxed. Completely relaxed. That is where you could injure yourself because I can bear myself to like, I'm like the Alex Honnold of butt plugs. Like the free climber, you know? Oh yeah, the free climber. Yeah, because like what I'm doing, it would kill us. So with something that big, do you just stick it on the ground and slowly sit on it? Are you putting it in with your hands? Or how does that work? I jump onto it now. Okay, okay. Because the slow thing, like there's too much room for error. You're basically just, it's mitigating risk. So it's like, slow, okay. I understand there's a lot of people out there on the circuit who are doing slow insertions. Yeah, they're just each their own. And that's a classic way of doing it. The slow insertion. Insertion, slow. But there's so many like opportunities for error. Twitch of the hand. And then something inside of you is getting hurt or... Yeah. Did you ever see that video of the guy, the horse having sex with the guy? Mr. Hands. Mr. Hands. Mr. Hands. You don't want it that long. You can get it wide, but not that long. Cause that what ruptured is insides or something. Yeah. And like a lot of us pros watching that, when you're seeing it, you're just like, man, that could easily get up and prevent it. Yeah. Just horrified. And just in that dusty old barn, it's like get into a better location. Why are you literally... Barns are great for... Barns are okay. Yeah. A lot of people love going into a barn to insert. And it seems super realist. I mean, it was... Yeah. It was real. Yeah, yeah. You could tell from the noise he made. Like that was the noise of someone who had been mortally wounded. Like that's what was so fucked up about it is you heard this sound. Oh, I was like, ah. I can't remember. It was like, I think we all remember it differently. I don't know if you find that video anymore. We probably all remember it. I remember it more like a... Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. This is something like that. Oh. Oh. And that, you know, shows me like, yeah, you're not a pro. You don't know what you're doing. Yeah. In-breath, when it... Insert, in-breath. Insert, in-breath. Insert, in-breath. Take it out, breathe it out. Take it out, breathe it out. Yeah. Yeah, but he was out-breathing on an insert and that is automatically dangerous. That'll do it, because you're tighter down there on the out-breath. Exactly. Exactly. It's just so preventable. It was a tragedy studied. A lot of people in the Alliance studied it and... So some people at Stanford again? I think it was... No, it's the Insertion Alliance of North America. It's just like professional. Where are they out of again? It's... China. China, okay. It's the North American branch. It's weird they're allowed to do that. What? Oh, or is it American people in China too? Why are you so against China? I don't know, it's after the TikTok thing. I swear, I've been trying to do those dances. I don't know, because I can't do the dances and now it sounds like maybe I don't need to. This whole thing, everyone's so afraid of Chinese surveillance. Yeah, it's like, what are they actually... They're just gonna watch me looking at my weird shit on my phone. It's like, right. But no, I don't think so. They're gonna get... They get a lot of data from you that is very useful for the CCP. It helps the country. It's like, look, I love America so much. But China, wonderful country. And wonderful people. And most importantly, a wonderful government. Yeah. Honestly, it's like, if you're gonna have a government surveil you and your children, which one do you want? America or China? China. Yeah. China. I know, I know, I know. I agree. I send to the CCP at the end of the day a journal of what I did all day. That's nice. What is that, like an email address or something you're sending it to? Yeah. Chinesesurveillance.com. .com. Yeah. I've heard of that. Yeah. I send a daily journal of what I ate, like how much water I'm drinking, weird thoughts I add, everything. Well, that's sweet of you. I'm sure they appreciate it. I have a very high social credit score there. Oh, so if you do end up going, you could immediately... I would get in what, probably get like not necessarily the front of the line for the trains, but I would get closer to the front. I know, isn't that a main part of their social currency is the line for the trains? You get closer up in the line. Getting in the train. Just get it, just even get a gun. Getting in the train, you know, everything is based on that score. Are there trains like the ones in India where the people are hanging on on the outside? No, they shoot those people off. Oh, okay. Yeah, they probably wouldn't be allowed to do this. No. Oh my God. No. I worked with some Chinese people when I worked up in the Tetons. And one guy was George, who we got to be buddies. He spoke pretty good English. And on July 4th, we were all sleeping in these dorms and I heard this weird crunching noise and I go up to George. I'm like, hey, what are you eating? And he was eating ribs, but he's eating the bones. And I was like, George, don't eat the bones, dude. Yeah, he was like gnawing on the bone, crunching it. I was like, I don't think you're supposed to eat the bone, man. Holy shit. And I don't know if that's all Chinese people or just George. It's probably just George. It's probably just George. I know, I know. He was hungry. It was funny. I would not, what are you, I just wouldn't even imply anything bad about any podcast ever again. No, I totally agree. It's probably just George. You should apologize. I apologize. To the Chinese Communist Party. I apologize, Chinese Communist Party. To the Chinese. I apologize to the Chinese Communist Party. I meant to say it's probably only George who eats the rib bones. And I'm very sorry. Not everybody. I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry. It's just today has been a rough day for me. It's just today has been a really rough day for me. I'm very upset. I'm very upset. At the United States government. At the United States government. said they would do. Said they would do. Military Intervention. Military intervention. If there were a Chinese invasion. If there were a Chinese invasion. Of Taiwan. Of Taiwan. Taiwan, of course. Taiwan, of course. Is part of mainland China. Is part of mainland China. And has always been. and has always been. Let me reiterate that I'm very sorry. Let me reiterate that I am very sorry. And I will never say anything like that again. And I will never say anything like that again. Thank you God. Thank you God. William, it's been great having you on the show man.

Well, I'm sitting at home, playing music on my phone, thinking about the book of revelations, spraying down my groceries to prevent contamination. A few weeks ago, I was in my car not thinking much about it. But now I pay for one more day driving around in LA traffic. I'm the future wearer about the thing that brought civilization to its knees. They'll sell a bat, somebody ate a bat. Hi, pals. It's me, Duncan. I hope this finds you in good health, good spirits. I hope that you are not slowly going insane and quarantine. I'm not. I'm doing great. We'll be right back after this. This episode of the DDFH is brought to you by Blue Chew.

It's a fascinating thing to just notice how weird the energy is right now, how things can go from completely normal, basically, to being really sinister. For example, I stepped on a piece of glass the other day and got a piece of glass in my foot. And it got a little infected. And we didn't have any tweezers. And instead of just being a kind of normal, well, I'll just go to the store, get some tweezers, pull the glass out of my foot. The whole thing turned into like a weird mini-mental drama. You know, like, oh, fuck. I'm going to have to put the mask on, put some gloves on, head out into the wastelands, get some tweezers. And then hopefully, I'll be able to pull the glass out of my foot. But what if I get an infection? I don't want to go to the doctor right now. I don't want to inhale some pestulent sneeze. I don't want somebody blowing their doom cough all over my face, just walking down the street, you know, with the baby. And I'm so attuned to coughs right now. I don't know if you are. But like, I can hear a cough 100 miles away, saw some guy up ahead cough into his army, completely did the thing you're supposed to do, the cough into the crook of your arm thing. But still, I got a little pissed, you know, just thinking like, what are you doing out? Where are you out? You got a cough. You got to stay inside. You got to quarantine yourself. But you know, this guy, he's working. He probably has a family he's got to support, you know? And who knows, most, it probably isn't the disease. But the, just the attunement to the potentiality of getting this very brand new sickness is so interesting to experience, like how locked in the mind can get locked in to things when survival is involved, especially when now I've got a kid. Like, I think even without a kid, I would be, you know, flipped out. But having a baby like seems to really amplify the survival quality of it all, which is why I feel so lucky to have friends like David Nickturn. I need friends like this, because otherwise I'll burrow. Without someone like David Nickturn in my life, I would probably just find a shovel and just start digging into the ground and just burrow into a hole, just the right size for my body. Just kind of pull some loose dirt over my face and just lay there in the soil and wait for this thing to pass. Fuck it, let the dog shit and piss all over me, who cares? Just lay in the grass and the dirt and just wait for this to end. But thank goodness I have friends like Nickturn, who keep me above ground. We need this, we need a stabilizing element. Right now I'm trying to like not, because I'm in quarantine with my wife and like we've got a time out when we freak out so that we don't freak out at the same time. That's the main thing. If you gotta like sort of like make sure that if you're gonna have a mild freak out or a major freak out that you're the only one doing it. So you wanna, like if you're in a roommate situation, if you're married, if you're in a relationship, if you're with another person, the only bit of advice that I could offer you, and this isn't even, I didn't even think of this, a friend of mine, I was talking to him, gave me this advice. He said, pretty much anytime anyone's freaking out, it's okay. Not that it's not okay to freak out, but right now everybody gets a hall pass for freaking out. So if somebody's like annoying the shit out of you or if you feel guilty, because maybe you're annoying the shit out of somebody, don't beat yourself up right now. Give yourself a freak out hall pass. Have a pocket full of them. Make, write it out on notebook paper and just pass them out. The next time somebody you love is feeling a little weird. Because why wouldn't you feel weird right now? You're supposed to feel weird right now. There's not a, if you can find a reason to not feel weird right now, congratulations. But this is the dawning of the age of weird, man. Like we're in the, you can't go to the grocery store without passing people in surgical. Like they're about to go do his fucking surgery. They got a cart full of hummus. It's fucking weird. People in galoshes and rubber rain suits and goggles with weird BDSM gloves. Gloves are kind of sexy weirdly. Is that weird? I like to wear latex gloves. That's one of, that's just weird by itself. I like strapping on surgical gloves and go into whole foods and dramatically looking for grits. Cause the baby loves grits. One thing's for certain, the pandemic has not silenced my poodle. I'm gonna, I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go take care of something. I should have taken care of a long time ago. And when I get back, we'll jump into the podcast. Gatsby, Gatsby, we're running. Here's some good news. CBD is legal. In this episode of the DTFH has been supported by feels.

If you are looking for an actual kind of stable, balancing, energetic pattern to calm you down during this thing, then this conversation, I think, could serve that purpose. It certainly helped me, though I'm sad to say the effects have sort of worn off, which means I should probably give Nickturn a call after I finish uploading this thing. Regardless, everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast, David Nickturn. David back. It's the Duncan sections. David. Welcome back, to the DTFH, Mr. Nickturn. Who would have thought that we would be recording this during a pandemic? Who would have thought that this is where our conversation with Landis is in a pandemic? You know, like of all the things I would have predicted for us as far as podcasting goes, it wouldn't be under these circumstances. Well, Duncan, first of all, thank you for having me back. But I just want to say that it seems clear that the entire time we were heading exactly to this point. How? Inevitably. You mean in the sense that we knew that eventually there was going to be another pandemic? Well, pandemic or something. So because we're in our conversations, we're sort of including the improbable as part of the ponderable, right? Right. So, and this is probably not that unpredictable, right? We've had these before. People who are tracking these kind of things projected this would happen sooner or later. And here we are in the midst of it. And so I think I've been talking to different people about what their view is of the situation. So what's yours? Well, it's that part I agree with. I knew and I've been told by various people and read in books that it's an inevitability. Pandemics are just one of the many global catastrophes that happen. We get pandemics, we get meteor impacts, which are hopefully rarer than pandemics. We get world wars. There's a variety of global catastrophe that we can expect. So my view is, yeah, this is normal, but it's abnormal for us, for most of us, in the sense that we, I guess we got really lucky because it's been a long time since we've had, I guess they're comparing this to 1918 or something. That was the last global pandemic, right? The Spanish. So we don't have the, my generation and your generation, we don't have a, in our memory banks, anything to compare this to, only historical things that we can compare it to. Sure, and another factor is, of course, in the United States, which is where we are, you're in LA and I'm in New York. We're not, that used to having reality come back to us so much in our face, you know? Like war, even the world wars didn't happen here, you know? So I think we have, in terms of the Buddhist view, we were living in a sort of God realm kind of situations, pretty padded and for many people, they don't have to worry too much day-to-day. And that is shifting a little bit and this is making it obvious that there's some kind of shift and that we have to face the music of cause and effect. You know, and this facing the music thing, I think, and particularly is melting the brains of the most privileged members of Western society, because if you're living in the United States and you're a certain demographic, you're a certain race, you're a certain income bracket, you're worrying a lot every day, but now this thing has essentially saturated all classes, all races, all religions. Everything is being affected by this. So it's like the realm of the gods is a great way to put it and even within the realm of the gods, I imagine, there's another realm of the gods. Like, you think, sure. And it's, and this is sweeping through the entirety of it, which is really fascinating to watch, you know, like Fox News pundits freak out because this is touching them and they don't know who do you get mad at? Like, who are you pissed at? Who can you lash out at? You know, a virus, who are you gonna get mad at? What can you do? It's, this is anyone could be affected by this. Yeah. Oh my God, has there ever been a better time for watching TV in the history of humanity than right now during a pandemic? Much thanks to my friends at Shutter for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. There's lots of options out there for you to stream stuff, but Shutter has got a gourmet selection of some of the best horror movies out there. I love horror movies and Shutter, whoever is putting these movies together understands horror. If you're somebody like me that grew up on Fangoria and Stephen King, if you're somebody like me that has a deep sentimental attachment to Creepshow, then Shutter is the network for you. These are real horror movies, not some bullshit squeezed out of a toothpaste attempt at being funny but scary horror movie crap. This is the real fucking deal, man. They've got the hills have eyes. I was just watching the hills have eyes. You wanna see some creepy shit? That one will get ya. Shutter, it's an amazing selection. You gotta try them out. If you love horror movies, they have a unique collection of exclusives and original films and series, horror classics and blockbuster hits, including the head Creepshow TV series that DDFH guest and a friend of mine, Rob Schropp, directed an episode of, which is incredible.

It's interesting to look at pictures of things. And one of the things I've been saying, Duncan, is that there's some element of a Rorschach test going on right now at a pretty big level, Rorschach. Which is that there's something happening and people are projecting different sort of views and versions of it based largely on their own perspective, their own way of looking at things. So it ranges from, oh, this is the enemy. There's a little virus, this little thing, this little tiny thing is some kind of military force that's invading. Up into, then you go to the other side of the spectrum, it's sort of the people saying this is sort of God's way of communicating certain kind of purification ritual for the human race. So everything in between. So you know me for years now, Duncan. You know, I like to just look at things and I try to look at it really cleanly or clearly. And the pictures that they're showing of it are really interesting. So I'm going like, well, what is this virus? What actually is it? You can make it clear what your projection is about what's happening. But the actual phenomenon itself is just this little thing with spikes on it that has the fantastic capacity to reproduce and to permeate all the porous boundaries which are porous to it, you know, which, because it's so small. And so it's going, the virus is going viral. It's something that in other situations, we say this is very good news. Information is getting out. Some kind of positive energy is going viral. A great song just went viral. But this thing in terms of the human host has a certain kind of symbiotic relationship that is, on the one hand, you could say dangerous. On the other hand, it's kind of intriguing because different people are responding it to so differently. Yeah. Well, you've, let's see, you got the apocalyptic people who are responding to it that these are the end times. You've got just the basic denial people. Yeah. Just a bunch of bullshit. I feel good. Shut the fuck up. I'm going to the beach. Then you, like the, I guess you could say validated preppers who are like, we've been saying this forever, y'all. Like, you thought we were crazy, huh? Thought I had too many cats, huh? No. Right, yeah. Don't have toxoplasmosis poisoning. I'm just aware of the fact that history shows certain patterns and in those patterns, empires collapse. And then you've got like scientists, my favorite is the scientists. Yeah. Because they are the ones who are like, I don't know. Yeah. And that was the, I was watching, because we love watching Fox News. I don't know why it's like this, it's just so vile and so hilarious and so edgy and dumb. It's just so funny to watch state media at that level. And, you know, Trump is pushing, and hopefully he's right, this old medication, I can't pronounce the name, chlorochlorosomethingqueen or something for the possible treatment. Hydrochloroquine. Hydrochloroquine. Wow. Yeah. And, which seems to have some effect. So, you know, they get this guy on who was incredibly sick in the hospital. They gave it to him the next day, he was totally fine. Sure. The scientists, the doctor, what do you all, who's like treating patients right now? And they said, well, what do you think about this? And the doctor's like, well, we don't know. It's so frustrating because he won that. Oh, it's a treatment, it's a cure, but they're like, well, we're not really sure. Yeah. If it is doing anything, because we don't have all the data yet. And that's what produces this, like, Rorschach ink block mirror. Whenever you have the unknown, this mirror forms, right? Yes. That's the Rorschach element. That's exactly it. So, Duncan, it reminds me a lot of days in the recording studio. You know, we would record like a big orchestra sometimes, you know, for a TV show or a movie or something like that. And you have maybe 50 or 60 musicians out there. You have the clients who are, you know, the ones who are producing whatever it is, commercial or TV show or whatever, five or six of those people. And then you have a timeline because the union requires a certain amount of, you know, after three hours, you're going to overtime. After that, you're going to double overtime. So that's a disaster if that happens. Right. So let's say it's 10, you're almost done, but it's 10 minutes now before the session, official time of the session runs out, you're going to overtime, and something's wrong with the gear, you know. Now, everybody's starting to freak out. Of course, the musicians are not necessarily freaking out because they might get paid more. Right. But the producers, the budget people, you know, are all freaking out. And who comes into the studio at that point, and they used to have these before you guys all had your own little digital workstations, and man, every aspect of it by yourself. Who comes in as the maintenance guy in the studio? And these people always had a certain type of personality, which was everybody's freaking out, but they're completely calm. In fact, they're twice as calm as they would have ordinarily been because they actually get to do their job now. And their job is just to completely relax and just look and see what is actually happening here. Yeah. That's the scientist you're talking about here, which is to be, to have clarity, we need impartiality. Right. It's just, I know it's part of the human drama to get all involved with it, and your best friend just got it, and you know, and the president is whatever, and you know, and the republic is, but just look and see what's happening. And what I see is that something is going around fast, and it's actually a good thing when you're talking about a hit record when it goes viral. It's a good thing when you're talking about your podcast going viral. It's a good thing when you're talking about your upcoming show going viral. You know, all those are good things, but when a virus goes viral, it's not a good thing. Yeah. And it's the one who invented the whole gig. You know? All right. All right, so I'm not trying to, you know, look, I know people are gonna have tremendous suffering, so just dunking as a pragmatist, which you know, that's really how I think of myself. I've sort of created a little, you know, mind calibration for all of us going through this, including myself, and it's really three steps. And the first one is assessing your physical safety and health and wellbeing. Okay. Just seeing, let's bring the scientist's point of view to that. Right now, you're in your house, you're okay, you feel okay, you want to avoid, you know, getting too easily infected, so you're avoiding crowds and you're avoiding situations in which you move your risk ratio up too high. Yes. But how are you right now? And so this is when I'm working with my meditation students and stuff right now, I'm saying, are you feeling okay? Is everything okay? Are people in your family safe? Is anybody in trouble? Physically. Second tier is, how's your mental landscape? How's your emotional and mental state in terms of, are you panicking? Are you freaking out? Are you too blasé? You know, are you dull and ignoring stuff? Are you, do you feel awake and relaxed about it? And you're able to deal with it. I gotta go to the store and buy food. I'm gonna do that, and then I'm gonna come home and have dinner with my family. Can you dial down the drama element of it and just relate to some kind of basic sanity, even in the midst of a challenging situation like this? Right. That's two. Third one is, how are you financially? Because the obvious implication of this is it's just not just a physical health, but people's financial present and future is being affected by this in a variety of ways. Some people I talk to are fine. They actually have a year's worth of whatever in the tank and they're enjoying the time to work on a book or even take some contemplative time. Other people are, hmm, this is gonna tighten up something that was already getting tight. And other people are in immediate jeopardy. They're losing, like, three of the yoga studios that I teach at are closed. Yeah. Most people are gonna be without a job. Yeah. And they're not, you know, they're not well-to-do people. They are gonna pay next month's rent based on this month's salary. So, and then even more, we have to look at people who are, you know, maybe who weren't doing well in the first place and this is gonna be extra hardship. Right. So, but each one of us going through that three-tiered scrutiny of our situation so that you can boil it down to like, what am I actually dealing with here? And then just dial the rest of the hyper drama to a, you know, to a nice gossip level, but not that it's taking over your whole state of mind. Right. Then the fourth one is like, once you put your oxygen mask on in that way, look around and see what you could do to help other people. Right. Yeah, that fourth one seems somewhat challenging compared to the old models we had of helping other people in the sense that, you know, there's no human contact right now. Physical human contact. No physical human contact. You can, for example, go to the grocery store to get food for someone else, but if you do that and you don't have the right protective equipment, and maybe even if you do, you're upping your chance of getting this disease. And there is, and if you, to me, it seems like, I guess the primary way to help other people is to not get sick. Because if you get sick, you're going to take up a hospital bed. And if you take up a hospital bed, that's one less hospital bed for somebody else. And that could cost someone their life. So to me, Okay, well, right there, just like right there, just to insert a little pause for that perspective. If you do get sick, one in 20 of the people who get sick is going to need some kind of medical care. And the other 19 out of 20 are not. Right, right. That's good to just, okay, you know, just balance your perspective on that. I know, and I just got a message. I told my friends out here, I'm in Long Island, my house, and I'm hunkered down, complete them in total retreat mode at the moment. But, you know, I said, it's going to start happening that people we know are going to be calling us or texting us and saying, I got this thing now. And that's a big shifting point. And then the second tier of shifting is it goes, somebody in my household has it. Right. And then of course, what's the final frontier? I got it. Yeah. But as you go through those steps, I mean, it's good to evaluate realistically, even if you did know somebody, like for example, this morning, I got an email from a friend, and a good friend of ours said they have it. But then the next wave of messaging was they're fine. The symptoms are not that powerful, and they're recovering nicely. And then of course, they will have the extra advantage of being immune. We don't know that. Well, do you think that's not the case? Well, I don't think that's not the case. I heard a virologist saying that, because we don't have the data on that. We don't know. It's another question mark. It's like possible. But you know, you can catch the cold more than once. And so people do seem to be catching this thing more than once. But those data sets could be, that could be from poor testing. That could be from false positives, false negatives. But that's the thing we don't know. Hopefully, the thing is, if the case is that you become vaccinated, quote, vaccinated when you get the thing, that's really great if that's the case. And that leads, if they show that that is what happens, then that, from what I heard on NPR, that means that there's a, that's a vaccine. If you, if they don't know what else from get from it, then we can make a vaccine. Whether or not that's true or not, we don't know yet. So I don't know. I think that the thinking there can lead some people down a self-destructive track, which is if you believe that you get an immunity from getting the thing, there might be people who are like, fuck it. I'm just gonna go get sick. Then I'll have an immunity and then I won't have to worry about it anymore. And now I can go out. And if they're people who've had the thing and believe they have an immunity and because of that thing, they're somehow not gonna get it. If they're wrong, then they're gonna go around infecting a lot of people. So the problem is we don't know about the immunity thing yet, which I love all this stuff because it's like, you know, you could see in what you just said, there's this hopefulness that is maybe not true, which is so, to me, that one thing, one to bring it into Buddhism. One of your areas of expertise, you can see how normal ignorance, like normal day-to-day ignorance, in general, is not deadly. It's going to probably lead you into some places you don't wanna be. It's probably gonna make the people around you feel at the very least irritated with you. But normal... Ah! Yeah. Okay. But normal day-to-day ignorance, it's not deadly. You know, when you're in any kind of survival situation, ignorance becomes deadly for you or for other people. And so you can see how many chances there are within this big swirling viral Rorschach test to use ignorance as a shield against the pain of not knowing. And you can pretend you have an immunity. You can pretend that you got it. There's people I know who are like, oh yeah, I got it, I think I'm fine now. It's like, A, you don't know that you got it. You didn't get tested. B, you don't know if you got it that you're fine now. Exactly. But what you get from that sort of ignorant deal that you've made with yourself is this false security, a feeling being protected and it's not real. That is not real. So it seems to me that the one quality and Buddhism that seems really useful here is the invitation to turn and look this insecurity right in the eye, which is, I would, and I also, you know, of course, you know me well enough to know that I tend to use this lens or this framework of the Buddha's sort of perspective on things. And that can be, you know, you could have that wrong too. You could either, that could be the wrong perspective or you could be getting it wrong. And that's clearly the case so that there's nothing more penetrating than the actual truth itself or the actual experience itself, even within the Buddha's framework, you would say that. It would contain the seeds of its own destruction if it became just an ignorant veil and filter for processing information. So you would destroy it. That would be the right thing to do. So I appreciate what you're saying. But just still at the moment using that framework for just a second, you and I have talked about this before, but there's like these two primitive beliefs about reality called nihilism and eternalism. And lately I've just been seeing them everywhere. That's like one goes to the left, one goes to the right. If you either negate and you sustain your perspective by through negation, or on the other hand, you affirm and you sustain your identity through affirmation. And they're both considered, it's a cute way of saying it. And I wonder what the original translation is, but a primitive belief about reality and it's not sophisticated in a way. So the nihilists are saying, yeah, we're all gonna die. And we always were gonna die. And this is, anybody who's sort of thinking anything positive right now is missing the message of the whole thing, the whole message is about negation and kind of annihilation. And there's a certain truth in that. There's a certain falsity in that. Then on the eternalist side to say, everything's fine. It's all God's plan, whatever you have of looking at these things, there's the new age version. And then there's the sort of old age version of it, like you bring out your prophecies, you bring out, you affirm some kind of, we knew it. And it's all part of a cohesive whole that is basically working for us. We're the children of this. And our parents are still alive, they're still doing well. And the nihilists are saying, you're an orphan. You always were an orphan. So somewhere, is there a way to relate to it? And I guess my way is boiling down data, which is what I think you're exactly right. Scientists do. And you remember when I playfully gave you that nickname of sort of Prajna, that Prajna is the type of intelligence that scientists have, without a nihilistic bias though, that's an important thing, there's no nihilism in it. It's just objective, you observe the phenomena, you come to conclusions that are verifiable, you know? So you're right, we don't know yet that you can. Let's just say that that's exactly right. I misspoke, we do not know yet that you can, you could get this disease and then get it again. But you can spread it. The thing is, it's, this is the way things have been. And so it's a logical conclusion to draw. But this is where you get into the name of the virus itself, right? It's the novel coronavirus, called a novel virus, new, it's a brand new thing. Sure. This I love, because this is in the same way that you were earlier talking about how in general, like a song is a hit and it goes viral, everyone loves it, bread, word of mouth. Which has a new meaning. Yeah, exactly, yeah. So it's a new song, people are like, wow, I've never heard anything like this before. And they love it and it spreads. This is a new virus. So what that means is we don't know anything about what it does. Because it's new, we think of like, it's similar to when I was younger, and I guess you could say wilder, I wasn't afraid of ordering these things called experimental chemicals or psychedelic chemicals. And like, so it was hilarious because there still is just a wide variety of psychedelics that have yet to be assigned an illegal status by the state because you just move a couple of molecules around, you got a new thing. Yeah, they're novel psychedelics. Novel psychedelics, yeah, exactly. And so you would go on these websites, and it was so funny because the websites were like, these compounds are for laboratory testing only. You know, because the website didn't say like, these are going to get you fucking high, man. Now you're intentionally selling drugs. So the whole website was designed to look as though, I don't know, man, like chemists are shopping around for LSD analogs or something like that. But I would order them, I did it once or twice, get completely blasted on this stuff and not really think too much about it. And then I was on the Vaults of Aeroid, which is a psychedelic website. And they said something that I should have obviously thought of, which is with LSD, marijuana, alcohol, or any drug that we've become familiar with, we have hundreds of years, decades of data that we can draw from to understand what it does to our physiology. And even with LSD, we're still not quite sure what it does. With psilocybin, we're still learning what it does. So the warning was, listen, these drugs have been around for three weeks. You have no idea what this is going to do to you long term because we don't have 80 year olds walking around the day who've been doing this drug since they were 20. You know, we don't know what. Well, you could take a look at them and maybe you think twice about it. Well, I mean, look at Hoffman, you know, LSD didn't live to a ripe old age, you was fine. And he was like, certainly a lab rat for LSD. But you know, look at you, look at Raghu, look at all you, you're perfectly fine, you know? But anyway, the point is with this virus, we don't have any understanding. It could do anything. It's essentially a spaceship. It's- Well, wait Duncan, I wanna just interject one thought there. Okay. Because you said it's a novel corona virus. So one part of that description is a known aspect. It is a virus. And so it is part of a family of things that have a certain group, you know, description of their tendency to behave in a certain way. So it's not totally, it's a novel virus. It's not just like, wow, this is, you know, a novel fa-fa-fa, you know? It's like, it does have continuity with other experiences that we've had. Well, thank God it's not a novel fa-fa-fa. Those things are fa- I got one of those on the website, you're talking. Yo, that makes your face melt off. But, well, okay, fair enough. But I guess what I'm saying is, you know, to get into the finding the, not the eternalist viewpoint on this thing. Sure. To try to zoom in on a realistic. Realistic. Magnetic. Positive thing that's happening here that encapsulates within it. And when I say positive, I mean, you know, you're in prison and suddenly you realize that your mattress functions as a weight. And now you can work out in prison. You're still in prison, but you just, you can- Uh-huh. Yeah, so, like looking at the situation and seeing, okay, how can I construct a kind of spiritual gem, spiritual gem equipment with this situation here? No, wait, Duncan, I gotta pause you right there. Everybody listen to what Duncan just said. That's a very, very powerful thing you just said and a really positive transformational kind of message. Oh, cool. Yeah, I mean, and you came up with a cool metaphor, but I didn't know where you were going with that metaphor. But the idea that the turning, transforming the prison into a gem, I think is the central idea of Buddhism, as I understand it. Wow, cool. You know, you are working with the same things and it's maybe the more transformational dimension rather than the renunciative kind of path. But you take those same things, those same anger, you take aggression, you take ignorance, you take passion and you transform them into gem equipment where you strengthen your positive qualities with them and you get them to express the intelligence aspect of it. And that is, I think, not just pie in the sky and that's not really just a spiritual, mucky muck, wishful thinking. That's really skillful living. Cool, yeah, this to me is all, that's because we are kind of imprisoned depending on where you're at, we're quarantined at the very least we've been imprisoned in the paradigm that's being exploded out of every TV and radio and website in this podcast. Because we are, and that's why I use the prison example and then it's like, here we've got this brand new thing which like you're saying is produced a reflective, a kind of reflective quality. No doubt. Which we're seeing our fear, our tendencies to ignore or our tendencies to overreact or suddenly there's this wonderful, forget gathering the data sets on what this virus is unless you're working in the World Health Organization or you know, you hear something. But damn, this is a great chance to like start getting data sets just about yourself. Like, because the way you're reacting to this guaranteed is the way you subtly have been reacting to any unpleasant situation, right? Like, this is, so yeah. And that's why Duncan, I'm highly, highly recommending to all the people that I work with directly and indirectly to include some time for training. Yeah, let's call it training, cultivation. Let's call it meditation practice, but not the kind of meditation where you're spacing out and trying to get past or around what's going on. But right, looking at it very clearly and very straightforwardly, including your own state of mind, especially your own state of mind because that's one of the things that you actually can work with in any situation. And the instruction oddly, corkily, if you really get with what the Buddhist original jam was is working with your own state of mind in a situation, not because there is no external reality to it, that's not the point. The point is you have some ability to shift perspective, to open the gate to your resourcefulness, to even thrive in a situation in which your survival is threatened, which is the ultimate achievement. That's when you see great meditators, they thrive even in situations in which their survival is in question or even compromised or even ending as a personal thing. Yeah, now, this, okay. So this is benefit number one, I think, in this gym of the COVID virus. First bit of gym equipment here that we have. I guess you could almost say this isn't really gym equipment, it's the music they're playing in the gym of the COVID virus, is music that is reminding every single one of us that there is some possibility, even though statistically, depending on your age, it might be pretty slim, it's way more than it was prior to the COVID virus entering the scene. So one gift that the thing has given us reminds me of this, there's this great book by Krakauer, John Krakauer called End of Thin Air. Have you read that book? No. I think that's what it's called. It's about climbing Everest. And one of the things he says in there, which is so wild, is like the only place where he can really feel connected, relaxed, and fully himself is like in a deadly situation. That the reason a lot of these people put themselves in the insane predicament of climbing up a deadly mountain is because it gives them the feeling of fully, full presence, you can't fuck off. It's like, you know, not to put it, if you wanna put it in a little less extreme way, just skiing is like that, or any kind of sport that involves, if you make a mistake, you could get severely injured, brings all of your senses in, and now you've gotta like, you really have to have your shit together. You know, like, I'm with my wife Erin, and a one year old, and it's stressful if you are with, you know, I've been reading this everywhere, married couples who find themselves in quarantine right now, I don't know, maybe you're not going through, a lot of people are just experiencing like double the pressure of being in a relationship, because there's no way out. And so this is Duncan, this is what I'm calling the Petri dish principle, which is also another element of this. A cruise ship is a Petri dish, you know, an apartment complex is a vertical cruise ship Petri dish, a family is a Petri dish, and so there you are. Now I happen to be physically alone in my Petri dish, so I can, and this is the value of retreat from a Buddhist point of view, I can bank on the fact that whatever is coming out into the atmosphere in this room is coming from me, and that's why I sometimes recommend retreating people, there's no, you know, fussing around about it, you go, whatever environment is being created, that's coming from your mind, there's just nobody else there contributing, so I'm in that situation personally, although I am communicating with my beloved partners, stranded in Thailand at the same time, you know, Monica, so she's going through her journey and we just are connecting, but I don't have to carry anybody, and I'm talking to my students and my friends online, so I'm sharing the journey with the people in that way, but I could see that you're in a, yeah, family, a young family like that is in a Petri dish, and including the kid, and you got to probably, you don't probably have a nanny now, ever, or daycare or anything like that, right? No help, and a lot of people are getting out because the kids are out of school. Yes. So one thing that we both, what has come out of this, which is really good, is like in the past, when there wasn't this like, when the gym wasn't playing this message of this severity, there's a luxury in bickering, there's like a kind of like recreational quality to it, because you know, like, you know, it's not like, if one of you decides, okay, I'm gonna, I'm leaving for a little bit, we're gonna go now, inhale viral spit somewhere, so we suddenly, because of the situation, we both have like, started dropping these defense mechanism techniques, and we're really communicating, you know, we're really saying, here's what that thing you're doing, this is why it bothers me, and we're both saying, I love you, I want you to be okay, because there isn't the luxury anymore of fucking around, you can't, you know what I mean, you can't, it's making me realize how so many sort of sloppy modes of social interaction are based on continuity of life, you know what I mean, are based on, like, if you're climbing a mountain with friends, there isn't real, that's not the time to get into a severe argument with them, it's not even a time to get in a little bit of an argument with them, it's a time to focus on the mountain, and it's not- Well, and it's not also a time to get into a severe argument with yourself, so if you start for this singular retreat, it's a time to kind of work with your state of mind and really try to resolve it towards a very, you know, conscious and, you know, mindful perspective on what's happening so that you don't drive yourself crazy to the beginning, then you have the retreats for two people, that's called a couple, and the same principle then spreads into a small group, and then you have the larger group, and then you have like a group retreat kind of situation, and then you have everyday life, which is the big retreat. Wow, that's so cool, yeah, it is, so that I think is the, if the music being played is, watch out, there's this virus, then the gym, the structure of the gym, it's a retreat. It's a, it truly is a retreat, at the very least, you know, some people, thank God, are still working because they're doctors and they're clinicians and they're working at grocery stores and delivering food for us, thank God, and plumbers and electricians, but even if you're still out there working and haven't self-quarantined or been forced to do what's it called, a huddle in place, it's a scary name, if you're not- Shelter in place. Shelter in place, not huddle, shelter, liver in place, regardless, the retreat that you were all, we find ourselves in, is that we have moved out of a life that we had all become very familiar with, which is day-to-day life in the world and the, you know, what a default reality, which is if I need to go to the grocery store, I can go anytime I want, generally. If I want milk and eggs, I'm gonna be able to get milk and eggs, and more than likely, if I take a trip to the grocery store, blah, blah, blah, I don't have to worry about some brand new virus infecting me and my family. So the retreat we're in now is one where that's not the case anymore. All the stuff we took for granted, we can't take for granted anymore. And that, I think, is the, wouldn't you, that's the structure of whatever this gym, temple thing is that we're in, so- And none of that, Duncan, think of the traditional framework of it, like this is really a daily Buddhist practice for somebody who's doing this seriously, is chanting something called the Four Reminders of Renunciation. I don't know if you've heard this yet or not, but- Listen to me. Listen to these four. They're very short and very simple. And think about this is something you remind yourself of, even in what you're calling normal reality, everyday reality, smooth reality, functional reality. You say these four things. The first one, joyful to have such a human birth, difficult to find, free and well-favored. Just the very fact that you have a human body. Will you say that again? Joyful to have such a human birth. Difficult to find, free and well-favored. So that's the first one is you just remind- Free and well-favored part mean? Free and well-favored means that you actually have some independent agency at the moment. You're health, relatively healthy, let's say. You're able to study, you're able to practice, you're able to learn from your experience. You're not in the gulag somewhere. You're not in a crippled body with six months to live. You have a recently good situation for yourself and it's not, you shouldn't take it for granted. That's what that person is. Cool. Second one is impermanence. But death is real, comes without warning. This body will be a corpse. Now, who would remind themselves of that on a good, nice sunny spring day? Me. Well, and it's not nihilism, by the way. It's realism. Death is real, comes without warning. This body will be a corpse. So even in a good, even an ideal situation, which is no coronavirus, there's no cancer. There's no, not even a cold. You still say death is real, comes without warning and you recognize that it could happen any moment and it's actually the truth of the situation. Wow. Third one, laws of karma. Unalterable are the laws of karma. Cause and effect cannot be escaped. Cause and effect cannot be escaped. So in other words, you look at the situation, you go, whatever I'm experiencing now, without any doubt, no hedging on this, is a result of previous causes and conditions that are my own, my societies, my families, whatever, however extensively you wanna look into it. And that is in spades with this stuff. You look at the causality of this virus and the likely origins of it, whether you go conspiracy theory or just the conventional theory of the Wuhan wet markets, there's causality to it. And you can't just do stuff like that and you can't go out and go to the beach during a shelter in place situation. You're creating causality for whatever conditions and effects are gonna manifest. Acknowledge the law of karma. And then finally, the fourth one is about samsara and understanding this is like really the key is that there's a cyclic web that is created, just like we've talked about in the wheel of life, where it goes around and around and around. Samsara is an ocean of suffering, unendurable, unbearably intense. And samsara includes you're out on a spring day and having a great meal and your gourmet acid trip. It includes that. That's called the God realm. It's part of samsara. It's not easily recognized as sort of suffering, but the root of it actually is there's suffering underlying it. So those four are on a good day. How about that idea? Ah, right. So this thing is like in an odd way, it's giving us those four reminders. But not giving them in such a clear way. Hey, it's the four reminders. It's the four reminders wearing the face mask. A demonic appearance. Or the surgeon general. You know what I mean? It's the four reminders. We're getting them every time we turn on the TV. And so the CDC is saying, wash your hands because you can spread this to other people yourself. That's the law of karma. When the CDC is saying, if you have pre-existing conditions, you have a higher chance of being hospitalized. That's the reminder that you're gonna die. And the unbearable situation is when you're in a fucking house with four goddamn dogs and a little kid. You know, you're challenged. And even to me, I would, this would be unbearable. I'm really glad I'm with my family. But I think it would be more unbearable if I was just the one having to deal with my own emissions or however you put it. Sure. And because that to me, my mind keeps going to those people. The people who are in their apartments right now, dealing with this kind of intense isolation. What? Well, see, just the other perspective on it is it's like in the whole world is sort of going into a retreat. So if you have the framework and understanding that retreat is an opportunity to address some of these underlying situations, it's not you go, yeah, be, I can't go to have my favorite meal at such and such restaurant. But I just had some split pea soup for lunch and I just practiced some meditation and I'm working on some projects coming forward. Everything's okay. Right. You know, within, in other words, nowhere in these instructions does it say, and on top of this, you should panic because I just read you the bad news, so you should freak out because this is all bad news, basically. The four reminders is to renounce your dependency on hope as the platform for your sanity and wellbeing. So then what is the platform? Ah. First thought, best thought, right? There is no platform. And that's, you know, the Buddhists don't say, don't find an ideal state of mind and freeze, dry it. And that would be hope. So, you know, Tung Pramitra used to say, hope and fear are there like symbiotes, you know, they're partners and you, when you cut the root of one, you cut the root of the other. So, part of the pain is that right now, if you're hanging out by yourself or if you're with others and you've gotten up in your head with some kind of fantasy. You know, like Aaron and I have been saying, man, when this thing is over, we're gonna take a trip to Europe, we're gonna go to Paris and have Parisian wine or, you know, or just like, ah, we're gonna get some help, you know, we'll be able to get some help and help us. Those, is it that those fantasies are actually just causing more pain and that we should renounce those kinds of fantasies and just sort of sink? It depends how seriously you engage it. If you engage in a way that it becomes, you know, craving, yeah, you definitely create some kind of torque in your state of mind. If you're just playing with it, you know, for God's sake, it's like, you know, we're human, right? So it's okay. But I think the, just in contrast, like I'm in this house and it's a very comfortable physical situation, so I have that advantage to it. And I'm also like, if I asked myself those first three questions, which I asked everybody, how's your health? My health is actually excellent at the moment. And I've been doing Tai Chi and Qigong every day and meditating every day. And I'm eating completely transformed diets since the beginning of 2020. I've lost 25 pounds. I wasn't that heavy to begin with, but I feel light and good. I've decided to continue. I thought for a minute, maybe I should just push the pause button. I've got a lot of teacher training programs coming up in New York and LA and Japan, and I decided just to take them all online. And we had some preliminary meetings and I just realized, gee, doing it online in New York, there was somebody from Colorado coming in and somebody from Montreal. That would have been impossible before. Right. So I'm saying, let's, let's, let's, I think I can work with people online with Zoom platform and communicate at least 99% of what needs to get across on the situation. And so let's, so I'm just putting energy into like the digital reality, which I think a lot of people are thinking about. Yes. In an oncoming format, anyhow, you're already deeply into it, but that it's wise from a financial and sort of occupational point of view to advising people to shift whatever part of their platform they can to that for now, you know, not right out the other thing. And so, you know, I find my state of mind is mostly manageable. Of course, I'm noticed I'm monitoring it, which is part of our practice mindfulness everyday life. You just look at your energy and watch your stomach and your head and your heartbeat and stuff. And when we go on to these knuckleheads, you know, on the media and the leaders of some of the leaders that we're dealing with, it's so obvious that they're caught up in a kind of inertia and momentum. And to some extent, that's useful because as I said, caution is the enlightened part of panic, you know? You know, you want to not be dulled out and asleep and you want to get those beds there for people, but it does not require a freak out. Right. You know, if you're freaking out, you're not helping anybody right now. Right. And if you're dreaming some kind of like, like we're gonna, they just said, Trump just said, we're gonna open this all up by Easter. And I just went like, whoa, you're creating a noose for yourself. You're gonna be sticking your head in that noose because by Easter, this is gonna be worse and people are going, what are you doing, man? You're opening up all the gateways. So, you know, avoiding the hope and the fear and just trying to stabilize, I don't think I could do it without some kind of meditation practice because it's almost like the gym that you mentioned. It's like you're lifting mindful weights. You're saying, let me just hold on and let everybody hold the horses. Let's just come back to where we are, what's going on. And it's completely legitimate to look at your health, look at your state of mind and look at your financial situation. You don't have to ignore those things. Those are important and do what you need to do. If you need to make adjustments, make them. Now, as far as those adjustments go, do you have any outside of the beautiful advice and recommendations that you've given so far? What are some, I think people who are by themselves right now are facing some really unique problems. Loneliness being probably one of them. Just how are you gonna spend your time all day? I'm lucky, we just moved. Every day I have shit to do. And if I'm not done, if I don't have to unpacking to do, I gotta figure out a way to train these damn dogs. And if I don't have that to do, I've gotta be exercising. If I don't have that to do, I gotta be taking care of the relieving errand of childcare or she'll go completely bonkers. And if there's not that to do, there's my business to do. If there's not that, there's a million things for me to do. If I... Well, I noticed you put right at the top of the list and I'm so happy that you did, that you're protecting your meditation practice during this time and that's the first priority. And it shows all these communications over the months and years have been fruitful. Yeah, man. That's my top one. Yeah, you know, so you just, that putting at the top slows all the other ones down and then you go, okay, now I'm dealing with Aaron and now I'm dealing with the dogs. You know, meditation in everyday life becomes your next stopping point. So I'm highly recommended to people who are alone. What a great time to develop or learn about or strengthen meditation practice. You're in retreat already. Right. So it's a, you know, you already have skipped a step and you already have the time and the space to do it. So A, that's my recommendation. B is, yes, I think people need to connect. It's just part of the human thing. So I've been looking at Zoom and I've chosen groups of people that I feel, I don't want casual conversation right now, Duncan, personally, other people might, you wanna just talk about what new movies, what new movies are not coming out, you know, as a result of this, but you could find a group of people to consort with, you know, and really kind of process with and just create like a regular Zoom session, you know, once a week, twice a week, three times a week. Yeah. And that's what people are taking that to extremes. They're having disco party, you know, dance parties on Zoom and they're having cocktail parties, but something a little bit more like that has some element of sobriety mixed into it of, like, you know, good friends that you can, you can really check on, check about the news. What did you hear? What's going on? How are you feeling? Are you okay? You know, and to create a virtual community. So I think there's a lot of that in play already and it's a good time to just maybe formalize that or create some kind of virtual song over yourself. That's cool. Yeah. That's great. Yeah, that's actually a really brilliant thing. So you're saying meditation, figure out a way to build some kind of community using the tools you have around you and then exercise. And then anything else that, anything else that these people out there could do. Cause you know, I have friends who are like meeting in virtual reality and stuff, but God damn, you know, if I didn't have a family, I think I'd be up to my neck and ketamine and booze. You know, I think I'd be blowing my mind on drugs and eating sugary stuff and just playing. My dear Duncan, Duncan, you are part of your family. You have to take care of the whole family. Oh, right. Right. Yeah. So even if you are alone, you are still part of a community, a society and it's still everybody's primary responsibility to take care of themselves properly. It's the right thing to do. It's a compassionate thing to do. And it's an opportunity to take a second look at how am I at that? And, you know, so people should definitely be taking good care of themselves. But in my mind, that means taking care of your body and your mind and your emotional life and learning, you know, I've said this till I'm blue in the face, but meditation is not just a way of focusing your energy and attention for productivity. And it's not a way of going into a trance state so that you don't have to worry about the, you know, the problems and troubles that are happening in you and around you. It's also a process of discovering, giving yourself space and time in a friendly, gentle, non-aggressive environment just to really learn yourself and see who you are and make friends. And this is a perfect opportunity for it. So it may take a shift of view and perspective, but I don't think the, you know, it could become really obvious to people that punishing themselves in this situation is extra and I'm really not necessary. I got you. Okay, so it's sort of like, you need to remember that even if you're separated from your family, from your relatives, from your friends, you're still part of that community and that you've taken care of yourself is the primary act of service for that community. Cause if you're all fucked up, how are you going to help or do anything? Is that why? Yeah, I am saying that. I'm also saying it's an interesting twist because sometimes for some of us, it's easier for us to think of the wellbeing of others as a primary directive for whatever karmic reasons. So use that. You say, I'm doing this for the benefit of my family. I'm practicing for the benefit of my son so that he has a wholesome environment to grow up in. I'm doing it for the benefit of my community. If you need that motivation, the other way is you just do it for your own. You say, I'm doing this for my own benefit and because of that, then I'll be better able to benefit others. That's basically the summary of the Bodhisattva path. You both do it for your own benefit so you'll be more productive and more helpful for other people and then you do it for other people. You're inspired by wanting to help other people so you take better care of yourself as a vehicle for that. David, that's where we should wrap it up. That's a beautiful, thank you so much. You are, I feel so lucky that we're friends and- Me too Duncan, I do too. That was very inspiring. Where can people find you? I know you are doing these trainings online so when do those start? Well, that's the thing is they're starting and we are doing it online so I kind of want to get the word out that you can now participate from wherever you are in the world actually. So one of them is through Samarasah Studio, Samarasah Center in Echo Park, Los Angeles. And so we're still going to be running under that banner and running that program the way we've run it for the last two years and you've helped with that a couple of those situations. So we'll be continuing that so you could just go to Samarasahcenter.com. Maybe can I send you these links? Maybe that'd be easier for people. And then the other one is at Tibet House in New York which starts in May on Mother's Day. And that one you can include your mother for free. Wow, that's really cool. That's pretty awesome. So that one, they run for four months and it'll be a chance, just like what we're talking about, it'll be a chance to be part of a community that is studying and practicing and trying to learn how to clarify some of these basic principles and practices and also for the benefit of learning how to present to others. So I think it's a really, if you at all have thought about this for any period of time, this would be a way to do it. And I can send Duncan the links and he can post them. So you can check it out if you want to. All the links will be at ducatrestle.com. David, thank you so much. This was a joy. Thank you, Duncan. I'll talk to you soon, okay? Talk to you soon. Bye.

Today's guest was a student of an amazing Buddhist teacher named Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche He's also a musician He plays in Krishnadasa's band He's won Grammys Gold Records In his new book, Creativity, Spirituality and Making a Buck Just Hit the Shelfs David Nickturn It's been DuncanTrustle DuncanTrustle David Duncan Welcome back to the DTFH Thank you so much Your new book, Creativity, Spirituality and Making a Buck which is fantastic and which is bringing some wires together that tech and technology can bring some wires together that technically you're not supposed to bring together when, you know, if you just step over that line too much of selling whatever your fucking thing is But everybody's selling things anyhow That's right, but if you don't do it in the right way in the sense that you don't like You have to deprecate it and deface it and kind of diminish it I don't know how you do it, right? In fact, I think many people get really pissed off when people are making money Have a wallet? They want y'all to be photosynthetic Then there's this You know, there's like a I have to think about that one for a minute If you're not, then there's some sense of some kind of corruption or something like that You know, when you hear about the great spiritual gurus of the world and then you see their ticket price and you realize how much they're charging or they have like little meat and greets like Justin Bieber I've seen videos of this poor kid man, they put him in there and he has these meat and greets where parents are standing there their Bieber obsessed daughter has paid at $500 to stand with Bieber for like two seconds and weep and then like a bodyguard grabs them and just like a hair! Don't touch him! It's the craziest thing to watch but when you see that replicate itself in a spiritual It's sort of like Amma without the hug Yeah, that's right, man and I think Amma doesn't charge there He doesn't even give them a hug? Does Justin not even give them a hug? He can't Yeah, there's no way I can get in trouble for that stuff but the this is one of the unspoken things like man, spirituality that's its own thing art, creativity, that's its own thing but the moment you start making anything spiritual or creative with some intent to get rich Well, get rich, how about just livelihood? A livelihood I mean even how dare you call yourself spiritual, how dare you call yourself an artist? Who the fuck do you think you are? This is the attitude out there in the world it seems like on one side the other side is people coming from the world of commerce and business who say how dare you get spiritual? How dare you apply a code of ethics? How dare you be mindful about what you're doing? Why would you even bring up that topic here? We're just making money here That's right, it's just business So there's two sides to this paradigm They've been separated for thousands of years in my estimation it goes back literally thousands of years to some kind of sane, holistic lifestyle it pops its head up every once in a while but I'm trying to talk about it directly You did a great job of it Thank you, sweet of you To me using Buddhism as a framework for the conversation is paradoxical in the sense that at least paradoxical if you look at Buddhism from a certain perspective So I want to talk about that perspective that I sort of started off with about Buddhism prior to working with you and reading about it and studying it which is that there's this sort of emptiness this emptiness The nothing The void, yeah, this sort of neutral emptiness within which there's this phenomena that we have Whoa, cool There's some phenomena Hold on one second It goes to the machine? Yeah Yeah, we I didn't know where it came from That happened the last time we talked God, man, that's cool So this sort of like vision of the Buddha the starving Buddha the Buddhist monk sitting with a begging bowl here in some scriptures that what did he call people worldlings and he talks to the arhats or what do you say? Arhat Arhat and these are the congregations of monks that are have shaved their head or wearing robes and have tuned in or let go or Well, the notion of arhat is they've realized some degree of egolessness There's a marker there sort of the level of individual liberation Yeah But it's trumped by the Bodhisattva by the Mahayana teachings which say you have to give that up even and then dedicate all of it to the merit of all beings So that even the arhats, by the way in the heart sutra which is the famous sutra which the Mahayana is sort of proclaimed they say that some of the arhats actually died of heart attacks on the spot when they heard this view because then they couldn't even hang out with their individual liberation they couldn't sustain it or hold on to it in any way And it just killed them Well, you know how much shock could you take to your sense of reality? I don't know Before you jump out of that body I almost had that happen when the rumba ran over a dog shit That's about as much as I can stand as I'm coming into my living room and the rumba's done some kind of horrific spiraling of shit art Now, the emptiness the letting go all of this that especially the emptiness which a lot of people think of as a black hole Yeah, a black hole None of it seems to connect in any real way to investing in this world growing roots into this world producing a life in this world because who gives a fuck, man? We're all just rivulets of sentient matter floating into the great void What? You want to start a website You're going to like, what are you going to do? You want to start making crochet shit for Etsy? Let go and die We're all drifting into nothingness Go into the forest and forget Yeah I mean, that's an extreme version of it But you know what I mean? That's the romantic idea It's great to really like the actual Buddhist teachings to correct the misrepresented Buddhist teachings You're talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger and then he's in the room, you could ask him You know what I mean? So here's the non-rumor part about emptiness It is not considered to be nihilistic in the sense that you're portraying it There's not a nothing valence to it It's a kind of potentiality that is not limited in any way So it actually gives birth to everything So it's that kind of, it's like a womb and in tantra it becomes womb-like and it gives birth to all phenomena But they're not distinguishable from the openness or the emptiness of that So when you talk about emptiness, you should always say empty of what? That would be the right way to talk about it And it's empty of three things, right? It's empty of permanent existence It's empty of independent existence and it's empty of substantial singular existence Now, if you can qualify something those three ways you can say it's empty Right, yeah So take Duncan for example Are you permanent? No Do you exist independently of all other phenomena? Nope Not yet And can you identify a singularity that is Duncan that is reduced down to a singular phenomenon like a soul or an atman or something like that? Is there something you could identify as the singular Duncan-ness? Well, it's kind of like tattoos, right? That's why I don't get tattoos Well, that's right Because you get a tattoo and when you think you've figured it out And then down the line you've got this awful fucking tattoo and you still have to explain to people what it is It's like my poor friend who, like, tattooed the initials of his girlfriend on his ankle in high school Never got a date again after that, right? Well, god, no, I mean, it just didn't work out I mean, and I have a friend who's a tattoo artist who says that's one of the signs that it's ending if someone comes in and gets somebody else's tattoo their name on them because it's like a grasping situation Anyway, what I'm saying is any singular Duncan self that I have felt like, oh, that is it has inevitably over time proven to be just some kind of dream-like state that I was in and then you look back and you're like, holy shit, I was gonna do that I was gonna get a crucifix that said resurgio underneath it, resurrection on like my arm when I was in college after I took acid and read the New Testament Thank god I didn't Thank god, I don't want that tattoo I mean, it's not as embarrassing as the people who get the angry clown or whatever but still, it's an embarrassing tattoo Now here's something I noticed about Duncan Phenomenon You change your identity quite frequently Like you change your name online Oh, you mean my Twitter handle? Yeah, absolutely You're a shapeshifter Well, I mean And even in some of the work you do, you shapeshift I enjoy doing that It's a blast, yeah It's really fun to not be so solidified into some any given identity I mean, Duncan is more like a swarm of bees than an individual person in a way Isn't everyone like that? The Gurjeev idea that we're just a swarm of various personalities living in the mansion of our self and most people are running amok because the great master who's running the house has vanished and that's your undisciplined state That's what Gurjeev says, it's really quite beautiful Fantastic So you begin to like, the joy is the beginning of the realization that the master's returning which would be the moment that you start gaining some bit of internal harmony, a little bit of discipline a little bit of consistency That's like the idea that you just got a letter saying, oh, I'm coming back, don't worry Or the prodigal to son would be the reverse of that It's like, you're the person out in the wilderness Anyway, the point is Yeah I'm a shapeshifter Anyone's a shapeshifter, if you dream you're a shapeshifter I wonder about Gurjeev What did he do for a livelihood, do we know? He sold carpets Whoa Yeah, carpets Yeah, so he's a little bit, I mentioned in the book Charles Ives who was a famous composer and he didn't want to have his creativity be his livelihood, so he sold insurance I wonder if that's the case with Gurjeev that he didn't want to have to put that on the line as like, okay, I buy and sell teaching these people so I'll sell carpets and then charge students money for studying with him, you know I have no idea I've heard cool stories about him selling carpets though, like I read a story about when he was selling carpets, he would assume a completely different identity and wouldn't be Gurjeev the mystic he would sometimes act really like dumb, he would act like he was sort of confused, he would act like he would just play games with his identity as the carpet seller but I think that he knew what I think a lot of people forget which is that every moment is holy and sacred regardless if you're selling milkshakes or carpets or lectures or whatever it may be, that this is the this is it and it's okay to be any way that you are that's okay, which is why to me, like a book that dives right into this, and also not just in a woo-woo-ee way, even though you have a chapter open that I do like that we've talked about before the concept of joining heaven and earth it's not just that it's just a lot of good practical advice and when we were talking at our I don't know what you call it, the thing we do at Samarasah dialogue, that's what we call it you said this is you learning from my mistakes because you've been to be clear, this is me learning from my own mistakes and passing it on I haven't learned anything from your mistakes yet you're gonna I've done it so sinister oh you're gonna do it yes you are no but I mean what is, you know part of the concept in the book and in me working with people and talking to people is sharing the journey, and you know I think all of these traditions are passed on human being to human being, any of them that are worth anything have a human chain of communication in it so the big part of that is mishaps and finding out how not to do something, so I figure at my stage of life I've had more mishaps than many of the people I hang out with just by longevity at this point and it's things like as simple as if you're gonna start a record company, don't finance it yourself and put both your houses up for mortgages for second mortgages don't do that but you know what I mean, just some reasonable things that when we're in a fever of creative outbursts that we can misappropriate misunderstand the situation and replace common sense with enthusiasm that's right, how easy to do that oh gosh everybody who's ever been in love has done that this is what I love for sure this is what I love about the Hare Krishna this is what I love about the story of Krishna particularly the Rasalila which is you hear this flute out in the woods and it's so beautiful that you leave your lanterns burning you leave your baby and you go out in the woods and you have sex with God and then when you're having sex with the divine who gives a fuck about whatever that old life was it's like you're up from a dream and you're not mourning over whatever that used to be you know that past thing and this idea is to me when people finally have inspiration and finally sort of merge or feel that first you follow the flute you have the idea and then you have to have the guts to go and do it and it does require some sacrifice divine contact at last and then beauty is coming out of you and you're like this isn't even me I don't know what this is and then you're hungry and you're like I gotta fucking eat I gotta go somewhere to eat and I don't have enough money to eat and if I can't eat then I can't make stuff and then you know what I'm talking about this is the to me well of course that's a famous part of the Buddhist story it was a hard core meditator and he got down to one grain of rice a day they say and real aesthetic because a lot of the trajectory into the spiritual realm was based on asceticism that was one whole line of thinking if I shut it down, if I turn it off if I eliminate distraction then I will get to the some kind of experience of spirit so he tried that because as far as I could tell he was an industrious kind of practitioner he had a teacher he did what the teacher said but then it got to a certain point that he was literally passing out like so not able to meditate that's the starving Buddha but then there's and I've rendered this in some of my music on this topic a maiden named Sujatha was walking by and kind of singing this song it's like a kind of yogurt drink that she was selling and she offered it to him and then he drank it and just thought kind of what choice do I have here but he found it kind of pleasing and he also gave him strength to continuous practice so that's supposedly the discovery of the middle way kind of approach maybe you don't have to be checking into the seven greatest restaurants in LA one night a week you can become upset when you're tortellini was a little bit overcooked that could be one extreme and the other extreme is starving yourself to death maybe there's a middle way and that goes a long long way into the depths of Buddhist teachings once you get past the renunciate stage of them which really if you stay with the renunciate aspect of Buddhism it's very refining in a way it's like you learn how to stop lying stop cheating stop abusing but then it reaches a point where you begin to explore reality in a much more in depth way and that's part of the tradition going all the way up to the highest tantras in which really they're saying this phenomenal world, just like you said this is the sacred world it's nowhere else you cannot find it elsewhere like right now, this is it heaven if you want to call it that you could just call it probably wouldn't give it that much of a way bearing load be more like suchness as it is so in the book I talk about as it is what is it and then the second metric is up to you like this is up to you this is not there's no fate from a Buddhist point of view Duncan is not faded, Duncan's future is completely open yeah primarily open so it's like that as it isness is that that's where you start the as it is it's a funny thing that people are saying is get back to what it is so how much time do we spend with what it isn't I guess you could say what it isn't is the fabricated part of the mind or the fantasy part or the part that is projecting reality in kind of a hyperactive way instead of maybe pacing it a little differently and just seeing the actual texture and nature of things that you're working with including going to the office in the morning including making your cup of coffee including raising your child yeah so if you see those things as unholy I feel you have a long journey ahead of you that's right there's like a fun exercise to just like scan through what you think is profane that you do throughout your day what are the things you are doing where you're down on yourself and you're thinking this is not who I'm supposed to be for a lot of people that's their job they do it they feel out here in LA some people who have a job that isn't immediately getting paid for art they feel really like failures like I'm waiting tables it really gets to people and for some people who are making art and have temporarily sustained themselves but are entering a place where it's not for that moment they feel absolutely humiliated to go to work you know what I'm saying to me that's like a really interesting thing to start realizing you have zones shame as the ground of your whole day embarrassment so this is one thing that Trump used to call negative negativity I think you and I have talked about it but the idea is you have the original confusion but on top of that you're dumping on yourself for having that and he said you just strip that layer away first you know the kind of judgmental layer now you're working with what he used to call the manure of experience it's like a fertilizer so all your ambition your anger, your jealousy these things are potentially fertile in that they can be viewed as energy they can be viewed as a pure form that's not so egocentric so for example you take something like you know jealousy or competition that could be like just a genuine intense energy for excellence and perfection which people have so those things can overlap on each other but as long as you're dumping on the whole thing you won't get any of the juice I want to talk about this with you I haven't finished it you recommended this fantastic book on alchemy that I started reading and then from time to time I'll just look up the emerald tablet which is that alchemical text which seems to have the concept of samsara and nirvana that you find inside of it and then there's this invitation to take from any matter internal or external the impurities and within that sliver of impurity somewhere in there is the thing you're looking for which is a really intense thing that krishnadas said to me once which was like he's always saying the most intensely profound things they're really compact so once he said nuggets but you said the longing is the grace and that to me sort of translates into some other ideas that's bhakti in a nutshell don't you think that's devotional yogas the longing has something about it that pulls you forward and upward you're right you know how we would say this in our teachings in some of the buddhist teachings there's this notion of raising what we call wind torus your sort of personal presence and strength and magnetizing drahla energy so the drahlas are the self existing sort of rich energies that are in the phenomenal world particularly in nature but not just in nature the level of some kind of confidence and presence then they love you they shower you so this is what his tradition and my tradition have in common tantric buddhism is devotion is really hugely important and it's not so much it has a guru, it has a literally guru devotion as part of it but it also has just that sense of longing as opening your heart and making you a little less kind of hyper structured about who you think you are this episode of the DTFH has been supported by feels this sponsorship couldn't have come at a more perfect time I've been trying to get up at 4am every morning so that I'm more productive but that means I gotta go to sleep at 10 or I'm not gonna get a full night's sleep

taken off your first order with free shipping feels.com slash duncan hyper structured but that longing is to bring it back to what we were talking about earlier if I bring the longing into the thisness into the nowness and it's just the longing and then I'm experiencing it it's those times when you're like weeping for your someone who's died and in that breakdown there's a moment where you realize it feels like I'm with them right now inside of the that inside of it is them is the experience somehow of connection with them and then if you take that and you look at the thing that you want what you should people you shouldn't be ashamed of some people are ashamed of it because it's so tremendous and it hurts this thing that they want then they think it's they'll never have it like true love or something but when you look at the feeling of it instead of running away from it then somewhere in that feeling that desire want right there's a sliver of the thing you're looking for somehow it's already there but it doesn't make sense because nothing's there to induce it there's the person or the job or whatever and yet there it is in the sliver you taught me this the way that if you really look at pain there's somehow it's not quite different from pleasure if you take a cold shower an ice cold shower and really feel it you realize it feels as good as the hot water it's alive it's alive it's like so anyway to me I think that there is a possibility for people to find that sliver and then manifest it right? into their world that's exactly what is in this book that's what I'm trying to get to the notion of finding a vision which is the heaven principle that arises spontaneously and freely in your mind like the unobstructed version of what you'd like to do in life that's called heaven which is unobstructed then as you draw that down to earth it's always earth goes but but but no I don't think so what about this what about that so I say that some people will have a strong relationship to heaven they're quite visionary but they're not connected to earth solidly enough so they can't manifest but on the other hand if you're connected to earth but you've lost heaven because you have this to-do list and you're checking it off and you I did this I did that but you forgot why you're doing it so there's no vision unifying it so in the Asian paradigm joining heaven earth is the role of the human beings us and when we do that we manifest and we also manifest leadership and we can also manifest almost anything you want at that point so heaven's like the wifi connection that downloads the system upgrade into your iphone if iphone is not plugged in is not taking the message is not whatever it may be then forget it you're fucked and then when you add to this situation a taboo on taking that inspired heaven and bringing it into the world in a relatively mundane way if you think that that's not how it works I'm a sell out if I start doing business calls then you're doomed that is such a taboo for a lot of people my uber driver was playing some music he made and it's really quite beautiful but he was telling me I'm not good at the business stuff a lot of people will say that everyone says that but that's why there's 8 chapters in the book about business somebody could say I love music but I'm not good at learning how to play the guitar okay but there's a way there's methods the reason I like business and I have really enjoyed entrepreneurial energy and business my whole life is because it's extremely creative A and B it's like you have to be practical about things and you have to know how things work so the idea that I can't engage that energy is probably a miss perception because it's actually part of living you have to know how you're I use the image of a Phillips head screwdriver or a Flathead screwdriver you have to know the difference if you want to unscrew something so just some kind of practical wisdom and mixed in with that is the notion of ethical conduct which is sort of right livelihood no matter what scale you're operating in fact I quoted you in that chapter Duncan you said if you're lying, cheating and stealing it's not going to work out for you that was your quote and it's great it's because it's so to the point people think oh I can manipulate this energy I can manipulate this wealth and that's just that's true that you will create spiritual imbalance when you do that that's no doubt about it also if you think about the mood state you have to be in to lie, cheat and steal that means you're afraid of shit if you've gotten to that point that's how when people start robbing banks or whatever when people are like getting to crime which is extreme dishonesty why are they doing it they're not doing it because they're filled with some joy and love and feeling like the world is an abundant place they're doing it because they're terrified that they're going to run out of money and they're pissed and that attitude of fear I think when that gets in you then what whatever heaven is is being channeled heaven is unobstructed there's no hope no fear and no hope that's what's interesting about it Trump used to tag hope and fear as a pair when you can't have one without the other that's cool so when he'd say this situation's totally hopeless and I mean that it's not a strategy how can I get hopeless so I could get enlightened it is hopeless and therefore it's also fearless yeah right well I mean it's like when you get the thing that you wanted the hope goes away you will become hopeless in that sense and you know that the moment let's say for example you're out there in the middle of the woods and you're hoping to god someone finds you because you've been wandering for like a week you think you've seen like a mountain line that's following you and you're hoping beyond hope and then someone comes and gets you you're now hopeless that hope is gone you've been alleviated of the burden of that hope and to me hopelessness or fearlessness or heaven energy when it comes through the pipes and there's fear in the pipes it still comes out in the same way that if you like shove some cat turds into a water fountain you're still going to get some water but no one's going to want to drink it and it's going to be disgusting and so that to me I've noticed when I make shit out of fear when I've gotten really into like oh my god I got to make this work it works but within it there's the tonalities of fear whereas like if you do this insane thing which I from my very not long long term practice I associate with the concept of fundamental goodness or this general sense of like my god this is this place is wonderful right now this if I'm like making stuff from that place which this guy Neville Goddard describes as working from the end so working as though you already did achieve the thing you want with that state completely believing yeah a fruitional kind of point then good stuff comes out of me sure where I get confused with that kind of manifestation stuff and Buddhism is sometimes it feels like there's a weird kind of like pushing or a visualization of a life where all my needs are met and the world is abundant and I see myself held in the great eternal rainbow field of love and my life is completely actualized right now where I get we confused when it comes to Buddhism is like well Buddhism so thus far to me is the practice of allowing things to be as they are and that other thing when you're doing your affirmations and stuff like that sometimes there feels like there's exertion is there a way to bring these two together so that they don't seem this is exactly what we were talking about in the car on the way here in a way so you know a bridge let's say just for argument say things are like as you said clear water perfect the way they already are let's just say that how come we don't perceive it that way and that you also said because there's cat turds in the water fountain what are they there are our own habitual patterns and confusions that have accumulated over time so nobody's denying that that part of reality that's called relative reality and if you if you ignore that the law of karma the kind of sense of how did we get where we are what energies are we working with what confusions exist in the situation what doubt what hesitation if we ignore that we get a kind of theoretical version of the purity an abstract version of it and you can see it on the cover of yoga magazines people with looking like they have an abstract version of the purity but you know that as soon as the photo shoots over the shit is going right back to the fan and life continues on right so on the flip side if we if we can look at our actual life and that's why I'm talking about like the real life that we have and you see ah you know there's certain kind of karma here there's certain things I'm working with habitually maybe doubt maybe a depression maybe anxiety these things are recurring in in the in my mind stream regularly they may not be permanent they may not be substantial but they're recurring frequently so then there's certain practices that are called purification where you're actually cleaning the pipe cleaning the delivery system of course it's a relative thing because it's inherently though it's pure already but relatively speaking you know we have attitudes we have you know we have things where you know wish we could have done differently we have regrets we definitely have anxiety about the future and these are kind of hyperactivity in the mind so part of it is allowing the mind to settle down so that you know in a way you can purify by just allowing the mind to settle you just feel the purity of it but otherwise you can actually review look through your shit you know and there's a lot of ways to do that you know some the twelve step people have some of the best techniques for that I've ever seen and they're not dissimilar from certain Buddhist techniques where you recognize what you've done wrong you acknowledge it you kind of attempt to rectify it and and make a vow not to create the same trouble going forward there's a so there's purification this purification what you just said there's a concept that this guy Neville Goddard was talking about which is really really trippy which is that it's called revision you ever heard of this no vision I never heard Neville Goddard he's pretty intense but you sort of so you have the memory we all have one at least many many may probably where the thing you did that you wish you hadn't there regret memory so that's the reoccurring thing so you're sitting and then this is one of the bubbles that floats up the recurring habitual pattern so Neville Goddard is saying actually remember it differently as though you did something perfect at that time as though in that moment you you apologized and instead of trying to be right or at that moment you walked away instead of fighting somebody or in that moment whatever visualize it you visualize the same event the same event right but as though it happened in this beautiful way it is really trippy to do and it sounds crazy and he's not implying that this literally changes history but what it does do is it somehow leads to self forgiveness somehow because you see who you are now versus who you were then and you let the who you are now be back then it's a pretty beautiful thing to do but the other thing that it does which I like where this splits from my understanding of mindfulness is that in mindfulness it's more I understand it too let's just watch the bubble there it is and now it's gone let's look at it time travel revise see it in a more perfect light and then let it go so this comes to a really deep topic of East Meeting West which is trauma and I really don't think after many decades of various Buddhist practices but obviously mindfulness being the foundational one I think mindfulness is a foundation practice to stabilize your attention and it's really basic you know from there I think then you get out the tools to work with your experience and I don't think awareness itself unless it is just stunningly complete will remove the stains of trauma so it might need other kinds of work and even some people I know in our field would say that some forms of Western therapy might be more effective at that very deep kind of like stain of a traumatic experience so I myself am just exploring these things and I think there is a great phrase called spiritual bypassing that has been John Wellwood I think came up with it of the possibility of spiritual techniques to avoid sort of encountering some of these deeper rooted aspects of one's personal development so we'll see how that shakes out but I also think within the Buddhist tradition there are many ways to work almost more shamanically, energetically with things there is a whole map of the inner landscape of our you know our highways of energy going through the body and the idea of opening those channels and purifying those because really what's ever stored has to be stored in either our physical body or our mind stream where else would it exist so you think oh I haven't thought about that for five minutes where was it it didn't really have much presence during that time but it recurs so I think the idea of recurring is something that we have to address as part of practice how do you deal with recurring oh you can label the thinking and go back to your breath and then it comes back and then it also has a certain feeling tone to it when it comes back you say okay I recognize that feeling tone but at a certain point it's like there's ways to get brillopads out and kind of clean out your psyche that's cool to know yeah that's good to know well that's just another prostrations 100,000 prostrations oh yeah you mean like when you're like doing the thing where you're like going around the temple bowing and stuff yeah but you dive all the way to the floor and you put your whole body on the floor 100,000 times 100,000 how long does that take people months or years I don't have time for prostrations I've got a family I can't be flopping around like some Buddhist fish on a temple floor hoping for peace there's no peace in it it's really connecting with your emotional life in a different way sounds cool you would love it actually prostrating yeah you would love it if you put it all right there you put it all right there like if I'm like I'm tripping super super if I've taken the right amount of psychedelics sometimes I feel so overwhelmingly in love with the universe that I'll do that just on its own it's also known as passing out I mean if somebody saw me there like Jesus fucking Christ he just passed out is he okay wake up face down yeah I love to hear that because this to me is it like for a lot of people Buddhism gets translated as a passive yeah and I've been accused of passive hipster Buddhism yeah you know and just this sort of like you're not there's no action there and so to me to bring it back to your wonderful book it completely exercises that perception and I think you've done a really good job of illuminating how there is there's action in this there is an ability to interact with this place we call it entering the action even when somebody leaves a three-year retreat the name of that gesture is called re-entering the action so the retreat doesn't stand on its own it's how you manifest after it so and just to frame it out I see three pathways for people like us we become renunciates, monastics what do you have to renounce probably pretty much most of the things that we do all day every day sex, you renounce, livelihood coffee probably coffee, definitely alcohol definitely drugs and you pay attention all day long every day to every gesture every word you say to bring it into alignment with your prime focus which is to attain enlightenment that's a legit that's going to be a legitimate path forever okay that's one group now the second group that arose were the lay people living outside the monastery who were receiving some teachings from those monastics and supporting them as part of a larger cultural initiative this is worth supporting we value this and so they're called patrons and they somewhat have a household of practice they do mantras and little things and they have chachkis around the house and they have a general sense of appreciation so that's two paths there's a third path and that's the household of yogi or the hidden yogi and this person or even Mahasiddhas they look like normal people living in a normal way and they're famous for that they could be running a delicatessen you wouldn't know but the person has pure view all the way through and every moment there is practice so this is in all the traditions you have the Sufis, the Buddhists it's the hidden yogis or household of yogis and your view is the same as the monk essentially or the nun it's that there is no wasted time there's no wasted gesture it's all to move towards a recognized enlightenment and yet at the same time you don't have to change the outer form you just change the inner form you know what I love about that it makes it so there's no escape it's like the fantasy my god the fantasy you get it in college but there is always a fantasy of like shit maybe one day I'll become a monk but until then I'm just gonna be a fucking asshole you know what I mean that's right because you've constructed a reality where oh no there's this thing I have to go to a temple, the place, the whatever but then to hear that and I'm saying it in a negative way the positive version of it is that realization of like right now you can enter into something as potent as a monastic order sure in your life at this moment you are in the monastery it's whatever your surrounding phenomena is and then within that place you can turn your life into something very instantly sacred in this magical and beautiful and real no matter what it is you're doing and that's a really intensely beautiful path I think and for a lot of people I think that's liberating on its own because people really do feel like and it's a genuine path this is not wishful oh well I missed that boat but this one I'll make up another boat and sail up on this one this is you know for many centuries this kind of path is acknowledged with but it's probably a little more inner a little more less show about it there could be delusion on either path that's the thing for example if you're the patron you could just go well I'm just going to keep making money and running my corrupt business or whatever but I'm giving some of it to charity right so there's a disruption distortion there the monks and the nuns could as you say be bypassing you know you want to talk about bodhisattva activity try being a mother you know I mean just look at being a mother everything they say about bodhisattva's mothers are already doing and that's why they use it as the metaphor for it there's no time off you're just dedicating your life to the benefit of sentient beings you know that's right and in the householder path you could talk the talk and you have this kind of view of what you're doing but it's really kind of flaky right we see that and that's why some western people they love zogchen and things like that they're a very fruitional view because it feels like oh I don't have to do the prostrations I don't have to do the hard work you know well yeah so there's always room for self-deception there's always room to the last second there's room always room it's very exciting to realize that oh actually you're in the abyss right now you're in the abyss and you whenever you're ready you can be in that place and I think that's one of the most spectacular the exciting things because you know this is the resurrection of the dead this is the potential that this whole life that you decided was mundane profane mediocre lowered is in fact just as far out and mystical is some mountain monastery up in the snow and you're the one deciding that it isn't that because you can't handle it man it's too much to have as Trump or Rinpoche says sometimes the floor drop out that moment of like what the fuck you mean here my dirty fucking apartment with my ashtray filled with cigarette butts and my dust covered fan you know when you're like not taking care of your apartment your fan gets a thick coat of dust on the top of it this place is it this is it as powerful as that I don't think people want to deal with that because they want to say it power now be here now but that is not really tenable for some people because it's such a shocking it's a death wouldn't when you say it would be a death I guess you have to give it all up you have to like give up the fact that you're in a profane situation all your attachment to being profane all your attachment to quote failure all your attachment to self abuse all your attachment to the cynicism that is you think is your personality or your witty quality all of it has to be the moment you see it no longer as an aberration in the universe but as a beautiful outflow of your heart and soul as you are right now into time then you don't get to hate yourself anymore it's an attachment and that's a death and then because if a lot of people that's the finding characteristic of who they are is a general secret disdain for themselves poverty mentality yeah yeah so what are we going to do well I mean I think it requires a kind of waking up from a daydreamer some way of continuing to wake up first book awakening from the day I know I didn't mean to plug it in out of my head it's sitting right there I'm not like trying to do some cheesy sound like I'm doing a fucking telethon but it is like that and that's what you're so good at teaching to me and to your students which I think is really quite beautiful is this like sudden awful moment where you're like oh my god I don't have to fucking move to Bhutan I'm in Bhutan right now this is it and that I don't know how that applies to business necessarily but well and I was just thinking that Duncan here's why I like business particularly for people who are spiritually inclined because if you're spiritually inclined you're usually working with like Pema Children says gentleness precision and letting go she has a chapter called that I went like every beginning meditator read that be gentle be precise and also some sense of letting go the precision element is something that a lot of times people enter the spiritual arena they'd like to slough that off a little bit to shave that one off a little bit it's kind of all one or it's kind of all already good and stuff so business just like does not tolerate that kind of imprecision and it can be corrupt easily and the motivation is what makes it corrupt like you know there's greed involved or if there's a kind of feeling of dominance or those kind of toxic kind of emotional landscapes but just the pure act of exchange requires a certain level of precision right like even if you're just counting somebody's change they give you a dollar give them their change back you know where's your mind right then if you're thinking about a retreat right then you give them the wrong change yeah it's in everything that precision but in business it's valued it's also kind of claustrophobic if you don't have it oh you're fucked support for the Doug Etrussell family hour comes from Manscaped who is number one in men's below the belt grooming Manscaped offers precision engineer tools for your family jewels there's not much worse than when you decide to trim

everyone smelling your balls thank you Manscaped to me the other sort of taboo about this and we've talked about it a little bit more is that um you're not supposed to I've always been taught well before I was working with you don't meditate to get enlightened don't meditate to gain realization don't meditate for any reason you read this all the time it's really frustrating or you'll hear certainly if you begin to experience some kind of like well like the famous Hare Krishna story a woman said to Srila Prabhupada when I'm chanting Hare Krishna I see a light coming towards me and his response was keep chanting it'll go away you know this idea of like it's there really this isn't a thing that we do to produce some future thing and then if you get caught up in that you're gonna get lost and yet when I've been practicing regularly for sure inspiration comes and more than that synchronicities and more than that opportunities and it's like my whole life lights up like some coal that's getting blown on and I think when that's happening when it's good when that starts happening I start thinking well you're fucking up because you're getting good you're this is not for that we're not doing magic we're not at a cauldron here we're not summoning this or that we're evaporating our beings in the great eternal nothingness and then you know what I mean and then I feel bad about it but you know what I'm saying so to me it's really cool that you've written this book where it's not tiptoeing around the fact that if you start up a practice weirdly there seems to be a lot of stuff that happens that is abundant where abundance starts appearing and you know it's just first correcting the notion of what richness actually is so you could say our whole culture is suffering from a misunderstanding about what wealth is so there's nowhere in any of these teachings I've seen that doesn't say our actual nature is not abundant and rich and potentially thriving that's if people think you have to be punished and then what well even then they say okay you could have some kind of brilliant retrieval from that so the thing wants to end on an up note it's like it wants to end on an up note so however you get there is fine with me I'm really very open-minded at this point about what people do or don't do but if you're a creative which a lot of people are even if you don't think you're a creative but you're a secret closet creative and if you think that there's some mitigating circumstance to just working with your mind in a day-to-day way to become more sane, more balanced you know use your intelligence in a creative way and a positive way which I'm just loosely calling spirituality the mind aspect is spirituality means mind esprit mind if you have to live during a day living in this real world why can't that all be part of your journey and why do we have to parse it out and kind of pit one against the other so that's the view I'm presenting it's what I was taught I didn't make it up, it's the first seminar I ever went to was called Work, Sex and Money by Chogem Trunker Rinpoche Boston 1970 first seminar, walked in off the street here's this high Tibetan Lama in a business suit talking about these ordinary things and you know so it resonated with me so I'm passing it along and trying to make it accessible to people now and then more if you can give me the specifics of your situation what I call the life puzzle there's definitely ways to sort through it so that you can remove obstacles so that's maybe the Ganesh element or something like that look at the obstacles not as obstacles but as a way for you to learn more to grow more to thrive that's the particular journey we're on David Nickturn thank you so much creativity, spirituality

13^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 564: Ian Fidance Transcript and Discussion^2023-05-05^Things are getting clearer, yeah I feel free to bare my skin, yeah that's all me, nothing to me, go hand in hand, nothing on my skin, that's my new plan, nothing is everything. Used to go to the park and look down at my skin, wonder what it would be like if I was looking, then I found some cream in my life and came a dream cause I learned that nothing is fucking everything. Things are getting clearer, I can see an infinite void inside of me, nothing on my skin, that's the new plan, nothing anywhere, I'm a Nihilist man. No matter what they tell you, only one thing's true, there isn't really of me and there's definitely not a you, from dust you came and to dust you will go. Don't fill the highway on your grave and nobody will know. Things are getting clearer, I got tricked into sucking the demiers, a giant dick. Nothing is everything. That is of course a track from the Richard Dawkins script that they just turned into a movie. It's called Jesus Christ Superstar 2. I was really, really wrong and it stars Kevin. I'm really excited to see Kevin in this film. If you're wondering why my voice sounds like this, I will tell you why. It's cause I updated my operating system which is something you should never do if you work with audio. You should just leave it alone. If it works, that's great. Are you updating? What are you hoping for? Nothing's going to change that much and yet I do it. Every time I see that software update available, I get excited, I click it. What the fuck am I looking for? A new emoji? What am I doing? And now this is the price that I pay and unfortunately updates roll down hell. You have to endure this intro with my voice sounding like I have a woman in a well that I'm about to skin. Children, I'm going to be at Helium in Portland this weekend. Almost all those shows are sold out. Probably by the time you hear this, it will be sold out. So why am I even mentioning it outside of some cheap insecurity based way to inflate my ego? It's pretty gross. But shows that I haven't sold out yet. Copper Blues Alive, Phoenix.

Ian, welcome back to the DTFH. Look at you. You've got a background now. You've gone pro. It looks great. Thank you, man. I'm in my podcast studio for being Ian with Jordan, and it is in the basement of my apartment. So, it's a long trek to work. It looks fucking great. You've got your Ghostbusters background. I'm seeing a lava lamp, Lucky Cat, Minora. Some books. Yeah, thank you. My great books. Yeah. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. I have enjoyed making this my own, and I feel like it's when we're down here, it just feels like we're hanging out in a basement. Your parents are in home and we're having big sleep over, you know? Ian, can you turn your mic up for me a little bit? Is that possible? Yeah, give me one second. Oh, boy. Let me know. Let me know. Let me know. That's good. Is this better? Yeah. Yeah, way, way better. Okay, cool. That's perfect. All right, good. That's good. Yeah. Well, the studio looks good, but the sound is shit. That's the story of podcasting, baby. You can decorate this shit out of your studio. You can get a repaint. You can get all kinds of props set up, but the audio will fuck you every time. And if the audio isn't fucking you, this shit will pop up. Like right here, it says Ian is using a roadcaster. I am. Make sure they're using the right mixing settings. Let's see. Ian has been embezzling money. Oh, yeah. No, that just came. That came with the warranty. It says on a roadcaster pro enable mix minus audio processing and use roadcaster pro stereo and Riverside. Do you know how to do that? No, I don't. All right. Well, it sounds fine to me. Fuck you, Riverside. Leave me alone. Yeah. Is this all right? Yeah. It's hard enough. I don't need you telling my guests how to do their fucking audio. Yeah. Fuck you. Fuck you, technology. Fuck you, AI. Yeah. Fuck AI. God damn. Ted Kaczynski had it right. What? Yeah. Ted Kaczynski was fucking right. He called it from the get go minus the mail bombs thing. He could have been a really great author. I know. I know. He just had to take it one step too far. You know, it's just, you know, the moment that you feel like you need to write a manifesto. That's a warning sign. That's like, we should be trained on that. Like I know that. I know where I'm at when I get in the manifesto mood. All of a sudden you see me just taking stacks of paper and be like, yeah, I know what you mean. I'm just hiding them away from the camera. Pushing an old typewriter away. You, you can't write a manifesto on a computer. You got to type it. You got to get like a nice typewriter. Oh yeah. Anything on the computer. It's passe. You got to go old school typewriter. Sign it in blood. Maybe, maybe put newspaper clipping letters on the envelope, you know, another bad sign. If you, it's like writer's block. How you know you've got it really bad is when you're on eBay looking at typewriters, like you're fucked. You're so fucked. Cause you're like, the problem is the keyboard man. I'm thoughts, not my creativity. I've got it all right here. I just need an antiquated machine. I'll give you one. I'll give you one further. Every time I go on eBay, I'm in a bad place. I'm never on eBay buying things because things are good. I'm doing it. So I have something to look forward to or fucking jump off a roof. I have never gone on eBay in a nice state of mind ever. Like every time it's the, it's really though. eBay is the bottom of the barrel for me. It's like, this means I've gone through all of Reddit conspiracy. This means I have doom scrolled everywhere and all that's left is go on eBay and look at haunted dolls, which is a very interesting genre of, I'm serious man, haunted dolls on eBay. Have you ever checked them out? No. What is this? This is called capitalism. This is ultra capitalism. So what people do is they go to a thrift store and they buy a creepy looking doll and then they put it on eBay, like sell it for 5,000 times more than they bought it for. And they just say, this is an extremely haunted doll and people want to buy haunted shit. So they're like, God damn, let's buy a haunted doll and they buy this shit. I'm haunted. Somebody buy me. My head is a haunted house. You could money into me. You've got to take the first step. I'm telling you the haunted doll business. It's hot haunted dolls, haunted boxes on the dark web. You can get, I went through this whole thing. Like you can go on YouTube, the opening of haunted boxes bought from the dark web. It's a whole thing where people will order a fucking haunted box from no, they don't know who it is. Like this will, and it's horrible in like the sales pitch is just like it will ruin your life. There's demons in the box. You should never open this box. And then they film themselves opening the box, sent to them from some Eastern European fucking entrepreneur inside is just chicken guts, ecstasy, yeah, there's drugs, they'll send drugs in the box. That's why I've got this, this Ghostbusters trap. To get all the spirits. You need it. You need it. You, you, I guess some people just want to be cursed, you know, like they're so bored with their life. I wonder if it's a thing of like, you know, they're, they're haunted boxes, but do they ever do mystery boxes? Like you don't know what spirit's going to come. You just bid on it and it's like, you'll get a random spirit. Yeah. That's kind of what it is. They don't say what comes in your shitty box. They just say it's going to fuck up your life. So there, there might be a thumb. I mean, this is from like, this is, this is, dude, this is from, um, uh, what's that movie? Uh, that, that hostile. This is from the darkened lands. You know, this is like people who, who do communicate with Odin and they don't, they just are like, yeah, put Sven's thumb in. What do you mean? And then they'll just, yeah, body parts. Are they just shipping out the ingredients of a witch's cauldron? It's a great way to dispose of a body. It's like, wow, somebody up, you're in, you're in wherever balleris, you're out there. You have been, you know, you've got another body on your hands. It's like you're sick of like the normal disposal methods. You just chop them up and send them out in dark web boxes. I mean, it, what is the shipping on that fucking expensive? I mean, that's why the, that's why the box is on, uh, the dark web costs. I mean, I don't even go on the dark web. I went on there once. I, I, I had my acting like I'm a hacker. I've been on there once. Like I got creeped out and never went on it again. I was, I wanted to do a joke of like, uh, remember when there was that rumor that Wayfair was shipping child sex slaves in furniture? That was crazy. Right? Anyway, uh, does anyone want, uh, Shae's lounge unused Shae's lounge. Yeah. That was a real, that was a fun one. That was like peak QAnon hysteria there. Uh, I went on the, did you check it out? I went on the Wayfair site to like sort of examine this overpriced furniture and it seemed like it was like an AI had just fucked up. Like they have an AI that kind of populates it with bullshit and AI had just gotten confused or whatever. Definitely. Probably, I'm sure there's like better ways to sell your kid than to like go up, like create a fake Wayfair furniture account. Right? Yeah. I mean, literally, there's got to be a better way to sell kids. Yeah. I mean, I don't know, I'm, I'm a fan of the good old faction auction. You know, yeah, whatever happened is bidding, bidding in the market, you know, whatever happened to that, man? I mean, I don't want to get political and everything. And I, you know, I don't want to get all dismal and shit, but you remember those days you'd go to the child market and it was like, it was fun. You'd get caramel corn pizza and then you just, you know, child. Who wants to, who wants to fucking buy a kid? Yeah. That's the other thing. What are you doing? Like it's like five million times worse than a puppy. Like it's going to, what are you going to do with that? It's good. Oh yeah. I mean, a puppy you've got 12, 16 years, maybe a kid 18 plus you're not, you got to hide them. You're going to spend all, I mean, it's just too much work. Who's got the time we're so like the most naive idiots on earth. We think child traffickers are like putting them through college. Oh, that's so funny. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You got to get them to sporting events. You got to sign them up for camp. I mean, it's just such a responsibility. It's too much. Why are they doing that to themselves? Kids are so expensive, the food, medicine, you got to get their vaccine, medicine, vaccine. What do they need braces? My God. Jesus. Yeah, that's got to suck when you, when you buy your kid and the shipment, the Wayfair shipment comes and you open it up and you're like, Hey, you're home now. Can I get you a smack and cheese? Can I see your teeth? Yeah. Fuck. Fuck. You just got your braces off and now you got to get your wisdom teeth out. When does it stop? This episode has been sponsored by BetterHelp. You're something you should ask yourself. Are you spending any time on yourself at all? Are you out there spending all your time dealing with your life and other people? It's a very strange thing we do. Shula Prabhupada, the founder of the Hare Christ, has described this way of living like polishing a bird cage and not feeding the bird. You got to feed the bird and the best way to feed your mental bird. This is not on the sheet they want me to read. The best way to feed that birdie is to go to therapy. I love therapy. I swear by therapy, the only direct advice Ramdas ever gave me was unique therapy. He was right. At the time, I really needed therapy. He wasn't joking. He said it with a big grin on his face because he's Ramdas, but I needed therapy. So I went to therapy and it changed my life and I guarantee it'll change yours too.

You just got your braces off and now you're going to get your wisdom teeth out. When does it stop? Fuck! I'm never ordering from Wayfair again. Yeah, leaving a negative review about the child you received from Wayfair. The child I received from Wayfair does not pay attention in karate. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're not applying to themselves and they have really bad ADHD. I don't like it. There is some creepy statistic I read, maybe not true, that said human trafficking is one of the number one industries on the planet. Did you read that? No, it's so bleak. It's so sad. It's so sad. It makes me sad because I never traveled as a child and I feel like that could have really helped me out. These kids get to see the world. But I mean, how does that even, I just, I guess I don't understand how it works. Like first you got to procure the kid, packaging, like how do you even send a kid in a box? What do they put them into? Do they wrap them in bubble tape or is it? I don't know. Well, I mean, every kid's allergic to peanuts, so you can't use those, you know, styrofoam peanuts anymore. So how do you, how do you, I got to get a trafficker on the show. Yeah, yeah, man. Yeah, just hang out in a Greyhound station, you'll find one. You know, this is I think why sex robots are a good thing. I think it's going to take care of a lot of the human trafficking problem, like just robots in general, like humans are difficult to work with, you know, but once we get robots going, it's going to kill the child trafficking business. It's probably going to fuck up the economy because who wants to order a human slave when you can order like a robot? It's legal. It gets upgrades, you know what I mean? No one's going to do it anymore. Like I'm sure that there's a lot of human traffickers out there who are shaking in their boots right now. It's going to be interesting when self-driving Mack trucks deliver the robot child sex robots. It's like, man, we've really gotten the human aspect out of everything. Out of everything. All that's left is just fucking self-driving cars, Mack trucks, baristas or robots and just everyone's just inside fucking their sex robot. That's all it is. There's no one goes outside in every home. People are just fucking their sex robot. You go to your friend's house. He's got a nicer sex robot than you. You know, it's going to be that like, you know, the my least favorite kind of car commercial is where the dude is in his driveway with his new shit car. It's some dumb car and his neighbor is jealous. You know that genre of car commercials? It's so, no one cares about your car. Do you know how many commercials I've auditioned for where I'm the jealous neighbor? And they're like, okay, so you're mowing your lawn and you pop your head up over the fence and go, uh, for tourists, it's the saddest, worst car. It's a lease. You own the fucking car. You got it for no money down. It's a shit car and your neighbor acts like the, the grail, the arc of the covenant is in your fucking driveway car, car companies, man. They really are like just the worst when it comes to social engineering. They're just, they, they, they either play on jealousy or they play on the dream of a new life. Like somehow they try to tie that car up and like your life is starting over. They're always, they're always driving in nice neighborhoods and the family's happy. There needs to be a real car commercial where it's just a dad yelling at the kids to shut up in the back. Yeah. The husband and wife are trying to not get divorced. They turn the music up so the kids won't hear them arguing. Yeah. And he's like, just no more fucking Taylor Swift, you bitch. There's, there's fucking cans, beer cans rolling around. God damn it. Do you know he couldn't afford this shit, you bitch. It's not going to fix anything. You fuck Darrell. You're going to make me late for my GED class. You're going to fuck Darrell. You're going to fuck Darrell in this one too. You're going to fuck him in the back. Stop, stop crying back there. I thought this car would fix everything, but it can't just doesn't do it anymore. That's what, you know what, what they need to do is like the car commercial version of that would be they're driving in this car, kids are in the backseat. Taylor Swift is playing and the guy looks over at her and he's like, you know what, it's okay that you fuck Darrell. And then like happy music plays, like the car fixed the adultery. That's what we need. There are the other car commercial, which is a family related, family related one says two things. One, the car you're driving in is 100% going to kill your family to if you if you buy this car, your family will live happily forever. That's the other genre of it is my, I love the outdoors. So that that's the other genre is like now that you have this Range Rover, you were going to be like driving off road through the Grand Canyon or something with your, with your love at a time when now more than ever, people are never leaving the house. They're like, yeah. This is so unrealistic. The family's driving go camping. It's like nobody does that anymore. It's like the phone camera commercials. Like whenever they're trying to sell a foot, no one gives a fuck about the phone function anymore. No one cares about the internet function. All they have left is the camera and so those commercials give you the impression you're going to get into extreme sports if you buy, you know, it's like it's all it's dudes doing backflips on fucking half pipes and like doing like wing suiting. You get this fucking phone. You are going to be so active. You won't even believe the reason you're not active right now is not because you're a flabby pussy. The reason you're not active right now is your phone sucks, man. You have a better camera, but that's not relatable. Make it for Americans. Make it for us. A camera that makes your dick look better in a dick. Ah, now there you go. Jesus Christ, Ian, you need to get on the phone right now with Apple because that, you know what? It's one of these fucking stupid phones. I can't remember which one the selling point is it, do you know about this, the moon scam? No. Okay. The selling point was you can finally film the moon. Not only can you finally film the moon. This fucker will zoom in on the moon, like the Hubble telescope and you're going to get like, it's like a moon telescope. It's not just a phone. So people started getting suspicious because they realized that the moon it's zooming in on, it seems to be kind of the same moon. It's like not the moon they're looking at. And all it was doing was taking and knew you were looking at the moon and then using like augmented reality to superimpose a preset moon. And you would zoom in and be like, Oh my God, this is insane. Honey, come over here and look, will you stop fucking Daryl? Look at it. How good this picture is. And it was fake. It was a whole scam. It was like AR moon. That's so terrifying. We're living in hell. I mean, God damn it. Yeah. Well, I mean, the, it is interesting that like, I mean, there was probably a time there's been, there's laws that are exist in existence now. We just take it for granted, but at some point those laws didn't exist. No one had made the law before the law existed. I don't know what the law I'm thinking of, but I'm certainly there's new laws that get at it all the time because people exploit the system. But we, yeah, we don't have the laws we need right now. There's laws we need that just don't exist. And it's like, you know, the person who made the ozempic commercial. Do you watch TV much? No. You know the song? Oh, oh, oh, ozempic. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know that's okay. I get that confused with O, O, O'Reilly's auto parts. Is there an O, O, O'Reilly's? Those motherfuckers stole the O'Reilly's auto parts. Yeah, yeah. Oh-oh-oh, o-oh, o-oh, o-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh, o-oh-oh. That should be illegal. Like do you ever made the song? The musicians involved. The writer of the song. The person who funded the song that should be like a five year prison sentence. Like they should know and they're making the song. Oh yeah, whoever made, whoever! Whoever made the cars for kids commercials should be drawn and quartered in a public square Listen, you're a little more extreme, but you would be welcome on our council of judgment Thank you Love to have you we could have it like the points of a pentagram everyone sits on a point Then we all sort of we have I don't know blood marbles or something to vote marbles made of the crystallized blood of People who've made shitty commercials and you just drop them in and then boom Whoever is like making this MK ultra shit goes to jail for you or drawn and quartered I won't protest if people vote drawn quartered with drawn quarter. I'll be the I'll quarter I'll whatever the I'll tie the fucking rope to the hoof. I mean I mean why not two for one the the blood and body parts We draw from them. We put in a box and sell them on the dark web and make Millions curse curse boxes curse boxes from the council of six We're the ones who put those in big I mean You when you think about it though like the The the studio sessions for recording the ozympics song like what's the energy in the room when you're recording? Pharmaceutical companies music like it can't be good like the energy in the room is just or My real fear is that like obviously I've thought about this too much. Is it You know after a really good ozympic take somebody in the studio was like Incredible that was incredible You know like they're so oblivious to What their lives have turned into that it's flipped to the other side. We're like Jesus God. I told you Greg would be good Yeah, did you hear that it they they act like when the wonders from that movie hear their song on the radio for the first time Running around screaming Running around screaming babe, babe, it's me daddy. Is that you? Oh God that fight the other one that is like permanently burnt into my head is Nothing is everything. You know that one. No, it's guys. It goes things are getting clear I can see bump bump bump bump up Nothing is everything It's for this. It's an eczema Cream it's an eczema cream It's Man, you are healthy you ride bikes You're out there in the world. You're anytime I talk to someone it's a test honestly like if you seeing the The the Sky Rizzy commercial to someone and they've never heard it. It means their life is better than yours It's just there's no way around it. Your life is better than mine You're if you've avoided that commercial. It says so many things. You don't watch Fox news you Problem you don't you don't go on the internet that much you don't you're not blasting your mind with filth Yeah, I mean instead, you know, I'm a pillar of health. I'm a two-pack a day's smoker And I'm like, yeah, I don't need pharmaceutical commercials Even though I'm gonna be on every medication ever when I'm dying from lung cancer Well, look, I mean what look do you but you're but you're my it's you know You see the shits of wild animals and they're just just worms you inside of wild animals They're just yeah, I once I was on this this island and I saw a deer Just covered in fucking mosquitoes and pox and pus and you know, this is like the real Bambi This is a fucking creature that should be it's just a walking blood bag and it's a it's a host organism Right, that's me for you're clean. You're pure. You don't have the sky or you don't wake up with nothing is everything You don't wake up with it something that was definitely created by people who for sure spent time at the CIA I do for sure have interrogated the Taliban and Or poor people that weren't in the Taliban and they just Couldn't have the an understanding of the language so they just assume they're guilt Yeah, yeah, right that decision. You're you're out there You're a farmer the next thing you know stormtroopers have thrown you in a cargo jet And then you're just on some island that represents like a liminal space It's not really the United States. Yeah, yeah And they think because you're saying you don't know anything and you're pleading that you're just holding out and if they torch you enough You'll tell us something. Yeah, you got all these new agents are like, hey, can we try my thing? I'm telling you Please try my new Synthetic cortisol mixed with PCP VR will make this fucking asshole sing like a bird Mm-hmm, you know, just people lining up to test their projects people lining up to Like hey, I know this doesn't necessarily have to do with interrogating the prisoner But I did notice he's got a pretty blazing case of eczema I was just gonna say let's get some ozampic in them and see what he says All of them all of them all of them ozampic sky Rizzy These are just fucking interrogation medications that didn't work to manipulate the prisoners and now they're like, well Somehow their eczema got better. Yeah, we could price fucking well, I I will say what I found interesting is um With a lot of like depression and anxiety medications They'll run these ads and you'll notice in every ad they go ask your doctor about Slippity slap and With psychiatrists, and I don't know how it is with you know other doctors that are giving you like medicine and antibiotics and stuff but with psychiatry and everything they don't really know how that Medicine is gonna affect you and sometimes you have to say to your doctor. Oh, I've read up on a fexer Can we try that and the doctor will be like, oh, yeah, you know, I haven't really thought of that sure So it's like these commercials are putting your own Livelihood in your own hands because the doctors are just throwing shit at the wall to see what'll stick and half the time You got to be on a medication for six months Just to see if the side effects go away and it works and afterwards you're like, oh, it doesn't work They're like, well, let's start it over again. Just why so many people have a hard time with medication Well, and don't forget a lot of these companies they they pay doctors they come in they have these PR campaigns They lube up the docs. So you go in and you mention Hey, oh Zempick, what do you think and the doctor will be like? Oh, yeah Oh, oh, oh Zempick fuck. Yeah, because I don't know this for sure But I think they're they might get some kind of bonus or you know if they prescribe it They get the whole thing is insane like it's in other countries. It's illegal for pharmaceutical companies to advertise You can't yeah, I mean, dude, there's a book called dreamland I think Samuel Kenyonis. I may be Butchering the the name of the author, but it's an incredible read about the opiate crisis and how Doctors were incentivized and also at the same time They were kind of bullied into giving opiates because at a certain point they changed They kind of made Doctor visits like a Yelp review where the patient would be like they would review the doctor And if they didn't get the medication they wanted they would get the doctor a little review So in order to save their job, the doctor would just give the patient whatever they wanted so that then the patient would be like, yeah 10 out of 10 and And then doctors would just and they were getting paid per visit So if they saw 12 patients in a day in and out in an hour prescribing the medication It'd be a lot faster than taking an hour or two to go through the patient's medical history This at the other and it was just so insidious and it's got satan. We are it It's worse than brave new world. It's where it would brave new world. This is kind of or is like utopian in this dark way people were Fucking each other on these like awesome Psychedelics this version of it is just like yeah, the doctor the doctors have been beaten down They need the business. They got the student loan debt They can't fuck off and like not prescribe synthetic heroin to people people don't want also they at some point You just realize as a doctor. They don't want to get better. They want to get high. That's all they want They they're not coming to me because they want to feel better physically and exercise it It's not even gonna just give them the fucking oxy Codone or whatever it is.

There was a pillow doctor In la that people started hearing about they're like you go there. You just ask him Whatever you want, he'll prescribe it for you. He does not give a shit about you So I went there because I'd heard about this new speed that fighter pilots were taking and I was really curious I read all these articles that said it enhances your IQ. So I go to this fucking doctor The waiting room just filled with old people who need like morphine or whatever. He had his own pharmacy in the Waiting room like the way in in front of the waiting room is a pharmacist. So I go in with this doctor And I'm like, uh, didn't even did we didn't even pretend He wasn't like, let me take your pulse or anything. He's like, so what what's what's going on? I'm like, well, have you heard of this shit medoffin all or And he's like, no, he had this dick exit and then I'm like, well, I want to take it And he's like, what is it? And I'm like some kind of fighter pilot speed and he's like, whoa And he looks it up. He googles it. He's like, well, he asked me he goes. What dosage do I give you? And I'm like, I have no idea. Wow. I'm not a I don't I don't know then he googles it And he's like writes a prescription for me right there and and then he's like, do you need anything else? I'm like, no, this is good. When was it left? When was this this was He got arrested. This was so long ago. It just didn't work. He was just writing scripts getting rid But he got busted. They shut him down. Thank god. But yeah, I mean those doctors are out there, man They they they're like the Sith lords of doctors. They just want to they just want that fucking insurance money for Did they get when you come in? Yes, it's wild in in so many industries whether it's social services Public servants or even, you know doctors people stop Becoming people to you at a certain point and you just are earning a paycheck and then people turn into paperwork And I feel like your your soul and your consciousness leaves you and you're just Doing a job instead of like sitting back and going. Oh I think I'm truly facilitating evil right now Yeah, yeah, well you you it's like I I think you know a few rotten clients. I think you know you after You you don't see the the normal sick people that you're helping You just remember the person who sued you or you remember the You know that somebody you fucked up your your doctor life a little bit or whatever and yeah, you just I I mean, I think people like us make the big assumption That everyone is like us, you know, like you assume like yeah, I know I'm not the best person in the world You're no one's the best person in the world, but We make the assumption that there's people trying after they yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, who they go home. They made a mistake. They said something rotten to somebody They were in a bad state of mind and it bothers them as opposed to like people just the moment The the interaction has happened where they said the worst thing they could say to somebody or or fuck someone's life up They're not thinking about it two minutes later. It's not even on their minds. They're just You you ever play like nasty monopoly? No, what is that? Well, it sounds a lot more fun than you know, just where you start playing monopoly in the game turns mean Oh, I thought it was a version that like Mattel was selling like adult monopoly. I was like, oh, what's nasty? Instead of buying property you buy people and you sell them. Yeah Yeah, nasty monopoly, baby. What are you willing to do for park plaza? Yeah, there's no money in nasty monopoly, but it does dispense lube You it's got lube dispensers on every the the you're getting out of pegging free card The the I just think some people that that's how they live like they when I'm like that moment you let yourself go evil on monopoly And you know, this is just monopoly, but I'm gonna be evil. I'm gonna like be put play the part of a of a beast And then the game's over and like, you know Whatever your friends again. I think people They play life like that. So they you know, if you look at trump the trump The way he acts is the way I act when I'm playing monopoly and being mean, right? You know the you look at like biden. It's like another version of like Mean monopoly player They I don't think they look at the world like we do. You know, I think you're totally right and and I think, you know Unfortunately and also, you know, I'm not a part of this group And I don't plan to be but I think a lot of it comes from parenting I think a lot of people anyone can be a parent, but to be a good parent It takes a lot of work and instilling values and instilling these ideas of Consequences and like actually really being in someone's life has long-term lasting effects And I think a lot of people are poorly parented and it's just generationally repeated And on top of that, you know, uh on the flip side Anyone can be corrupted with money and power. So no matter how good you are or how good your intentions once you start Getting money and power. You're going to completely change and if you aren't rooted in good foundation of growth and You know something instilled in you you're your House of cards is easier to fall. I will say You know what we need We need a summer camp for wayward billionaires where like you take these shitty billionaires You put them in this camp You don't get your phone You're there with other wayward billionaires and you you do group activities Learn to build fires together Rowing I don't know uh prayer circles. Oh, you can do your anxiety coloring book, which is what I had to do in rehab Anxiety coloring. Yeah, you draw what your anxiety looks like and for me it was just pictures of parents fighting Oh my god, dude. Yeah, this is like you I think you nailed it. I mean, it's it's it's never one thing But I do it's like why are parents bad parents or parents bad parents because they're evil? No, no Parents are many parents or shitty parents because they're being crushed Under the heel of capitalism They fucking can't afford they the kids need cheese. They need bread. They need fucking milk You got a it's like you got a pick. Do you want hungry kids or kids who aren't hungry but are at a Garbage preschool. Totally. I've heard stories of these preschools, dude. Like the in in communism uh The idea was the state becomes your parents. So you you're your parent the the What are the nuclear family or whatever? This is bull this is bullshit. It produces too much Too many problems within a nuclear family. You you if you're you can't really control stage one Mental manipulation because the parents who knows what they are. They're gonna tell the kids that they're Gonna go to hell if they die or they're gonna tell the kids that god is more important than the state or they're gonna fill the minds With antiquated filth. So the idea is you separate get the kids educated early on to know the state is mommy and daddy and mommy and daddy are just members of society, but they're They're secondary to the state capitalism It's this chaotic version of that like we like to think we're not separating the children from the parents But we sure as fuck are but instead of sending them to like a state facility where they're like whatever saluting general Mao they're in a A preschool that smells like a fucking internment camp It smells like a civil war hospital. I've heard stories man. These kids are just on the floor crying There's too many kids not enough people. So This is the this this so you see a parent out in the world Who's just trying to like care for their the kids they love And and they know that's happening. They have to go pick them up from there. They know that look on their kids face Is not the glassy Kids got the look on his face like he was at some famous world war two battle or something and he can't Articulate to you what happened. He pulls his pacifier out of his mouth like a cigarette. He's like I've seen some bad things Mommy I saw some shit Yeah, yeah, yeah, they see sh- they and and Dude, we're touring schools man and like Try to get our kid in a good school and like in front of us. There's like, you know a line of these kids in front of us at one of these schools this teacher bends down gets in the face of a three-year-old And and like does like prison guard shit to the three of you will behave And then marches these poor kids to their to their classroom. It's like so you have like this combination of Parents who want to be good parents This is probably mine me being very naive. I think that's generally what parents want But they can't they got they're working two three jobs So they got to fucking offload these kids to preschools and god knows where else and so So these kids are just getting bumpered around capitalism and that's the thing too It's like you can be the best parent in the world But at some point it's out of your control like you know what you can do everything you can But once you put them on that school bus man And then the other kids that weren't parented well will influence your kid and this and that and then you take them to the school And they're not managed well and it's just like I mean man I God bless you so much for being a parent and a good parent and there's so many out there, but it's just I've I've kind of accepted the fact that I I know in my heart of hearts. I could be a good parent I just also know in my heart of hearts. I don't have the dedication to it because i'm too Self-involved right now Hold on Yeah, but that's okay boy What are you doing in the fucking studio? Go give me a fucking cigar There's glass on the floor have mommy put bandages on your feet I told you to wear shoes Yeah, I love my kids and Um, you know This is that what you're saying there. I this and I don't know if you really actually feel any kind of like non reproducing guilt, but I think this is Perfectly Fine and and really good like like Having kids is is like, you know it When it's time like it's it's It's very primordial like you your body you meet somebody Your pheromones match up in some way that you will never understand And something clicks in your brain and you decide to have kids like they they did a study where They did genetic testing on like a group of dudes and a group of women and they took Matches they they basically like I'm sorry. They took the clothes the t-shirts these guys have been wearing their stinky ass shirts Put them in ziplock bags and had the women choose a mate based on the smell of their shirt. No Yes, and like 90% or something of the women Picked the perfect genetic match just from the smell of the shirt and it's beautiful the ones Where it got fucked up where it got fucked up Is Apparently I think the women on birth control. Yes, I was gonna say There wasn't there a study about women on and off birth control with pheromones and smell And it led to like divorce or some sort of like mismatch or something Because it affects your your sense and smell and and biology so much Watch out if your partner gets off birth control, which is probably not the worst decision They might just suddenly be like you smell like shit They they just they just will get they suddenly are just sexually disinterested in you Because they now their body is telling them do not reproduce with that motherfucker Like you are going to make some fucked up babies if you reproduce with that person And then they all this is happening like in the subbasement of your Body like you don't know you're just all of a sudden you're like god I hate the way he holds their remote control, but really your your body is telling you you fucking reproduce with that guy You know, you're gonna make a fucking goblin. Don't do it. Yeah. Well, I I'll say when I'm So into someone and I'm in a relationship. I'm such a pheromone guy like I don't want them to wear deodorant I want to like sniff their armpits and they'll like put their nose in my ear And stuff or like I'll get done working out or riding my bike and they'll be like Well, don't don't go in the shower. Like smell is so important And it's so fucked up with birth control does to the female body and With with hormones and changes and then you get off it and you have this whole new sense of smell and attraction And it's just again back to pharmaceuticals and and how it just Completely destroys humanity as it should naturally be, you know Yeah, man. I mean we it's just so many different Like Untraceable factors are mixed in with us at this point. Like we got You know, we're getting our dope. We're all dopamine addicts. Like we're all getting high on our phones. Yeah add to that you know birth control mixed in with You know, I I I I believe in Telepathy I believe that they're everyone puts out some kind of I don't know pulse or or or whatever you want to call it quantum entanglement or some kind of general signal emanates from a person meaning that like the old model of meeting people at a bar at a restaurant at a club at a museum It you you what's happening there are all these like natural synchronistic Patterns or convergences are happening and then you meet someone in this very normal natural way That I I know this Go ahead. I don't care. Make fun of everyone makes fun. I don't care. No. No. No. I'm listening I'm telling you the I'm wasn't talking to you. I was just in my mind I have a contingent of people on the internet who are like just Rolling their eyes vomiting. I I you know, like when you have kids you get this weird feeling like Did the kids have something to do with me meeting this person? Like how involved Was I in this situation? How much control did I have in this situation? How much of of of this was just some souls wanting to come into the universe? Through this particular portal For it to deal with the karma that I'm going to like inevitably like pass on to them I don't know man, but you throw tender and grind or all the fucking electronic ways of meeting people and You're you're eliminating this huge 3d space that's used at the spatiality that was involved in reproduction. It's it's like everything's getting compressed to the screen And then what kind of kids are coming out of that? Well, also, you know, I and and certainly I'm not the first one to say it but the the whole meeting online thing It's it's such a mind fucking terms of like, okay. When do we move? From the app to texting when did we move from texting to seeing each other and then just am I texting too much? I've heard of this thing called like a double text. You're not supposed to text two texts at once or like this or that And now there's this new thing where girls get the ick where if they see you like You know use your straw wrong. They're like, oh ick. I can't be with you and it's like what the fuck What is happening? And and there was something to be said about like distance even when you were living in a world where someone was You know, maybe living in your same neighborhood or a 10 minute drive if you weren't constantly attached to them with the phone You still at that distance Which would make you look forward to seeing each other more But I find for me the phone makes things so hot and heavy so fast that it almost runs out of steam because everything is so accessible And it's listen to you you Chad. What you're a Chad. What's a Chad? You're like dude, I've seen you you've got like serious game like you're assuming like that's the normal Reality for most dudes like you've got like crazy mystical Game like I've seen you do that. I've seen it man. It's like Yo, shut the fuck. Did I get out you? I'm sorry. I didn't mean to No, I don't know what you're talking about. Okay. Oh, I know you don't it's all a mystery Isn't it? I don't know I don't know how I do a triple back flip I get that funny. I get that funny feeling in my feet and then I'm flipping back Three times How did I how did I break that world record? I don't know It's a mystery. I guess it's just the mercury must not be in retrograde You got people lining up to fuck you at shows Yeah, but I 99% of the time I don't do it because I'm at the point now where I just kind of want a connection And the the fleeting moment of coming is no longer Attractive to me. Don't get me wrong. Sometimes I'll do one time after show a girl came up to me and she goes You're such a weirdly attractive little man. Can I just smell you and I was like, okay And she smelled me and was like look I don't know what you're doing tonight, but I will do whatever you want. I was like, oh god Wow, yeah, wow. Wow. Okay. Now. Let me tell you what you just did. So I I don't this I'm sure you've read the statistic Uh on the amount of single dudes out there right now It's horrifying like 70 for I think 70% or some massive percentage of guys are are single hopelessly single completely depressed completely frustrated What you just did Would be similar like if we were doing a podcast in a famine In a lake during a famine and I'm like, I don't want you to be eating You know it's worse than that worse than that. You're just like, you know, I'm just not in it to be full anymore I'm a foodie now. I'm looking for like that special taco. I really just want a A gourmet sandwich. I just don't want by the way, man. I think it's great I hope I don't seem like I'm throwing shade. I like you deserve you deserve it. You're fucking hilarious. You're you're brilliant You're a sweet guy like why not but yeah, man I think that and and also I've been off the scene for Five years now. So I don't even know what's going on out there. Like I don't even know Any more I I well, thank you. That was very kind of you I love love and like I want I want my heart to come. I'm tired of coming for my weiner. I want my heart to come and feel that feeling all the time and yeah, I But it is very hard to be in a relationship in terms of like I mean, dude, I'm only in the city for like three days a week. I'm on the road every weekend Which is wonderfully amazing, but it's just it's so hard to leave someone and to be away and not available And whatever whatever but I love love so much I would love to be able to be like a matchmaker and try to help guys come out of that depression and help them Find someone and help women find someone that would like love them and support them like I love Love and I love when my friends Find people and they're they I can see their relationship blossom and I love When like you you're in such a love relationship and and that love is building through other human like that That makes my heart smile so much and I I hope for that for me one day But I think for now I've kind of resigned myself to the fact that I'm just uh going to have to In enjoy and embrace my solitude rather than my loneliness, but I would like like if I get approached after a show I would be like, you know, that's very kind Maybe but why don't we find you a guy here that you know We can dish about and and I'll help you to be happy, you know Yeah, yeah, why don't we find a guy here to watch us fuck? Let's find a really not for you and me I've turned into a Victorian woman of like, I don't know sir, please. I'll tell you Get to know me. That's very No, that's very that's very sweet. You know, you will they're out they're out there, man It's like you will find them like and you do as a comic you you have to find somebody who is capable of Not being so attached to you that they can't deal with the fact that you're you're a traveling person and when you find that person then You know, it's great. It's it's like you it's great because you know, this is another thing that gets left out uh And I the romantic love thing is Is is that that's the It's the one of the main reasons to be alive probably but I'd do that When you manage somehow in this insane universe to And and with your neurotic Programming at least my neurotic programming totally talk. I know you're open about your you manage to find somebody and work through all that shit And like accomplish harmony with that person Then it's like the value Of having someone in your life who like Where you're both helping each other Yeah With all the little shit you're all just the shit you're doing yourself right now or suddenly someone is like, you know like erin She will not let me cancel a fucking show like if if i'm feeling lazy Which is very common for me. I'm getting that like you know that thing where you're looking at your phone and you're thinking man It's not that important. Yeah, they have other comics. He'll go up. Yeah, she will be like no No, you're going to go good. I need that. You're too brilliantly good to just silence yourself because you're a fat lazy piece of shit He says shit get the fuck out there you motherfucker. I need another refrigerator Well, you know, I will say you know talking about the cosmically connected and finding that Partner and love relationship, you know, and I've talked about this before and you know it is that around this time of year I always get kind of My in may it'll be 30 years since my dad died So this this time of year is very uh You know and also I've outlived him. I'm older now than he was when he died So it's like kind of heavy on my mind a lot, but Wow, you know the the idea of like love and and cosmic relation I I think I've told you before years ago. I found Old journals of his when he was like 24 25 yeah He would write in his journal there There were all these entries there after day and for the date He would write like December 3rd and then it would be crossed out and it would say November 3rd and and he did that like five Times and then after a while he went I don't know why I keep writing December Something magical must be happening in that month. I'll keep my heart my eyes open to it But the month of December is calling me And uh, he met my mom in December Wow And for some reason the whole month of november he kept writing the date as December and he recognized something was Wow was coming and then he would call my mom his moon woman because he said when he when he spent time with her He felt like he had known her for many moons. So Wow Dad was really romantic. Yeah, that's so cool. Yeah, so beautiful. You know the so Talking about dead parents, uh, so So A few weeks ago I got weird and you know, it's somebody would like to press gets depression and shit sometimes and like, you know I'm pretty attuned to the warning signs. I try to be at least and like But in a lot of times I could just make sense of why like it's it's inevitably my own fault. I'm staying up too late I'm not exercising. I'm not taking vitamins. I'm not doing whatever But this one I I I couldn't identify it and I'm acting like I'll grumpy and shit and Aaron is like What is going on with you? Like what is happening? And I'm like, I don't know. I'm sorry. I just I got a guy I just I'm gonna have to spend some time by myself and like figured out Anyway, I'll all of a sudden I'm like, when did my mom die? Google it I had to google when my mom died It was that day And like yeah, and then I talked to my friends as a psychiatrist. He's like, oh, yeah That's a whole thing like seasonal triggers with grief and some people They don't realize that happens. They're just all of a sudden they're all pissed and like angry and neuratic and It's because they you know the moment I connected it because like I'd been for like a few nights. I'd been like Laying in bed about to fall asleep and like, why do I want to sob? I feel like I'm about to start crying What the fuck is happening to me? It was really a nerving man But that's grief is so weird. So I get what you're saying is we get closer to when you're when you lost your dad Because yeah, all the triggers the spring. Yeah, all these things the smells everything is like Bringing you back to that. Yeah, and and I was I I went back to visit my mom And it's the same house we've been in, you know, and and it's you know, it's been me and her for like 80 years 80 years since I was eight for like 30 years and I was sitting on the front step and I was smoking a cigarette the sun was going down We had just eaten dinner and I'm like man, my dad used to do this He would sit outside have his after-dinner cigarette and I'm like I'm standing in the same steps I'm older than him. This is like a very I'm at the same house. It's like a very surreal moment, you know And there's there's beauty in that but also at the same time, you know, you saying that kind of makes me realize Man, I've been in this wavy funk lately and I have to recognize A it just happens B There are legitimate things and I would always be I could spend so long get over it get over it and and I've made so much progress but at the same time I am allowed to To let it not affect me but kind of have waves of it and not get mad at myself for it But that's so interesting that I mean, how long has it been since your mother died 2013 yeah I mean in a way That's almost beautiful that it's not weighing you down so much as to be dreading the day Letting the date affect you like I had a beautiful. Oh, no, it's not healthy like that. It's not healthy like that It's like me not wanting to remember it's there's nothing healthy of it Yeah, no, I wish it was like a no, there's nothing really enlightened or spiritual about my relationship with that grief. It's still fucked up Well, there goes my theory. I was trying to It was I wish it was sweet. Listen. I wanted to be I I would apply. I mean I wanted to be like, oh, yes Yeah, that's probably why that's because it's your mom's dad's only a baby minds on minds An old almost going to get a retirement check 30 years. Come on now Oh, come on. There's no time and grief time the time space continuum does not work with fucking grief Unfortunately, there's no time It doesn't seem to be based in they say time heals all wounds. But guess what pal their clocks must be broken Yeah, fuck you. Fuck you riverside. Fuck you ozympic So, you know, man, the thing is you What I realized after this last bout with it is It's like, okay You can't see anymore I had the perfect zit on my cheek. Okay, but it was like I could feel it was like a cyst I knew if I popped it it would be the most glorious explosion of pus But I couldn't it was right. It was a little too deep to get out So like I went meth head man. I was like trying to get in there. I just I It was obsessively like I want this fucking thing to pop, you know, it's it's my subconscious It's all my repressed everything just get it out and and and so anyway Like the when when grief comes to the surface is no different and like the worst thing you can do is Not Not let it express itself through you because it is held in your body, man It is held and and when you expel it, it's not just like you feel better than But you're like so like I my I used to have back problems Like the more shit like that you get out of you physiologically The more like your body feels better because your your poor body is like holding all that stuff in it and and then when you Expunge it Which is why anytime the grief zit shows up Pop that shit like get it out. Let it let it explode That's Alan Watts Yeah, well, you know the back holds so much stress and everything and like the last time I saw you In Austin a couple weeks ago My back and neck weren't so much pain. I I couldn't leave my bed And you you really helped me by by getting me that massage but my best friends also my doctor and we FaceTime and he got me on these like steroids and uh, you know, I'd be pro for and everything but I was incredibly stressed out. My mind was racing. You know, I had just gotten out of my relationship All this stuff was happening and it it just centered itself in my body, you know Yeah, yeah, that's where the it's in there, man. It just gets in there. It's in there and and Anytime you get to have like a breakdown or like, you know, anytime you get to volcano that shit out It's such a good opportunity. It's so sad the people Hold that hold on to that stuff. It's you know, it's like I get it. It's embarrassing to weep It's embarrassing. You're so you have to you have to weeping is good You got to let yourself weep and shake and snot and ugly cry, you know ugly cry. Yeah, you got to do that I mean, you know, you're gonna get you're gonna get like emotional blue balls And that shows up as like fizzy that can show up is like fizzy. Sorry, man. I told my kids not to fucking landscape You know how hard it is to find a toddler fucking leaf blower like they can't carry the full-size leaf blower so you got to get them this like It has bro leaf blower and they are loud because there's I'll tell you what'll make them carry You tell them use their fucking arm as an ashtray again, or I'll say Fucking better get to going on carrying that leaf blower.

Welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands. Don't be too blue. Welcome to you. La-la-la-la-la-la. It's the Duncan Castle video. Castle, castle, castle, castle, castle, castle, castle. Ida, welcome to the DTFH. The DTFH, it's so cool to meet you. Oh, nice to meet you too. Thank you for having me. You know, I gotta say, you know, my favorite comics, George Carlin, Richard Pryor, what I love about them is they're alchemists. You know this, but they transform, they're so good at turning some of their life experiences into something funny that somehow you can forget when you're watching them. You know, they've been through something so brutal. They're almost too good at it. Almost too good at it. You know what I mean? Because you're laughing at Pryor talking about getting his skin, his like, skin like, shaved off or whatever when he was burnt. Carlin talking about his wife screaming with cancer. I'm watching you and I'm thinking, my God, I would be in a curled up in a ball somewhere if I went through some of this stuff you went through. And so my first question to you is, I can see that this is a kind of beautiful, powerful therapy that you're doing successfully because I don't like it when comics are doing the just the therapy part, but it's not funny. You know what I mean? Don't mind, but you're making it brilliantly funny. But I got to ask you offstage, how are you working through this stuff? So I thank you. First of all, Carlin and Pryor are my heroes. Those are the best comedians that ever lived hands down in my opinion. Yes. And I, those are the people that inspire me all the time. Honestly, the way that I deal with a lot of this stuff came to me later is I'm in therapy. You know, I do a lot. I meditate. I do a lot of, yeah. And I read this book by Louise Hay about healing and I sat down and I started doing some of the exercises, which was really weird. I did this. It's right here. It's called You Can Heal Your Life. But it's like a book that I really work. But there's an exercise in that book that you go back to little you. And I had never done that before. I think I was afraid to do that. And I went back and I visited with little me and I thought that it was bogus. I was like, this is, this is some, you know, whatever trash. And I cried like a baby, just allowing, forgiving myself for thinking that a lot of the things that happened to me when I was a kid was my own fault. And just giving myself grace, but also letting that little girl know that she was going to come out on the other side and be okay. And I don't know what happened that day, but honestly, I think that that has been something that's been very instrumental in my healing. And I practice forgiveness daily. Some people tell me I'm a sucker. Like I'm a, you know, like I'm kind of weak for that. But I think it makes me stronger not to walk around holding anger for what other people should be accountable for. And it just, forgiveness has been really, really empowering for me. How, how do you, how do you do it? How do you forgive? Oh, it's practice. Like I sit down and I write about it. I write it in a journal. I say it into the mirror. I say it out loud so that my subconscious can pick it up. It's a process. It's not like me saying, I forgive you and it's over, but it really has been Mike's husband, the father of my children who didn't take care of his kids for a great amount of time. And then blamed me for my geographic setting as the reason for why he didn't do what he was supposed to do, which that would make me so angry at the time. Yeah. Just forgiving him just gave me freedom and, and realizing and acceptance like acceptance is always a big thing for me because that's where we, that's where it gets tricky for us. Because when we don't accept things, we continuously try to adjust them, try to fix them. Right. And I was like, he's not going to show up and I have to accept that this is my journey. My journey is as a single mom, I'm going to have to do this task. And he's not going to pay child support and he's not going to show up and you have to accept that. And it took me years to accept that because I was just like, but why? And like, how could you just travel? And when I finally said, this is my journey. This is what I'm supposed to do. I'm supposed to show up. My life got so much easier. Wow. I just don't, I can't, there are, you know, I've been thinking about forgiveness a lot. And, you know, it's something everyone says, forgive, forgive, forgive. But, and I think a lot of people think they've forgiven just because they've sort of casually thought, well, I don't care about that person anymore. But I can't, some people, I can't let go. I mean, not like I'm like stalking them. Not like I'm sending them like dove heads in the mail or anything like that. But just like, it's like they're stuck in my mind a little bit. They float around it in there and then appear sometimes at like 2am where I'm thinking, what a motherfucker. And this, but so, so. For you to hook when you're forgiven. So that's, that's the thing that I had to learn because forgiveness is for you. Right. So I forgive you. That does not mean in any way that I will continue a relationship with you that I will engage you that I will, I'm not here to alleviate your guilt. That is all for me. And so that was what I had to learn because I always thought, you know, I was, I was a victim of sexual abuse when I was a child. So when I, when people would talk about forgiveness because I grew up in this like super religious, complicated religious setting that was weird because there was all drugs going, all kinds of stuff. But they will always tell us. Sorry, what was the religion? So my family was, they traveled from being Pentecostal and landed at being seven day Adventist. Wow. So you know that you're always being told to forgive. If God can forgive you, you can forgive. But that sends mixed messages to a kid when somebody's doing something bad to them because they're obligated to forgive them. Oh God. What a mess. Yeah. Right. So for me, it was like, um, I had to learn that forgiveness, the version of forgiveness that I've accepted is my me forgiving you has nothing to do with you. It's only mine. And it's just for me to free myself and forgiveness. It has so much to do with me accepting that the things that happened to me were not my fault for giving myself and then letting that person go. Um, but I will never, ever look at their face again. I don't, I don't engage people who, who I believe mean me no well. I don't care if we share name, blood, I don't, I don't want to be around those people. Right. Do you think you can forgive someone and simultaneously still be angry at them? Absolutely. Maybe that's where I misunderstood it. Maybe because my version of forgiveness is I don't have any hard feelings for the person anymore. No, no, no forgiveness is, I mean, for me, I believe it has so much to do with yourself. Because a lot of the times when we hold on to stuff, we're angry that we let that happen to us, that we didn't catch it, that we didn't, we didn't figure it out. And for me, it's like, you know what, the universe will handle you and it always does. You know, like, I don't, it's not my job. Right. Vengeance is mine, say it the Lord. That's right. Now, but tell me a little bit about, you mean like Christian Pentecostal, like snake handling? Well, I mean, I never saw that, but yes, that type of Christian. It was a holy ghost, you know. Speaking in tongues. Speaking in tongues. A lot of stuff happening that was very complicated and difficult for me to understand. You know, people would speak in tongues that scared me as a kid. Yeah. Or as a child that didn't understand it. Then I thought something was wrong with me because it didn't happen to me. And so I didn't know that, you know, in some cases that is just mass hysteria. And I was just like to, I was like, maybe God doesn't love me because I don't do it. Oh, wow. It's so sad that, you know, you have this, the story of the Pentecost is so intense and beautiful. The fire, the tongues of fire on their head and they could speak all the languages of the world. I mean, symbolically, metaphorically, oh my God, it's like the most beautiful thing. But then in practice, you hear these stories like what you're saying, you know, of abuse of children who are completely scrambled by the pressure parents are putting on them to sort of give up their rational mind. And oh, it's really can war people in the most intense way. Are you still religious? Do you still pray or go to church? I still pray. I don't, I don't go to church right now. I don't have a church home. I still pray. I believe in the most high. I do believe in the most high at that. And I just, I arrived at another place where I was like, I'm not going to let other people because, because we say the Bible says that God made man in his image, but man has made God in his image. And so we sit down and talk to people who would are always speaking on behalf of God. And my mom is one of them, oh, God is going to punish you. God doesn't like God. Don't like ugly. You hear it all the time. And I'm like, how you know you a mere man in perfect. I didn't tell me that the, the infinite intelligence, the most high of us all is that petty. That is worrying about, you know, you being snarky. Like this, that for me is just incomprehensible and it doesn't connect with what is in my heart and soul or in my mind. And I do believe that praising and believing in God, the most high, infinite intelligence, whatever it is for you, Jet Jeshua, it is an intellectual process. And to say that it's not, it's insulting to what the most high is. And that's why where we, where we split, because people will say, oh, it's, it's here. And I'm like, now it's here too. Because what I'm able to do, and I have domain on this planet over all the other creatures means that it, there's some form of intelligence that went into that. So why would I, why would I forsake that in my decision making process? I think that's ungodlike. And so, yeah. I want to thank Liquid IV for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

That to me is the creepiest thing when people are inviting you to abandon your intellect and usually the way they do it is very flowery. Just listen to your heart, blah, blah, blah. You're wrong. Your instincts and all the intuitions telling you that you're getting inducted into a cult. That's just your mind. Listen to your heart. Yeah. That's how people get. I love that. In Buddhism, the idea is there's no faith here. It's a process. It's a system. It doesn't matter if you understand it. You have to practice it. They call it picking it up. You have to take it up. And so I think sometimes people get lazy and they imagine, okay, I have some sort of vague belief in something bigger than me. That's enough. I love that you're saying you use your intellect, but what does that look like? You mean like when you're approaching some scripture or something, don't be afraid to deconstruct it or pull it apart. Yeah, I'm not afraid to deconstruct it. And I also read all the books, all these doctrine books. I don't just read the Bible. I've read the Koran. I've read the Torah. I've read all of the books because if you read the Kabbalah, if you read all of those books, you'll find the common theme and it's like the universal laws, right? Because if you look, they're universal laws. Even when you think about money, money is an energy, right? Because it's a piece of paper and we've assigned the value to it. So it's energy, right? That we have given power to, right? We choose what we give power to and we sit around and think about a lot of these things. For me, it's like, what is the common thread in all of this? And the common thread is you obey the universal laws, right? Whether you're tithing to a church or you take money from all the money that you make and you make sure that some people eat or that some people have a sweater or socks because it keeps you balanced as a human being. So maybe I'm not tithing to these big churches where the pastors are driving Bentley's but I do make sure that I invest in helping people who don't have what I have because I feel like that is following the universal laws, right? And whether in the Bible it's tithing and alms to the poor in Koran, it all means the same thing. It's like, it keeps you balanced and human to take from all that you have and be able to help somebody else. And that doesn't do anything but make you feel better as a human being and it completes the cycle of humanity for me. So I read all those books and I take from all of them because I think that they've all been polluted and they've been tainted by the hunger for power and money, the greed for power and money. So if you remove all of that, you'll see that the common thing is to obey universal laws. It's not cool to murder people because you want to control and you want power. Like all of that stuff is just common sense and we don't need anybody to tell us what's right or wrong. The center, the people who don't have that, there's something, they have issues, right? There's some balances, some chemical imbalances. You know, nobody, you don't need a man in a suit to tell you as you hand him over your paycheck that you can't, you know what's right or wrong. It's just, to me, it's just like, we all have it and you have to stay connected to that if you want to have a fulfilled life. Have you ever heard the Mark Twain quote, religion is what happened when the first con artist met the first fool? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and it's a brilliant trick because it's so deceptive in the sense what you're saying, anyone I know who is successful, they leave massive tips and they're so generous and they're always giving and giving and giving and you realize that's not just, they are generous but it's not all coming from some benevolence, it's coming from understanding these laws that you're talking about and working with them, utilizing them, knowing you've got to be in the flow. You know, you have to be in the flow, but do you, it's such an insane thing to think that there are organized groups of people who understand that law too and are deceiving people into, like if literally shifted that flow into their organizations. You know, and a lot of times those organizations are taking 70, 80% of the donations and just using them to pay their staff. And to live well, you know what's funny, like those people are the people that scare me the most because those are the people that I believe don't believe in it, right? Did you see leap of faith, like it's a hustle, right? Because the Bible, if you are really going to go by the Bible, the Bible says, better you not be born than to mislead my sheep. Like the consequences are more for those people who have assumed the positions of power within the church. So if you honestly believe that and you know you hustling the people and you know the consequences are worse for you, you can't possibly believe it. And that's why for me, I always look at people sideways because, you know, I never gave money to church because I felt like I was getting hustled. That was my way of praise and worship, right? I gave, I tied or I gave my offerings as praise just like I seen and whatever that person does with it, that's on you, right? Because I really believe that I believe in karma as well. So, you know, I just think that it's important to deconstruct it and find your own way in it because if you allow people to sway you, you will be a victim. You will be a victim because everybody's not whole and pure. And a lot of these people who I think start, I was a member of a church that was really small and very humble and then I watched it evolve into like this mega church because it became a business and you could see the difference where the first lady of the church had a security guard and would not even allow members of the church to get used close to her. And I stopped going to the church. It was so, it was so gross to see, it was a young man who was mentally ill and he was trying to talk to her and she had, she told the security guard to get him away from her and I was just grossed out and I was like, I can't be a part of that. And I just remember how humble and meek they were when they didn't have and the love that they had is what attracted people to the church and people wanted to be a part of that because it felt so authentic and as it grew, it just got gross. And I was like, I can't, I can't be a part of this. Oh, no. Do you can't, you don't want to say the name of the church, do you? No, I don't want to say the name of the church because I don't, but it's in Los Angeles. It's in Los Angeles. Oh. Yeah, Woodland Hills. Oh, no. I hope it's not the church I think it is. I'll ask you off, Mike. Oh, shit. That's so depressing. It's so, so depressing to think of that. This podcast is sponsored by better help.

No. He's great, but one of the things he says is that any good church or religion or whatever is a self-destructing trap, it keeps you there long enough for you to be empowered, for you to take on whatever it is that it's transmitting and then move on with your life, not stay perpetually in some kind of never-ending trap. And some of these churches, because they need that money and because the people running them are getting incredibly wealthy and not paying taxes. How about that? What a fucking grift. They don't pay taxes. No taxes and everything becomes about money. It's like, please put some money in the bucket for the women's group. Please put some money in the bucket for the children's choir. Mind you, you see the porcelain walls and you see these elaborate floors. And I'm like, what is that for? What do you need this for? Yeah. When you got people, you know, I went to this church in Los Angeles and it was shaming people into giving money. They make you stand in a line and give the offering. And the pastor was like, everybody in here should be able to give $20. And I remember at that time in my life, I was so broke. I had my two kids and I was just like, I was like, that's my last $20. Like I needed for gas. But you get in this line and they watch you people, you shaming people into giving you money. And I was like, I can't do this. I can't because I mean, this is not wise. You know, this is not wise, right? You have to be smart with your spending. So I stopped, I stopped going to these churches altogether. And I was like, I'm going to be my own church. Yeah. I'm pure at heart. And I know that I mean, well, and I really want to help people and I want to give and I give a lot, you know, and I give quietly, you know, I don't put on Instagram when I help somebody or I don't give with the expectation of return. And I may not have like some of my friends who have a lot of money. But I just feel, I always feel good when I give. Oh my God. It's, it is the, it's the greatest feeling. And I do, you know, I do think there is something to be said for doing it secretly. I don't know why or what it is or there does feel like some true like magical thing happens when no one knows except the person that you're with. And it's so, also I think it's just humiliating this thing where people film, you know, someone's holding a camera and then you see them doing some nice thing. So it's all been set up and staged and it's pretty grotesque. But I've got some questions about you. Okay. I want to. So you end up in Los Angeles, homeless, living in a car with your kid. And again, I'm sorry. This is just a question from your Wikipedia. But, but it seems like it's saying that simultaneously you had started working on standup comedy. So, oh my God, can you tell me how you navigated the Los Angeles comedy scene while being a mom living in your car? So in all fairness and in all transparency, I only slept in my car for maybe about a week. We were homeless. So we would go, we would get vouchers. And the vouchers were for like best Westerns, which I'm thankful to the best Westerns because I stated a few of them, but I was able to have a warm place and a safe place for my kids to sleep. But I did sleep in that car for a week. And that was probably one of the most horrifying things I've ever done. Since then I haven't slept. I cannot sleep more than five hours a night. But because I was in that situation, I didn't sleep because I was scared that something was going to happen. Somebody was going to see us. It was very, very horrible. I did start doing standup when I was homeless. I was not, that was at the point where I was staying at someone's house who's a friend of mine and I had a safe place for my kids to be. So I wasn't in a car going and stand up and having kids in the car. But I didn't do standup at that time. I never thought it would turn into anything. It was mainly for, it was cathartic for me. It was just me processing and working out what was happening in my real life. And I couldn't afford therapy. So being able to get on stage and just talk about it and just make it funny somehow became what I never thought I needed. But I had a job. I had a full-time job. And I always want to make sure that I take the opportunity to say that because a lot of times people think that those who are homeless are homeless because they're lazy and because they don't want to work and they've given up on everything. A lot of people who've ended up unhoused is because they're under-earners in a country that prioritizes wealth over health. And people don't realize that a lot of those people are also veterans. When they come back, the resources that are available to them are limited and they can't cope. They need mental health care and all that. So when I speak on behalf of that period of my life, which was, it was years. It wasn't just, I wasn't unhoused for eight months. I was without a home for about four years. Wow. That was very, very traumatic. And the people that you see when they're asking for money or you see people, everybody's not on drugs. Everybody is not lazy and don't want to work. Everybody is not a violent criminal. Those are human beings that are having a very difficult time surviving in a country that is doused with toxic capitalism and really just overlooks the value of human beings and human life. And that doesn't mean that I'm communist or I'm anti-capitalism. I'm speaking to the specific toxic capitalism that has, you know, people in America are so uneducated that any single reality star or celebrity politician can sway you because you don't have the basic information and knowledge from school because they don't care about schools the way that they care about cars and they care about everything else. And so those people that you see, and I was one of them, it was so. Anyway, I started to, you know, use those experiences and talk about them on stage. And for a little while, I had like my own little therapy session with an audience. Wow. I want to talk more about this, what you were saying about unhoused people. And are you living in LA right now? I live in Los Angeles. I think I know what you're going to say, but full disclosure, when I was living in Los Angeles and the spread of the tent cities and, you know, knowing everything that you're saying, new age spiritual teachers and, you know, praying to God and all this stuff, I still felt resentful. I still felt like, what the fuck is this? This city is so expensive. They're taxing us so much and somehow we're like you're witnessing a kind of poverty that I've never seen anywhere in all the places I've traveled in the world. I've never seen anything like that. And your mind wants to come up because you don't want, you don't want to face what you just said. You don't want to face the reality. These are people, you know, not you want to make them into monsters. You want to think. So for me, I would think, well, these are people who just want to do heroin on the streets or, you know, these are right because it makes it makes your, I mean, I, again, just trying to be brutally honest, it makes your drive easier. When you're driving somewhere, you don't have to confront the fact that you're witnessing people who have just been ground up in these invisible gears and splattered out all over the streets who are hopeless beyond hopeless. But what, how are we to maintain compassion in the face of this sort of thing? I've got kids, you know, I don't want my kid to see somebody shooting up on the side of the street or like jerking off while I'm at a traffic light, you know? So how do you balance, you know, the compassion with like realism when it comes to it? That's also, that's very transparent and that's very honest. And I cannot say that I can't relate, you know, because I understand exactly what you're talking about. Being in this city can be very harmful to the psyche and the spirit, if you're not honest about it. Some people get swept into it and they justify it with whatever because the hype tells you because you are having success that you're doing it right. And, you know, even fools, you know, can do, can do well in life. I, you know, I have to, I have to stay grounded in some spiritual work so that I can maneuver being in this city every day and I'm not going to lie to you and tell you that I don't think about leaving this place multiple times a week because it is a toxic place to be. It is expensive. It is superficial and it's hard to live in this place. Now that you see these people coming and robbing people and doing smash and grabs and all of this stuff, what you're seeing is an evolution of crime and criminals becoming more intelligent and learning that they were harming themselves by staying in their own communities that are already lacking and now they're going to where the wealthy are. And eventually, hopefully, they'll leave off to the place where they learn that that's not where you need to be. If you really want to make an impact, then you need to really go to where the money money really is because that's really who has their foot on your necks. But where is that? What do you mean, like a castle in Viveria or something? They got to find the Illuminati base. Well, you know, it's not the Illuminati is right in front of us, right? You want to be mad at another and, you know, as a person of color, you want to go steal a watch from another person of color who appears to have more than you. But Jeff Bezos made three times became a trillionaire during a pandemic where half a million people died, right? So your anger is targeted at the wrong place and it's institutions. Like, I'm not telling anybody go kill Jeff Bezos, but what I'm saying is you're targeting the wrong people if that's really what you feel like you're doing to, or else it's envy and jealousy. You're not really doing this because you're hungry, you're doing it because you're entitled. And so there's a lot to unpack there. But what I'm saying is that. Hold on. We're going to cut to an Amazon commercial now. Okay, we're back. I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm honestly thinking, oh God, did Amazon advertise on this episode? No, I don't know. What? No, I'm not taking that out. Are you kidding? What you're saying is true. It's just, I think like it's just probably a hell of a lot easier to do a smash and grab than it is to get through the multiple layers of security around the people that you're talking about. I mean, I agree. But what I'm saying is that it's misdirected anger. But what I'm, what I was saying is that that's how it's evolved, right? Because first you would hear people saying, oh, look at them. They're just, they're just destroying their own neighborhoods. They're stealing from their own people. Well, now they're not, now they're in Beverly Hills, right? Well, they're in, in Calabasas. So now it's, oh my goodness, they're gruesome people. And we don't ever sit down and talk about what the root of all of this is, right? And the root is that some people are eating like fat rats and some people are eating rats. And there's a big difference in that. And we don't, we don't, you know, what do you think is going to happen as human beings continue to evolve? You know, they start figuring things out and things start to move. And now you have to be uncomfortable. And that's really ugly for you because you're not used to that. You're used to people serving it to you on a platter. And you don't have to see those people because they're not in your neighborhood. You're not in, you know what I'm saying? That's one of the ways I was beating myself up as I'm like, oh really? Okay. So now it's in your fucking face and you're, you're uncomfortable. You just want to see it in little like clips on, on Fox news, some kind of fucked up commentary about it. Like when they show the immigrants on Fox news, they're a war with immigrants. And these are, they will zoom in on a mom and like two kids with like music playing as though like they're zooming in on some kind of predatory alien. You know what I mean? And they're so unaware. They don't even know that that's, that's what they're doing is like where, where is the, you know, so I hear what you're saying. It's like, here it is. It's in your face. Now, now do now live with that. Now deal with it because, you know, the very system that's putting those people out is the same system that's given you a car that's given you the ability to drive around. But all that being said, still from a compassionate place, what's the solution? This is an ongoing conversation when I was living in LA that I was always having. I was always curious, like how people thought the situation could be dealt with. What, what's, you know, and again, I'm not asking for you to give some kind of, obviously if anyone knew, but I would love to hear your thoughts on like what, like ways to, to deal with it.

So I honestly believe a lot of our FDR said that one of the greatest threats to democracy was, you know, a lack of education. And he said it far more eloquently than I did, but I believe in that. I believe that wholeheartedly. I think that everything begins with education, right? Education, because of course resources, right? Because a book is not going to feed a family. But I think the fact that we're so uneducated and we're so far from balance, because we're getting our information from the Internet and we constantly distract it and always thinking about ourselves. Because now you have your own little channel on social media where you can post pictures of yourself, get adoration, and your brain just starts deteriorating. It becomes like mush. And you don't realize that you're not aware of what's happening and everything in your world is to support your ideologies because the machine has picked up on what it is that you like and what you believe. And so you're insulated in this world. And so I think education is a big factor in how we, you know, restore order. Because so many people, you know, now these teachers are going into the classroom after listening to Fox News or CNN for the whole weekend, and they take that with them. You know, they absolutely take it with them. And we've got, it's idiocracy, right? So what's the, what's the opposite of that is information and education. And it has to be equal education that everybody is being educated with the right information until people start being informed because we're emotional creatures. We can't move forward because now you have half of this country believing that red is it the matrix dammit is come to life blue is it. And the truth is that it's all for profit. And all of us are pawns in the game. Wow. Your allegiance to, it's no difference in the Red Sox and the Yankees. You all have this blind allegiance to this team. And that team is just trying to win a world series that can care less about you. But you know, it has to be education. People have such bad education. Some places in the middle of the country in the South, even in California, don't have up to date books. They're getting informed by stuff that happened, you know, books that were written 10 years ago. It's really, really bad the way that our children are being educated. And these are the people that grew up. These are the people that grew up on the internet now. And they feel like, you know, I deserve this. I should have this. There's an entitlement that doesn't come with work ethic. Everything on the internet glorifies how quickly you can get there. There's never anything about educating people about the process, about how you work to get the things that you have. And it's just become a circus. And that's what we are. And until we start delivering accurate information to people, they're going to be ill-informed and they're going to react. That's what we have a reactionary world. All we do is people reacting, you know. Yeah. It's a danger. It's a very scary, weird place that you add to it the bizarre reality of a lot of artificial intelligence bots, intentionally starting arguments and threads to send jam debate. And it's so surreal. I want to ask you related to this. You know, your story is just so incredible. And to go from living in your car, even for a week, it's the fact that you're like, oh, it's just a week. It was just a week in a car with my kid. It was just a week not knowing what was coming or what. Yeah, I wouldn't wish that on anyone. But to go from that to having an amazing special on HBO is so beautiful and so powerful. But how are you dealing with that kind of acceleration in your career? How are you dealing with this sudden real power that you have? The sudden real fame that you have, which is only going to grow and grow and grow and grow. How do you deal with it? Everything that you're saying about education and people understanding our privilege and understanding why it's... You are now going to the place where you meet the people who earlier you were recommending. Those are the ones who should be robbed. I know you didn't really mean that. You know what I'm saying? Don't you find it a little eerie and unnerving and creepy sometimes? Because I know by now some of them have probably come knocking at your door to say hello. Absolutely. So one of the challenges that I always have in this business is a battle with my conscience. I don't ever want to become one of those people that I despise. And I got to be honest because I feel like I see a lot of people who are famous. I know them. I'm friends with some of them. I wouldn't say friends, but I know them who are very performative and they claim to love the people. But when the cameras are off, it's all in angle now, right? Because even activism has become mainstream. So everybody's an activist. Everybody has a cause. You know, how do I get involved with this? Because it's good press. You know, I have made a commitment that I'm going to be part of that minority group of people who want to make a difference. And the only way to change some of this stuff is from inside, right? Because if you're not inside, you're not impacting, you know, I don't consider myself being inside yet. But even though I maybe have a special on HBO Max, I think that I can be problematic to some of those people because, you know, I threaten that for them and they keep doors closed when it comes to me. But I really want to be a part of the solution. And so for me, it's just about gaining equity and power, like you said, and learning to speak the business speak to be able to gain enough money and power to create content for the good people. And that's really what I work towards. It's like, I don't want to tell any more lies. I don't want to perpetuate what's already out there. I really want to be a part of the solution and also give people something positive to look forward to because the trauma porn is at an all time high right now. And it's people are triggered and they're depressed. And if they've experienced this collective trauma of what's happening in the country with this pandemic. And I just think that they're never being at they're never at the top of the list of priority of what entertainment should be. It always is about numbers and money and not giving people, you know, because if you get if you put some trauma porn people are going to watch so that's going to give numbers and money. But never like with the the wellness of the people at the heart of it all and I want to stay. That's why I can you define trauma porn for me. You know, like I think that a lot of these movies, TV shows, you ever see those videos where people getting beat up or people getting killed, they go viral. Yeah, okay. You just get off on that stuff like and it's you don't realize that constantly feeding that to your subconscious mind. Downloading that your mind your subconscious mind doesn't know the difference between reality and fantasy and then you wonder why you're feeling down. Oh, you're talking about Dateline forensic files. Is that what you're talking about? You're talking about all of it. Yeah. People love SVU like I'm one of them. I watched so many episodes of SVU and then I wonder why I'm walking around paranoid. I'm in the parking lot like where my key ready to and you know, and you have to, you know, my gun. I got to get put the you just walk around like because you're constantly downloading. I remember watching Sons of Anarchy. I binged and then I went into a depression when it was over. And my my therapist was like, yeah, because your subconscious mind doesn't know the difference. So of course you're sad because your body feels your mind feels like you you had so much loss. You experienced so much loss. That's why you shouldn't binge. You should you should watch and release watch and release because your subconscious mind doesn't know the difference. Right. But it's just like that's so I'm I stay because I want to make a difference and I believe that there are people here. Who you don't hear about all the time that really want to do good work and create content that's good for the people. Speaking of which, sorry, may I toot your horn for a moment? Can I play a clip of you back to you just to hear your thoughts on it now? Do you mind? I'm sorry. This is this is where the rubber hits the road. This is folks. This is somebody who is not bullshitting. You're really like, in fact, you're being kind of modest about it. But I found this clip from a few years ago. Do you mind if I played it? You're on a panel with the young Turks. They've got you up there with two like right wing people. And I just wanted to play what you said because a little clip from what you said here it is. And then we could talk about it because we have about 10 more minutes. Can we save the world? No, we cannot save the world. We can't even save ourselves. Can we take more children from Africa and China? No, we should start with the little white boys who shoot up schools and theaters in America is where we should start. We like to give immigration a brown face. Are you talking about the Eastern Europeans that come here because you're talking about building a wall. Is that going to keep people coming from China? It's always our people who are demonized and you talk about we come here and we do we commit crimes and we the Democrats want the MS 13 to come here and rape all the white women. We hear that bullshit all the time where we got to be scared right now. Look how many white boys are out here. We got to worry about them shooting this bitch up. And it's really frustrating to have to hear that immigration belongs comes from Mexico's El Salvador. When we all know that people migrate here from all over the world, overstay their welcome, abuse our economy, break the laws and then you want to blame it on the people who come here who are honorable. They work, they mow lawns. They do all kinds of things that you would never do. Sell delicious fruit in Mexico. Beautiful. Okay. What did that feel like? What did that feel like when you were doing that from your heart? And I can hear it, right? I was angry. You know, the thing is that I don't want to participate in this thing. This us versus them thing in America. Because we all know it's common knowledge that all of us are the children of immigrants. This land is sacred land that belongs to the First Nations people. And many of us are the descendants of immigrants that came to this country all seeking the same thing. Whether they came from Ireland or Guatemala, they were seeking some sort of freedom. And so, you know, to sit here and just talk about the, it's just, you know, those people that I, I'm different because I'm, I don't belong to any group on that panel, right? I don't belong to any group. I'm there with the young Turks, but I'm not, I'm there as a standoff comedian and I sit there and I'm like, you are speaking these talking points because they support the, the doctrine that you guys continuously spit out. Because you're getting checks from corporations and you are participating in, in political party bullshit and it has nothing to do with the people. Because when was the last time said, said white guys sitting on a panel that you ever drove through Omaha, Idaho, Montana and talk to those white people who are also struggling because of this toxic economy. And don't know any better. When was the last time you shook hands with one of those people? So you sitting here scaring them, telling them these immigrants are trying to take their jobs. But when you go to California and you look at when they deported the farmers, because the farmers that were for Trump participated in getting rid of those, those people that were working there. Then they were begging because they didn't have anybody to come mine the crops, because all of these alleged jobs that these immigrants were taking. Nobody wanted to do that. Right. So then when we sit there and have this conversation, I'm like, and what immigrants are you talking about? Eastern Europeans come here every day illegally. And you know what? They also do jobs that nobody would want to do. And you also scoff at them. So it just, it was, I was just sitting there and I'm listening and I'm like, what are we talking about here guys? Like really, did you come here to say you are, you made immigrants the boogeyman and you thought I was going to sit there and allow you to do that. And that's not going to happen on my watch because too many people in this country are struggling, are hungry, are really, really, and they don't even know any better. Because they don't have a good education. Fox News, CNN, all of these people are telling them bullshit. And they're believing it because what happens when you're afraid you become angry and then you become hateful. Those are that's the process, right? And so I'm sitting here listening to this man feeding all of these people with this information and those people got caught the bus and paid to watch this man talk. And I was like, nah, bro, you're gonna, you're not doing that here. Yeah, that's it. I mean, I think that like if you that to me was an act, you know, I know what you're saying. I feel like I'm guilty of it because it's so easy to tweet some obvious fucking thing in the past. I've done that whatever we've all transgressed in that way. But I think that what you did, that's what real activism looks like, which is you go to the place where it's at, confront it directly in front of people. And then somehow you're, you manage to be funny. And in the midst of that, that is real talent because I could hear it in your voice. I could hear the pain. I could hear like that, that my stammer for a second just said everything about what how upset how pissed off you were at them. And the look on their face was so beautiful. They weren't used to that. They came there to humble me. They were sent there to put me in my place because I'm not a political pundit and I didn't finish college. So they were coming there to put me in my place because this is what they do for a living. The problem was that they came there with their talking points and they came there with, you know, this disingenuous vibe. And I don't talk about things that I don't know about because I don't, I am not, I didn't go to Harvard and I don't have a degree. But I do know people and I know good people and I know good working people. And I'm tired of these political fools continuously swaying people in different directions while the people are struggling. And I'm sitting there watching them roll up in their nice, you know, expensive attire while I have on a dress that I bought at Target. I'm sitting there listening. That was a beautiful dress. Thank you. But you know, and I appreciate that. But what I'm saying is, no, I bought it at Marshall's. I'm sitting there like I'm sitting here knowing what it's like because I got to go to work every day still as a stand up comedian. And you're sitting here because Fox News is giving you all this money. And you're going to tell me about us. Like us as the working class people, are you kidding? Get out of here with that bullshit, bro. Get out of here. Right. Wow. I, you know, the other, I was really impressed that you spent part of your comedy special going back to see your dad and forgiveness. Oh, wow. And, you know, we didn't mention it yet, but and maybe you could help clarify this story. You, you were abducted. My mom. Your mom came and took you from your dad. You don't, when you were just a little baby and just to clarify, you hadn't seen him since that. No, I'd seen him like on WhatsApp a few times after we reconnected. But that's the first time I actually touched my father since I was maybe three or four years old. Wow. Wow. That must have been the most beautiful bittersweet feeling to come there shooting your special. Could you just talk about it a little bit? Yeah, I wanted to capture that. I wanted to normalize, you know, that the romantic notion that of a, of a not having a parent in your life and reconnecting with your parent is going to become something that's like a fairy tale. I wanted people to see it, especially little kids who don't have a parent and or younger people. I would say when I say little kids, I'm always talking about people who could be 19 but younger people who are feeling that void of not having a parent. I wanted them to see what it looked like and what it felt like. I didn't have my father. I was, I had my mother's last name. I grew up feeling this hole in my life. And I wanted them to see that I did accomplish something in life and that there's a there you can be on the other side of that. And I also wanted to show people where my jokes come from and how I write my jokes. So I wanted to share an experience that would end up in the special and the comedy. Great joke, P.S. Great joke about like, what was that? Do you mind if I poorly recite your joke back to you? It was so good about what your dad was a giver. Everybody got their own. Will you do the joke for me? I'm sorry. Yeah, no, he gave everybody their own mother. Oh my God, it's such a killer joke. It didn't have it illustrated. Like, wow. You saw all those sisters and they have different mothers and I'm sitting there like, I'm surrounded by people that I never knew existed. And there's so many different trails of pain from different women that were, you know, hurt. And now the daughters who are also women that are hurt. And it was just, I wanted to show it. And I was like, I don't care if people, you know, I want people to know that that is okay. And this is life for some of us. And a lot of people have reached out to me, white, black, Latino have said to me, men, women, you know, trans have said I had the same experience. I didn't meet my father till I was nine or thank you for sharing that experience. I thought I was alone. My driver, a white man that was in his 30s who took me to the airport was like, I watched your special, the stuff about your dad. I just want you to know that I went and saw my father. He was like, I didn't, I didn't meet him, but I saw him and it was because I saw your special. So it was, it was, it was cool. Wow. Well, you know what? Your dad missed out. And that's the real truth. He missed out and he'll never get that back. And that's a tremendous loss that I think a lot of these dads, they don't realize until it's way too late, what they let go of. And thank you for that. I appreciate that because that was what I was grappling with my whole life was am I nothing because he's not here. And so that, that's where that forgiveness came from. It was forgiving him because, because of that missing part, because your parents are your, where your trust is formed. Yeah. And so that you form your empathy, your self-esteem and your trust with your parents. So for me, it was like, oh, I, I, I'm not worth anything. And then I evolved to this place where I was like, you missed out. I turned out pretty good in spite of your absence. And so thank you for saying that. Oh God, thank you for making such beautiful comedy for us and for doing this amazing work. And thanks for giving me all of your time today. Thank you for having me here. I love, I love doing the, and this has been like one of the most thoughtful podcasts that I've been on. So thank you for these questions and watching and, you know, knowing what I do. And, you know, I just, I care about people and I want to, I don't ever want to lose that. And I'm never going to let this town make me like that. Oh no. I'll see it. We're coming back. I'm bringing the family back. We left for the pandemic where we're headed back in the summer. So don't leave. Maybe we can get dinner or something. Yeah, absolutely. Come to a show and as we can get dinner, I would love to meet your family and I, you know, this is what it's about for me. It's building a community of people like us. Yeah. Because we make the difference. This right here makes the difference getting this out. That, that's how we change the world. I love it. Everybody fighting words. You can find it on HBO. It's brilliant. Obviously. HBO Max. HBO Max. I didn't, I guess there's a distinction now. I'm old. It's all HBO Max is the streamer. And I think that some people have it and don't have HBO proper. So HBO Max, not regular boring HBO, HBO Max. And can you let people know how they can find you please? Sure. I'm funny a idea on Instagram and Twitter and on Facebook, which I really go to is Ida dot Rodriguez. Beautiful. Thank you so much, Ida. Thank you. Have a beautiful day. God bless you. God bless you.

Greetings to you, sweet lovers of the universe. That was Madame Caroline Prince that you just heard, featuring young nasty, a.k.a. Johnny Pemberton. By the way, if you like Johnny Pemberton, you ought to subscribe to his Patreon, and I'll have the link at dunkitrustle.com. It's Patreon, live to tape, and you can get more incredible rap tracks like that, blasted into those holes in the side of your head, vibrating your brain. Here's a fun fact you might not be aware of. I've got a lot of fun facts for you today. These are the kinds of things you need to know because sometimes the conversation dries up in a bad way. It drives up in the way a cut that's infected dries up, and you think, oh my god, my infected cut is healing, but it really isn't. It was just that kind of scab that looks like maybe things are going okay, but then you barely touch the scab and pain shoots up your arm. The scab falls off. You look down into a crevasse of pus and tendons and realize you have some horrific flesh-eating disease that gradually spreads up your arm and into your face and across your body. Horrible spider webs of disease, eventually huge pulpy, mushy, purpley chunks of your skin start falling off, and then the rodents come, burrow into you, and the next thing you do, you're just an infected, meaty bag of wriggling mice and rats. So you need fun facts to fill in the blanks during those moments. Sometimes when the conversation has a pause, it's nice. It's a time for you to look at each person you're eating dinner with right in the eye and fold your hands at your chest and silently offer them a namaste, and then throw your hot coffee in one of their faces, run out and blame it on some kind of mania that you have begun to experience because of the pandemic. Here's the first fun fact that I became aware of watching a nature documentary with my beautiful child, Forrest, the oldest son, and we like to watch this Bumblebee documentary. Nature documentaries, I'm sure you're aware, if you're a parent, it's Rollin' the Dice. Watching these things with your kids definitely can't go like pre-70s because those nature documentaries are there the walking dead. It really isn't about animals as much as like what the animals are running away from, and sort of, I don't know, I guess getting you used to the idea that for a lot of animals, day-to-day existence is eating and running away from things bigger than you, which is, I don't have a problem with that necessarily. I mean, I know it's kind of like that. I am a carnivore, and I eat. I have to eat things that used to be alive to live, but when do you start showing your kid that shit, you know? So this Bumblebee documentary is cool. Bumblebees are awesome. They're awful creatures in the sense that they go, and right when I said that, I know someone listening is like, no, they're not. I love the bee. Okay, it's fine for you to love the bee. I'm not shaming you for being a bee lover necessarily, a beeophile, but they do like fuck other things up pretty bad, just like everything else. For example, the bee documentary that Forrest and I enjoy watching has a part where a bee goes into a mouse hole and forces the mouse out of the mouse hole so that it can lay its eggs there, which is awful. If you think about it from the perspective of the mouse, there really is like a cute creature sitting on some clover, just chilling out in the darkness, and suddenly something that might as well be an HR Giger painting comes barreling into its house, raising one of its legs up, which is a sign that it's going to sting you, and then the mouse flees. The bee takes over the mouse's nest. I'm sure the mouse, as soon as it leaves its nest, fleeing from a giant insect, was eaten by a hawk, no doubt, and then dropped into the razor sharp snapping beaks of the hawk's brood. But there's justice in the world because at the end of this bee's life cycle, what happens, and this is what happens to every queen bee that gets old, is the other bees climb on top of the bee and begin to vibrate, and this vibration cooks the bee to death. Now, fortunately, and I think probably because whoever made this bee documentary knew that kids were going to watch it, they left out this one little tidbit that my wife showed me yesterday, which is the queen bee actually does this kind of terrified scream. I didn't know bees could scream. There's a name for it. It's called Fluting, I believe, some weird name like that, but it's a scream. It's a scream of anguish and confusion, a scream of anything that's being murdered by its many children, a kind of howl into the void. It's exactly the sound you might expect that you would make if you had evicted a mouse from its burrow and then laid a bunch of eggs and then tended to those eggs until they grew baby bees, and then those baby bees, once you got old, decided to roast you to death with their vibration. But why am I trying to describe it? I'll just play it for you. They're chewing on her wings. Let me turn the volume up a little bit so you can really hear it. Bee scream gang. Here's another fun fact that you might enjoy sharing with your friends at the dinner table. Have you ever experienced the need to poop when you go into a bookstore? I know maybe some of you have never been in a bookstore, not because you don't read, but because bookstores are going extinct. But when I was a kid, I would go into bookstores all the time. And every single time, I would suddenly have to poop. Now, I was mentioning this to my wife, and she said, yeah, the same thing happens to me, also in Target. So I decided that I would Google it to see if this was something other people were reporting and was thrilled to find out that there is something called the Mariko Aoki Phenomena. I understand what you're thinking. This is another bullshit thing that you're making up in your intro. So I invite you to Google it, and a Wikipedia page will pop up with an insane amount of data. But the essence of it is the Mariki, the Mariko Aoki Phenomena, is a Japanese expression referring to an urge to defecate that is suddenly felt after entering bookstores. Look it up. It's crazy how much research has been done into this phenomena. The people have so many people have experienced. My guess is a lot of the research is being funded by bookstores because it must suck when you get a job at a bookstore and you realize that people are constantly shitting in the bathroom all day long. You wouldn't expect it. And then probably your manager would be like, yeah, it's this phenomena, the Mariki Aoki Phenomena that just like, yeah, people are just, they blow it out in a bookstore. But yeah, there's a lot of, there's many, many explanations for it. There's the altered mental state hypothesis. There's the posture and gaze related hypothesis. There's the conditioned response hypothesis. There's the standard explanatory models. Look it up. There's even metaphysical theories related to this effect, which some people say actually happens to them in a target. So the world is a very fascinating place. And it's a place that fills me with such wonder to think that bees, queen bees are vibrated to death at the end of their lives and that I'm not the only one in the world who needs to poop when I go into a bookstore, but it's an actual phenomena. The point of all this is you got to keep learning friends. Don't let anyone stop you from exploring the inner recesses, the clammy yet somehow enticing damp pits and pools of congealed wisdom that is just right out there in front of you waiting for you to push your face. Just lift the fold of information with the nose of your curiosity and lap it up with your flickering tongue. We have got a wonderful podcast for you today. Comedian Annie Letterman is here with us. We're going to jump right into that. But first, this. I want to thank Athletic Greens for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Everybody knows that vitamins are one of the easiest ways to improve your health. All you got to do is start taking vitamins. But if you've ever been around a healthy vitamin chomping freak, then probably they've looked at whatever your particular vitamin you're taking is and scoffed at it saying, no, you've got to do this. And then they reach into their pocket and they pull out a big Ziploc bag full of thousands and thousands of pills. You know what I'm talking about? And you look at that and you think, I'd rather wither than eat that many pills per day. I don't even know if human existence is worth it. If every day I have to eat a giant Ziploc bag of pills and then probably spend what three hours sorting my vitamins every day. No, nobody wants to do that. But we do want the benefit of vitamins. And that is where Athletic Greens comes in. Athletic Greens is a great for simplifying endless pills, multi vitamins, multi mineral, probiotic, prebiotic and more.

I was before we started recording, I was telling you that I don't think I would do this if I were on the road. Like usually when I'm on the road, I like to just not do anything until the show. Watch true crime, masturbate. Yes, that's the pattern. For me, it's forensic files than masturbate. Yes. Oh, I do it during. I just have to, I time it perfectly. Oh, yeah. You know, I don't think my wife and I humped to Sean Hannity once and that was pretty fucked up. I just don't think I could jerk off to forensic files. I don't know how else I'm getting through it, you know, and then the coming is sort of like a, it's like a morning, the loss of the dead person. Wow, what a cool way to mourn. That's beautiful. Get it all out. Get the gunk out. Instead of this crying bullshit, just big orgasms. Yeah, I mean, why are we watching it anyway? Okay, so you're going deep right away. You mean you're getting into this idea that come on, what do you think? Like the way those shows try to make you feel is like you're studying something, but really you're just getting off on the dark. Oh, it's real. It's real. You might as well use their blood as lube. Come on. Wow. The blood of the innocent. The blood of the innocent is lube. Where, what is, wow, you are, you, this is your post pandemic identity, right? Like this is. Listen, I'm at the Mall of America. I'm doing two more posts tonight, one Sunday, Mother's Day show. I'm ready to go. What's the Mall of America like during like the ending of COVID? It's great. It's fine. Nothing. All it looks like is that everyone's Asian or something like pre-pandemic Asian, like everyone's wearing masks. It's just totally packed. None of the stores out of business, none of the stores. There's two Spencer gifts. One is like, and they're not like on other sides of the mall. They're just on different floors and like this far apart. What the fuck? Two Spencer gifts are flourishing. Also, they have a, I saw a store called alpaca connection where it's just all, honestly, I think it might be your favorite. You actually are the person most likely to buy something from the alpaca. What the fuck? What's there? It's like moccasins. How dare you? Your beard is like. Because I have a beard. It doesn't mean I wear moccasins. You don't wear moccasins? I don't. You're too good for moccasins? I don't know. It's not. I'm too good for. And then let go release. You're holding on to something. Okay. Look, I, what do you work for the moccasin cartels? I could only think that this is what's going on to keep this business afloat. I honestly, it made me think like, have I just been in a bubble in LA and the news has really just been making me think other people are wearing masks and. Yeah. In COVID because the economy is fine as far as the mob Americans. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's the LA when I left LA and came to Asheville, which is a very safe, like people are still wearing masks and stuff. It wasn't even close to that. To whatever was happening in LA, like LA was, was spooky. It was so intensely locked down. Whereas like other places, you know, at least some places have found what seems to be a nice logical middle way, just a normal, like, yeah, there's a pandemic. Yeah. Masks might help. We're going to wear masks, but LA was, I mean, it was nuts. Everybody went crazy. I love that shit. I loved the lockdown. First of all, I lived right by, I just moved, but I was living by the Grove, which is where they were burning all the cop cars. So it was just like, it was just helicopters and it did turn into a riot. I'm not, it was not people of color that started the riot. It was very young skaters. I saw them with their skateboard smash in the cop cars. Weren't you scared during all that shit? Didn't you feel legit? I was meditated. My boyfriend would come in and I was like, I literally meditated the entire day. He's like, you're still meditating. I was like, are you, you just meditate through the riot? I meditated the entire day as the helicopters were going around. I was like, I cannot deal with this. I just can't. Yeah. Like if you're into any kind of, and I don't know if you are, but if you're into any kind of like psychedelic, those helicopters just suck. Like I just hate tripping and a police helicopter goes by just every single time. It just feels like a goose walked over my grave. Yeah. Some things not. Yeah. You're not supposed to know that you're not supposed to be tapping back into that world. Yeah. And you're reminded that's a, you know, there's like a, like people in there with powerful weapons that are living in a completely different reality than yours. Like you're like, you know, you're hanging out, maybe a little stoned watching TV and they're in a militarized helicopter with their adrenaline pumping zooming over a city where they might have to like get into the gun battles with rioters. It was wild. It was so wild, but at least the homeless people can stay. What is your, what's your take on, on just LA in general right now? Because I, obviously I know people who've left. I know people who've stayed and a lot of the people I know who have stayed, I can't tell if they're just telling me it's fucked up over there to make me feel better. Cause they know I kind of, I must kind of miss it. Or if it's actually like fucked up over there still. It's like, it is fucked up, but it's very fun and beautiful and nice too. So it's like, I kind of just like don't, they're just my neighborhood in general where the cop cars were burned right in front of my house. Jesus. Um, the cops just don't really like go by anymore. Like they got defunded and they're not there. So, and, um, so there's like the thing with like the homeless people. I mean, I'm not supposed to call them unhoused, but I feel like that sounds like undead and they all seem very zombie likes. I feel like it's rude, but they are, it's really dangerous. Like it's really not like a safe. It's not just like people that like lost their homes and are just chilling. It's like crazy methodics. Like my citizens app. I'll just be living a normal life and then all of a sudden I'll go off. I'll be like, a homeless person jumped into someone's backyard stabbed them in the neck and some guys stuck in a palm tree or something. I mean, it's like, so I hate the fucking haps to tell you the crimes, but it was really like, it did just get to be a lot. And it just didn't seem like there was any, like there weren't cops like patrolling or doing anything. So it was just like a little bit. I don't really go out with my dog alone at night or anything. But other than that. Other than that. It's nice. Things are opening up again. It's like pretty cool. Pretty fun. That's what, that's the part I know. I felt such intense FOMO when I saw your name on the, those comedy store lineups again. And it was just like, oh, y'all, you might be in a city where like madness is just like everywhere to some degree, but it's almost worth it to perform. Even with the taxes and stuff, it's like, you're paying a price to live in this place. That's kind of like unmatched as far as weather and weird opportunities and weird people working to do things. Yeah. It's really fun. But I actually was also like a really cool place. I've had really fun times there. It's beautiful. And, and Austin, I haven't really hung out there, but I guess it's fine. Have you, you've been, you've been at. Yeah. I went to Asheville when I was looking for colleges in 2000, maybe or maybe 99. I went with my dad on like a road trip to a bunch to look at a bunch of schools. Wow. And I went to Warren Wilson. No way. That's where I went to school. You went there? Yeah. That's where I went to school. Oh my God. That is the weirdest fucking school. I'm like, I look, I aged 10 years and what I learned from two days of like sleeping over there and being a prospective student. What do you mean? What did you learn? It was the weird. Okay. First of all, trans people. I did not know anything about trans people. Okay. This is 1999. I knew about like cross dressers. I knew about drag queens, but I had no clue. People were like taking medicine to like alter themselves to look to match what they felt inside. It just wasn't a thing that existed in my brain. I go to Warren Wilson one day. Okay. Yeah. Everyone was like, there were very few, it was like, everyone was like shaved head lesbians like kooky, cool, weird, fringy people, which I was kind of used to from Philly anyway. Yeah. But I got set up with this, this girl named Gretchen. I'm wondering if you were there. No. How old are you? Are you 40? Yeah. But it did my age. I'm 47, but I was, I, I had, I had, I, I know. I'm so, I am. I thought that 47 is old. Now we have to be like 47 when I'm old. It's pretty old. I mean, Is it weird? It's old. It's not old. It's middle eight. Well, I mean, I, I, we're trying, I, we have two kids now. We try not to say, I try not to say it around the kids because my two year old the other day said, I'm getting old. Oh my God. I've already infected him with his neurosis regarding my age. But, um, yeah. So, but whatever you want to call it. I, I, this is something I've realized I've been doing, which is looking at people and thinking they're old. And then I realized like they're my eight. That's like my age that I'm judging. Whoa. And, but it's, it happens. I mean, what can you, what can you do? It just suddenly, you, you'll see, you'll like one day I'm 37. So when I see what I do is when I look at people that are 37, I go like, I look young and then I'll like ask my boyfriend who's 26. I'll be like, don't I look younger? And I'll be like, no, she like looks your age. And I'm like, don't I look younger than her? Yeah. And I'm like, no, she looks good. And I'm like, I don't be a feminist right now, bitch. I did that to my wife. She's younger than me. I showed her a picture of someone's like, do they, I don't look this old. Do I? And she's like, sometimes I know they're just honest. Yeah. They just, but I'm pretty much having her lie to me. What are you doing? But anyway, so, so I got set up with this girl Gretchen who was, I think that was her name, she was really like this very weird, cool, interesting girl who had, she was wearing a jumpsuit from when she got arrested from something. It was really funny. Like she had like a orange jumpsuit on or maybe just the shoes. I just, this was just like, I mean, I was just going to look at a school. She was wearing a jump. Wait, one second. The jumpsuit was an actual prison jumpsuit that she'd taken home. Yes. I remember, I think she wasn't wearing the whole thing. I think she was just wearing the shoes she got, which were almost like just like orange vans. And she let you know these are from my prison days. Yes. Wow. And I, she got arrested for like a protest or something. Okay. And then she, so then she, she also had, I remember this too. She had a x-ray of she got a, she was doing like circus act stuff and she got a nail stuck in her nose cause she was, she would put nails up her nose as like a thing. This is their school. This is your school to me. Okay. So then, and then so when she went and they gave her the x-ray, she just had it in her window, like a stained glass. Like, I was like, this is awesome. Wow. So you were with someone like who has been in prison, but has also suffered circus. Oh, she was like a mild hippie chick, like cool, like weirdo circus girl. You were definitely a one person. Right. So she then she had a play and she's like, do you want to watch the play or do you want to go with my roommate who was like shaved head? I remember she had nikes and she had the Nike symbol duct tape. She's like, my parents gave them me for Christmas, but I don't support Nike. So she duct taped the thing. Wow. And my dad, by the way, we might have to believe this, but my dad was like, I remember telling everybody's like, no, you got it. Nike, Nike, like it's just made me laugh so hard. Is your, your dad, did he say that out loud there? Because if, you know, not to her to me when I was like, yeah, and she was, and he goes, no, you don't see like the thought process. Dad's dad. Come on. He's so funny. It's a, you know, but anyway, so, so then I was like, well, I'll just, I don't really ever, I've never wanted to sit and watch a play in my fucking life, especially not like a school production. So I was like, I'll go with her. So she was like, yeah, I'm just going to watch this going to this like seminar in the city. So I was like, all right, I'll go. And we went to this like little room and it must have been in like an elementary school was just like this room at night. And there were like people sitting in a semi circle, like in little like desk chairs and horseshoed around four or five trans people. Really? Okay. And they would be like a, like a speech, just talking about being trans. Were they students or was it, I don't remember. When I was there, I do not remember. And then they just took us to, and she was just going to this like event. So they were just trying to, it was like an info session on like, this is something that happens and. But it was like, I was looking at someone who was like, I was born a woman and it looked like Louis CK and I was like, I am so confused. It was just like the most impressive mind blowing. I had just never even, I didn't know that there were like meds that could make a woman like bald and grow a goatee. Isn't that wild? That you can do. I mean, it's like absolutely amazing. And it's, I think it's much easier. Female to male. I think it's easier than male to female. I don't know. I mean, I, I don't know. I've never really looked into the, like what the process is when, if you want to do that, it seems like one of the more impressive things we have in medicine right now that if we want to, we can shift our bodies that much. It's fucking unbelievable. It is unbelievable. And you know, it's just going to, that technology is going to get better and better and better until it, we're able to do that with other things. You know, it's not going to stop with gender. It's, it's going to keep going with ethnicity. It's going to keep going with, you know, eye color, hair color. I'm sure. You know. Think about that sometimes. And it is like, she did get like a, like such a fucking everyone came after her. And if you think about it, what she's saying, and she was like, I'm transracial, what she's saying, a very similar thing. Like she really feels like she was born black. That's her identity. It's like they're going to be coming down the pipes. There are going to be so many interesting, like cultural moments where some group of people pushes back against another group of people taking their DNA into their own hands, so to speak. Cause like it's weird. It really is like frightening and upsetting to people that you, if you don't stay in the body you were born in, they feel like you, there's like this weird genetic predeterminism in their mind. If you're born like this, you must stay that way. And it's fascinating. Isn't it? It's like it's got a root from a feeling threatened, right? Like a fight or flight feeling like you're what you are. Like if you think of even like KKK shit or like white supremacy shit, it's very like keep us pure. Like, like we, what about our future race? We were like, why are you even thinking that far ahead? Living the moment. Right. And they're going to be so pissed if suddenly anyone who wants to can shift if somebody decides they want to be a Caucasian for a few weeks, cause that's the other thing about it is it's going to be like, I think one of the right now what like, because the medicine maybe isn't as advanced as it probably will eventually be. I'm no doctor, but I would guess there's like money in anyone who could create a way that you can transition genders and go back the other way, like in a day or two, like what if it could happen like that? Oh my God, that would be really, that would be very interesting because you would lose like that sort of, this is my culture. This is my identity. I was born into this. This is my tribe. You would lose that kind of, but you would gain understanding how other people were born in the other tribes. Yeah, just the experience, you know, I don't know what it's like to, you know, walk around as anything other than what I am. I don't know what that's like, but just that, that kind of stuff. And then, you know, it'll probably be for other things too. Like that neural mesh Elon Musk has, like the implications are crazy. I don't know about that. It's all I know is that he's on SNL and they made a safe space for there. Did you hear that? No, they're making a safe space for all of the people on the actors on SNL. If they're uncomfortable with Elon Musk being there. I mean, this is out of control. He's, wait, why is, what did he do? He's the, so he's the guest on SNL this week and Lauren Michaels or whoever made, um, I saw an article about it. They created a safe space for the employees that aren't comfortable with Elon Musk are triggered by Elon Musk. What did he say that pissed people off? I don't even know what I think they're Maddie's rich. I don't know. I have no because he's rich that he's like anti-vax. Maybe I don't know. Oh yeah. Right. Oh, it's probably that it's probably that, um, I don't know. He's like, I really don't pay attention to what people say or do. I'm just trying to have a good life and be happy. darlings. We have a new sponsor and I got to tell you, I am thrilled to present to you. Omegle, but days wait, don't skip. I'm, this is really going to change your life. You know, if you've been listening to the DTFH long enough that I love bedays. I've talked about them in the past and I, you get addicted to them. The reason you get addicted to them is because the moment you start using a bidet, you realize that up until that point, you have been a pretty disgusting creature. Like I don't mean to shame you. It's how we've been. Most many of us have been taught that you're supposed to use dry, white bits of paper to wipe the shit out of your ass. And it doesn't work all the time like that. You know, I don't have to get into like the gory details of the thing, but you know, sometimes it just, you need more than that. And so maybe you're a wet white person. Okay. Fine. But you're still just using wet paper to clean your ass. And you're probably clogging the cities of the world are collapsing because there are seven ton balls of wet wipes that have clombed together underneath the cities, creating horrible, sentient life forms. There's militias and armies that go down there to fight them. And most of the time they don't come back. So wet wipes are not the answer. The answer is Omigo, but days. Let's just get to the point. Here's the deal. The pandemic seems to be waning and that means people are going to be fucking. You're going to be fucking a lot. Whether you have registered that or not yet, it's going to happen. People are thirsty. They're horny and they're going to be humping. They're going to be humping in the parks. They're going to be humming in the streets. They're going to maybe be humping in their homes or probably they'll be in the fields humping like a Led Zeppelin song and you don't want to have a non bidet rinsed ass for the great summer of sex that is upon us. Get the Omigo, not just for you. Get it for your future lovers. You will be able to dive in to hump sessions, knowing that your ass is pristine and clean as some celestial temple. Omigo, they got a warm water wash. They've got customizable with pressure location, heated seat, an air dryer, LED nightlights and of course a remote control. Listen, this is definitely the most premium bidet that I have ever used. I've used many bidets. I've been to the Illuminati Mansions. I've used their bidets. This is better than that. This is exactly what your ass deserves. Think about it. Think about it. They say that the human incarnation is the most desirable incarnation. If you're a human being, it means you've done incredible things in your past lives to get that asshole that you've got. And that asshole deserves more than a dry, white wipe.

You know, I saw on Reddit just last night. There's a sci-fi book. Those are some real strong words. You know, I saw on Reddit. It's my number one source of all information. I love it. I love Reddit. I love it. There was a book from I think the 60s or the 50s that was about someone who took over who was like the king of Mars and his name was Elon. So it's really weird that that might be the guy who goes to Mars. But yeah, he's so, you know, he's one of the people right now who for better or for worse is like altering human society in a lot of different ways. I mean, if we get humans to Mars, then that's it's going to I mean, that's he's essentially like Jesus or something like he's the Mars. Maybe bars will go up in stock. Fuck. Yeah, they will. It'll be cheesy. It'll be one of the like silly things you do when you're sending someone a care package and like, you know what I mean? It'll be like, ah, here's a Mars bar. And then you'll get him like, oh, dad, come on. Our men from Mars are women from Venus and women from Venus. Oh, there you go. That'll be that when you go to Mars, did you stand up? That'll be like your opener. You'll have it. Do you want to know what I did in Minnesota? Yes. Do you want to know my opener? Okay. I said, um, hey guys, there were two. One was my do you want to hear the dad joke or the one that I actually can I hear both? Yes. Okay. So my dad joke was why do you call it Minnesota when you call soda pop? Shouldn't it be menopop? And I was like, do you guys hear that all the time? And they were like, no. And I was like, oh, cause it's like so bad. Nobody said it. And they're like, yeah, we've never heard that. We don't like it. Everyone was just like, so upset. I was like, I was just just asking that. What's that? I was just curious if you've heard. I go, I was like, is this hacky? Like if you've heard this before and they were like, so shocked that someone would say something so stupid. But I was like, I was just curious. Tell me your other Jeff. Okay. So then I said, I open up. Usually I said, you know, usually when I'm on the road, I kind of like Google what's going on and an area and what they're known for. And I do some jokes about it, but I'm not touching this one. Minnesota because of George Floyd. Oh, fuck. This is where it's down when I just hold it and they all crack up. That's cool. It's good. That's scary. That's walking on some state. You're brave. That's as cool as scary places. You're going through, but especially as your opener. Cause that's that thing. If it doesn't work, that could you're going to have to do like 15 minutes of work because isn't the way this is how I get people to laugh. I read the room. I understand where the tension is and I go straight for the tension. Sure. Yeah, that works. That works a lot, but sometimes it doesn't, you know, sometimes I'm maybe not, maybe for you, but it works. But for me, sometimes I've gone for the tension and then regretted it deeply or, you know, my attempt at like playing with that energy was not funny enough. And then, oh, nothing. Then now you have an offended crowd. They don't trust you. You can't be nervous when you say something like that. No, you got to come. I definitely have some like race, like, like race is the topic of some of my jokes. And if I have any sort of like hesitation at all, it's done. Do you, um, what do you have, you know, does it? Do audiences feel different? I mean, you've, you've been performing through a lot of the pandemic. I'm not all the time because the store got shut down very little, very little, but honestly, but you've been out there a little bit. Have you, can you comment on what it was like performing for audiences? Uh, when it was a, when we were more in the depths of the pandemic versus now, does there seem to be a change in the audience that you're experiencing? It felt so weird because it was such small audiences because they couldn't have that many people. And so the, the shows that I did do were, um, I did some stuff. Whitney Cummings put some, some shows on in her backyard and it was for like random, like it would be like, it would be like Olivia Munn and then like Amanda Cyrini, who's a influencer with like 225 million five, like just like random people were like, Oh, like just this sort of like, um, Frankenstein audience of Whitney friends, which was really fun. And that was like a really cool, because it felt like such a hang was in her backyard and she's such a pretty place. And you know, just Whitney's just so fucking crazy and like so committed to whatever she's doing. Yeah. It's just going to be a success no matter what. And so that was really fun. I did a couple of those and that felt really like we're all outside. I don't know. It just felt like excited for like a little treat, like a little party. And then I did some shows when the comedy star was semi open. They were doing shows in the, that window that they have in the OR that goes out to the front patio. Yeah. They were sitting people in the front patio, but they couldn't have that many people. That was when I saw that, that was depressing. Sorry to cut you off. When I saw that online, I just, that made me feel sad. It seemed like a really brutal way to have to perform, but it was actually so fun. I thought it was fun because then the loud speaker was going out and it was just fun because sometimes there was like the timing was off. So it was just like, you just had to surrender to the fact that it was going to feel like you were bombing, whether you were bombing or not, because a laugh will come up two seconds after, you know, so you're like, and then they would laugh or you would be onto your next joke and they wouldn't be laughing. You're like, oh my God, I just, but you kind of missed your bomb too. So you're like, all right. And it was just, it was just a weird, it was just a weird little thing. It was fun. It was like, you know, I think what I've liked about this pandemic is just any sort of illusion of control is just out the fucking window. Like there is no control. So it was a lot of like surrendering to the moment and like, I'm in this weird situation with the comedy store right now and just enjoying it. It was fun. So, okay. So now you're at work kind of coming out of the pandemic. You were, is this your first time in front of an audience audience since the pandemic started? Yeah. Well, I did, I did an outdoor show. This is the first time I did an indoor show at the comedy store last week. Okay. Yeah. And it was very fun. Um, different vibe. It was like, so it feels like, you know what it feels like? It feels like a business has closed for the, for the night and you all are the ones that didn't leave. Like it feels like you've been locked in or something. Right. You know, it feels like, and especially like these shows here because they're in the mall of America. You, and when you walk out, you're literally in like a shutdown mall. Everything feels like easy or something. Fuck. It feels like sneaky. So it's more exciting. It's like, yeah. It's like, we're like, ooh, we're like breaking the rules or something or we're back, but it's like, are we allowed to be here? Are we going to, is this going to be taken from us again? Wow. It's really cool. But also I'm having a whole nother thing happened because my podcast that I started with, um, Kalilah and Esther Pavitsky is like blowing up. It should be blowing up. May I just say it's so funny. You and y'all are doing such a good job promoting it when your Instagram clips are so funny. Congratulations. That's it. That is it. That is a podcast that will blow up because it's hilarious. All of you are just really, really funny and so perfect with each other. And Esther and I have been friends for like, you know, 12 years, getting advice, not talking for years. Like just always kind of, but we just can never deny that we have this fucking dynamic that just works and we just never could find the right glue or whatever. And then Kalilah is just like this fucking gift sent from heaven and she's just so cool and she just like mixes like both of us. Like she just has like both of our qualities. And so it's just like, all just mixes together so well and the production company is so good and it's just really fun. So it's just like so easy. Like I've never, it just, I'm now realizing like, you know, that's saying that everything good is downstream. No, I've never heard that. No. Everything good is downstream. So if you're like resisting, it's like you're going towards something that's not even good. And this is just such a downstream. It's just so easy. It's like, don't have to like resist or find anything. So then when did you start it? We started it. It's like we're on our like 12th episode and it's just like what my shows are filled. I'm like almost selling out, which I never had before and it's all people. They're like yelling out things. I've said, I just never had that experience. You know, I've been doing it like 12 years, but I just never really hit and I, I think during this pandemic, I had to get real with myself on how that was like me, you know, I was like definitely the one blocking myself and not putting myself out there and being really worried about judgment and which is so crazy because in a sense, that's what our job is, right? Like there's it. We're projecting out into an audience and then they're like letting us know what they think. But I just realized like, and I was very worried about getting canceled. I don't know. I just was like, and I just had this like epiphany where I was like, if I'm worried about getting canceled or if I'm worried about like people not liking what I'm saying or just being nervous about that, then it's like, I'm just doing a disservice to everyone on the earth. Do you know what I mean? Like what is that? Why do we need more people that are just like holding back? There's no reason to do that. And holding back for and now I'm not and the whole world is. But yeah, but also think of who you're holding back for. You're you're holding back for a non-existent thing, a phantom that you've invented in your mind, the whatever the canceling person who you're afraid to offend when in general, most of the time when I've directly responded to somebody trying to like seemingly being corrective with me or something and I've been honest with them. You usually you realize like they actually were either legitimately like their feelings got hurt, but they liked you and they were confused and then you start talking to them and you realize, oh, they weren't trying to hurt me at all. They were just like, you know, speaking up for themselves or they're what they consider to be their position regarding whatever it was. I'm just saying my image of that is a cruel person. He really doesn't give a shit. Just wants power, wants to shut people down. But then when you most of the time, it's just someone who's like, oh, yeah. Oh, thanks for writing back. Why? You know what I mean? Or you're like or they're just totally no matter what they're doing, it's just completely about them. It just has nothing to do with you. So it's like I'm out here taking every fucking thing that happens personally. I'm like the wind blows and I'm like, how dare you, right? You know, and it's like why it's like focus on yourself bitch. Just what am I like doing and putting out and like instead of just I'm just absorbing negativity for no reason. You know, like I got like a DM from someone being like you got chubby and I'm like that's stupid. You know, you have this like moment where you're like, wait, am I going to like take this on? It's like or am I going to realize this is like a fucking also there's a fat slob that's been just fapping to me for just days like he's just got like his hands are bleeding from jerking off to me. Like he's just and he's just like, oh, I think I know how I'll get her to like think about me and then here I am like talking about in the pockets. But I just I'm just using an example because I got it today and I was like, oh, I no longer that's old me if I were to even take that on. Oh, yeah. And also I look fertile. You don't look fat. That's just an asshole. But that is women. Y'all have a no, I understand the psychology and I'm like above that feeling. So it's like I can like take that on but then like why am I saying why would I then say if like a social justice warrior came after me because I said something that she thought was like ableist. Why would I take that on to when it's almost the same fucking thing and it's coming from the same place where it's like I want to have my say and what this person does and I think I speak very freely and I think that that is like triggering for people that don't feel like they can. So why would I then instead adopt what they are dealing with so that they're not mad at me? You know, like I'll just continue to live freely and like whatever happens happens and trust that that's like the way it's supposed to be and it's all good. Yeah. I mean, I think you know what I mean? Yeah. I also comments. I mean, what do you like comments are? It's like it's it's Vegas for your ego. Like every time you go into your comments, you're just pulling the slot machine. You don't know what you're going to see. It might be someone saying you're so funny all the time. It's a lot of time. I can like reading comments and I'm like, I'm sorry if you had a place you could go on the Internet or before telling you like you changed their life and you're this or that and a few of them are like, fuck you, bitch. Hope you die. Can you know, like you would and of course the content ones are the ones to stay with you. But you know, it's like would you not be good look, but it really is like I I'm I'm doing a program where I'm trying to like retrain my subconscious identity and like working on establishing new habits and stuff. So what program? What it's called the transformation. I was not going to talk about it until I was done with it, but I'm going to talk about it because it's really like fucking unbelievable. It's this guy Jim Fortin who I was listening to his podcast and there's some things about him. I very much I'm not in a line with but I do like a lot of what he does and it's called the transformational coaching program. I'm writing it down. And it was like way more money. I spent way more money on it than I've ever spent on anything in my life to join this thing, but I just was like so called to join it. I was like, I got to do this. Is this your first coaching thing like that? Have you done something like this before? No. Well, do you remember you told me about the hundred day challenge? Yes, I do. I signed up and paid for that two or three times and never opened one email. I know. Fuck this hundred days. I know. But this one, I think I spent so much money on it that it was like, all right, you have to do it. And I just really was ready because I just was realizing that it's me. It's me. There's no like person I can blame for my life. I just heard the term blame storming. No. Where you bring instead of brainstorming, you're just blame. You're like, who can I blame? Oh, blame storming back. You're like, who can I place this blame on? Yeah, just like, you know, any sort of unhappiness or disease I have is because of that. It's like, because I'm like, it's such an external locus of control where I'm just like letting these outside sources tell me whether I'm good or I'm bad or I'm like comparing myself to other people always. It's every every time I'm upset. It's some sort of like outward thing that I'm taking on. So I was looking at my habits and stuff. And so this program is a lot about how like you like don't take on these things that you say you are these identities. It's like, you're just this person that's experiencing these things or like you have done these things and they're just they're things that, you know, you can you can if you do like enough work on you can shift them. So in the habits section, we've been talking about they say like doing like micro changes or I'm totally misquoting all this stuff, but it's a lot of information all the time. But so like micro changes. So what I realized today I need to do is I'm always like I always go on my phone and when I'm going on my phone, it's like to distract myself like I love like talking to my friends and FaceTiming with my family or my friends and my boyfriend or someone like all day. And you know, I'm looking at like what am I committed to in my life like his whole thing is like whatever you have in your life is like what your habits are. It's like what you've created it. So I'm like, okay, that resonates with me and I do feel like I spend a lot of my time on the phone and it's not like I don't like it. I'm having fun. I'm laughing, but it's like I'm committed to my communication and stuff, but I could just be committed to getting my work done and then like having a little communication on the side. Yeah, every time I'm going to call someone I'm like thinking about it, am I calling them because I have something I really want to say or that I want to have this like moment of this burst of joy with my friend or is it because right now I know that the thing would benefit the goals I have would be to sit down and like work on this audition and I'm not doing it. So now every time I touch my phone, I'm like making myself stop and the little micro habit is to sort of address like what am I touching my phone for? That's brilliant. That's brilliant because it might be a micro habit, but fuck over time, like evading whatever that learned to Wow, that's so and you've been how long you've been doing that? The touch in the phone. Yeah. I came up with that about 10 minutes before this call. Okay. Yeah. See, that's the problem is now I'll stick to it. You know what I'll just try to do it. I would my one of my friends was telling me he was reading some book by like a Tibetan monk who was saying habits are like when you know, like when a receipt is rolled up or when a piece of paper is rolled up and you push it down and then it comes back up. That's what a habit is and you have so you have to keep pushing it down and if you do it long enough, it'll stay down, but it takes, you know, there's actually I think there's science behind how many days it takes to create. Yeah, I've heard 27. I've heard 90 days. I just you know, it's actually for me. It's six days. I've been studied. Wow. You're in a wooden being. Yeah, it's only six. It was seven, but now it's six. Yeah, but honestly, you really could just decide that and have it be that you really could just decide now that I break my habits in six days. And then because you said it's true, it just is true. You know, I don't know. My problem with this stuff is I will get into it and when I get into it, I'm in it and then at some point I'll just wake up in the morning like fuck that. I'm not going to do that. And then it's then I just like lose it. I hate that because it's very frustrating. It was cute when I was like in my 20s, but now I don't know how much time I've got left. Have you ever seen, have you ever, this is the most horrific like this is gangster. If someone has one of these at our age, at least our age and your age, my age and your age. Thank you. It's a big deal. You know, age fucking they have stoic calendars where you, they put like a hundred little like dots on it. Yeah. And then it's like, and they'll break it down from like years to day to weeks or to months to days. So then they have as many weeks as there is in a life of a hundred years and you check off where you're at. I mean, it makes you, I'm like, that to me is too much pressure. If I sold that when I was fucking 17, maybe. Yeah. And then each day when you see how much life you have left and it's like, that's that's too much. That also there's a, you know, anytime anybody really lets themselves believe they're going to live the average human lifespan. It's like, that's kind of optimistic, you know, like probably not like, especially like, if you look at how things can change globally in a second, including human lifespans, really you think you're going to live to be a hundred. Give me a fucking break. You need to like go to the like probably around 90 and just generally gray out everything past 90 anyway, because you're going to be, you're going to be pretty confused mostly. Your brain is going to be all fucked up. You have to have that in your head too. So you're going, even though I'm working towards this, it's less. They might have it as the average lifespan too. I don't know, but it's just so, and it's interesting because my dad's 79. So like he's like going through this sort of like transitional time where he's just, you know, surrender to his age and what's going down and stuff. And it's interesting. He's got a very good sense of humor about it and it's just interesting to watch and I'm just trying to not like attach myself to anything and is your dad a Quaker? My parents brought me up quicker, but my dad was never quicker. My dad's, I think he had like found God in the military, but then he would never even talk to us about it. Whoa, you have a military dad. But barely. It's like barely. My dad's just this sort of like fucking hilarious, like shiny little light. I don't know. He's so funny. He just, and he was very angry when he was, like when I was younger, he was working. He just didn't ever want to work for other people and he just, you know, had ADD and just couldn't get his work done and all this self shame and all this stuff. And he just has like, you know, I always feel like people when you get older, you have like the choice to like go in or go out and he and my mom both just like are just becoming so great and so happy. Like, I saw them. We all got vaccinated and I got to go see my family and we're staying in a hotel when we're visiting my nieces. My dad's like his balance is an issue now. So he's like bumping into walls and my parents are just cracking up every time he bumps into wall. They just start like hysterically laughing. They just have such a good sense of humor about everything. And it's just really like, it's nice to see and I've also really come to terms over this, this break, I guess that we've been on that like these moments in my life where I'm just so much like my parents and you know, people say there's like a negative thing. I just like love it. It's just so funny. I just like the way I binge eat and like, I don't know. They're just like things that that, you know, I've made wrong before and I'm like watching my family and it's, you know, so many of my fun members of my family and my parents like fighting over icing and stuff and shoving cake down garbage disposals and stuff just like just laughing and just being naughty, eating gummy bears with my dad and stuff like, and so then I'm like thinking about it in my life. I've like created this thing I need to change and I'm looking at it and like, I see it in my own life. Like my boyfriend will get Oreos and he'll like hide them up tall because I asked him to keep him away from me and then he'll like come into the kitchen. I have like a knife and I'm like trying to get them down, you know, and then he's like grabbing my wrist like knocking the thing out of my hand like wearing like a slasher film and I'm just laughing harder than I've ever laughed in my life and I'm just like, I'm absolutely 100% my parents like this is so crazy, but it's like an honor. You know, I love it. Do you, they must be so excited for you though. That must be really to get to share. It's so funny. Yeah. What they're because they they're probably watching your podcast online. If I'm very proud of you and they're probably really getting like really happy because it is at least for, for, I know it was very hard for my parents that I decided to be a comedian like that was a stressor for them and it's such an uncertain job to pick up, you know, it's so uncertain. No matter, no matter what, even if you're the funniest human on earth, you know, there's still things that could go wrong. There's still, you know, wrong turns you're going to make. They could end up with you giving up or whatever, but it's must be so can you talk about that a little bit like what are they, how are they doing now that they're seeing, you know, your podcast start taking off and you're, you know, you're able to tell them, holy shit, people are coming to my shows and calling out stuff from my podcast. How are they responding to that? They're just really happy. I mean, my parents have always been really supportive, like maybe in the very, very, very beginning when I told them they were like, no, but I mean, it really comedy has always made me so happy. Even when I was upset, it was just like, it was just something that I was able to dedicate myself to and work really hard at and just really enjoyed. So my parents were just fucking happy that I found something, you know, because before I was like a go-go. I mean, I was doing crazy things. My dad just happy I'm not on a podium dancing. You were a go-go dancer? Which they would have supported me dancing. I was a go-go dancer for a little bit. How long? All right, dad's like, do you just want to borrow money? Do you want to borrow money? Just for like a summer when I was 24, maybe 21 or maybe I was 21. No, I was 21. I just turned 21. So, okay. So then Santa Fe in Mexico. I have a few questions for you about comedy, but just because you mentioned being a go-go dancer and it's something a couple of times I've walked into a place and there's go-go dancers and can you maybe talk a little bit about the distinction between a go-go dancer, a professional dancer and like a stripper? What are the, what's the difference? Oh, okay. So go-go dancer at the place that I worked was you just wore kind of like, you could wear whatever you want. They didn't tell me what to wear, but I wore like a little mini skirt and like knee-high boots and I would wear like a shirt that like showed my bra and like those fake like chicken cutlets look like a big boobs like glitter, fake eyelashes. Right. And you just had these podiums and you would just dance on them and people, it's funny because they did hire a stripper and she would come up like pasties and I faked it and she was like taking tips and stuff. And I was like very like kind of disgusted by all of it. Like I was, I would be like on the podium like don't look at me, you're objectifying me. I remember the, there was these two gay guys, a gay couple that go in the club and they were like, you don't have, I'll be crying and like they're all like looking at me and they're like, you don't have to work here. Right. You're not a steward, you're a slave. Oh yeah. I was sweating. I was sweating. My chicken cutlets would like, you know, like rise up, people like, we can see your thingies. Were you getting tips? And you just like dance and people like, I never want, yeah, they would tip you. I didn't really like that. Like the owners would tip me 50 bucks. I made 50 bucks an hour and then the owners would give me like 50 or a hundred. And I didn't like when people gave me tips, but I also like, that's, that's also like a money pattern that I'm working on now that's, I've just kind of worked on releasing and now I'm just fucking like a money bag. It's crazy. I just went from like no money to just like I opened my, I came back from vacation the other day. It was like two days before the end of the month. And I've been living in this apartment with construction because someone had bought the building and they are going, they were buying some of the people out. So I've been waiting for this payout from this building. Oh yeah. And you know, thinking I'm going to get like 30 to 80 grand. Yeah. Right. So I've been waiting and they, they are just doing construction and all of the things are. So for a year during the pandemic, when I'm trapped in my house, I'm in hell. There's just pounding all day. That sucks. It's insane. There's dust everywhere. It's dirty. God. And I didn't leave because I was like, I need this money. I'm broke. I need this money. Right. Like just living in this really like weak victim place where I'm like, I'll just stay in here. I got an ulcer. Like I was sick. I was sick from this place. I was getting headaches. Like it was just really, really bad. So I did all that. And then my boyfriend and I went, we saw our family, got our vaccine, saw our family. It was like such a cool, beautiful time, so much fun. And then we come back to this shithole. Right. And we're walking up our parking and gotten taken away. Like that. And then they were doing construction on the street too. So we had to park like really far away. It's a really homeless neighborhood. So it's like, we're walking through like not a great. I don't, it's not a place I want to walk alone anymore. So it's like we're parking. It just like felt like hell, right? Yeah. And for a year we've been doing this. We walk up after a beautiful time and our whole front building is boarded up. They've now like started doing even more construction and we're just like laughing. It's like, and then the streets torn up right in front of our apartment. We're like, we just look at each other like we're fucking out of here. I don't care what we have to do. This is, we're not spending one more fucking month here. Yeah. So then we go like fuck the bar. We go to the mailbox. I open the mail. There's a fucking letter from the IRS and I'm like, oh my fucking God, are you kidding me? Seriously? Of course I'm going to have to pay for the thousands of dollars for something behind my taxes. Yeah. Fuck. And like, I'm like, thank you mommy. You know, and then I go, wait, I spent a lot of money on this fucking course I'm taking, right? So I got to listen to like those things. So I like, I just thought about it and I, I was like, all right, I'm just a person experiencing this anxiety. I'm not an anxious person. I'm just, it's running through me and I'm just, I don't know what's going on. I'm attaching an outcome to something that's not there. Yeah. And I was like, I'm just going to choose that I'm a money magnet and that I, I get money. I opened the fucking letter. It's a, I didn't claim one of my tax returns in 2018. It was $6,000. Wow. So I went from feeling like I had zero dollars and I want money to $6,000. Wow. And we, I told my friend and she's like, oh, my friend Rachel just found this really cool place in Venice that's like, it just, they just found this place by the beach that's like protected as 24 hour security. It's like totally beautiful. Yeah. We went, made our appointment and moved in two days later. Wow. And it's like beautiful. We're so happy. Our dog. There's a, we have a dog park right there. It's just like perfect. Amazing. And I was just staying there because I need this payout. I need this. You, I mean, that toxic environment. LA is hard enough. LA being a comedian is really scary. And like so many things like that happen. Just suddenly your life gets completely just smashed down by exactly what you're saying. You're fucking apartment building. Some, some, for me, usually it was definitely bad decisions I made. Like, I don't need to pay these parking tickets. What's the big deal? Then your car is gone or some shit. And they, then you have no car. Then you have no car and you really do experience to me what really, what I like that you're describing it as hell because it's like something about being in Los Angeles, you know, having like advert like extreme fucked up adversity. You know, for me, roaches in my apartment that I couldn't afford even though it was only like $600 a month mixed in with. Only roaches in my apartment get smoked. It's very cruel. You shouldn't do that. I mean, I know they're bugs, but they feel when you're burning but the, yeah, but you, they get pretty high. But yeah, it's just, I can remember having more than a few brushes with that LA reality and thinking this is hell. I can't think of anything worse than this. It's not like literally flames, but at least flames are consistent. You know, this is more like just some perfect combination of fucked up things. An up a pandemic, an apartment where they're doing renovation during a pandemic, not having enough money. So it's almost like you went through some kind of initiation or something. Yeah, but I also kind of realized like I could have left that place at any time like I really like imprisoned myself and if you look at like, you know our fucking good friend is one of the richest people like alive who is like, he's a good dude. He's just like us. It's like, if he can do those things, why can't it's like, I look at that and I'm like, Oh, there's like a mindset and I feel like with Rogan and even with like with me and stuff and my friends that have a lot of money. Yeah. They're just like looking at the pitch like come up. What are you doing? Right. I remember I used to open for Rob Schneider. And he's like, the door is open and he stepped into it. And I'm like, what are you talking about? I don't understand. He's like, step in. We all want you here. Like come here. Yeah. And I didn't understand what he meant. It is like, I didn't realize how much I was like really needing and realizing that I was like committed to a roller coaster. And the thing you were saying about how when you get really into those programs and stuff and then you like pop out, I like live for that roller coaster. Why did we start doing comedy? It's a fucking roller coaster, right? Like I like have committed my life to these ups and downs and stuff. And I've always, I was like being a waitress. I always like things where it's like, I didn't know. So I need to accept responsibility for the fact that that's like something that I've like gotten off on. Like that's something I've actually aimed for. Right. And now that I'm like a little bit older and getting more comfortable with myself, I would like the comfort of having money. Like I would like to be able to have steady money coming in and get rid of those worries. I also was thinking because you know, I have a lot of like so much of my life is my connection with my dad. And I realized too during the pandemic that I think a lot of the times when I would run out of money, I was doing it almost subconsciously on purpose because my dad would always save me. It was always this like experience of, and that's sort of one of my like childhood wounds was that my, I didn't feel like my parents like protected me, but they always did as far as like, I always had clothes, a house over my head. Like I always was like taking care of financially and that sort of stuff. So I think I was, it was like a way to stay connected to my dad. So you feel that feeling of him saving. And once I realized like, yeah. Are you in therapy? Did that come from therapy or just from contemplation? No, it came from like just meditating. And, you know, before the pandemic, I had started doing ayahuasca. I did it like two times and that like, I kind of got a lot of lessons from that. Like, I don't really have an urge to do it again right now, but I'm still kind of reaping the benefits of the lessons I learned in that. And a lot of it was like, I remember it's so funny. This is actually really weird. My last ayahuasca trip, which was like in maybe May before the pandemic. And I asked this question to mother ayahuasca before I did it, the ceremony. I said, what do I need to do to bring my career to the next level? Like, I know I have what it takes, but like, how do I like put this into place? And in my, in my trip, I had this vision of I was like, I need to bring my female audience up. Like I got the guys already and now I need to do something for like the girls. And I literally saw a vision. It was like Powerpuff Girls, like three girls, like me and two other girls just like working together and kind of like, it's like rainbows and unicorns. I didn't even realize it until like really recently that that's like exactly what the podcast is. And it wasn't like I was going for this or trying to do everything. It was just like some of this lesson I learned. And another thing was I had just been at my niece's house and my sister-in-law is so good at teaching my niece's structure, which is something that I lacked in my childhood. So it like she, I was, it was, I was so like blown away by them just being taught to like flush the toilet, put the seat down, go pull the stool over, stand up, wash their hands, dry their hands, turn the light off, close the door. I was like, oh my God, that's something I don't do. You know, my fucking, there's always floaters in my toilet and I'm fucking almost 40, right? So I'm like, oh my God, like this is incredible. I'm like so impressed by these basic things because I realize the freedom it gives them in the rest of their lives, right? To have this sort of like simple ingrained, just like you just automatically do it. They don't have to think about it. So that also came up in my hallucination where it was like, just wash your hands bitch, like shut the lights off, like just like get yourself in order because I think I was using this chaos as a way to keep myself in a smaller place where I felt more comfortable and like didn't think people could like get me or whatever, or whatever my reasoning for not doing this or living my fullest. But so then it's like, so now I'm at this hotel and this is the first time I've been on the road where I'm like, oh maybe I'll just keep my place nice because usually I just dump it out. I even like will leave the pee in the toilet on purpose to like assert my dominance over the room, you know? Yeah. And I just like, I just weren't ready for this call. I was like, oh, I have a couple minutes. I'll just tidy up and I just like folded everything. Doesn't that feel like, oh, that feels so weirdly good to do that. And it's such a powerful thing to be in a hotel. And to, you know, I generally when I go in a hotel, I destroy, I don't, I don't even know what's happening. I destroy it. But there's a fun in that, right? There's almost like an excitement in that. I don't know. It's like rockstar. I'm gonna fucking trash this bitch. It's, I mean, when I'm leaving my hotels, I'm thinking to myself like, if someone like, there was a contest and someone asked you to destroy a hotel like this, you wouldn't be able to. You know, you could, it requires like such high levels of complete unconsciousness, basically, you know? Or you're just like, how did one of my socks end up like on top of a thing? And then the other sock ended up in a couch cushion that I didn't sit on. What am I doing? But if you, but I was interviewing Tom Papa and he said something really simple that stuck with me, which was if you are, if you're just being mindful when you're doing things, like if you're there, it always tends to be better. You know, it's like when you go into that unconscious sort of autopilot state, that's when everything gets scattered around you. And I, you know, for me, when I, I came, I came out of a lifetime of that, like my life was the hotel room. My life was scattered everywhere and madness and insanity. You know, yeah, that's something we do to ourselves. I don't know. Like it also was fun. Like I don't want to like knock this like way I've been living. Like it's been fun to trash everything and it's been fun. Like I'm a fucking mess and I'm, you know, I'm, I'm this and I'm that. But it's like in the end, it's, you know, for me right now, when I look at the things that I want to do, if I just put a little bit of order in, it just makes it a little bit easier. And just like that whole idea of like not having enough time is something I always felt. Like it's almost like I would like set myself up for failure by wasting my time or throwing my stuff around. And then I can't find my things. And I'm like, I can't make it because my, um, do you need to get it? I can't. Is that an emergency? Do you need to get that? Is that something related to your show? I don't answer it. The internet is a swamp and your computer is like some bloated, massive, blood filled swamp pig.

When something like that is happening, it's hard for me to concentrate because I will think it's, oh my God, it's the worst. Who knows what it is? My mind goes nuts. Yeah, I'm fucking over those feelings. I'm not doing that anymore. I love it. So when I came on this, wait, can I just tell you when I came on this fucking, okay, so I've been doing this course, right? Where I'm like, really realizing I read this book called the power of the subconscious mind, which is a little gaudy. So you have to like not play into that part. But the thing that this guy, the author, if I can't remember the name, the thing that he sort of presented the idea was his hypothesis was that you are the creator of everything in the whole universe, right? So like your brain has created every single thing here, which I'm like, okay, that I actually can like understand that. So then when I'm going to do these shows, right? Like I did my first like outdoor show in front of a real audience that wasn't the comedy store in Venice. And I was driving in there, sort of get that like old panic that I would get. And then I'm like, I'm choosing this panic. Like there's no other thing in the earth that's giving me this panic except me. And so I was like, I'm just going to choose that I'm going to have the best time. And I now I go into my shows without like, with no attachment to an outcome and like in the moment. And it's like, I can handle any heckler. Like there's just nothing like that. And I know I work better in the moment too. I work better when I'm just laser like in the moment. Yes. So it's just like, there's no reason for me to do that. I script and all of a sudden I'm like the script comic. I'm not, I've never been that person. Right. Right. So like, I'm not going to be one of those people like I get this joke and this joke. So that's like this panic. When I came here, I've done so much work on myself and not like having that feeling. I started to have a complete meltdown before my shows. Like, Oh my God, are the numbers going to be good? Oh my God, I was thought I leveled up, but I didn't level up and I'm back here again. And I'm going to have to borrow money from my parents and like, oh, like, you know, just like went through all the negative things. And it was just like, all right, stop, stop, stop. And I was like doing the best I could to be like, all right, read, like, read, like redirect yourself, like look at something else. And I was able to kind of calm myself down. And then when I got to the show and it was like just the best show ever and all these people were there to see me. And it was just like really like a very loving, fun, cool experience. I was like, that is dead. Like I will never let myself have that anxiety again. Like I'm never going there. It's I'm the university has already told me enough times that it's not going to happen. So the only way the show is bad is if I decide it's going to be bad. Right. It's the only way. Wow. Because even like, look at Bill Burr getting booed off. That was one of his best shows. One of the best. Yeah, that's one of his most monumental. He was already on the map. But that was that was the thing that like that was everywhere. Everyone watched that. And it was so brilliant what he did. But you know, this what you're saying reminds me of something that my meditation teacher study with this teacher called Chogym Trumper Rinpoche. And he was Alan Ginsberg's, I guess you could say guru, basically Alan Ginsberg, the poet. Oh, and so Alan, Alan Ginsberg at one point Alan Ginsberg was like comparing their travel. Like Chogym Trumper Rinpoche is like speaking engagements and Alan Ginsberg was going around reading his poetry and Ginsberg's bitching about it to Chogym Trumper. He's like, oh, you know, all these fucking shows and Chogym Trumper said to him, you don't like your poetry. You don't like your poetry. And Alan Ginsberg's like, wait, what are you? Don't tell me about my poetry. How could you say that? And he said, why don't you just go on stage and write your poetry there? Don't you trust your mind? And it was like, blew my mind as a comment because it's like, yeah, it's like what you're talking about is the flow. And when you get there accidentally, which I think a lot of comedians get there accidentally. And maybe we try to reverse engineer it, you know, like, well, I was kind of stoned. I had two beers. I exercised that day. And so maybe that's why it worked that time. And then when you see you invent all these things, I think what you're talking about is just you just have to be there. Like you just trust and it's like, yeah, I have these books that I wrote, but I don't have to get to them and they don't have to land a certain way. Like I just could be like, read the room and do what I do, which is cut the tension. I just have to like what I do. And it's like you and then you're building an experience with these people. And yeah, I just because it's true. Like if I'm having it's because I don't like my jokes. It's like if I don't like my jokes, because I remember asking my friend Hannah Fidel is this really successful. She's a screenwriter and she made some movies. She did. I was a was in her movie The Long Dumb Road on Netflix and I was in it really short, but it was good. Super cool. Good. And yeah, and she like she wrote the show a teacher that was on FX like she's just very successful. And I met her in a coffee shop years ago in New York and I just always admired her work ethic and stuff. And I was like, how do you write? Like how do you just sit down and write? And she's like, any I love doing it. And I was like, well, okay, but yeah, but then I got it. It's like, oh, yeah, you just everything good is downstream. Like you just go with the light. Like you don't have to make everything so fucking hard. Right. I'm just getting my flow. It's like you don't have to just make everything so fucking difficult all the time. And then because you know the comics we get into like such blame where it's like, you know, why did that person get that thing? It's like so gross. Yeah. I, you know, like do what makes you happy. I think if I say it's going to be easier to write. I was really too good. I'm sorry. No, you go ahead, please. I was just going to say like I was realizing that what I was doing with money is what I was doing with jokes to like where I was like living out of like the lack of money and being like I'm broke and thinking about what I don't have and what I need to pay for and like panicking. And then in that time taking up all that space, right? Like cluttering or like destroying the hotel. That's our brain with that shit. Yes. Rather than being like, oh, where are these active solutions? They're so easy. Like let me look out the window. It's a beautiful day. Like I don't need my room to be trapped. You know what I mean? Like I can just like come up with solutions. So then what I was doing with jokes was I would have this panic if I don't have enough jokes. I've a lack. It's impossible to write jokes when literally I'm spitting jokes out to everyone all day. If I can do that, why am I being less myself? Right. Like it's so now I just every time everything was hard and I was realizing where I quit is very quickly. Right. Like the minute something gets hard because when I was a kid, my mom used to write my papers for me. No. So the minute I would have like discomfort, someone would come in and see me. Yeah. So I think I got addicted to that. Like, oh, if I quit this thing when it hurts, I'll get saved. And then when that stopped happening, it just was addicted to the quitting thing when it hurts. And then I would get saved by like TV or internet or something. So then now whenever I feel that way, I just go, I just go, it's easy. It's easy. It's easy. And then it is easy. Yeah. I know, you know, that I have enough time. If you're robbing yourself of that feeling, which a lot of people do, it's the learning curve. The learning curve fucking sucks. You know, it sucks. And it's, it does hurt. And I feel like it's okay to admit this is this hurts. The reason it hurts is because we like to be in control. And if you're, if you're like encountering the learning curve, you're, you don't have the same control you have as like, and just shit you do all day long, like driving or walking or whatever. But I mean, I think the reason, like if you were to spread out the human population, only a much smaller percentage of humans have like skills, like being able to play piano. I mean, a lot of them do, or being able to do comedy or being able to be a great go-go dance or whatever. And the reason that is, is because the moment they started feeling uncomfortable, they just stopped. They tried to, because I think when you're saying go downstream, you don't mean like abandon things that are difficult. You mean go towards the things that you love, even if it hurts. I mean, like nothing's difficult really. Like if something's really difficult for you, like if something's like really, really, really difficult, like there is a chance maybe, and not even that the thing is bad that you're doing, it's just the way you're approaching it. It's like, I realized I was just coming so aggressively at everything all the time, like just assuming, I used to just like go on stage and just assume they hated me. Wow. And I'd be like, all of them. Like what is fucking wrong with me? That is crazy. I didn't like myself. I've seen your stand-up, I would never in a million years guess that you had walked on stage thinking the audience, I've seen you kill, what, almost every time I've seen you. Like in the main room, sometimes late at night, those are hard. That can be a very difficult crowd. And maybe that's just my own thing, saying it's difficult. But I've seen you in front of crowds that I would have been supremely intimidated by, just crushing. So it's interesting to hear that that's how you were approached. I, in the main room, the main room was a whole thing for me that I had to conquer. Like the main room was just like the hardest. I used to have panic attacks like all day. Like I would just like, oh my God, oh my God, the main room, fuck I have a main room. And then I would have to like completely block out that I had a main room. I'd be like, bitch, you just have a show. It's not the main room, it's just a show. Hold on, just one second. For folks listening, let me explain the original room. It's like a smaller room, the belly room even smaller. The main room, it looks like a cross between like that scene with David Lynch and Twin Peaks. And like, you know, something in like some weird Vegas thing, but also like maybe a Marionette theater. Like it's all these weird things combined together that make it this occult chamber that is can be quite terrifying. So I know what you mean. The main room is like, you feel like you're in a dream or something. But when you're in the pocket in the main room, it's like, there's nothing better. It's like crazy. When you're just like, everything you're saying is just like, it's like waves of laughter. It's like, oh my fucking God. It's like unbelievable. But it really like, it took me a long time. Like it really did take me a long time. And I've seen a lot of great, like I remember Tim Dillon used to always struggle in there. Like it's like when he first started, he was just killing everywhere. But it just is there's something that's like intimidating about it. Oh, I've eaten just hot bowls of shit in there. Hot bowls of shit in the main room. Big hot bubbling bowls of devil's shit in front of all these people in this beautiful room. And you're just like, what if, what am I? If I can't make people weird? Is it that we let like a room like be more important than our physical beings in the fucking room? We like let our room haunt us. Like that's where I think the ghost song. All the fucking bombs we like ourselves have. And I always think so. That's what's haunting the comedy stories. The ghosts of like, I don't know. We'll see if Jeff Scott comes in. I'll believe there's ghosts. I can't believe we lost Jeff. What an annoying thing to have happened. I'm like, Jeff. I just never, I always thought he'd be here. I mean, that's someone I just, that one was, that was a brutal. I mean, that was in the midst of the pandemic to hear that. I just, if he had killed himself, I would have been out of my mind. I'm just glad he didn't kill himself. Me too. Well, okay. Now wait, I have a little bit back and we've done an hour and eight minutes. Do you have a little more time? I will just, I'll talk to you till I'm done. Thank you. Okay. So you, you, you were talking about when they boarded up your apartment, you got that check from the IRS, but you also mentioned like, it's like you stepped through or you made a decision there. And it seems like ever since that decision, you've been experiencing like almost like you're in a different universe or something. Like you're, is, so that's safe to say. Yeah. So wait, I want you to maybe tell people what you mean by that, because it's a very confusing thing when you hear it for the first time. And some of my most successful friends would say different versions of that. And when I, when I was in a lack situation, I would generally like roll my eyes at it or just feel frustrated by it. You don't understand what it's like to be poor, but they really don't anymore because they're, they have gone to another. But they were, and they did it. And, but, but it was just to me when you hear someone talk about it as though it were a portal or something, like it's, there are a decision you can make to move from one version of your life where you're struggling to another version of your life where you're not struggling. It sounds like wishful thinking. It sounds like it just are new age, like, you know, visualization shit. You're, you feel like you're going to be disappointed if you believe it. And yet my own experience with that is like, it's true. Somehow it's true. Well, I think like, okay, so I was talking to Rogan on the phone yesterday and he was like, um, he's like, you got to keep doing your solo pockets. You got to make sure you go to solo pockets too. And I was like, yeah, I know, but it was like my apartment and he was like, I'm just hearing a lot of excuses. I love you rich man. And, um, cause I really sort of like had that epiphany where I was like, as much as it's been weird to be like this person where my peers now in comedy are all like, so financially, like just killing it. And I'm like living, I remember like one of my first like, when I first heard becoming friends with Rogan, I was like, we were in the parking lot at the college and I was like, I live in my car and that's like one of your 13 cars. Like, can you help me understand that? Yeah. And he was just like, do you have a podcast? And he's like, he just was like, ask me questions. It's like, when I realized like it really just does come down to excuses and blocking yourself and a victim mentality. Like I just have to make sure I never, every time I go into the victim thing, I just shut the fuck up because it's just doesn't serve anyone. It doesn't serve me. It doesn't serve anyone. It's just like useless time. It's useless. It's just wasting time. It doesn't do anything. It's absolutely useless. I mean, it served me to like feel like, like, oh, I'm special because I don't have that or whatever, you know, like, oh, like, you know, and I didn't have to do work. I didn't have to do the hard stuff. And now that I realize that the hard stuff is actually easy. It's like, well, the hard stuff is way easier than not doing it. Exactly. Well, someone was saying in my program, they were like, I can't, I think it was the guy that wrote, it's a quote from like the guy who wrote chicken soup in the soul or whatever, didn't write it, but put it together. But he said like being committed 99% being committed 100% to something is easy. Being committed 99% is like really hard. If you think about it like it's so much like because I do agree with like it's so much harder to feel it's so much harder to like not get your work done than it is to get your work done. What's the Jesus? Talk about this because we'd be like, oh, God, what's the Jesus quote? And you know, the house that is divided among itself cannot stand. It's like, you can't be divided in there. I'm sorry to cut you off again. It's just because we have a little bit of lag. And so there's a tiny little bit of lag, which is why it's happening. I'm so sorry. So you were mentioning something that you were saying with Esther. Sorry. No, that's okay. Okay. Esther Duncan, you're like one of my favorite little balls of light. You'd never have to apologize for anything. I absolutely adore you. Likewise. You're so special. But anyway, so Esther and I were we have always like we would like call each other like we need to write jokes and like, oh, like dreading our spots and stuff. We would just talk about it all the time. And like Esther, I feel like we have convinced ourselves that complaining about doing our work is work. And it kind of was like, it's like the amount of time we just felt like it was. And then we felt like we'd worked on our jokes because we could. And it is, it's hard to work. It's hard to work. Then just you just get it done. You're on to the next thing. You don't even think about it again. Yes. And I'll, you know, remember before you became like this, you would meet people who are like this and there was something scary about them. The people who just did, you know, so you would hear them say they were going to do something and then they would just do it. And if you were like us, that was almost like, it was terrifying. You almost feel like you'd be like, oh, like, fuck you. Like, what did you, oh, you must have brought up rich or something. You must have been like, you kind of like make it like they had it easier than you or something, you know. Well, yeah. Cause it's not appeal. Like especially, you know, naturally you will, if you anything, just like what your is saying, which is like, if you look around you, you see a cloud of decisions that you've made. And that's what you're surrounded by. And so, you know, if, if like you haven't learned this shit yet and a lot of people haven't, you will find yourself around other people who haven't learned it. And so then you'll get into the symphony or the chorus of victim hood, the victim course. You're hanging out with everybody and all of you are just talking about how awful everything is and how terrible the world is and how everyone's out to get you. It's not fair. And the whole thing's falling apart. And God, you remember the old days when people weren't like this. And you know what I mean? And then like you, so it's like a, in witchcraft, they talk about the coven, you know, you gather together and you do your incantations. But there, that is literally what that is. It's an unconscious coven where you're casting the victim spell. And like, and you know what I mean? And there's always in those groups, the greatest victim. You know what I mean? The King victim and everyone else is like sort of subsidiary victims. So that King victim is always getting the most help from the other people who are like, wow, you really are a victim. I'm a victim, but holy shit, you're the most victim. They lead those groups. So whenever you're going like, oh, I am a victim of things, but this person's a worse victim than me. So instead of like taking care of my own life, like I'm going to make them my project because they need me so much. And then like such a good person, I have nothing, but it's because I've devoted myself to helping this other victim. You know what I mean? It's, it is tear. And then if you do that long enough, you'll start realizing that the help, nothing's changing about them at all. So the help is being sort of absorbed because they don't really want to change because if they change their entire victim. Another Bible quote. What? Don't throw pearls at swine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. In real life, probably. So I'm like, what are you doing with my pearls? But yeah, this is the. I'm going to show you. It's these little, you know, I, we, we were sort of briefly deeming about this new cult that came out. The love is one cult and cults are so fun. Anytime you hear about them, there's fun to explore because, you know, I like them because whenever I'm reading about them, like, I could easily get into that cult. Like, you know, catch me at the right time. It's a really good point. So I was like, Oh, right. And you get, do you take away some of it? Oh, that's actually pretty smart. But those are like conscious cults. And I think it's almost better to be in a conscious cult than to be in an unconscious cult, you know, with a group of people hypnotized by some prime victim who's like got them all like hypnotized and imagining they're doing some remarkable service when really all that they're doing is being fed upon by a kind of psychic vampire. But they would never call what they were in a cult, but it's no different. It's like, you've got the leader, this depressed fuck up. You've got this bizarre, sycophantic circle of people who are so hypnotized by their tragic story that they're like the whole life. It's just what you're saying. They can procrastinate working on their own shit by constantly bang or helping or just listening to this generally a dope complain about everything. And it's a cult. It's a fucking cult. I know it well. And so yeah, once you get out of that, it's just like getting out of a cult because sometimes they'll try to keep you from getting out just like a cult. They're sticky. Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I do know what you're talking about. It's so funny because I did the landmark forum. My parents do it and I did the landmark forum like years ago and I felt like really like halted like because you would do it and then they'd be like, bring your friends, bring your friends, bring your friends. And that's why I've been so cautious to not even bring up this program I'm doing because I have a lot of like, I'm just like PTSD from that. Yeah. Experience and it helps people that's great, do landmark, whatever. But for me, it was like, you know, I don't ever want to feel like I'm not. In pat and control of myself. And so with this program, it's like really important that while I'm taking in all this information stuff, I'm putting it through my own filter because I don't ever want to just like agree 100%. Like there's some things he said where I'm like, totally disagree with, you know, so it's like, it just, that's important too because you could just wake up one day and you're like, Oh, I'm in a fucking cult. Oh yeah. That's how I felt with landmark. I was like, Oh my God. I don't have my own thoughts in my head. Like I have someone else's words in my head. I, you know, I've heard some interesting stories about landmark and then I've seen people. Most of this, mostly it's annoying. Like you'll end up with somebody and then suddenly like they're like inviting you to a landmark meeting and for a second. Oh, and they kind of like just come to this get together. It's annoying because you know, they're like, it's like, it's not like when someone's inviting you to something spiritual or that they just like, it's like you get this sense of like, you're part of a project that they're being told to do or some shit. I don't like that. I don't want to be part of your fucking score, man. But, um, but, um, still, I know people who, if not for that, I know people who've done crazy shit with whatever they're teaching there. So I mean, I'm not completely knocking it, but yeah. Exactly. That's how I feel too. Like I don't want to, and also even if these people want to join a fucking cult, it's like you wanted to fucking join it. You were missing something in your life and like your life up a little bit. It's just like, sometimes we'll save you from them. Sometimes we have to come get you out of them. Yeah. Well, Ramda's called it a self-destructing trap. Like that's what you want. You want, basically it's, it's sticky, maybe a little bit, but then by the, the more you grow with it, the more it just starts falling apart till you just don't need it anymore. And that's any healthy anything is it's not going to try to like grab you when you're, when you're, when you're done. Exactly. No, a hundred percent and not make you grab everyone that you know and bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them in. Like the cool thing is that for someone to come up to you and be like, Hey, I think I can help you. I'm like, Oh fuck yeah. Fuck off. Don't. I don't want it. I don't want. I don't care what it is. I don't care if you've got an alien in a sarcophagus. If I start getting that creepy feeling that you're going to rope me into some shit, it's the worst. But also it's like the assumption that like what works for you is going to work for everyone else. It's like, I've done so many of these. I mean, obviously I signed up for the hundred day program. Like I've done like so many things that I, you know, if you're not at the right place in your life to hear them, if you're just not that type of person, if they're not like it's nothing, it's nothing, you know, but you can take pieces or everything you want. It's just like, I would never like, I just haven't even been bringing this thing up because I just won't want people, you know how like, for instance, like if you're trying to get into shape or something, they have all these like websites that are like, what does like Heidi Klum eat and exit? Like you're looking at like someone that's not you with a different body and you're trying to, and you think they're better than you because they're like famous or they're rich or whatever, you're like playing into that. And then you're like, oh, I need to do exactly what they do. Like what is it exactly that you eat to make yourself lose weight? Or what do you do this to get like six back when it's like you have a completely different body and and like it's again, it's just like escaping yourself and giving your power to someone else. Like there's a like there's an answer or whatever. Well, you know, I just feel like everyone there's like there's a different light. We're all living different lives and it seems obvious to say, but some people don't realize that Heidi fucking Klum. You don't know what her DNA is like. You don't know anything about her. And also you don't know for sure whatever the fuck she says she's eating in some interview. You don't know that she might just making that up for fun. Bored on a press tour. What do you eat? Oh, you know, I like to eat grapefruit. I only grapefruit and on Saturdays I have strawberries. Then I take a bath. I take a bath and goat piss or whatever. You know, you're just bored. Who cares? Let it get out there. Do you know that I just saw someone did an entire documentary for MTV about how they'd gotten off drugs and later on they admitted that the whole time they've been on cocaine that they were shooting that documentary. So the hours are crazy. Come on. It's the assumption. But look, this is I'm so glad you're talking about it because and I also I'm glad you're bringing up landmark form because I think there's a healthy suspicion people have when it comes to any kind of getting help at all and no matter what it is, but especially the kind of help where you're going to a seminar or a retreat or some training or something like that, because it's like you feel like number one, it fucks with your ego, right? Like you kind of have to humble yourself to start taking classes. You have to that part of yourself that wants to believe it knows already how to do everything kind of has to go out the window, right? Which I do think we know how to do everything because okay, so even friends like, okay, so this program is working a lot for me right now. This is the right time in my life. This is the right like the messages I'm learning are like really resonating with me, but I did choose to take this course at this time, right? So it is something that I knew like I trusted my body to be like, all right, even though this seems like an insane amount of money to me, I'm going to fucking pay and I'm going to trust that this is the right thing. So in a sense, this is all stuff that I've asked for that's coming to me, you know what I mean? So it is stuff that I know and it does feel like maybe that is why it's resonating because like I feel it's a deeply in myself from like, this is stuff that I feel like I do know. And it's just being like re-talk to me because this is not what life is, right? Like you're just trying to learn who you are like you're born. Yeah. And then your whole life is like discovering who you are. Yeah. Yeah. That's what it is, right? Yeah. And I think part of that is like remembering and extricating yourself, you know, like I think you're associating discipline with freedom because I don't think people understand that that or I didn't like you think of discipline as being, you know, someone is like, you know, like your parents are yelling at you, they give you discipline or whatever, you know, not you don't see the discipline is you're not free if you're completely like trapped in your habits. Like you're the least free thing and it's scary because you're also when you get to like a certain age, it's like, I'm not like, I'm fighting. This was another thing I learned in that same last ayahuasca trip. It was like, I realized like this anti authority should I have. There is no one telling me what to do anymore. I have been 18 for a long ass time. Like I don't need there any authority is myself. It's like, it's like my greater self telling me what to do. Like bitch, get up, like do your work. Like we want, we want to go places. Like hurry up. You're like, you're slowing us down. So it's like, I was like, I was playing hooky. Like when I wasn't doing my work, I wasn't cleaning up. I'm playing hooky on myself. Like I'm not showing up to my, the school that is me. Yeah. Like I'm mad at me. Yeah. You know, and then I had to really get like, get real with the fact that my self esteem was so low, even though I project off like a very confident. You do. That's what can ask burgers baby. Okay. I'm telling you, like, I mean, I have it because there's up the truth is that I know, right? Since I was little, I was like, you are a special light bitch. Like I knew it, right? Yeah. A lot of adversity and I knew I was like, shouldn't be being treated like I'm bad, you know, and then it's interesting because as I got like a better relationship with my parents and I remember my mom just randomly sent me a card that said, like to my sweet girl and she had, I like started crying because it was like that. I just realized like I'd never been called sweet and I had this identity of myself and I was like, this rotten thing. And I think that's been something I've had to really work past because well, I don't deserve money. I don't deserve good things. Why should I put myself out there when I'm just rotten and like bad and I'm going out into these audiences and they paid money to see this rotten, you know, like that's something I had to really do. You know, I've been doing like self hypnosis and stuff and just trying to just like, wow, really like grow the light. Is that part of the gym for the gym? Fortan stuff, self hypnosis. A lot of it is. Whoa, I am looking at this. How cool. That's so interesting. So incredible. And I don't want to like, I don't want to be like, this is the greatest thing because other people might fucking hate it. Like I just don't. And I don't think that you have to. I don't want people to go. I want what she has. I'm going to do this. Like don't do it. Like I want people to not do it. You know what I mean? Like I like, I just don't want to, I don't want to like play. But whatever, all I can do is just have. You don't sound like that. You don't sound like a missionary or something. You sound like you've encountered some training that is having profoundly powerful effects in your life. Like quantifiable effects. And you're excited about that. So it's fun to talk about that. But you don't sound like someone who's like trying to like, I've been around that thing and you don't, you don't feel like that. You don't seem like. It's just like this really weird thing though. It's like really so cool. What they recommend to this book to me called, um, love yourself like your life depends on it, which like, I mean, all of me would have trouble even just looking at a book with that title. Like. Love yourself like. I'm so glad you're. May I just say I'm so glad you're, you're, you're being honest about this because, uh, it's so for someone who shares many of the same neurotic things that you were talking about as imposter syndrome, a sense of like who they're going to find out there. Eventually they're going to know all of those things that are just, you know, projections of the mind. It's still really empowering to hear someone else admit it out loud. And it's good for other people to hear it too. It's because, you know, you were dangerously good at projecting the opposite of that. Like people just would never in a million years, uh, probably who didn't know you think, Oh my God, Annie is like, uh, struggling with the same insecure bullshit that I'm dealing with. And I always have been, and I never have been like trying to hide that either. Like I really do think that I was raised very wild. Like I was raised very loosely and it, it gave me none of the rules that would have kept me from telling the truth. Do you know what I mean? Like I never was taught to conform or anything. I've always just been kind of like talking shit. And, um, you know, I really like as many times I got molested because of that. Um, it's worth it because it also made me like, you mean literally. Freelance. Did you mean literally? Yeah. I mean, my parents were kind of like, Oh. Wow. I'm sorry that that, I'm sorry to you. No, who cares. The molestants have the best life. We've, it's all up from here. But, uh, it really like, it's just like, you know, and I was like, kind of like living in that trauma and angry at my parents. And then I look at it and I'm like, everything is so good. And I have so much love in my family. And it's like, just like completely like complete forgiveness of that has just been like amazing and like my parents are just, you know, getting older and it's just such like a, such a nice thing to just feel like I just want us to have a good time and not there's, I don't need anything from them except just like to be with them. It's just so nice. Like I'm not angry with them anymore. And if I look at it, it's like, it just, they just gave me such good tools. Like it's just so, you know, I came just so like, I'm like affected, you know, so. As a new parent, hearing you say that is awesome. Just you, just because it's like, that is what you want. That if you, when your kids finally get through the teen thing and the rebellion thing and get to and say what you're saying, the gifts you're giving them, it's such a sweet thing. I'm sure you've said this to them in person, but wow. I mean, I had to get through the angry phase too. And I had to like, I really like have to look back on myself and all my phases and kind of just be like, oh, like, what am I cute when you were screaming at your parents for getting raped a bunch? And they were just like, what do you want us to do? And you just kept screaming at them. You know, and we like got through it. And it's just like not even like, it just doesn't even matter. You know, it's just like, they're so good. And I was realizing how much of my life I was spending like mad at like something they did or didn't do. And just missing out on all this like good stuff, you know, this time where like, they're not angry, they're happy, they're laughing, they're having a good time. And it's just so fun. Like, what did I need from them? I wanted them to feel bad or suffer or have a best, a like less good life. No. So now it's just like, it's just so good. Like our last vacation was just, we just came back with was just so excellent. It was so good. You know, yeah, I just feel like one of the things, oh, you just feel like, I'm sorry, y'all. It sounds like I'm cutting Annie off. It's this, there's a little bit of lag for some reason. So I can't jump in at the right time. So I'm so, so sorry. Please finish your thought. No, it's fine. I was saying like that book that I was saying about like, love yourself like your life depends on it. It had all these like rules and things you were supposed to do was to meditate to this, look at yourself in the mirror. And I just didn't care for those things. But what I took from it was just saying to yourself all the time under your breath, I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. Every time I feel like something's hard or like I can't do it. So I love myself. Do you know how easy it is to exercise when you're like running and it starts to hurt or whatever you just go, I love myself. I love myself. I love it. You don't even like notice it's hurting. Yeah. It's really been helpful. Wow. This is you're making me think of Ram Dass because the mantra that he told people was I am loving awareness is what he would say. I'm loving awareness. I'm loving awareness. And then the other thing that you're making me think about him regarding your family that I always found really interesting about his guru, uh, name Crowley Baba is that when people went to that guru and said to him that they were having problems at home with their parents, he would immediately make them leave and go home and say, I don't know what he would say when you've worked out your shit with your parents. I don't think he would say shit. I don't know what he'd say, but he like for him, all this, all the other, the other stuff, the meditation, the spiritual stuff, the astral project, all of that paled in comparison to first get straight with your family. If you can like, because you're blaming if you're still in that fight with your parents, you're a victim of something and you're blaming the external and you're giving the external all your power. So how are you going to do all that work on yourself if you're still in that fight? You can't. And but what it's such an easy trap to get stuck in. Some people never get out their whole lives. They're bitter and angry about their parents and sometimes rightfully so. I mean, some people, they get assigned shit parents, like, you know, like crack smoke being blown in their face and like horror stories where it's like, I get it. I mean, maybe you need more than one lifetime to get over this shit, you know, but you only got one. That's the problem. There's one. So you got to deal with it. I think this is why we can't remember our past lives. Because can you imagine having to deal with trauma from three families ago, three lifetimes ago? Sometimes things hurt so bad. You're like, this is from another time. Like that shouldn't have hurt that bad. I know. I'm really enjoying my triggers now too. Because I'm like, oh, what's like that about? It's just fun. I don't know. I like learning and figuring myself out. I'm freaking in light. And like, that was the other thing. Like, uh, Ram Dass and neem curly Baba would say, like, when that when it was exciting when like where they're stuck showed up, because it was like from every time you realize like, oh, fuck, I'm really hung up here. The implication is that means that this you can unhook and, you know, and then every time you legitimately unhook from a thing, your universe expands instantly. Yeah. It's an amazing thing to witness or to get that when no matter what it is, even if it's a little thing like what you're talking about, you know, a tiny little shift. That feeling of like also like when I get triggered and I'm like, I'm like filled with rage, like that feeling of just like flooding with rage and you're like, oh my God, I really am a fucking animal. Like I really am an animal. Yeah. Like get over yourself, bitch. You're an animal. Like everyone else. You're filled up like cavemen did like you are a fucking cavewoman. Yeah. It really is cool. It's just cool to realize that and then to realize that I can just kind of take it down. Well, just go like, what was that? It gives you some compassion when you see on the news, someone who like, you know, shot someone in the face because of road rage and you and it's so sad because you realize like that they turned into a demon. They're not the continuum of their identity is they're not always going around raging at people, but they just to me, that's the in Buddhism. They say the most like the thing you got to watch out for is anger because that that they one moment of anger. They I read will completely annihilate a lifetime of good merit, good work. One moment of anger just obliterates it. You got to start over starting over is great from a Buddhist perspective, but you know, but just and I think the reason that they're so intense about it is of all the emotions that is the one that you can ruin your life with fast, you know, you just lose control. And the next thing you know, you do something incredibly dumb for some people. It's suicide for some people. It's violence. And then you try to come back from that. Then the courts are involved, you know, like, you know, it's so dangerous. It's scary. Well, it's just so like, it's so and like, obviously we have effects, negative effects on people around us. And that's like their life's karma is to like figure that out. I guess, you know, like we like, you're going to fuck your kids up in some way that you have never intended to do. And it will be less than your parents fucked you up and less and less and less if you're in the right direction. And but it's like, you know, it's also just kind of like learning and doing that less and less and, you know, like allowing that to be like the process of life too. So it's like, yeah, if you're getting angry and you're freaking out and you're raging out, it's just like, it is just like hurting people around you. Yeah, it doesn't ever do the only thing it's good for is fighting. You we need that. You need it. I get it. I get it. I get it in the sense of like, if like, I don't know, a wild animal had just charged at me like a panther or something. And I if I didn't like freak out and like just become a demon or something, then I'd probably die. That's what it's for. It's not for like AT&T. Dude, can I just tell you that's so funny. He's an AT&T. I have a Karen inside me that comes out quite a bit. So I do try to work on that. But, um, but you just reminded me. Okay. So I went and I always surprised my nieces like they never know when I'm coming. I always pop out of something or I'm under the Christmas tree or something like that. So this last occasion, we haven't seen each other in two years. That's and I faced them with them all the time. So my sister-in-law and my brother and my boyfriend, like every and my parents were all like conspiring against these little innocent children to scare the shit out of them. So, and I always saw them on to can pop up. They're like, what are we missing? Like I could pop out anywhere. Just be ready. So this, you know, last couple of weeks, I went back and they had no clue. So they read soccer practice with their mom. I came home. My parents were hiding inside behind the curtains. My boyfriend was just off in the other room because he's a stranger and they can't see him first. Right. So I get in this giant box and I go in the park. So Dana, my sister-in-law comes in, the girls come out. She goes, oh, can you grab that box? And it's this giant box. So I thought like to lessen the blow. I remember the first time I surprised them was under the Christmas tree. And I always had neon green nails. So my niece said that she wasn't scared because she saw my neon green nails. So I was like, oh, I'll wear my leopard print jacket because that will like, they know I wear that jacket all the time. That will cue them. That will like, let them be less scared. Yeah. Pop out of this box. Not what happened. What happened was my four-year-old and eight-year-old nieces came to move a box. They had no clue. They were just at soccer practice. They were just coming home. They went to move a box. It didn't move. And then all of a sudden a fucking wild animal popped out. My niece was like, oh, my four-year-old niece, fight or flight. Like an experience so few kids have is an actual animal attacking them. She was like, bro. And then she saw it with me, but it was like, there was like a split second where she, my brother and I were laughing. So we're rewatching. Like this was maybe the most fucked up one yet. I mean, she was like, I thought you were a tiger. Oh, God. I mean, you just use that as an example because it's so bad. Like you used, you got a worst case scenario where a panther was attacking you to explain when it's okay. Like this is the most primal shit that my niece would never have to go through. And she just experienced it. Like she was in the fucking jungle book. You plugged into like DNA traces from like the hundreds of thousands of years ago. That's hilarious. Next time you got to dress like a bear. It's so funny. Let me just find her face. It was so crazy. Oh, you got it. I'm like, I, we filmed the whole thing. My boyfriend's going to edit it together. I think next time your boyfriend should jump out. Oh my God. That's a new fear. That's an auntie lesson. He's naked. Where is this one? It'll be worth it. Okay. So I mean, they were just couldn't believe it. I know I, I scare our two year old a lot accidentally. My wife did too. He, he has, he's got a baby. Let me see. Do you see her here? Wait, hold on. So then they're so excited. But wait, let me show you. I'll pause the fear. Pause it, please. That is death. That is like profound deep. You could look, you know what you could do? You could cut that out and just put that in any historic disaster. And it will make sense. You could, you know what I mean? Cut that out. Put it over like the ruins of the bombing of Dresden. Put it, you know what I mean? Put it in front of the, like the Titanic, but like black and white. Put her on the Titanic. It's terrible. It was her whole family was drowning. Like a letter. I was like, that was, she was just like, but it must be worth it to realize that it isn't a wild animal. It's your favorite. Immediately. Yeah. They immediately were so excited. So it was good. Annie. So it went from that. Yeah. You ready? We got to wrap it. Oh, I got to, you know, oh my God. Yeah. Look at that. That's the, see that's the best. That is, I get it. I get why people get addicted to that cycle. That's the cycle we're talking about. We're talking about that to ourselves. Right? That's what that is. We go from my, oh my God. It's a leopard. Oh, it's love. And I know it's like not shaming yourself for that too. And just being like, it's all good. I submit to you, my new guru. Thank you so much for teaching me. I mean it. Like you taught me so much there. I really needed to hear a lot of what you said. And I really appreciate it. Thank you. And thank you for giving me. I feel that way for you all the time. I really like my inspiration with you is like one of my best episodes ever. Oh, that was so, what a fun day. That was so fun. God damn. I was taking everything for granted. I didn't know that I was going to be one of the last podcasts that I did. I didn't know a pandemic was right around the corner. A leopard that turned out to be, I think for both of us. You can always come back and you can always spend as much time as you need. And there's nothing to like miss. And there's nothing, you know what I mean? Yes, I know. And it's like, you know, I'll be back. I love it here. It's the best, but I do just have, I just miss it. But Annie, forget about me. Fuck. Let's talk about your upcoming shows. Let's talk about your two hit podcasts so that people can connect to you. Um, you got shows coming up after this one? Cause this will come out next week. I do. I have, I have one on the 27th. We'll be up by then. Yeah. So I'm doing a Brea one nighter at the Brea improv. Nice. I'm doing a show on the 27th of May. And then what else do I have? I don't know what's going on. You can text me all these gigs. Um, I'm doing a one nighter at flappers. Flappers. I know my agents like promote flappers. I was like, okay. Um, flappers on July 15. And then, um, I'm doing, uh, episode in Bakers or an episode. I'm doing a one nighter. Having an episode in Bakers. Oh, and then Hartford. I'm going to be at the Hartford funny bone in, um, August 27th through 29th. And I love that place. It's so fun. I've heard great things about that club. Actually. That's really cool. Um, okay. I'm going to have all those dates at dugoutrustle.com. Now talk about both of your podcasts. Please. Okay. So my inspiration is the podcast that Duncan and I did go watch all the old episodes. Check them out. I have not made any new ones in a while. I had some health things and now I'm reassessing what I want to do with it. So I think I might rebrand it and come out. I'm going to come out with something different. There will be a, there will be in my own podcast, but, um, that's coming. But watch all the old ones. Watch along with me and Duncan. I feel like we got in some real deep. I definitely cried. Um, you said some things that have stuck. And then also, um, I have my podcast that is now being rebranded. It's now called blood honeys. And that is, um, you can find that on YouTube and Instagram and follow me and little ester and koala. It is so funny. I mean, I am what whoever's running your, I don't know who's doing the promotion stuff for editing, right? You have some, I can tell whatever y'all are doing. You have some smart people. You must have a big, who's editing. Who's doing the promo for the guys that do tiger belly. They're, they're called a seven to sec keys and they're just like really great. So we, you know, we pretty much partnered with them. So it's like, you know, it's all of our show. So we're all just putting in everything we can put and they, um, Kalilah honestly, they do a lot of editing, but Kalilah does a lot of really like strong notes. Like she's really good. She goes through, she finds the best parts. And then, you know, a lot of times people will DM us the line and then we'll have them make a clip of that. Like, you know, I always try to have like the funniest lines. You, I look, I'm not going to pick favorites on there. You all are very funny and I really love it. Well, look, thank you so much. I hope you kill the night. And I, I folks, it means a lot that a comedian on the road gives you an hour and 47 minutes on a day that they have to perform. I'm so grateful to you. Thank you. Well, you know what I'm going to do after this, right? What? I'm going to go to the mall of America and I'm going to ride the roller coaster by myself. We're at a roller coaster by myself because here's the thing Duncan, when you trust the universe and you trust that you're going to have to show that you're meant to have, you don't have to panic all day and worry or like reserve your energy or anything. Well, don't leave. This is what I'm praying. I'm praying that you that the roller coaster doesn't fuck up somehow and you end up in some horrible roller coaster accident because then this entire podcast will seem so sinister. You know, like you're talking about all this beautiful stuff. I'm supposed to go skydiving on Tuesday. So don't fuck your. No, I'm sorry. Jim Fortin. Don't do that to don't. What are you doing? So funny. I might cancel it because I have gone before and before I was not in the greatest, like I was, I've always been happy, right? But I haven't been in this level of like, I'm actually really like content, but I go with my friend on her dad's death date with her. So I have to really think about, am I doing this to like take care of my friend who needs me or am I doing this because it's something I want to do because I actually really don't feel like plummeting to my death right now. But the reason it's fun is because you might plummet to your death. Right. I mean, right. Yeah. It's fun. Well, I just got to touch base with her because every time I smoke weed, I go, I think I don't want to go skydiving. Listen, don't listen to me. I'm an old, terrified old man. I just, I'm not, I don't want to, I got kids, you know, I can't, my wife would never let me anyway. But like the idea of like, you know, in the old days, maybe I would throw myself out of a plane because it's like, it's a cool way to die. You know, it's like, you're only going to be scared for a relatively short time. You don't have to like slowly like, you know, fade out. You're just going to splatter all over the place and have some kind of interesting fame in the sense that you're one of those people who like, you know, died falling out of a plane. That's kind of cool. But. Or I like, you know, fall, I get paralyzed. I'm in a wheelchair and then all of my wheelchair jokes like hit even more because I'm in a wheelchair now. Wow. Yeah, but then your whole thing's going to be, you don't want that to be you. You don't want to be the comic that fell out of a plane. You know, everyone's going to want you to do your fucking air fall out of an airplane jokes and you're going to get so sick of it. It's not even made for not me talking. It's a computer. I'm like, thank you for coming. Can you imagine if you did that? And then there was a heckler in the audience who also had the same setup. Fuck you. I would only perform to people that are quadriplegic at that point. God dang. Annie. Listen, I on behalf of everyone listening, these, this is a comedian. She doesn't mean anything obviously against quadriplegics. You know, No, no, no, it wouldn't be against them. I would only be talking. I'm saying I would be like doing comedy festivals just for people. Like I would highlight them and be like, this is just for you. There would be no one, the no people with like able bodies allowed. I love that. That is actually brilliant. It's for us. Love it. Annie. Thank you so much. Hold on one second. Thank you. One second. Okay. I'm going to say goodbye to you. That was a little clumsy.

Hey, man. I'm hanging in there. You know, the commute was a little brutal this morning, but I'm glad to be alive and I'm glad to be in his kingdom. Absolutely. I listened to AM 429. You're in his kingdom. AM 429 TBZ. Here we are. Bo and Clint. Let's take another one. Let's look at the news. Have you been paying attention to this story? Try not to. Honestly, you know, I don't look at it anymore. I listen to it because, you know, actually, what I meant to say was I smell it. Yeah. And it smells bad. It smells bad. There's just so many bad smells now. I think of my Bible as a loaf of bread fresh out of the oven. And any time I want to, I could take a smell of that delicious buttered bread. All the slice. I'd love to give you one. I know a lot of kids used to roll blunts with Bible pages and I was always like, no, no, no, not for me. Yeah. I remember that. I had that experience behind the bleachers. Yeah. One of my friends, Daryl Schnau, he has since committed suicide. AM 429. But yeah, I remember he tore a page out of the... Maniscus? That hurts. Oh, la, la! A Maniscus Book 5 chapter, LeBron, I can't believe I went to the Lakers, but, you know... What hurts worse? Your knee or your wallet, because those Maniscus operations, they're expensive. I think they try to figure out what you got and they try to make it balance out. So you stop thinking about how much it hurts because you're thinking about how much it hurts the pocketbook. So this is like the new OxyContin is freaking out over how much your medical bill is? That's what I hear. That's what I hear. You know, this just came in. If you hear about this, it's something called digital drugs. Digital drugs. Say what? I'll read it to you. Here it is. It just came in off the hotline. Digital drugs. Are your kids using digital drugs? Special frequencies that go from high to low using binaural, binaural, binaural, I don't know. I don't know. Binaural headphones going from high to low and low to high at the same time creates something in a euphoric effect and the listener often called digital drugs. Well, why don't we take a download of one of those and play it for the listener? I don't know about that. Okay, well, we'll take a listen. I want to hear some of this digital. Abby, can we hear some of this? There's no way this stuff could work. I mean, I don't do drugs, so obviously I can listen to the word of God. I can listen to some digital, quote unquote, digital drugs, right? Hey, let me tell you something right now. Abby? If the word of drugs is God, then I'm a God-y. I'm a drug addict. Let's, I am 429. I'm a drug addict. Let's play this. So whatever this is, this is still got a digital sound. I guess it's going to make us all high. Clean the bow in the morning. We're going to play this for you now, guys. I'm sure you'll be fine, but this is something off of a, what the hell is that? Be careful. You've lost me at the word, the W-W-W. If I see three letters next to each other, I'm like, I'm out. My niece, my niece came up to me the other day. She's beautiful. She's so cute. Thank you so much. She's a delightful, darling, darling child. Gloria, I love you if you're out there listening. She comes up to me with her iPad or whatever I pick, whatever you call these things. It's the size of a GD couch. Giant. It's bigger than her head. She comes up to me with this thing and she's, she's, she's won me to punch in some kind of series of buttons and my thumb print here and then my social there and all this crazy stuff. I know. What are you doing, Gloria? 429. You were rushing hacker, you know? Yeah, that stuff's all malarkey. Honestly. Debra, do we have it? Okay. Do we got it? I guess we got it. All right, let's go ahead and play that file. Yeah. I don't want to be used by you, I don't want to be used by you, I don't want to be used by you, I don't want to be used by you, I don't want to be used by you, I don't want to be used by you. Yeah, from the internet, you're, yeah, from that, that sphere of mycelium inner, inner connected influence. My, mycelium. Well, I don't know. I don't even know. I don't know. I mean, we only, we only went on a date. Did I say that word? Just kidding. I don't know. What? All right. We've got a lot of stuff coming up here this hour, Taco Bell, I guess, is changing the color of cheese. Did you hear about this? Oh, yeah. I heard they're changing the color of cheese to like this glowing, inner pulsating connection. They're going to change the color. I don't know why, but I guess, you know, if you're not on board with the color of the Taco Bell cheese, then I guess you're not on board with cheese. How do they get all those delicious ingredients into one burrito? I think you got to not ask that question pretty much, just here's what you do. You go there, you get it, you eat it, then you ask the question. And that's why you're my best friend. We're going to jump right back into this wonderful show. But first, some quick business.

And now everyone, without further ado, please welcome to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour podcast, an incendiary, fearless human being, a person who is not terrified at all to speak the truth. Abby Martin is a journalist and she is the host of the Empire Files, which is a wonderful show on satellite network TELASUR English and YouTube. She is an amazing person and she's one of the very few people who make me nervous to be around her. Not because she's dangerous, but because the people she's pissed off are deadly. Everybody please stretch out your angelic astral wings and embrace today's guest, the brilliant, Abby Martin. Let's start with the most important thing, the cancellation of the Roseanne Barr show. Did you see that shit? I did. What I was confused about was why is it this time with her calling a black person an ape? Why was this time that the time that it was just too much for ABC? She's called black people apes before? Absolutely. She brought up a tweet from her calling Susan Rice a man swinging big ape balls back in 2013. And this is after the photo shoot with the burnt cookies of her dress like Hitler. I mean, there's been several questionable things that Roseanne has done. Yeah. Yeah. Well, you know, I guess in this case, I don't know what is the ape that broke the camel's back. It's one, it's one, it's one, like sometimes when you see people get, you know, incinerated these days, right? You feel authentically bad for them because like they were drunk or something. They were on speed and they tweeted something that they truly, I don't think they meant. But with her, this is a, people are really celebratory right now in this, in a way that I don't feel that I feel like what's unfortunate is I do think that she is mentally ill. Back during her shtick, you know, when Roseanne was first out, she was, she would make fun of her and she, you know, she would make fun of her, the mental illness and her popping pills and stuff. But now she actually believes her, that she's not mentally ill and that she really has this forbidden knowledge of QAnon and the deep pedophilic demon cult and all that stuff. So it's weird. I mean, I think that someone has to be mentally ill of, you know, just five years ago they were saying Israel's a Nazi state and then now they're, you know, taking the photos, like I said, with the burnt Jew cookies and then now today being like, you know, Palestinians are Nazis. It's just like, just a complete reversal in a really weird way. This is a really rough time to be mentally ill in this country because it, you know, having a podcast and being on Rogan's show, it's really taught me a lot about how people can get off track because sometimes I'll make the wretched mistake of going to some message thread. I don't do that. What's that? Don't do that. Don't do that. But you do see where there's lack of information, people who are mentally ill or scared will fill in that lack of information with some insane theory about what's going on there. And I have, sometimes those theories are about me or Joe and having been with him or myself knowing I'm not, I'm definitely not, last time I checked in the CIA and I don't think I'm going to be women on it. If I am, they're doing a really good job of keeping me in the dark about my membership. I'm still waiting for my Soros checks. The Soros, exactly. All those things. You're getting Soros checks. You're bought and sold. Right. I'm bought and sold. Joe's bought and sold. And you realize that this is happening from lack of data. Like they don't have access to my bank accounts or your bank accounts. You know, they don't see we aren't cashing checks from the government, but they fill it in with this lunacy. That's what's happening. And it's, it's kind of sad because I think these people just want the world to be that exciting. Yeah. I mean, you're right. We're in a position. We're all getting paid by Soros, but I think it goes down to the whole, you know, this, this massive mistrust in the corporate media apparatus. It's coming from a genuine place, right? We got sold the Iraq war. We get sold basically every imperialist adventure from our government that ends in disaster. Aside from that, you know, the Patriot Act, all these endless catastrophes. So I think that there's a reason why people distrust the mainstream media, but then they want to fill in the gaps, right? They want people to close the circle for them and say, well, what, what, you know, tell me the alternative theory, because it's too hard and daunting to stand in the face of this kind of naked corporate tyranny without a solution or answer. Ah, what a beautiful way to put it. It's frustrating. It is. It's frustrating. It's complex. It's a million different levels to it, real, not like, you know, sticking pictures to the wall that you cut out of time magazine. I do that too. Yeah. With the red tape all connected and. But it is. It's it's it. The world is just think how complex any fan, any given family, take any given family and look at how complex just that group of people can get in their interactions. And then from that, create an entire planet, right? And it's right. It's incomprehensibly on one level, chaotic and complex. And we can't stand this feeling. That's the problem. We can't stand the, you know, the people who believe in that school shooters or some kind of MK Ultra, Project Monarch, Manchurian candidate trained by the CIA, drugged by the CIA and sent to schools to shoot kids to get the guns taken away. That's so much easier to believe and safer to believe because there's order there. Then it's just, no, people go fucking nuts sometimes and shoot things up. That's a little more daunting, right? Because we don't we want to feel in control. Yeah. No, I think. The world's largest empire, you know, we have the most guns out of anywhere except other than I think Libya. And we're wondering, you know, obviously, yeah, the simplest explanation really is a lot of the times that the honest one that in a society where we're empire babies, we're you know, this toxic masculinity and also militarization of everything. Of course, people are going to fucking lose their shit. And you know, especially like under capitalism and this individualism where you have to make it. You got to be popular. You got to you got to pick yourself up at your bootstraps and be rich, kid. You got to be popular. It's all about you. And if you're not your fucking loser, you've done something wrong. And that really doesn't work for a lot of people. And it really puts people into a corner where sometimes they lose their shit. Like we said, I mean, we're living in a mentally ill society for a very good reason. And I don't think it's one thing. I think it's a multitude of things. But that's why we have this fake news versus Russia hysteria phenomenon where it's either everything's fake news that doesn't worship our anointed leader or it's Russian propaganda of people who are this nearing pun punditry class that can't accept why Hillary lost and why reality is the way it is. And so we're here kind of waiting in the middle, just trying to sort out what the fuck is going on. Yeah. And what's confusing and then to add insult to injury, we've got Trump in line to get a Nobel Peace Prize for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. So then it's like, well, you know, this man, you know, many of his policies on my Patreon, somebody gave me a real like talking to that I liked it was either right, they're like, you sound really out of touch. I was talking about how people don't seem to be so nuanced and stuff about Trump, you know, being partially good and partially bad. And this person wrote to me, I'm not sure if it was a he or she, Jodi, thanks, Jodi, said, listen, I've been working in the unions for 20 years. Trump sucks. He's the worst thing that ever happened to us. But for you to say that we're not aware that there's some good things presidents do too, it makes you seem completely out of touch. I appreciated that. That's absolutely completely true. But this conundrum of having a president that's fucking with the unions deregulating shit that probably doesn't need to be deregulated. And yet denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, for real, for real. This is like now it's become like, I mean, when you were watching The Apprentice, certainly you never thought that guy's going to bring peace to Korea. Well, this is the one good thing about Trump is that because he, you know, on one hand, he's the biggest puppet, quote unquote, the biggest deep state puppet that ever existed. On the other hand, he does have that kind of streak of independence where unlike every other president who has refused to meet with the North Korean leadership, which has been a disaster, right? Why is it that we're refusing to have diplomacy and talk to people who are so-called enemies? That's insane. So I thought it was great that Trump was like, you know what, I'm going to actually talk to him. And then the world just flipped their shit. I mean, you had Rachel Maddow saying, there's a reason why no other leader has ever met with the North Korean leadership. It's like, no, that's actually not good, Rachel. We shouldn't be egging on war in the region. But true to Trump's erratic nature, he's already like reneged on the deal and he's like, you know what, I'm not going to do it anymore. And Kim Jong-un is like, look, we're actually going to send now this delegation of North Koreans to try to convince him to get it to happen. I think, but they opened the door. Trump opened the door for it to happen. I think the really interesting thing, Duncan, is why is it that two regions, right? And we're talking about the same country, North and South Korea, they want peace. You know, the overwhelming majority of people polled in the region want peace. Why is it even up to the US to be like, you know what, actually, you guys can't have it yet. We have to like be involved in the, you know, we have to oversee this whole process. I mean, that's insane to me that the US has to even be involved in two regions who want to end this war. Why is that? What's your answer? Because the US is an empire and we've shaped and colonized the planet. And so you look at the planet today and everything's either who are the colonizers and who are the colonized. And in terms of Korea, you can't look at the region of Korea and all the news stories that come out about Korea without understanding how the US Empire shaped the Korean Peninsula and how it also contributes to the fomenting of war. Really quickly. I mean, the US is the one who came in an arbitrarily drew a line through a National Geographic map to draw the 38th parallel, which was splitting the country in two. Was it actually a National Geographic map? It was literally someone who didn't even know what the hell Korea looked like. And they're like, here's the line of the 30th parallel. And this is on top of decimating the country, destroying 25% of all, you know, killing off 25% of the entire population, decimating all infrastructure. We only basically pulled out of Korea because there was nothing else left to bomb. And so fast forward till today when we make Korea look like the belligerent actor, like, oh, Kim Jong-un is genocidal and he's threatening us every day. Well, we're the ones who are surrounding Korea with war games and warships. There's torpedo nuclear submarines that could destroy North Korea in a day. There's beef to do bombers just set up in Guam and, you know, tens of thousands of troops stationed in Korea and Guam that could just destroy and obliterate Korea again. So they've been through this. They've built themselves up in a military fortress to prevent further destruction of their entire country. So there's a lot of things that I feel like are omitted. But yeah, I mean, I really think that Trump does deserve credit for at least opening the door, right, because this has never been done before with the U.S. But yeah, it's perplexing because on the other hand, he definitely doesn't deserve a noble peace prize. You know, everyone, Obama got one the first day in office before he even did anything. Yes. But after, you know, Trump is overseeing just so much crazy shit that it's hard to imagine him getting a peace prize. But we'll see. We'll see what happens. I think that it's a disgrace, the fact that people are actually egging on war and telling him that he's doing something bad for wanting to open the dialogue. That's insane. That's where it gets really, really weird to me is the same people who at one point wanted seem to have wanted peace in the most vehement way. Now they want war because it's Trump, right? Like they want war because they don't they don't know what it is. That's the to me. That's where I start getting very confused, where it seems like people are just support supporting infinite, endless war. I mean, this is the idea, right? Like, God, I had I rode with some mystical Uber driver today who's Korean and he was breaking it all down for me. And I was saying, oh, my God, maybe Trump's going to bring peace to the Middle East, too. What if that happens? Do they weren't really all going to feel like everything's fucking insane? He's like Jesus or something. Like if Trump is the second coming of Christ, just how weird would that be? Oh, now there's peace in it in the Middle East somehow by his insanity. Like, can you imagine and then you have to deal with the fact? Yeah, we're kind of friends with China now. Oh, shit. We're kind of friends with Russia, too. We actually seem to be kind of just sort of trading with everybody and it's sort of a mildly peaceful planet. And now everyone's going to flip it. I don't think this is my Uber driver. I was like, that's never going to fucking happen. He said, because the United States is the number one weapons manufacturer. And he said the creepiest thing he said, if you make umbrellas, you got to have rain. And I know. And it was so sad. It's so harsh to imagine that. But do you think that's true? We've these conspiracy theorists, me included, give me on enough mushrooms. And I'll start imagining that, yeah, actually we're intentionally making war happen because some lobbyist is whispering in the ear of some politician who's whispering in the ear of some other politician to go to war at some place where we don't need to go to war just to sell bombs. How true is that? So I think, unfortunately, Duncan, I don't think it's really a conspiracy theory. I think that, again, if you look at the world in terms of the US being the largest empire that's ever existed, right, we're talking about 900 military bases that span the entirety of the world military personnel in every, almost every country. Yeah. Aside from that, you just look at the way and how the extent to which the US is intervening and you serve the democratic processes of countless countries in Latin America alone, the numbers 56. So you look at the way that the world is structured. And the biggest. I'm sorry, may I stop you there? Tell me how just if like you and I suddenly are working with the CIA that does that. So you and I are working in the CIA. Just quickly break down. What is the. What is the order of events that so it's really so it's really easy. Look at the way the world is now. What countries is the US press and establishment fomenting regime change against? We got Syria. Yeah. Let's see. We've got I guess I don't even know. Would you even say Palestine? I mean, yeah. No, Palestine, Iran, Venezuela, right? Venezuela is a big one that keeps coming up. So those countries, what are they all in common? Well, they all are not completely in servitude to the US military and economic or banking establishment. That is very obvious, right? These these countries have not laid down like a carpet to US business or militarism. That's very true. So that's the way that the US operates. It's the countries that aren't completely in servitude to us that we knock down and replace their leaderships. I mean, this is all. How many are left? Just a couple. Just a couple. Iran, Venezuela. I mean, the ultimate prizes are inevitably, obviously, Russia and China. Those are the big prizes. Those are the big competitors in terms of capitalism. Right. But right now we have these little countries that are still semi-independent post-colonial states that we need to knock down in order to get to those big prizes, Russia and China. I mean, this is this is an open conspiracy. This is a conspiracy of capitalism. You need to keep growing as a system economically. And the only way to do that is to cross nation states and cross borders to keep seizing different economies, consolidating and monopolizing those industries. And that's the way that the US runs. That's the way that the US is operated. We had World War II, World War I and World War II, where you had a bunch of different competing empires that kind of all all came to a head with the dropping of the nuclear bomb. The US asserted itself as the dominant empire. And since then, we've been destabilizing and destructuring the entire fucking world and taking out leaders that have threatened our economic hegemony. And that's the way that we are today. So I think that, you know, taking Iran down, taking Syria down, all of these countries, look at Libya that the Gaddafi wanted to basically get off the dollar. I mean, Venezuela was talking about getting, you know, basically using their resources for the people instead of US bankers. And so it's not, you know, it sucks. I'm a big, I'm as big of a conspiracy theorist as the next person. But like, this is not a conspiracy. This is just the reality that we live in. Okay. Well, let's, this is instead of envisioning world peace. I want you to describe to me what the world looks like when the United States, if the United States, like you're saying, succeeds. We take out all of the countries that you just mentioned, including the big prizes. We do regime changes there. Now what does the world look like? Oh God, I mean, it's, it's really dystopian. And it's like Blade Runner, like very dystopian. I feel like it's, you know, you have this monolith, monolithic empire that is no, no longer needs to foment war constantly, but you're going to have that kind of 1984 Orwellian society where you just have the, like imagine war outside of yourself without, you know, it's just a construct of, of the threat without that actually existing. So I feel like we'd live in like this virtual reality setting of this retaliatory nightmare where we've just created a fake enemy that actually doesn't even have to exist anymore. And that's what the establishment can do to us. That is so creepy. So you're saying like suddenly like, okay, so it's no more Putin. We've got some, I don't know, someone in there, the U.S. approved. The Ayatollah is gone. Yeah. Now we've got someone approved by the U.S. Assad is replaced by somebody. And you're, because, and you're saying now we're going to invent people to fight. I think so. Because you still have to sell weapons. Yeah, exactly. You still have to sell weapons. So in a weird, construct. But so in a weird way, isn't it just, isn't that maybe what's already happening in the sense that we're just like, no, no, let's, let's just leave a couple of things out there to keep fighting so that we keep selling these bombs. And back to your point about the, how the, everyone works in concert to sell that. It's so true, Duncan. Look at the, look at the media. I mean, we're talking about the fact that the media always eggs on war, right? And the fact that Trump wanted a dialogue with North Korea and you actually had people opposing that, where you have Trump bombing Syria, the only time that you see bipartisan praise for Trump is every, every time he just wants to bomb something. That is true. Like dropping the mini nuke, the Moab bomb on ISIS caves, quote unquote, in Afghanistan. Everyone just loved it. You had Brian Wilson with a heart on, you know, talking about the beauty of our weapons. It's, it's stunning what the people do to basically egg on Trump and, and cheer on military intervention. And this is why Duncan, because you look at how, look at the media. The media is subsidized by banks, weapons contractors and oil companies. That's why we don't hear about climate change on the media. Like we literally don't hear about these things. And all you have is an, in the commercial break, you'll see a commercial for a tank. What the fuck is that? Yeah. Do you, this is one, I remember watching, I don't remember what CNN and they're like a Halliburton commercial. But why, and I've always thought like, who are they advertising to? They're, they're, that's, they're just reminding people who owns the message. That's who owns the message. And that's who, that's the machine, man. The machine just operates on its own. So you're saying, you know, they have to keep selling weapons. That's the machine. And if people descend or disagree with the ultimate goal of selling weapons, they'll be pushed out of the board of directors. You know, there are their own grave diggers. I mean, they're, they're basically just digging their own graves and, and, and, people who disagree with this end vision are just going to be removed. Have you ever met anyone who works at one of these places? No. God, wouldn't that be cool? I really want to meet them. I want to talk to a weapons manufacturer, like someone deep in Raytheon or whatever. Because this is the, these are the people I always wonder about the most because surely they are not feeling great about what they're doing. Are they, are they just sort of, I don't know, demonic? Did they, I just can't imagine that in these places that there's people who are 100% like, if I were, you know, putting the last bit of polish on a bomb, I just made. Which they do. They shine them. You know, there's like a whole like bomb polishers. Yeah, I guarantee they have something that polishes the missiles that they sell. Because when you see the missiles, they look good. Like they've been cleaned. They've got a gleam to them. Like a, like a new car, a fresh $100,000 missile. A new missile smell. I got that. Oh my God. The gunpowder smell. I think that people are compartmentalized Duncan. I don't think that, I think the vast majority of people working at Raytheon, Lockheed, Martin are compartmentalized into their own units. And a lot of these people, you've met them, you go to college with them and you're, and they're all like revolutionary and hardcore. And then they just become fucking cogs in the machine because that's the system. We can't all just go out and fight the man forever. You have to like make money and do your job. And a lot of these companies are the only opportunities for some of these people. And a lot of areas. It seems like the only hope here though is that at every, the weapons manufacturers, we've got the, I don't know what the chain of command is at a weapon, a weapons factory. There's someone running the show who definitely loves killing people, gets excited about body counts, probably gets reports on the body counts and like sends those to other departments. Like what's going on with your bomb? It only killed 50 people, but we dropped it in an area where it should have killed 500 people. Jack, what's happening here? These meetings are happening, but it seems like somewhere down the line, there's people there who maybe feel bad or don't want to be there. It seems like the only hope would be people at these companies just quit. Like we're not going to make weapons anymore. That's in fantasy. It's a weed, it's a literal pipe dream. It's a pipe dream because jobs are always going to be needed and people are always going to choose that over, I'm just going to quit from some sort of moral compass that's guiding me. Because look, at the end of the day, it's the cultivation of the dehumanization of the others. So as long as we're dehumanized to think of people less than ourselves and as long as we're living in the empire, if you work in some of these weapons manufacturers, you obviously have conditioned yourself into thinking that these people deserve to be killed. Otherwise you wouldn't be comfortable taking a job there. That's like, it's just the way that we're conditioned. The media tells you these people are our enemy, they need to die. It's just the same reason that no one who is a Democrat who's upset about Trump's policies now claiming to be upset about Trump's policies in the Middle East, cared when Obama was bombing seven Muslim countries and up to drone strikes. Didn't give a shit. Yeah, didn't give a shit. Didn't give a shit. And this is where it gets really, I guess just because it's happening at home, it's obvious, but these rotten school shootings, I just can't even imagine being a parent. Oh my God. I just don't know what that feels like. I cannot even imagine. But those school shootings happen and there's, I mean, everyone freaks. But then when we do bombings that kill kids overseas, nobody really talks about it. Why aren't there marches? Why aren't we marching? Why don't we march on the weapons manufacturers? Why aren't people sitting around Raytheon downtown or in fucking, where is it? It's in Westchester or some shit. Every time I go to LAX, you pass Raytheon. Why aren't people protesting around there, Abby? Why do we seem to be completely numb to the violence of the empire? But we seem completely freaked out when violence happens inside of our own school. I think it's human psychology and also, you know, that has a lot to do with it, obviously, but also we've externalized all the horrible shit that we do to other people. So that's like, I always say, the safest place to be is within the US because you're safe from US bombs and US regime change. And so we've externalized all of the violence, the hate. You know, you go to other places that are affected by US foreign policy and they're just like, I love Americans. Like they can all separate what Americans are to their government, but we don't separate other people to their government. You know, we hate Iranians. We think Palestinians are terrorists. And but then there's also the thing about the hypocrisy with especially the Democratic Party when it comes to these mass shootings, because they all like to pontificate about the NRA. Like you said, Duncan, we are the largest weapons manufacturer in the fucking world. We have the most guns out of any goddamn nation. And here we are selling weapons to police state, theocratic dictatorships like Saudi Arabia that are using it to bomb weddings. Where is the outrage on that? Where is the Democrats saying, hey, maybe this bleeds into our society? If we are the empire and we're selling the most weapons to theocratic dictatorships that are using them to behead people in the public square for sorcery, maybe we should take a fucking step back and say, hey, maybe this all actually reflects our leadership, maybe, and this reality star obsessed culture where we make these people an instantaneous celebrities. Maybe all of these things are components of why we have this unique phenomenon in our country. But no one's done that, Duncan. We just like to blame the exits and entrances to schools. We want to say that the transparent backpacks and bulletproof blankets are the solution. And all these people who want to say, you know, and I have my own opinions about gun control, but I find it hilarious that, you know, they claim that it's detalitarianism, right? If we talk about banning the bumper stocks or any of this shit because it's a slippery slope. Why isn't it detalitarian to have Dana Loesch talk about militarizing schools, putting metal detectors in there, putting cops everywhere? I mean, that to me is fucking detalitarian as fuck. Well, this is, I mean, I had a really dark moment as I was, well, one, man, it's like, God, I'm an old, this is when I, you know, you get these signs from the universe, like you're getting old now. But one of them was, I think I tweeted something that I thought was brilliant. Which was like, I tweeted like, you know what? Next step, it's going to be like the TSA is going to be in every school. And then right away, someone like tweeted back like, that's every inner city school now. Wow. You know, that's what it's like there now. Now what I was actually thinking is I don't mean like metal detectors. I mean, like they're going to have TSA agents where you have to get to school a couple hours early. You've got to get your shit rifled through. There's going to be dogs. There's going to be scanners. Right. And then it's going to take you two hours to get into your school. Right. And then you're going to get into yours and it's going to be a police state. And then I started thinking like, oh, I get it. Of course, this does make sense. Which is like, if you did want to create a police state, the best way to start is in the schools. Start in the schools. Set it up so the schools become little totalitarian states. Yep. Get the students used to it. No, this is normal. We're protecting you, man. We're protecting you. You don't know. Get used to these security guards and officers and drones. Drones. Yeah, drones. Did you hear that about the prisons? No. So this is a new thing where they're doing an experimental program where there's drones in the prisons. So now when you're in a prison yard, there's drones floating above you, watching you. And theoretically, in your cells instead of guards, it's going to be drones going by. So yeah, it's going to be like drones at these schools. You're going to be walking to your class and a drone is just going to hover in front of you. Maybe do a retinal scan. Just to make sure that you're behaving. Sure. Do a blood book. Yeah, check your bio signals, what your temperature is, to see what your pulse is looking like, how dilated your eyes are, what drugs are you on, a pheromone check. Do a quick scan. Oh, my God. Oh, shit, man. This kid's pulse is up a little bit. His eyes are dilating. Oh, my God. Yeah. That is terrifying. Yeah, that's where it gets really terrifying. Wow. Yeah, I know. Because right now, it's like in a weird way, the security apparatus is visible right now. So at least we can see the totalitarianism. The next step is when the security apparatus is not visible or is not quite as noticeable. So we just walk. Oh, my God. Now I'm on a rant. I'm going to stop it, but I'll tell you. That's really scary. I go on Reddit conspiracy late at night for some reasons. I don't know why. Sometimes a lot of stuff on there is just fucking lunatics. But every once in a while, there's shit that's real. And one of the things they put is Alexa is monitoring you. And you can actually go into your Alexa settings. If you have an Alexa, of course, you don't. You go to the Alexa settings and you can look at your Alexa history. Yeah. And if you scan through it, it has recorded random bits of just weirdness for now for me for like a year and a half. It has a year and a half of monitoring me. And it has. We couldn't translate. It just says we couldn't translate this to text. Listen if you want. And you just hit. It just records it randomly throughout the year. Just you talking. You could hear my wife and I like in the midst of, I don't know, some argument where she is saying, let's talk about this. That's all. I don't know what we were like talking about, but it was serious with that moment. I don't know what it was. And it's just randomly just like sniffing little bits of audio and saving it on the cloud. It's just sitting on the fucking. Wow. All these little Alexis, they're everywhere. And they're just they're just vacuuming up little tidbits of conversation that are just sitting there for some reason. Yeah, you can. If anyone out there, if you have an Alexa and you want to freak your fucking shit out, go look at the history of the Alexa and it's recorded you. And it's recorded for you as long as you've had that fucking thing. Oh my God. That's so scary. I know. I know. I know because but what you're so great. You're so good at describing the empire of the United States. And I love that you keep referring to it as an empire. And because that's what it is. But it's an evolved empire. Yes. Because they figured it out. We can't go around with the robes anymore, guys. Right. We've got it like we're not where the ropes. We're going to have a president, not an emperor. It's going to be someone who comes and goes a little puppet person. Just like we always have. I'm sure emperors always have little puppet people that work for them. That was probably a big part of empire. Find the puppet man who you're going to like, you know, control. He's going to get killed more than likely. So you won't get killed. It's all it all makes sense. But let's camo a little bit. Camouflage man. What's so amazing about evolution is looking at the ability for things to camouflage. And like how that's part of the evolutionary process is the world rewards great camouflage by letting you live. And so, you know, the United States is an empire. It's a very well camp. Not maybe not so well camouflaged, pretty well camouflaged. So Americans, what's that? I said it works really well because we've conditioned ourselves to think that we're actually the greatest country in the world. That we're the moral arbitrator of everything that's right and holy. Yes. You know, we deem who's the enemy. We we decide basically world policy. So yeah, I mean, we've conditioned ourselves into thinking that, you know, with the freest press, the world's greatest democracy. There's all these myths that you have to debunk and deconstruct to actually make people realize it's actually the opposite of what we've been told. We're actually the most like dangerous, violent force that the world has ever seen. That's right. But where it gets before you get to that, I just want to point out that the next step in camouflage is, yeah, we're going to monitor you. We're going to fucking watch everything you do. And we're going to know who you are at all times. But it's not you're not going to see it. You know, you can just pretend it's not there, but it's there. We're watching. That's the final phase of it. That's the final stage of it, I think it's just like, yeah, we're going to be watching you and just deal with it. And I don't know. Sometimes I wonder, is that the worst thing? Is that like, I don't know. It's it's it's confusing, but just I wanted to make that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I want to ask you where it gets really confusing to me is ever since I was a kid, I knew the news is bullshit. They talk weird. They promote war. You know, war is coming when they start talking about some country being evil. All of a sudden out of the blue, they get they get us primed. They get us. It's like the news is like to war. What forplay is decepts, right? They get us all fucking turned on and pissed. And then there's a war and we just kind of accept it. They who bus up. So where it gets a little confusing to me is now we have the president saying that news is fucking bullshit. Yeah. So the state is attacking the propaganda mechanism of the state. The thing that formerly was the propaganda mechanism of the state is being attacked by the state. So I don't can you explain this to me? What is happening here? Yeah. And before I get into that, I wanted to say also it's different. You know, a lot of people say the U.S. is falling in global power and we're in the death rows of the empire. I agree with that. But the dangerous thing about the state of the U.S. is compared to other empires falling in the past is that the U.S. again has the military bases all over the world has personnel everywhere. We're not going to go out without a fight. You think that the U.S. isn't going to like give up its power militarily without actually killing a shield of people? You know, I mean, what are we going to do with all these weapons and having, you know, all of these countries under our thumb? To your point about Trump, it is confusing, right? It is confusing that that Trump, you know, and it and it appears to a lot of people that Trump is fighting this deep state apparatus that he's really this anti-establishment figure. Again, we're in this dueling reality of mass hallucinations where you have everything that isn't worshiping Trump fake news, but you have to look at this is also a billionaire funded media apparatus to the Breitbart's info wars and Fox News. So that is 100 percent idolating Trump, 100 percent worshiping Trump. And that is also a huge part of media of state media. It just depends on the hyper partisan nature of where people are have their loyalties. But in terms of your your point, the neoliberal blob, this institution of mainstream media, CNN's, ABC's and all of these people, the DC neoliberal punditry Huffington, Huffington Post, absolutely. They all hate Trump. Why do they hate Trump? They hate Trump because Trump removes the mask of empire. They hate Trump because Trump is basically exposing what the system really is. Trump for the first time. He's like Netanyahu for Israel. Trump removes the mask and he's like, we're fucking belligerent, misogynistic, bigoted, bumbling around, right? And these punts, they've groomed the public. They've groomed the masses and accepting and worshiping someone like Obama, who makes empire palatable to the rest of the world. He's able to sell it. He's this really established guy just like Hillary. She was a, you know, she's the woman. She's just like Obama sold the empire right as we're in the cusp of this revolution after the Bush administration. Obama comes in, tightens it all up and carries it through. And they wanted Hillary to just continue that legacy. Trump comes in and fucks it all up. He basically shows the rest of the world. The rest of the world is like, this is what America really is to us. We know the repercussions of the empire and to Americans, we're just offended that Trump has basically delegitimized us, even though the rest of the world has already seen us for who we really are. I got you. And so the media hates Trump for that reason. They don't hate Trump. They don't, they don't criticize Trump for the right reasons. They don't criticize Trump for upping drone strikes, 400%. They don't criticize Trump for carpet bombing neighborhoods. They don't criticize Trump for the selling weapons to Saudi Arabia. They just criticize him for things like paying off a porn star. You know, like these things that are just very superficial and actually have no substance whatsoever. Grabber by the pussy. Yeah, grabber by the blink. I love how kids in the future, I heard someone saying this at the comedy store. He's like, in the future, our kids are going to be filling out multiple choice questions on a test. It's like, grabber by the blink. This is our world, man. This is our world. But it is confusing because people are like, look, the media hates Trump. That means that Trump's good. And I think that it's not as simple as that because obviously a lot of the, a lot of the media that's hyper partisan right wing billionaire, the Koch brother funded libertarian networks and also the info wars and Fox news is love Trump. They love him. It's just this blob, this punditry class that lost their power. When Hillary lost, they all saw that their futures were dwindling. They were like, oh, shit, where do I stand now in this place? And I saw it when I was in DC, these people just want access. They can't handle losing their access and losing their power. And I think when Trump got in, they just thought, oh, shit. You know, where does that leave us? Where does it leave them? What's the future for these people? I mean, they're going to, they're going to keep trying, Duncan. That's why we see them continuing over and over and over again with the Russia stuff, because again, they can't accept reality. You know, in the DNI report from the intelligence community, they were so desperate to blame and absolve their failures on anything except themselves that they blame Russia for everything. We see that they blamed me as part of the DNI report. My old show on RT, they actually said that that was part of the reason why we have Trump. Yeah, that's how desperate they are. That's how desperate they are. Holy shit. You're the one who did it. Yeah, I did it. So in a weird way, you're partially responsible for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Yeah, exactly. I want the peace prize. How weird. So, I mean, are you a Trump supporter? You don't seem like you. No, God, no, no. So you don't like Trump, but you're, so you are confusing. It's great. I love it because it should be this complex. We want things to be easier to understand. Why should they be easy to understand? It's a convoluted mess is what it is. And it seems like what you're saying is there, essentially, we have these two outlets, two factions, and they are at war with each other. And one of them has, but which one, if you had to pick, sorry to ask this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But if you had to pick between these factions, which one would you want to be in power? See, that's the problem, Duncan, because that was what I felt like was the biggest conundrum with the 2016 election. I hated Hillary and I hated Trump, and I thought this is fucking awful. You're making people choose between the two worst people that could possibly be the choices for the presidency and the CEO of the empire. And I think that on one hand, Trump is awful. He's galvanized generals who are bloodthirsty neocons and evangelicals, right to surround him, who are from the fucking year 1600, who are setting us back hundreds of years. On the other hand, you have the neoliberal blob people like Hillary Clinton who again make empire palatable, make people asleep. And if Hillary were alive today, if Hillary were president today, people would be asleep. People would not be out in the streets. They wouldn't be protesting the mass deportation of immigrants, even though Obama deported more people than any other president combined. All American presidents. All of these things. Yeah, all of these things people would not be out complaining about or fighting. And so for that reason alone, I feel like I would rather have Trump only because, and I'm saying this not lightly because I understand, you know, tons of people are facing really devastating life choices of being deported, undocumented people are being, you know, living a really crazy life right now under Trump. But however, the opening is there for change. The opening, finally, with Trump as our president is there for people to wake up again to what the system really is and what it represents and actually fight to change it. Because I think if Hillary won, you're just going to have people just hypnotized, just like Obama, and we're going to just again, remove ourselves from everything that we're doing in the Middle East. And just as long as we're comfortable, we don't care, Duncan. And so things need to be uncomfortable. Things need to get a lot worse before they can get better. I truly do believe that. You know, this is to me the really scary thing about it. If you kind of look at like the American presidents as a kidnapper, you know, I don't know which movie is some movies, people get kidnapped, people end up in desperate situations. But the person who's kidnapped them is kind of acting like they're their friend. You know, like that weird thing where you're Stockholm syndrome? Yeah, well, not even Stockholm syndrome. You know, it's sort of like you, I don't know if you've ever been conned before, but if you ever get conned, so when you're getting conned, the first phase of getting conned is the person acts like they're your friend. But you start thinking, oh, shit, I'm getting conned. Right. But the next phase of getting conned is getting mugged. Right. Getting mugged is the same thing as getting conned. A mugger just takes your fucking money and says, give me your money. It doesn't do the song and dance around taking your money so that they walk away and then you think about it like, shit, I got ripped off. So, but if you look at the progression of like, okay, so I've got you where I want you, I'm going to pretend to be your friend. Oh, look, I'm this articulate, sophisticated, elite, educated, charismatic man who is just seems so beautiful and peaceful. It's like, yeah, you're here. That thing you're hearing in the back rooms of the house. Don't pay attention to the screen. That's definitely people getting killed. Unquestionably, people are getting killed. You're right about that. But hey, check me out on Letterman. I make baseball references. I make jokes about the Jonas Brothers. Yes, you're right. I am murdering people. So you're kind of like, oh, okay. It's so true. It's really cool. Where it's like, we get Trump. But that's that's where like, suddenly the person doing it goes from being like, look, I just want you to be happy. Yes, I'm murdering people, but I'm, you know, this is the right thing to do. You know, this is what we do to shut the fuck up. Oh, you sad I'm killing people. I'm going to torture their families too. Yeah. Yeah. Now what are you going to fucking do? Do something. You're going to do something. What are you going to do? That's the next phase. Well, that's where it becomes fascism. Right. That's where it becomes full on totalitarian when it goes from the, because Mussolini wasn't pretending to be a nice person. Right. Did you see what his main building looked like? Have you ever seen pictures of Mussolini? It just looks like something straight out of hell that demons would live in. Like, look it up. It's like they didn't even try to make it seem happy. It's not the White House. Yeah. This beautiful, maybe fairy tale looking place. It's like a fucking terrifying looking satanic building that a person inside was like, yeah, I'm Mussolini. Yeah, who do you think we are? I'm a fucking fascist. Right. And so that to me is like, I love what you're saying because it's sort of like, well, this is going to like create perhaps a push towards a more peaceful world and the less warmongering government. But then I just think, no, maybe the scary idea is just like the next phase of power where they're like, all right, we can take these stupid masks off. Man, those shoes were too fucking tight. No, exactly. That is when you, again, empire has learned and the US government has learned on how to be relatable to people and the hijacking of identity politics, this hijacking of like revolutionary language to sell warmongers like Hillary Clinton. She's a woman. Yeah. You know, what's what's next, a trans person or gay person? And then we're just going to be like, it doesn't matter what they're doing as long as you can get behind this idea. And then that just sells, that just sells all of the policies around the world, Duncan. You're totally right. That is the future. That is the dystopian future hellhole. Is everyone thinking that you're free? You have to imagine that if you're Trump and you're narcissistic, power hungry, billionaire, who's like making shit happen. I'm just thinking if I put myself in his shoes at night, sitting in the White House, thinking that I brought peace, the Korean Peninsula, you know, probably I'm bored. So I'm going to go through as much like I'm going to just write down like five people I hate and then use all of my state power to like look at all their emails. You know, he does that night. Trump goes through his enemies emails and just laughs his ass off. You know, he does. He can write. He has that level of security clearance, right? Like he could call someone at the NSA, right, and give them a name and be like, Hey, can you send me their emails from the last five years? And he just actually just send me the images and the emails and then we'll go from there. He could do that. Right. Is that me just confabulating something? No, he could. He could do whatever the fuck he wants. Yeah. Right. Yeah. And he does do that. I'm sure. Guaranteed he does do that. And not only does he do it, I bet he has parties with his friends and they all sit around and they laugh their fucking asses off at all the dick pics Obama has sent. You know, if Obama sent a dick pic, Trump has it now. I'm talking about a guy that would call people pretending to be his lawyer because he wanted, you know what I mean? I mean, this is a guy who is totally off his. Shit. And it's sad because he's seeing the aliens. Like, you know, Trump has probably seen the aliens and just saw whatever. Yeah. He's like, whatever. Doesn't care. He doesn't care. He's like, seeing them in the White House. Right, right. Get the little squiddlers out of here. I like them. Just keep them out of my office. But the so we know that we know that he's doing that. But you know, Abby, if you're Trump, you do fantasize about how great it would feel to put on a fucking robe and have a scepter and stand in front of the planet and get worshiped. He thinks that. I bet he wants that. I could get this done so much faster as an emperor. Right. And there's people who have to say to him, just relax your highness. Give us a little time. We just have a few other places we need to fix. And then we can come out again. Then we can come out again. We can come out, you know, like we can like emerge again. He's such a wannabe dictator. Yeah. I mean, he he he's getting there. Just give him another year of executive orders and shuffling around these Supreme Court judges and judicial nominees. It won't be Trump. Trump's going to get some weird, you know, he'll get Trump will just one day years down the line. Maybe I don't know. He's just going to like eat a bad fucking hamburger and some food poisoning. Whoa, that's nuts. Yeah, they're like dropped dead from eating a hamburger. Oh, that's crazy. And that's when someone that we've never even heard of. Right. Magistrate Williams or some weird, you know, Cernovich for president. It's going to be President Cernovich. But I want to, you know, this is mostly ridiculous. But I do want to ask you, yeah, so let's imagine. Right. That suddenly Trump is supposed to show up for a press conference. It isn't Trump. It's a beautiful, powerful man. We've never heard of who's like, I'm running the show now. And the military is behind me and the corporations are behind me. And America, this is the new America. This is how we're doing it. What do you think would happen? It depends on what happened to Trump. Did he die? I had food poisoning. He got sick. Pence was in there for a second. Then Pence comes out. We think he's going to talk. And he just, it's like bringing up the next conference. He's like, I want you all to do your magistrate, magistrate steal. And a guy's going to come out and he's like, yeah, this is pretty much how it is now. We're going to, we're not really going to do the election stuff. He just knew that was bullshit. We were, here's what happened. We got infiltrated by the Russians. I'm going to have to set things straight. It means we have to suspend the elections because all the machines have been taken over. There's really no choice. This is just an end result. Obama will be standing behind him. We have to do it this way. We were completely infiltrated by the Russians. So we got to call off the elections. We can't really do the way thing we were doing before. We've got to take care of business for a few years. Something like that, what do you think would happen? It's a good question. I would like to think that people would just have a large-scale revolt. But I think it's such a hyper-partisan reality, Duncan, that half the country literally does believe that the Russians have infiltrated us. So I feel like the Democrats would be like, this is what we need. The Russians did this. And we need people to just take over everything. And then the other half would be the militia people who think that the deep state took out Trump and would go with their guns in the streets and start the revolution. Just like Alex Jones is warning everyone about. They would start the revolution. They would start a really dangerous revolution. Imagine, though, because I don't think that happens. I think what happens is, yeah, some people take to the streets. They're immediately mowed down by machine gun fire and Apache helicopters. And I think that the front line of people who get mowed down are like, you know what, I like Magistrate's deal. Maybe he's OK. And then that's it. It's just like that. I mean, I don't think, I think you could do it in three days. I think it could be done in three, just one speech. Let them run out in the streets. Just mow them down. And now, you know, we'll go to war with Russia. We're going to have a little World War III go down. And then we're going to just do it. We're going to big push the final thing. We're going to do it. You're totally right. Because when Donald Trump won, I thought, you know, oh, Trump's never going to win. I was like, if he does, there's going to be a revolution the next day or that, you know, and look what happened, Duncan. Here we are almost two years into the presidency. And nothing has happened. People have accepted it. It's very easy to condition people immediately into accepting this dystopian nightmare that we're living in. And so I totally agree. But it isn't a nightmare. It's a nightmare to a lot of people. But you're right. It's not a nightmare to a lot. You're right. God damn it. See, this is my problem. Yeah. I always forget. Yeah. It's so easy to be like, it's not a nightmare. Right, right, right. Yeah. Everyone podcasts. You do your podcast show. You know, everyone's podcast. You know, we all podcast. We just podcast. Yeah. Just a podcast. That's a podcast. But yeah, you're right. So for a lot of people, this thing that we're in right now is like some kind of nightmarish thing. And yes, still nothing. Right. No one's really doing anything except sitting back and letting the anaconda squeeze tighter. This is a really disturbing just notion that people would just sit back and let magistrate. Steel? Steel. I think it would just be like, oh, you know. As long as we could still podcast then. No, we would podcast about magistrate steel. And they would let, you know, magistrate steel would like laugh. Right. He would be like, I listen to podcasts. I know a lot of you are upset with me. I know. I'm a podcaster myself. He would have his own podcast. That's the future. But I think it would just be more like he would come out and be really affable and just be like, guys, look, I know. I know what I look like. And you're right. I'm an emperor. Right. I'm the new emperor. And I know that's a laugh about it. It's just let's get used to it. Right. Because think about it. Really, this can be a lot better than it is right now with our current democracy. And then suddenly people would think, you know, maybe he's right. All of magistrate steel has to say is like, you know what? We aren't doing that college tuition thing anymore. It's all free. Everyone will go to college for free. That's it. Everyone goes to college for free. And we're going to make sure that there's a basic income for everybody. I'm going to start sending every single American. We'll receive every two weeks a check for 500 bucks. Guys, I know that's not enough to live on. But it's close. It's $1,000 a month extra that you're going to have. And I think that at that point, most people in the country would be like, you know what? He's not so bad. You know what, though? Now that I think about it, again, to the point of people, you need to make people think that they have a choice. And that's why capitalism, like under our system, is so successful. Because even though half the country is living in poverty, Duncan, and people, you know, 70% of Americans don't have more than $1,000 to their bank account, they still believe that they're free. And they still believe that this is the best system in the world and that they can be rich. Everyone's just a Donald Trump in the making. So I think that when you take that agency away, even though it is a myth, largely, when you take that agency away from people, I think that people's psychology changes. And that it wouldn't be as easy to just rule over society. I think that people would be like, holy shit, we no longer have freedom. So there's something very unique about the idea of freedom and this idea, this notion of what America is that continues to keep us, you know, working hard and being good old bees. Okay, I don't mean to keep going back to this ridiculous scenario. But I'm saying like a young, charismatic person somehow ends up there. And it's like, no, we were doing it all wrong. We're not going to do these global wars anymore. We're not going to do this anymore. I'm nationalizing everything. Oh, we're taking the money back from these banks. You know, we're going to give people this and that. We're going to give you whatever you want. We're going to get, this is the thing. This is the new America now. It's not what it was before. Maybe do a couple of executions, you know, get some like people from Pfizer or whatever. Hey, this is the guy who was making millions of millions of dollars by selling poison to people, addictive poison. We're going to, look, oh, we just shot him in the head. Right. Then people are going to maybe be like, wait a minute, this is not awesome. Yeah, this is, wait a minute. Whoa, holy shit. They're like nationalizing the, oh my God. And on top of it, friends, marijuana, it's legal. Right, right. You know, things like that. I think that people might be a little more likely to go with it with just a little bit of just a little bit, because they've already taken so much shit away from us. Right. That's, that it's just a human right. And obviously we should have access to marijuana, like national marijuana should just be legal. This is an easy thing to give back. Oh no, here you go. You can have that. The thing you should have had anyway, we're just going to let you have it now. Yeah. We're going to give you that. We're going to give you a free education. You know, the only difference is like, we're going to have to do a little, some things overseas. Yeah. A couple of things overseas. Got a clean house first. A little world war. Just one little, little tiny world war. Yeah. Yeah. Or even creepier, a little like merging. You know, instead of just like, you know, like we're just going to merge. We're now like Russia, China, I think freaking Moshe Kasher, the comedian said that to me as really spooky. He's like, you know, the spooky thing is this, what's going to happen is just like a, a new, what was it called? What was a new access? Yeah. Which is the United States, China, Russia. You know, I maybe, maybe throw Israel into the mix. Right. So now we just have these like main super powers that merge into one super, super power. That's scary as hell. No war, no world war three, just like a natural. Don't you think that's the next, that's what's going to happen? If, if we don't come to a next, a giant war again, which I do think is going to happen, unfortunately, because I do absolutely. Because look, we're still, we're still competing with all of these powers. Russia and China are not going to go along with the domination and hegemony of the U.S. And so there has to be something that's going to come to a head before we get to that point. What is it? You know, the unipolar world. How does it get just, if you had to, I mean, no one's going to hold it against you if you get this wrong. Yeah, they will. But, but just if you had to put money down. Oh my God. Well, there's a, there's a couple of things that could erupt as we know Korea is one of them. That, that we can go either way on that one. I think the Pakistan-Kajmir border is another one. That's a hotspot. The Ukraine thing could get really heated. But yeah, I mean, those are some hotspots around the world that I think could, could go out of control in terms of like a hot war plus Syria. I mean, look, this is a region that we've been trying to start essentially a war for the last five years. And that's one thing. If Hillary were in office, we would have already had a no fly zone in Syria within the first two months. So it just is offensive when people are like, you know, people who actually worked for Hillary Clinton, thanking Susan Sarandon, like literally being like, thanks Susan Sarandon after Trump bombed Syria. And it's like, wait, did Susan Sarandon bombed Syria? I think fucking Trump bombed Syria. But it's like, Hillary would have been bombing Syria immediately if she got into office. So it's just nuts that people can't accept what a warmongering corporate shill Hillary was. But yeah, no, I think Syria is a huge hotspot. And that's why Obama at least was smart enough to not continue to send weapons to the rebels there. But Trump, unfortunately, because he's trying to acquiesce too much and bend over backwards to people who are like, no, you need to be harder on Russia. He's like doing, he's doing a lot of shit wrong. He's, he authorized a giant $700 billion defense bill. You know, we're $500 million of that is going to build up US aggression and the Baltics to counter Russian aggression. It's like, what does that mean? 500 million more are going to fund neo-Nazis in Ukraine. And the rebels in Syria who, you know, that could be a really slippery slope there. They're neo-Nazis and that's who those people are. There's a lot of neo-Nazis, the, yeah, the Azov battalion and a lot of these people in Ukraine who are total Nazis. You see this every day stories coming out where there's, you know, thousands and thousands of Nazi, Nazi strong marches, actual Nazis who are getting into elected positions there. And yeah, no, no peep from the mainstream media and no peep from Israel, amazingly, you know, as concerned as they claim to be about anti-Semitism and the rise of Nazism. It seems like they're only concerned with this crediting pro-Palestinian activists and they're not, they're not concerned with the rise of Nazism in Poland or Ukraine or here. You know, I don't really see them commenting much on that. It just seems like they really just, I don't know. I find it interesting that when peep, so like they put these signs up and they're like, if you come here, you're going to get shot. And then Israel? Yeah, the Palestinians, people go there and they get shot. And I, to me, if you really want to understand how it must feel to be a Palestinian, understand where your brain would have to be if there was a sign somewhere saying, if you come here, you're going to get shot and you still go there. You're desperate to the point that it's, you don't really care if you die. That's, that's what's going on over there. They don't, when people get to the point where they don't care if they die, this is a conversation that I had about the emulation of the Tibetan monks. Self-emolate, that's the last resort. Like you don't self-emolate if there's like four other things you could try before that. Right. No one's setting themselves on fire and thinking like, well, you know, I could have like written a letter to the someone. They're setting yourself on fire because it's, there's nothing else left to do and you're trying to send a message. So whatever's going on over there in Palestine, one thing you know for sure is they've gotten to the point where they don't care if they get shot. They're willing to get shot. Also, they're using slingshots. And every time they shoot a missile over, which they should, it's fucked. Killing is fucked. Missile scatters all over like a playground. It gets shot down by the iron shield. It's weird how many people immediately start tweeting like, see there's savages. There's savages. Yeah. Is it, can you at least say, well, there's savagery is on both sides. I mean, that's fair to say. Like if you're gunning down people or burning tires, I don't know. Well, really quickly, I think that there's several things to say. It's not a both sides issue. And I used to think that too, Duncan, but there's one side that is being brutally occupied by another. I mean, Israel is a settler colonial state that is installing an apartheid and brutal occupation system. Gaza is different than the West Bank. West Bank is under brutal military occupation from Israeli soldiers. You know, dehumanizing checkpoints, et cetera. But Gaza is Palestine. That is part of Palestine. So there is no border. The border fence, quote unquote, is really a prison fence that is literally encaging two million people into an open air prison. It's a cage. Aren't they building a seawall too around there? They can't even leave. Like if you try to leave as a Palestinian in Gaza, you will be executed. If you're like a fisherman and you go out too far to fish, you will get executed by Israeli soldiers. I've heard they're building a, they're actually wanting to build some kind of seawall out there. Not surprising. So not surprising. So if I'm a Palestinian and I am not a member of Hamas, I was born in Palestine and I want to leave. I'm like, you know what? This isn't the best place to live anymore. I don't like it here. How do I leave? So if you're in the West Bank, you can leave, but a lot of the times you can't travel freely. So it depends on where you're born. If you're born in Gaza, you're born dead. You can't leave. And I know people who've lived in Gaza their whole lives because they can't travel. There's nowhere to go. No. You can't go to, there's not an exit. So wait, I live in the Gaza Strip. Right. And I'm like, you know what? I want to move to Syria. Yeah. No, you can't. Oh my God. I want to move to Syria. It's better there. No, you can't. You can apply for a permit to maybe leave, but you, no, you don't get approved to leave. That's why people are killing themselves. And also to your point about the rockets, Hamas, they call everything in the Gaza Strip a Hamas target just because Hamas is the democratically elected leadership. It's an armed resistance movement. And people would argue, you know, that's legal to have an armed resistance when you're being brutally occupied. But that aside, this latest March of Return where 1,300 people were shot in one day from live ammunition. 500 Palestinians were shot in the head by snipers who were perched up on a fence. I mean, beyond a fence, 100 yards away from these protests, sniping people with sniper scopes, kids in their scope, medics, they shot 19 paramedics and one day they killed one. I mean, there's press, three journalists died, children, seven children were killed in one day. So you, when you're deliberately shooting people who are unarmed, Duncan, these people were unarmed protesters, thousands, 35,000 people were unarmed, protesting they're in prison. These people are protesting the fact that they are caged like animals. 97% of the water is contaminated with sewage. They only get three hours of electricity a day in Gaza. And you can't travel. So if you have cancer, you can't get treatment. You are born dead. And so a lot of these people have no choice but to protest and Hamas stepped back. Hamas didn't have anything to do with these protests. The fact that people are using Hamas as an excuse to execute 100 and 10 people, including kids, press and medics, they're fucking sick. You're a sick person. If you can't see that this is wrong and justifying this massacre by saying that Hamas planned it or staged it, the snipers saw people in their scopes and they decided to pull the trigger. There's only one side doing the killing here. So it makes me sick that people want to blame this on Hamas. And if you were in Gaza, you would understand what these people go through on a daily basis. And you would understand that there's no will to live. You have no dignity for life. You have no life to live. And the fact that they were protesting in mass peacefully and were still gunned down, mowed down by snipers is just beyond the pale, Duncan. And you had no one criticizing it who was in our government other than Bernie Sanders. And even he said, Hamas violence does not excuse this massacre. It's like, what Hamas violence? I didn't see shit. I didn't see one Hamas armed soldier. All I saw were people throwing rocks. And when you throw a rock at a fucking fortified tank, well, I'm sorry, I don't agree that you should be executed. That's insane. What the fuck, man? No one knows this. No. I mean, like, I don't know it. So I have no way to, I trust you. I believe what you're saying. So we've got a part of the world where there are a, how many people are there trapped? 1.8 million. So where 1.8 million people have been enclosed in an open air prison where they're getting power for three hours a day and they can't leave, there's no way out. They're getting gunned down. Is there anything that people can do about this? Like, what is the hope for them? Are they just dead? Is it some kind of very slow, long-term execution by confinement? Yeah, I think there's an ethnic purity that Israel's trying to attain. And that's why you see a lot of alt-right Nazis who love Netanyahu and love Israel, because like Richard Spencer, he was like, this is what we need. We need an ethno-supremacist state to have white people, you know. And Israel really is a white supremacist ethno-national state where they want to expunge and expel all the indigenous population, all the Arabs and all the Palestinians. Not everyone in Israel. All the Palestinians. No, of course not everyone in Israel. It's just the government. The government. But unfortunately, the government, like I think with Trump, I think Trump reflects a lot of the true nature of what America is, and I think that Netanyahu reflects a lot of the true nature of what Israel is. Because again, Israel's a settler-clonial state, even though it started off socialist with the Kibbutzes and a lot of progressive ideals, like having a refuge for Holocaust survivors, it has turned into a kind of a fascistic streak that actually is an inevitability of having a settler-clonial state built on the ethnic cleansing of an indigenous population that it still goes on to this day. Why do we do that? Oh, what do we do? So Palestinians have asked us, Duncan, and this is why, even though there is a left within Israel, it's small. There isn't enough people pushing the government to the left, and there isn't enough people actually calling to end the occupation in apartheid state. And these are a lot of people who are indoctrinated from youth. Like, you're surrounded by people who you are told want to kill you and hate you. Like, I get it to a certain extent. Well, they do. I mean, it is one thing that would be safe to say. If I was living in an open-air prison where my friends have been shot and bombs have been dropped on me, it's not like I'm going to feel great about the people who have been doing that for my entire life. So I think it is fair to say that many Palestinians probably would like to fight back and kill people. And that's why they elected Hamas and Gaza, because they wanted an armed resistance that were fighting the oppressors. I'm saying that just so that the complexity of the situation becomes clear. This is not a group of people who are over there like, oh, God, we only want love and peace. They're fucking pissed off. They get three hours of electricity a day, and they've been getting shot at. Yeah, exactly. And some of them didn't choose that. Some of them helped dig tunnels and did suicide bombs, and it fought back. But it is, we do have two groups of people who really don't like each other, right? That's safe to say. Like, Palestinians don't like the Israelis. The Israelis don't like the Palestinians. And the Israelis are winning. Yes, they have. That's the situation. Yes, yes. And I think that the Palestinians have asked us. You see Natalie Portman, who was essentially an ambassador for Israel, not technically, but she essentially was. She actually boycotted this conference that was going on a couple months ago. And she said, because of recent events in Palestine, I don't feel comfortable going into accepting this award. And they were going to pay her like a million dollars or something. So that was a huge deal. Right. You have people like Adele, who actually said she refuses to play in Israel. You have the electronic duo, The Knife, who has boycotted Israel. And you have Stephen Hawking's. Stephen Hawking boycotted scientific conferences in Israel because he agreed with Palestinians calling for us to have a scientific and artistic and cultural boycott of Israel until they end the occupation and, you know, end this apartheid state. You think that's why he died? They unplugged that. He was taken out. Shut the fuck up. He was taken out. Hawking pulls fucking cords. But that's all we can do. All we can do is support the Palestinian call for BDS, boycott divestment sanctions to support, you know, boycotting Israel until they stop what they're doing. Like, okay, let's say you and I now we're not working for the CIA anymore. Somehow they've made us the the leaders of Israel. Yeah. Now we are. Okay. We're like, all right, we don't want to do this anymore. So what can we do? What actions can we take to tell these? How many millions of people? 1.5 million. 1.8. 1.8. What can we do to tell these 1.8 million people? Hey, guys, we fucked up. We should have shot, right? I know many of you watch your grandparents brains get splattered all over the wall. Sorry about that. Very sorry. You were, you know, sending missiles at us too. We just won. But now we're sorry. So can you please forgive us and not try to get revenge? Right. Well, I think that what's what's unfortunate, Duncan, is it's not like they're just sitting back and being like, well, there's nothing we can do now. Kind of like Guantanamo. It's like, well, what are we going to do? Let these people out and then they want to kill us now. Right. As if that's a reason to continue their occupation. But I think that what's amazing. It is a reason. Is that Israel is continuing to build settlements in what should have been the Palestinian state. Right. So there's, you know, you hear people say we need a two state solution. Unfortunately, whatever state would have existed for Palestine has been overrun by illegal settlements from Israelis and Jewish settlers who moved from Rhode Island or whatever. Fucking move on top of an Arab village and then is getting set up by a guard post and electricity lines and water lines from the Israeli military. Unfortunately, there has been such little respect for Palestinian sovereignty and land that there'd have to be a massive, you know, apology tour. But on top of that, like a rescinding of all these settlements and being like, okay. So I think that first and foremost, stop building settlements because until that until that happens, nothing can really be taken seriously. Everything's just taken with a grain of salt. Whatever Israel says doesn't matter because their actions speak louder than words. So there's no really not what. Stop building settlements. Have one state with equal rights for all. Stop the apartheid. Kill them all. That's what, and that's what they, yeah. Stop building settlements or. Yeah. Drop a nuke or just sort of slowly like squeeze, squeeze down there. And then it just seems like you would let them escape by sea or something. That's what I don't understand. Yeah, they, they, they can't even let them escape. It's like, I can't even think of another refugee like ethnic cleansing in the world that you actually can't leave. That's where it gets confusing. They just wanted them all to die. That's really disturbing. It's the most, you got to back into a corner. Right. You have a recipe for just. And then you act shocked when they send a rocket over, you know, these glorified fireworks. You're like, oh my fucking God, well, of course we need to bomb a UN shelter or a school. It's like, well. Well, I mean, I wouldn't call it glorified fireworks. I saw the rocket that landed that fucking playground. That's real. They definitely want to blow people up. By the way, I'm not saying. No, I know, but they really, I don't. When's the last time a rocket fell on a playground? What, what, what video did you see? Cause I'm actually curious. Cause I. It happened. It happened today. It happened today. Yesterday. Yeah. The rocket flew over. So there was some shelling that happened. A rocket landed. They took pictures of it. They're like, look, it definitely wasn't fireworks. I mean, like, listen, the palace, I'm, I, this is a confusing thing to me. I, and you just helped illustrate what I thought it was. But I, you know, it's, it's hard to talk about this without just sounding like a monster. But if I was living in Palestine, I can't imagine. Look, I have three hours of electricity a day. I don't really care anymore. Like I'm going to do whatever I don't care. Just shoot me. At least I'll die a hero. It'll seem awesome. Oh, maybe I'll get on the news who gives a fuck. All my friends are killed. I've been killed. Everyone knows someone who's died. 1.8 million people. Oh, everyone has a horror story. Everyone has a horror story. Everyone's got PTSD. Everyone's broken. The world doesn't care. Right. We're, we're fucked. So I'm just going to, you know, I don't care. I'm going to fire a fucking rocket. I hope it lands on the playground. This is if I'm like super depressed and angry and have PTSD. But it's so that means, okay. Well, there really isn't a solution outside of decimating them. And then, you know, pretending it never happened. I mean, that's where it gets fucking weird. Well, I mean, I think that we do have hope. We look at South Africa and there was a BDS of South Africa too. It wasn't that white people in South Africa woke up one day and they were like, you know what? We're not going to be racist anymore. There was a, they were forced from the outside to and their apartheid state. And same with Israel. They need to be forced from the international community to end apartheid. So provide equal laws and equal rights for everyone living within Israel and Palestine. Right. But right now that's not the way it is. And the brutal occupation. This is an illegal thing under international law as well. All of this is illegal. So I think that I don't think that, you know, the fact that Palestinians, a lot of them are upset and will hold resentment toward Israelis is enough to continue to imprison them and brutalize them on a daily basis. I think that we should all be adults and say this is, this is really fucked up and wrong. And it's better now than never to stop it. Well, I hope that we have peace. I don't know. That whole, it's just the most confusing thing. And no matter what I say, you just end up sounding like a fucking lazy piece of shit. Oh, I hope there's peace. Thanks for doing my show. Let me do a quick square space commercial. Yeah, I'm just kidding. You know, it's like you, you really do feel incredibly impotent over here. I know, I know, and I guess that's it. Like, well, all right, I guess I just won't do any podcasts in Israel. But the truth is I would, I would fly to Israel and do podcast. I wouldn't, I would, I do want to go there. I want to see it. I think just go to West Bank too. Don't just go to Israel because a lot of people just go there and then they're like, you're fucking crazy. It's like, well, did you go to the West Bank and actually talk to Palestinians too? Right. And I think that's saying, you know, they're all going to go and kill them and stuff like the West Bank, you can travel around and they're, you know, they are under brutal occupation, but there's still like, they've largely practiced non-violence. Like, I mean, yeah, there's, there's reports of like people being stabbed every now and again, but like for the most part, the fact that Palestinians are largely non-violent, living under the situation that they're in, I think says a lot. Do they, is there, who's their main spokesperson? Do they, are there any voices coming out of Palestine? There's a lot, but that's the, another problem is that they pretend like this guy Mahmoud Abbas, who is the Palestinian authorities president, is like their leader, but it's really a puppet government to pretend like Palestinians have sovereignty. So it's what Israel likes to use to pretend like, look, Palestinians have their own state and their own leadership. No, it's a puppet government that is essentially in the pocket of, of the Israeli government and the, and Abbas will do whatever Israel says. So it's not, they're not sovereign, they're not independent. I mean, we're talking about people in the West Bank that can't even hold up a flag. That's the occupation. You can't be a part of a political party. You can't raise a flag. They don't have guns, no weapons. You can't raise a flag. No, you can't, you can't raise a flag. What happens if you raise a flag? It's against the law. I, we, we met two people who were shot for putting up a flag in their hilltop in this town called Sebastia. They were in the hospital because they were almost killed by Israeli forces for putting a flag on a hilltop. So yeah, that, that's the state of how crazy it is there. Dizzying. Yeah, it is. It makes me feel like I'm having an anxiety. I know, I know. And that's what's so dizzying about seeing the reports coming out from the media saying people died in clashes, Palestine, and painting it as if it's just this conflict that we, you know, we know that, you know, we know that the reality is a little bit different than that. They do say that. They say they died. People died. Palestinians died. Yeah, they all died of murder. Yeah, they died of murder. They died from sniper fire and shots. You got me fired up today, Abby.

17^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 446: Jeremy Corbell Transcript and Discussion^2021-06-19^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. It's not a brief story, but it goes back to 1953 when a CIA involved investigation was held. As a result of the extremely heavy wave of sightings in 1952, the CIA and Air Force became so concerned over the sheer number of reports that were tying up Air American intelligence channels that they wanted to get this signal out of the system, ask the Air Force, the CIA asked the Air Force for a debunking policy. The literal wording was to debunk the flying saucers to decrease public interest in the UFOs. Regulations were promulgated very shortly that made it a crime punishable with I think it's $10,000 fine and or 10 years in prison to release any information at air base level on UFOs. And as a result of that and the sequence of steady downgrading, the whole problem has been essentially lost from scientific sight in the US and nothing resembling any scientific investigation has been going on in the past 15 years. Has this been typical of the attitude of most world governments? As nearly as I can tell, yes. There seems to be quite surprising similarity between the official Russian, British, Australian, Canadian, American, French, Italian announcements. They all seem to take the view that there's nothing to it. There's a lot of nonsense that people see things and that it is not a real scientific problem at all and I most hardly disagree with that. We have in the UFO problem a very strange situation here for 20 years plus. Essentially similar phenomena have been reported all over the world, large numbers in the US, official den ignoring them, Air Force is ignoring them and yet apparently a steady increase in the numbers of reliable reports from people in all walks of life seeing these objects that are not products of our technology, they're not meteorological astronomical phenomena, hovering at low altitude, increasing numbers in urban areas and collectively we don't know what's going on. That's an extremely unwise situation no matter how you view it. We do not know what is involved in this problem. There are no strong indications of anything resembling hostility. I see some faint indications of hazard and danger, but in general to have this possibility that the world is under something resembling reconnaissance, possibly from some extraterrestrial source, and to go on about our many ways collectively doesn't seem to be a wise situation. So I'm trying to get scientists and governmental agencies to take a look at this at a highly accelerated pace. Greetings my loves. I am so excited to share this episode with you. Today's guest is Jeremy Corbell and that clip you just heard is from his Instagram. It's physicist James Edward McDonald and Jeremy writes that what he's saying here back in the 1960s is prophetic and more relevant now than ever. Just listen to what he says when he talks about our government looking into the UFO mystery and the lack of communication with the American people. There is no sensible alternative to the utterly shocking hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial probes. Look, I don't know what UFOs are after having a chat with Jeremy. I'm going to lean in the direction of extraterrestrial probes, but right now we don't know. But one thing we do know is suddenly people who you would never dream of talking about things like UFOs are going public about it, including President Barack Obama. Listen to this. The truth is that when I came into office I asked, right? I was like, is there the lab somewhere where we're keeping the alien specimens in station? And they did a little bit of research and the answer was no. But what is true, and I'm actually being serious here, is that there's footage and records of objects in the skies that we don't know exactly what they are. Their trajectory, they did not have an easily explainable pattern. That's from the James Corden show, and obviously you can watch the full clip on YouTube. And thank you Reggie Watts, James Corden, for asking Obama that question. But it's not just Obama, all of a sudden every major news network has been doing stories on these things, and a lot of the time these stories involve Jeremy Corbell. It's on, as we await for a new government report from the U.S. Senate on these mysterious sightings, Jeremy Corbell is an investigative filmmaker. The UFO footage was leaked to a filmmaker called Jeremy Corbell. So Jeremy, help give a little context to this. Why is it actually a pretty big deal that the government and the Department of Defense seemingly can't explain what these objects are but are finally willing to talk about them? I don't think I've ever been more proud of a friend. And I've never felt so cool that when I started getting texts from Jeremy showing me some of the videos that ended up on the news. I just naturally assumed, oh he's probably, I don't know, in the CIA or something, how else would he have this footage? And I know a lot of my conspiracy friends have speculated, or had other sorts of speculation regarding what this footage might be. Some people think it's a distraction. Some people think it's something called Project Bluebeam, some kind of Psyops or something like that. And late at night when I'm laying in bed because I thought it'd be smart to eat a slice of peanut butter, chocolate, cake, and drink. Two of these incredible Moscow mules at a restaurant that I've grown to love. Only because of the Moscow mules which are actually mixed with apples and cinnamon. Yeah, sometimes my mind would veer in the cynical, skeptical direction of thinking, well these fucking things are probably just a hoax, a Psyops. But surely, surely I can't be so lucky that I would incarnate during a time period in human history where we would actually make contact with visitors from other worlds or places or dimensions. Surely it couldn't be that. And you know what? Just because of my general cynicism or skepticism, I'm prepared to be disappointed. Anyway, the point is, during this conversation with Jeremy, I tried to ask him a few of the questions that I saw popping up and some message boards by skeptics and cynics, and I was overjoyed by his response. He's a brilliant person who I am proud to call my friend. We're going to jump right into this conversation with Jeremy Corbell, but first, this.

Welcome to the DTFH, Jeremy Corbell. Help me with this. Can you kind of map out how, like, how, what happened that suddenly you, and I, that suddenly you are on, like, I'm, you know, I'm watching Fox, you're on Tucker Carlson, you're on CNN, you're on everything. And the reason you're on these shows is because it seems like a variety of people have entrusted you with footage that has then been confirmed by the Pentagon. So as I'm, like, you know, we text all the time, but as I'm watching, I am thinking naturally, like, is he in the CIA? Is he some kind of, is he, like, loosely associated with some government agency that has decided it's time to start dispensing this information to the world? And I don't think that, I'm not saying that is a bad thing. I'm just saying, you know, why, you know, and I know in an interview with Russell Brandy, he asked you this question. I think you've been asked this question a few times, but just for folks who maybe haven't watched all your stuff. I want to address that question first, which is why are you in some way loosely associated with some kind of federal agencies? And again, I want to really reiterate, I don't think that's a bad thing. NASA is a fucking federal agency. But if you're not, why have you become one of the main conduits through which this potentially culture shifting video is coming through? Okay, so have patience with me. I don't have a lot of sleep, but this is such an important starting and jump off point. And I thank you for asking it because I really think if we mystify things, then we don't understand their power. We can dismiss them, right? You can dehumanize the messenger and you can dismiss the message. And that's the last thing I want. Right. Total complete transparency with this is kind of what's important. I am sleep deprived. As you said, I've been on all these shows. This is a tactical planned thing to get this message out now. I've been sitting on stuff for a long time and I still am, but I'm going to get it out. But have patience with me because my brain, it's just, man, I'm just, you told me like when you were going through something like this, it's like you have to learn to manage this moment. So that's what I'm trying to do. So have patience with me and let me just explain and hopefully I explain it further or properly. Okay, great. So straight up, no, I have never signed an NDA. I have never been employed by any military or federal agency. I'm under zero restrictions. I don't not only do it, I'm not going to get a paycheck from anybody. I guard myself from more attempts to manipulate or guide and control my narrative. Right. Right. Then people understand like big time. I do like big time. Right. For years until I've vetted, confirmed, vetted, confirmed, make sure I'm not being used as instrument as a marionette for anybody. I am 100% what you see is what you get completely independent, being completely honest to the best of my knowledge at any given time. Yes. Right. So to just smash that, I do not work for the CIA. I've never worked for any federal agency. I've never participated. I keep a degree of separation from anybody that comes to me. So with that said, I'm going to demystify everything for you. So why you're, you're seeing this man is because I have become a touchstone for people that don't have an outlet through normal channels in the military to convey something that has been world shaking, altering things that by the way, like maybe they shouldn't have had a burner phone inside of a secret Iraqi unacknowledged military base that is completely unacknowledged by the world governments. Yet they knew this was big yet they had a burner phone yet they filmed shit. You know, so it's like, it's no secret that the stuff that I'm putting out is contained within classified briefings. I don't have clearance. People that film screens inside of skiffs. I mean, it's not one deep throat person. Right. This is 10 years of my work. Right. This is people trusting me not to burn them to the point where they would go to jail, but they shouldn't be going to jail. You know, the thing is, is I'm not leaking anything. I'm obtaining and releasing it. Yes, sure. People leak stuff to me. But the reason that's happening is because the methodology of reporting the ridicule factor. Who do you tell people are so frustrated? So they take extreme measures to get me information and it's a dance that I play. People think it's so easy. I wave a magic wand. Man, I have the part how you how you can share secrets with the world is you need to keep more than you can share. That's just a fact of the matter. So from Commander David Fraver, who chased a UFO for the United States military and I kept this secret for like five years more than that. Prior to him, the world knowing about it. And I warned him. I warned him this was going to come out not through my hand. Right. Yeah. But from, from military people, I've only been assisted. I've never been resisted. It's like, I'm not, no one's ever saying people have federal agencies have come to my house, but it's never like, it's never like, stop. It's like, why are my videos being confirmed by the Pentagon in record breaking time? It's because I do with my mentor in journalism, George Knapp. We do good work. We inform to make sure there is no classified information that is going to hurt the American public. Gotcha. Or our defense system. So I'm able to provide stuff and say, and not always, not always before, because some of it I know, but I'm like, look, I'm putting this out. Do respect. I obtain these legally. There's nothing classified about it that I know. Tell me otherwise. Right. I'm putting this out. So that's how they can confirm it. Now, I ran into two problems. One is that there was a leak at the Pentagon and I was forced to put out some radar footage faster than I wanted to because I'm just one guy. I get so fucking tired, man. I can't like do interviews all day long. I mean, I have normal jobs, man. I manage apartments and stuff. That's my jobs, right? Yeah. Movies is cool. It's like extra. But like, I was forced to put stuff out with George Knapp a little faster. So now I'm really kind of cautious. Like I'm like, I'm putting something out. But like, so the last thing I just want to say is the weird thing, it's hard to accept, but it's true. Some of these things, as they go up the chain of command, I've actually had more information than the Pentagon. What? I bow in the direction of whatever beautiful outchemical laboratory.

I've actually had more information than the Pentagon. What? Right. Because think about it. You've got individuals that come to me with full sets of data. Like I don't know what to do. Put it up through the chain of command. I get it. It got completely covered and buried. I'm frustrated. I'll be in trouble for saying for reporting this even. Right. What do we do? So, so I was able to provide the Pentagon with George nap. Just huge sets of visual data that they didn't have, which are now included in these UAP investigations. It's so backwards and they were so like pissed at first because it was like their system broke down. This shouldn't have never gone outside of school. This shouldn't have been within their systems. But because that's not there, that's not in place. I'm now kind of trying to encourage that they do better reporting systems and obviously you're seeing it. So, so why now? Why now? I have footage. It's going to drive people crazy, but I have footage that is as definitive as it, as it gets. And I'm looking to try to see the legality of some of it. I want to make sure that sources multiple, many, many, many, many, every day hundreds of emails come in that nobody gets hurt. That there's a process where someone could say, I captured something probably wasn't a smart idea the way I did it. But I don't, I want to have impunity. You need this data. So I'm trying to work on finding that methodology. Right. Before they have a system in place where I can make sure people have total impunity to like any retribution because of it. I have such great imagery that I'm being very careful of. I'm being very careful to educate the public along the way. The sources don't get burned because one source gets burned and I'm done. It's done. I'm wrong about one thing. I'm done. Right. So I'm so methodical. Because people in the UFO community, some people, I mean, I, you know, I follow it closely, more closely now because of your work. People in the UFO community, they, they, they, they, they, some people get mad. They look at every, and then you should, I get it. They look at every inch of the footage, the plunge video of the thing dropping in. I watched some analysis. I'm sorry. I can't remember the ufologist's name, but he was pointing out the time code was broken and like, you know, I think he was like, that's not broken. That, that's incorrect. But yeah. Oh, so that was incorrect. I did, you know, I know you. I think like what ends up happening is, you know, just what you're saying, people who don't know you or don't, don't understand you. Right. Like more friends. And why should they trust me? Right. And so there's always going to be that, that sense. But I think one thing that I'd love to hear you, like, emphasize that maybe people don't understand is that if your job is flying fighter jets, for the Navy, that's what you like to do. And to get that fucking job, it's not like you just like, it's not like going to the DMV. Like if they're letting you sit in those insane machines and fly them, then you're being honored and you're given this incredible responsibility. And it must be the most insane feeling in the world to do that. And so the last thing you want to have to deal with is seeing a fucking UFO. Because now, and I can't remember again, I'm sorry, I wish I'd written their names down. I can't remember her name, but she was saying, I don't, I was thinking about not reporting it. Alex Dietrich. Alex Dietrich. She's like, I didn't want to say anything about it because she didn't want to lose her job. Because, you know, they, they hold, they hold them to such rigorous standards, like anything that seems like the cognition slipping. Go ahead. Sorry. In 2004, you could lose your wings if they think you're not wrapped so tight. Yeah. So none of them, all of them wish other people had been in the planes. Commander Fravor at this point, Dietrich, even, you know, Commander Underwood who filmed it, who filmed the tic-tac UFO. And you're right, Duncan, like, now think about this, dude, how hard is it for some tattooed bearded UFO maniac to talk with people like this? Why are they going to pick up? Why are they going to tell me their secrets? Why are they going to risk everything for what, for what I want? So, so it's, it's, it's always been this weird uphill battle. Remember this time I was sitting in the Annapolis Naval Academy, which is like the most prestigious, you know, how did, how did I even get in? I know somebody there who's, who's high up, who like allowed me in because of my passion to sit in on aerospace classes to talk about UFOs. It was crazy, man. So I'm just saying people take huge risks in talking to me and emailing me active deployment people. And also, I really thank the people that trust me. I've never broken trust. I will never. I will never. And I really got, you have to understand that leap of faith people take and walk in with me, man. But the thing is, is their trust is well, is well placed. So first of all, did I answer your first question? Yes. Thank you. Perfectly. Yeah. I wouldn't care. I wouldn't care if you did. I think other people out there have like a deeper, I used to have the government paranoia thing because I was chomping ass all the time. And I just decided it was like black and white, you know, like if you're in the government, you're naturally evil. Then I was talking to Richard Doblin, who, who Rick Doblin who runs maps. And he was like explaining me and now other of my friends who are in the, who are helping facilitate getting MDMA prescribable. They've told me like, no, the people in the government, there's a lot of like actual really good people who want like who are like us who got in there because they want the world. It's not all like people who are like, you know, evil monster is trying to disrupt other countries, believe it or not. And if it were, it'd be a lot easier, I guess that's maybe even more confusing. So I would like, but yeah, I get that. I think what you're saying makes way more sense actually, which is just to summarize, there isn't right there. It's getting there, but right now there isn't a built in way for people who encounter things like UFOs to, to report them or without potentially wrecking their career. And it's so much, it's so much broader than that too. And that the reason why we're getting all of this kind of information that's undeniable like is because look, I released for the first time in modern history. I've got radar data that corroborates FLIR forward looking infrared, which is thermal. I'm going to be dropping another form of data that also corroborates that whole series. The moment that the report drops, I'm going to be releasing something else. It's not my favorite piece of data visually, but it corroborates the whole thing. What you're talking about with the government, like look, the government's a big thing. Massive. Anybody can be in the government. Like it's normal people with the same interests, the same dreams, aspirations, hopes, but people understand there's a process for security. Right. Don't talk out of school typically, but as we know with government, when government impedes you from something so huge as these mind shaking, faith altering things that you see some, some things are bigger than the government. And government is supposed to be representative government in the United States. If we want to know, we pay for it. We should know you're flying that plane because of your dollars and my dollars and we pay taxes. So they feel a sense of responsibility, but no one wants to crack the egg. No one wants to be the cook. No one wants to not be able to get employment after because they were stripped of the security clearances. You don't talk out of school typically, right? Right. So just to, just to do one more piece to this puzzle. Now, I will tell you, I have been approached, you know, by agencies that would love to control to some degree. The narrative, right? Which I understand it's like damage control because they've been lying, you know, for 70 plus years about this. I get that. That is not seductive to me. I have always said, Hey, look, it's really good that people are coming forward that you want to engage the narrative, but you can't control it in the way you're thinking. So I just want to be fully straight up honest with you. There have been, you know, I have been, people have approached me, you know, from agencies just asking like, there's an investigation into my sources. There's all sorts of stuff, right? Yeah. And also there are foreign countries and to be transparent. Oh, shit. I never thought of that. Whoa. Yeah. Yeah. So check this out. I'm not going to name what it was, but imagine this, like you get, you know, 50 on camera interview requests a day and you're kind of sorting through trying to say, you know, which ones are going to have the most impact so I can do five and not 50. Right. So then you're like, Oh, that's another country. That would be good. It's a, it's a global thing. Then you do like a, it was an interrogation for like an hour. And then I realized that the media in that country is all state run. It never aired their first question. The first question is, who are your sources? Wow. So it's like, I am dealing with that too. You know, I'm dealing with such a mind fuck, man. It's a total, total mind fuck. Whoa. You know, so it's like, and you know, people on our side, if they're, if you're going to say sides, you know, they'd be disappointed if I, if I, um, revealed anything that I do know accidentally to an adversarial nation. So I have to walk this thin line of being, I'm a journalist. Right. Oh, whatever I am. I don't know. I'm, I don't know what I'm a filmmaker, you know, but like, You're a journalist. You do really good work. Okay. I found my way. I'm breaking stories. Right. I found my way into this place where I need to like learn how to operate in this field, this quagmire, this briar patch of international high level interest where there's many different pieces on the chess board with different agendas to stay true to myself, to stay true to the audience and to always maintain the integrity of the work I'm doing. And if you know me, Duncan, right, you know me, you, you come over to my house. I'll show you everything on the longer videos. I'll show you everything. It's not what I can put out, but as a friend, you know me, like I'm not editing anything. I'm not changing anything. I'm just trying to be responsible with the pressures on me to make sure that the American public and global public get this information in a way that's, that's useful. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I get it, man. You know, it's the reality is we live in the United States and I'm sorry, but if I have to choose who has this technology, it's us. I'm sorry. Like I don't mean to be like us and them thing, but if I'm picking, so I get like, and I, so I do, I do understand to some degree why, why they, if I could think of every single reason to not. Tell the planet that you know anything about this, I could see a million reasons to do the whole cannot confirm or deny because on one side, you're either admitting like we've been lying to you all this time and maybe the reasons are good, but we've been lying to you and they're, and then that's going to make people be like, what the fuck can we trust you about, but then on the other side, it's almost worse when you say we have no idea what these fucking things are.

And I'm like, wow, there are unknown vehicles of unknown origin that are highly, highly advanced technologically. They can outpace, outmaneuver and outperform. Any of our greatest warships fighter planes are greatest technology. They can shut down our nukes. They're filmed because of FLIR and the nature of forward looking infrared and how good it's getting and prolific. It's becoming through our society. We're seeing these more and more or there's an increase in frequency. We're like, holy shit, like let's exploit the technology. Let's make sure that it's not a foreign nation. Let's figure out what's going on. Can we have a technological advantage, a warfare advantage so we can protect our populations. That's what was going on since, you know, the moment we had aviation, like we've been trying to figure this out. So I understand, I understand that the concept of secrecy for technology and national defense. However, our government works for us. This is representative government. There's one thing to say we're working on something for the national good. There's another thing to say we've been actively denying, dismissing, ridiculing, lying, compartmentalizing, store housing and obfuscating the truth about a much larger existential issue for humankind because we know it's right. And you just sit back and don't ask questions. And that's bullshit. That's bullshit. And now we have collectively, as a public, American and global public, we have forced the issue. And that's why you're seeing, and that's why George Nappen are coming forward with this stuff now is to really, I'm only putting out videos that I know the Pentagon will confirm. And I'm doing it to influence policy, to influence the narrative and to get some semblance of UFO transparency. It's so obvious. And now people don't want to seem dumb. They don't want to seem out of the loop. They don't want to be on the wrong side of history. There's been a sea change. So now people are like, it's like their own idea. I'm going to fight for you. It's going to be on the next national ticket. The UFO topic. They're going to tell us in the report, these are not our black projects. Fucking duh. I mean, fucking duh. This stuff has been around before a modern aviation. So with that said, I understand secrecy to a degree. We are past that. The basics now need to be confirmed to the American public by the American government. And if they don't do it, I am going to force the issue with George Nappen. We are and others too. We're going to force the issue. So they're going to do it. Come hell or high water. Yeah. That is great. That is so cool, man. You know, my, here's my paranoid assumption with, with, with it. Because, you know, when you are looking at all this stuff and you, you, you, well, what I try to do is like, just go to what is 100% verifiable, 100% verifiable. We've got Barack Obama telling Reggie Watts that, yeah, there are these things out there. We've got like all of these, like, you know, George W. Bush recently, you know, we have like, They showed him, they showed him my footage and asked him what, what he thought of it. That was so surreal for me. I'm sitting there watching these. They're looking at the green pyramid. I'm like, whoa, that must have been so bizarre, man. But what I'm assuming is not, oh, they're doing it. Like suddenly there's like, from all these various angles, there is what appears to be a very light confirmation that at the very least we, there is something that we don't understand. But my, my assumption is that is coming from the government because they have some reason for doing that. It isn't that the reason they're doing that is they're trying to play catch up because they already know the dam's breaking and this information is coming out no matter what. And they, they want, they don't want to seem like they're, they're trying to do as much damage control as they possibly can because they're, they already know no matter what a lot of people are going to, you know, they're, they're, they're going to confront them saying, look, it wasn't just that you hid this information, like you ruin my life. Like a lot of people's lives have been intentionally ruined. Yeah. Yeah. Because of the encounters with these things and the subsequent. The implications, you know, that they have in their own minds, you know, but yeah, but what you said, let's, let's nail in on this. The government is playing catch up with certain people because here's the deal. It is so compartmentalized that there's two sides to the coin of intelligence and what you're allowed to know within a military environment. So one is, do you have clearance? Right? Do you have the right clearance? And the other is, do you have a need to know? Now, now who decides that? We know many presidents have tried to get to the bottom of the UFO issue and tried to the public. Yeah. One very famous one is, you know, a president, Bill Clinton, where he was working with Lawrence Rockefeller and they were trying to force the issue. President Clinton asked for the information. Now you think president will get a briefing on anything? Not true. I know some of the people that do the briefings on this. I know which some presidents didn't get the information even when they asked. So here's, here's the question. Who controls it? The president obviously should have the clearance for just about anything. Yes. But does the president have a need to know what, well, who decides that? So there are people playing catch up. Like they feel like they've got egg on their face. So the Senate Intelligence Committee has egg on the face. They're like, what the fuck? Like we're going to talk to CIA, FBI, every single intelligence agency that you've never heard of, by the way, a lot of them, right? And they're, they're trying to get information in a short amount of time for something that has spanned decades and decades. And look, a lot of this is in private industry. And that's a shielding. It's like how super wealthy people have an offshore account that can't be touched by the federal government. The federal government uses private industry to shield it from FOIA, a Freedom of Information Act request. So private industry, like Lockheed Martin, has materials from UFOs, hardware, but they are shielded by the FOIA, but that's by design. Wait, you just said Lockheed Martin has a UFO. So are you speculating there? Okay. So here's where I'm going to tell you specifically. So I didn't say this. Senator Harry Reid has said this, who is the guy that started off at the UFO government program that we've all heard of, right? He identified Lockheed Martin as one of the companies that he has been told for decades has material. I can confirm for you personally that they do. Now I didn't say a whole spaceship, a whole craft. However, I will caveat this with numerous private industry companies have pieces of technology, hardware. However, we do have full craft. We do. We've been exploiting these technologies for decades, trying to reverse engineer with modern earth materials. Our limiting factor is the material science. The way the atoms are perfectly atomically layered, which create meta materials, which are like the sheaths and the skin of the, the way these things are built, we can't do it. So today, not 20 years ago, not 40 years ago, maybe in a hundred years, a thousand years, but even if we can replicate the meta materials where it's perfect atomic layering with the orientation of differential, the atoms are so perfect that they have unique properties and to bring it down to earth for you. Imagine this. Graphene is a meta material. How they figured it out was they took scotch tape, they put it on like pencil lead graphite basically. Yeah. And when they lifted it up, it's these perfect hexagonal shaped atomic layers of 100% oriented perfect graphite. Now I have two pieces of graphing, like you come to my house, I'll, I'll show you. They're super conductors. Their pieces, you can write with them like you could a piece of lead, but they're atomically layered perfectly. Now I've got one that is a five degree orientation, which is from Russia. And then I've got one that's a one degree orientation or three degrees, a little bit better. And that's from China. These are used in like different types of weapon systems, but they're little pieces of just material. But the difference is one of them, I push into an ice cube and the heat transfers from my finger and it's like a hot knife through butter, but you're just holding a piece of it's, it's the weirdest feeling in the world. This shows you, this shows you what material science, why it's important. Yeah. So I take this five degree orientation differential one and I push it into an ice cube and it stops midway. But if I take the one from China that's at three degree or one degree orientation, I'm not sure it goes straight through the ice cube before it gets ice cold and stops penetrating. And the reason is it trance, it's a super conductor transfers the heat from my body into this material. So what I'm saying is this, what I'm saying is this. So weird. It is so weird, but this is so important materials, the way they're made. They're called meta materials. They don't exist naturally in the universe, but we create them. The better we get at that, the more we realize these materials have unique properties that don't exist in nature from, from electric disbursement to thermal fluxing where it heats up and expands or contracts. Like there's just an article last week about how they got a material that doesn't expand with heat now. And that's so important. Like when you're bringing in a craft, like one of our shuttles, it heats up so much. We have so many damage problems because of the heat. So these meta materials are the future. Once we can learn to atomically print, we can, in a zero gravity environment, you're going to have perfectly sphere atomic structures, perfectly oriented. That's the level of technology that we are seeing that we have possession of in these craft from another technologically advanced civilization, wherever they come from, either from other star systems or if it's like ultra terrestrial, meaning they've been here the whole time and we're just starting to kind of meet them. So Yeah, ultra terrestrial, extra terrestrial, extra temporal, extra dimensional. And my favorite, which I kind of came up with because I'm going to be doing something about this called techno terrestrials. It's this philosophy of what I think might be happening. But anyway, here's the point. Wait, I'm sorry to stop you on the techno terrestrials. Do you mean like a byproduct of what's happening with AI? Like they're sort of being, they're, they're coming out of the quantum computers or something they're like, and it's like AI has already gotten out of the, out of the lab, so to speak. And this is the way it's expressing itself. I'm going to probably kind of write this into a paper so people understand what I'm saying. But what I see evidence of is a mechanical intelligence that has bypassed the physical form as we know it, although you should be able to print flesh in the future because we can do it now. Yeah, we can print organs now. So, so imagine that these cybernetic organisms are really biological machines that operate off of a hive hyperintelligence. We're going really weird here, Duncan, but I think you can do that. Okay. So a hyperintelligence based on an artificial, you could say artificial, but a collective intelligence that is being dictated to this hive mind of cybernetic beings that are then using scout ships and kind of assessing the growth, the technological growth of the human species in the farthest realms of reality as if maybe we were embedded here in order to develop technology so we can become a beacon for a much larger global galactic community. We are useful to the interconnectivity technologically of the advancement of our own galaxy or and beyond. Like that's just a fun theory. I'm going to say this is like me just like tripping out fun. I'm going to define it later, but I call it techno terrestrial. There's a new term that I came up with to describe what I think might be happening, but I'm not one for speculation right now. I'm just going deep into let's admit we have hardware. Let's admit UFOs are real. Let's admit that they've been with us since the beginning of recording human history. Let's admit that they are machines that are technologically advanced. Let's admit that they made them. Somebody made them that there must be factories that produce them, that it comes from an archive of intelligence that we don't have access to a physics and understanding. And then let's finally try to decide, can we understand where these are coming from? And then can we decide why? Why are they here? And by the way, I asked so funny, our buddy Joe, like I was like tripping out to him. I was like, I was just talking to them as like, man, I just don't get why so many of these things are here. We can send one probe up and we can map the moon in its complete entirety. Why has it been consistent interaction on a daily basis for hundreds of years? Not thousands. And he just said the smartest thing. And that's what I love talking to them about. He blows my mind sometimes. He goes, maybe it's not hard to get here. Maybe it's fucking easy. I was like, oh, yeah, that's the most logical. Funny. That's so well, so empty. He just cut right with a samurai sword through the bullshit. I was spouting and was like, yeah, maybe it's fucking easy, Jeremy. You know, look, let me get really. Let me get weird back at you. Because like I want one thing that I do like to do is. Read Bible verses, but from the perspective of their like transmissions from aliens. It's so fun to do. And it really does. It really does change them. Is there like a website for this? Where do you find Bible transmissions from aliens? Is there any Bible? Listen, OK, so think in terms of like what you just said about, you know, which is essentially some version of. Directed panspermia, I think is what Craig called it. So you're right. That's it. But if so, if you look at the parable of the sewer, Matthew 13, not as, you know, Jesus talking about like the message of Christianity. But if you look at it as a galactic civilization, communicating that, you know, they go out and try to seed planets in the hopes that they'll produce something worthwhile. Listen to this, just from that perspective. A farmer went out to sow a seed as he was scattering the seed. Some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up. Some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil. It spring up quickly because the soil is shallow. But when the sun came up, the plants were scorched and withered because they had no root, other seed fell among thorns, which grew up and choked the plants, still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop 160 or 30 times what was sown. Whoever has ears, let them hear. Wow. You know what I'm saying? Like that is like if you if you think of that coming from this directed panspermia, yeah, saying, look, we we we put the we seed the universe. And most of the time it doesn't work out. But sometimes not only does it work out, it exponentially increases. It produces things we couldn't even fathom. And it fits into one of the theories of what's going on. And what you were saying is like, you know, when this was one of the inspirations for the Midnight Gospel is why would you want to simulate a universe? Well, you'd want to simulate a universe. So it would produce novelty artifacts that you could then bring into your world and do whatever you want with them. So it's like, you know, one of all you could do is do maybes right now. But these things are showing up. And maybe the reason they're showing up is the same reason farmers show up when it's time to start harvesting a crop. Well, so let's let's talk about that. Um, it is accurate to say that there has been an increase in frequency of UFO encounters recently, very recent. Yeah. Now, there's two ways to look at that. It's like, once you learn a new word, you hear it everywhere. Have you ever had that experience? Yes. Okay. So are we actually seeing an increase in frequency, which would mean something different than if we're not, right? Now we have better sensor systems, better reporting is starting to come in. You've got more leaks because people are frustrated, but both military with their better systems, but this is the kind of defining moment. There's an increase in, in just civilian encounters and sightings. This is verifiable fact as far as reporting of it. Now you could then go back and blame it on like COVID and more people are at home and looking up at, I don't know. So it's, it's hard to determine, but it appears to me that there is an increased frequency of UFO encounters. There's like waves. And this has happened in history, like in 1952, so much UFO activity, the national press, there was, there were congressional briefings about UFOs. People don't know that there were back in the sixties. Okay. So we're seeing an increase. Now, is this a wave that we've experienced before? I will tell you this. Anybody in the military that deals with sensitive nuclear installations and that sort of thing, if they were able to talk with me, they would tell me that there has been an increase in observation of the nuclear arsenals ever since the advent of the nuclear bomb, meaning that as we develop the tech and as we make it more weaponized, there's been an increase in frequency going all along of observation and intervention. So what we're talking about is machines from unknown origin coming over and shutting down nuclear weapons. This happened in China, Russia, the US, France and other countries. That's all documented. I can show you evidence for that. People have testified to that. So here's my question is like they suspect the fact that we have the ability to just completely destroy our planet with a single boom. Now, is that of interest to people that have an investment that have been cultivating the human experience? You know, if that's what's going on, I would say, yeah, I would, I would care. I would care for sure. Not like little wars or even pandemics, but like earth be gone kind of thing. I would say that there would be an interest. Now, I'll say one other thing about that, which is that I would find it highly interesting if the military is such a big word, if factions of our military were aware of this presence increasing and tried to see if they could in order to scientifically study UFOs, do something which would then provoke a response of contact. Yeah. And if that's like baiting UFOs, yeah, so you can study them. I would say I would suspect that if that was done numerous times, then it was it was successful every time. Wow. So if that is true, if my theory, my thought about that, that I'm trying to convey, if that's true, then we do know that there is interest in this nuclear capability that human beings have. And my, I suspect that you would protect something that is valuable to you. Yes. Maybe the human experience for good or for bad. I don't know. Maybe it's valuable to these visitors. Maybe they live here and they just don't want us to blow up the planet. Yeah. I suspect they're coming from other places just because of the design of their machines and that we're valuable to them in some way. And you know, yeah. And also, because it's like, you know, you take, you take the two big possibilities. Assuming that this isn't a project, Bluebeam, Psyops, whatever, who knows. I wish I could, it's not just push it off the table. I'm just saying, assume it. So that leaves two, as far as I could, as I could think, there's two big possibilities that we're dealing with. State-sponsored military technology that, as they say, is leapfrogged. And, you know, it's similar to when we were developing, you know, when we were beginning to learn how to split the atom, somebody else or us or whatever. OK, so push that off the table. So now, assuming that this is another intelligence that is what you ultra terrestrial or extraterrestrial, extraterrestrial and hyperdimensional or whatever that is, then from you can kind of start gleaning a little bit about them from what they don't do. You know, what don't they do? They don't stop wars. They don't stop hunger. They don't stop disasters. They don't stop COVID. So they're letting this that they're letting them the thing run. It's run. So clearly, either the reason they're doing that is because, well, they don't have the ability to do it. But looking at these fucking crap, it wouldn't be that hard to stop any manner of, like, you know, conflict happening around the planet. They could turn off fucking nuclear missiles. If they could turn off nuclear missiles, they could turn off everything if they wanted to. But so there's a seemingly a hands off, a hands off. And that implies a kind of morality, because the other thing is they're not as of yet. And again, you know, we are dealing with maybe a different perception of time or a different, you know, definition of domination, but at least from the human, the generally accepted idea of what it looks like to be like conquered or dominated or crushed or suppressed or have your resources drained or whatever it's the humans are doing that to each other. These things don't seem to be doing that either. So there's a kind of hands off. It seems like there's a rule not to fuck with civilization. It's called a prime directive in Star Trek from what I know. It seems like the prime directive. We non interference to a degree to a degree. Now the question is, is that what's happening? Or is it more along the lines of like, look, we don't, yeah, we are here and we're talking to governments. And the first thing we say to them is you can't say anything about this. It's if you want the technology, if you want to be accepted into whatever the fuck this thing is, you can't just like what you're saying, you know, you don't fuck up. If you talk about it, we're gone. We're not you, we won't. This is not the way we will transmit our technology to your planet. So there is that possibility, which is there aren't really hands off. It's just their hands are on people who are in positions of extreme power. Maybe, you know, let's go a step further. The UFO mystery, if if the visitors, let's just call them the visitors because I don't know where they're from. Yeah. If the visitors wanted to reveal themselves, they could do so immediately. Yeah, reveal themselves. It's like no problem. If you've ever read like the book Childhood's End by Arthur C. Clark, the futurist, I've heard about it. Yeah. So he was an incredible futurist and writer and philosopher in my mind. So he wrote a book called Rendezvous with Rama about a cylindrical machine that kind of came to life with an ecosystem as it was coming near Earth. Morgan Freeman actually bought the rights to that. Cool. Hasn't made the film yet, but for decades. But he also wrote a book called Childhood's End. So it's about these aliens that like come over Earth. And but they're like sitting there in a craft for generations, just letting people acclimate to, hey, there's their ships over major cities. And they're sitting there for decades, if I remember the book correctly. And it was because the the ETs, they had a little problem. The problem was they looked like demons, like they look like Satan. They had like tails with pitchforks. So they're like, huh, how do we get humans OK with us? Like, because honestly, we just we look really scary to them. Yeah. So they do this like slow kind of approach over over generations and decades. So so maybe, you know, I'm just just thinking for fun here, you know, maybe these things are slowly encouraging the technological advancement, giving us inspiration, interacting with people, with our military. But they're they're not revealing themselves. And they could do that at any given time. I would argue they are revealing themselves. I mean, that's what we're seeing. But some of them are kind of shy, like a lot of these fighter pilots. There's this whole set of weird things that happen. Like they can't see them with their eyes, but our technology is so good. They can see them through the through the infrared. So they have an ability to cloak. So like, look, they're just not they're not landing on the White House lawn. It's like people like to say, yeah, got it. But they could do it at any time. So the next question is, does our government really know what to disclose? I mean, sure, we have craft that physical hard craft. We have flying saucers in warehouses from other places. You're positive about that. You know that. I'm in like, I would bet my life on it. I do not have the luxury of disbelief. And I know that's annoying, but take it for whatever you value. Well, just take it for whatever you value. Because ultimately UFOs are not a matter of belief. Like if you erase what I just said, you have enough evidence for yourself to like really understand that there's something really, really high magnitude going on here that has physical hardware. Yes. But I will say that because they're not revealing themselves in that way. You know, the question is, well, our government should tell us. Well, what can they tell us? Maybe they don't have a great grasp on this. Maybe there's not some like alien sits down with eyes and how are they? They they chat it out, you know, maybe that hasn't happened. So what can they admit? They can admit that we are completely powerless to whoever is operating these craft that they shut down our nukes, that they can evade us, that we can't shoot them down, that we don't know what they're doing. We don't know their capabilities. They suck up intelligence and data all the time. And what, you know, what do we do? Like, are they going to admit that? You never show weakness if you're going into a fight, right? You have to believe your number one or else you're not going to be number one. So so I don't know. It's kind of like this place where until we get people feeling that they can without retribution, explain without showing the technological, you know, things that should be that should be classified like certain things in radar data that shows our capabilities to other four nations that do want to nuke us. They do want to get rid of us, right? As Americans, whatever. So without doing that, what can we say? And that's what we're seeing now. We are seeing now that although it's just a matter of confirmation, all they're going to do, all they're going to do is they're going to remove that this is US black technology. They're going to remove that. All right. And if they don't, their hands will be forced. But they're already said they're going to remove that. There was a leak to the New York Times. Great. What's next? They're talking about hypersonics with Russia and China. They have some that's fucking bullshit. These things are non-aerodynamic. They've been around since the beginning, recorded human history. And it's not even hypersonic capability, which distinguishes them. It's also their ability to have low observability, which is like cloaking. Yeah, it's their ability of high endurance to sit there for weeks at a time. Absolutely unaffected by the outside environment. It's their ability to be transmedium, to penetrate that space between air and sea or space and air. So that was that that is a charade. That's a slide of hand. When they put that into that article, I was like, I see what you're doing. You can't trick me. Government, they're trying to make sure they get money because they have an adversarial nation. Oh, maybe it is China and Russia. Then we come to find out they're studying UFOs with AI. That they also have UFO exploitation programs, which I could have told you because George Knapp and I got the documents and we've already released a lot of it to the world. So here's the deal, man. It is not our technology and I mean human. So what that means is are these people from another time? Are these people from another planet? Are these people from another dimension? Are these people from? I don't know, man, you choose. I'm just saying, let's stop the bullshit. Nobody on the inside or anybody, everybody on the inside knows that these are not ours and that these are not any technologically advanced nation that we know of in the history of humankind. This shit has never been shown in the theater of war, which is where you demonstrate your best technology. Right. So what do we left with Duncan? You tell me. Good point. Good fucking point. Because here's the real truth. If we control these things, you better believe we'd be using them. It's not like we'd be like we're shy. We've been at war for 93 percent of our history. You think we're not going to like send out our super fucking insane drones? Like just look what we did. Well, how long did we split the admin? What was it like four hours later? We dropped it on three cities. It's not like we waited. We just did it. Like that's that's that's a great fucking point, man. What do you the economics of it? Think about the economics. So if we just take a tiny little piece of this and we say, look, we can actually do, you know, we have a technology that creates positive lift without any reactionary pollution, no fuel, as you know it. Like, holy shit, just you leaked that little bit into our society. Right. Yes. And then all of a sudden we are the top economy in the world. Any nation would do that. The fact tells the story. Right. Holy shit. You're totally right. Yeah, because we're so money motivated. We're so and if fucking Lockheed Martin could reverse engineer it. They would do it. They would obviously do it because there's a market pressure. OK, that's brilliant. Now, let me ask you and we've gone over an hour a little bit, but I did want to ask because I yeah, I'm good, man. I'm going to whatever you want. Thank you. Thank you. So do you do you have any inkling of what we could expect to see in this like government report that's coming out? Everyone's so excited about the hypersonic stuff, but any other inkling of what might be in there? Should we be excited about it? Is it going to be disappointing? Well, that's depending on what you want. But yeah, I mean, it'll definitely be disappointed to some people and it'll be vindicating to others and it's going to move the ball forward and we're going to have a lot to chew on. This is this is going to be a decade long process, Duncan, right? So I mean, hopefully it moves and accelerates and accelerates. But yeah, I'm going to just say this like I have been obviously exposed to probably things I shouldn't have been, but I've been exposed to information. My understanding of the report is as is. I mean, this is actually reported on. So over 100 cases, about 120 plus cases spanning 20 years. Wow. But people aren't asking the right question. I'll tell you the right question in a second. So they're going to remove rightfully so that this is any US technology, which is a big it's a big admission. Right. You do that. You're trying to tell the American public the truth because it would be great to say, oh, this is ours. Don't worry about those. Those are ours, right? It's going to be the opposite. They're going to remove it and then hopefully they do their job and they remove that it's other foreign technologically advanced nations. But it behooves them to say that it might be that open because they could make a lot of money, basically, for the departments. I get that. So I as long as they stay true to what I am aware of, it's going to be very powerful in that it's going to remove the important things that we need to start removing so we can face a reality that is bigger. Right. With that said, the first question that I would ask that I am going to encourage people to ask, cool, where did you get over 100 truly in depth, multi sensor UFO cases that span 20 years? What archive did you pull from? Because I'll tell you something. Shit, there has been an active coordination of compiling this information, multi disciplinary or multi agency. Yeah, for decades. Yeah, there is a central storing house for this. There's multiple, but there's one I can very specifically, I will identify if they're not coming forward with it. It's a location. It was described to me on the big on the main part of it as a museum of paper, a museum of paper. I'm not going to say anything more about what else is there because things are spread out. But they pulled this data from somewhere. Yeah, we should be asking where. Because what that means is there's been a data pool that science scientists have not had access to. If it comes out the way I'm thinking it's going to come out. So look, don't be disappointed with anything in life. If you are unsatisfied, then fight to be satisfied. This report is a government report. They can't show classified stuff. And they're definitely not going to open the books on UFOs and just say everything you needed to know here it is not going to happen. But it's going to penetrate. It's going to crack the dam. We already did. The fact that exists cracks the dam, right? So there you go. So I'm very hopeful that as we dig into what's released, that we're going to be able to receive a lot more information and push to understand what questions to ask like the one I just told you. Yeah. And if they don't do their job, I am confident there are ways to pressure them to do their job through civilian release. You keep saying that. And aren't like in maybe this is my cynical understanding of the way some government agencies work. But don't you feel like, I mean, look at Assange. Don't you feel like you're putting yourself in legitimate, like at the very least legal peril by trying to force the hand of whoever the fuck is withholding this data? OK, well, I can't be busted for something I didn't do, right? So we're already cool. Right. And then you and then you talk about, well, what did like what did Ed Snowden do? You know, the military people, I know, just really are very pissed at him, right? So the public is very happy because we learned something we didn't know. But in the process of military, they have no respect. And I'll tell you why. It's because I know he says he was frustrated and he couldn't go through the normal channels. And I'm sure that's true. I'm not for or against. I'm not educated enough. But what he did was he signed an oath. And then he went against that oath in a strategic way. Now, is that good or bad? I don't know. But but he but he broke the law. Nothing I'm doing is breaking the law. So it's like I can have that moral dilemma or that kind of thing. And I don't have all the answers. It's not like I can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt to everybody. Like I'm not like sitting on an archive that like became in my house and grab that you'd be satisfied. It's a cumulative thing and the people that I know and who I know that's going to come forward. And and there is footage that I have that's going to shock the world. For sure. I'll tell you that. You come over to my house, I'll show you. OK. But here's the deal. Yeah, we got to do that. But but but here's the deal, man. I'm not doing anything illegal. I'm not doing anything to hurt the country. Right. I'm trying to work with people to push forward. People that want this stuff pushed forward. So I do not intend on breaking the law or hurting the country. It would be who has has been received this way. That agencies would see that more as a positive than a negative. Now, of course, I mean, I don't know if this should be part of your podcast. Let me say it and then let's decide. OK. But I you know, I have been warned. You know, I have a constitutional lawyer. I have been warned about other nations trying to penetrate my machines and stuff at home, not because, you know, but everything's locked down. I mean, my brother's a cybersecurity expert, so whatever. But I've been warned of that. So it's more like, hey, don't get in trouble without knowing you're getting in trouble is kind of like the front. My friends on the inside of different agencies, they don't get in trouble without knowing you're getting in trouble. Right. As a civilian, they're like you. As long as it doesn't say classified on the visual thing you're seeing, they're like, then you can receive anything as a journalist. It's up to the people that obtain it. That's their duty, their job, not to get in trouble. So to answer your question, there's a big way to answer your question. Look, I'm not paranoid. I'm prepared. I've done nothing illegal. I'm not going to do anything illegal. But I'm going to apply pressure, but I'm going to do it the right way because I haven't signed a contract that says I can't do it. Right. It's not like somebody says, here's all the UFO info, but you can't talk about it. And then I talk about it. I've never signed anything. I've been asked. I've never signed anything. And the reason is because I want to be free. And so as long as I do my job right with integrity, I vet the sources, I don't put myself in a compromising position. What's the worst is going to happen? You can come knock on my door. We'll talk about it. It's no problem. I'm not an adversarial force. I'm representing the interest of myself and other people. That's it. Right. Does that make sense? Oh, yeah. And we love you, man. Are you kidding? Like, seriously, like this, this work that you're doing and God bless you for giving me this much time. Because I just I just know, like, I can't imagine how swamped you are, especially today. They're getting the, you know, top secret briefing today. That means the report's probably coming soon. Right. Are they today? Do you know? Yeah, that's what I read. Yeah, it says, um, yeah, let me look it up just to make sure I'm not fucking that up. But, uh, yeah, they might be being given the heads up for the report today. That'd be big news. I've shut off my phone like Duncan, talk with you, man. It's a reprieve from the pressure that I feel from the universe right now. I mean, people are actually, let me tell you, something has changed. People would write me die. You fucking bearded, forenamed piece of shit. Die. That's the first thing I wake up to. I couldn't handle it. I don't know. And I got doxxed and my phone number was doxxed. My address was doxxed. They put it on, you know, on these YouTube things. Like I was just like, holy fuck, it's not the government. It's people. What's going on? And so I just have detached. I've, you know, just I'm at the point where I've just completely changed everything. Talking with you is like a reprieve from it all because but things have changed. Things have changed. I'll tell you praise and blame is all the same. Like, um, now I get more love letters that people are like, OK, thank you. I really doubted you, but I see, you know, they don't know me, but they're like, right, I think you're probably doing a good thing. Look, that's nice. I just, I can't. The only opinion that matters to me are people that actually know me. If they tell me I'm on track or off talk, they don't know me. It doesn't fucking matter. Right. Love or hate, it doesn't matter, but it gets grinding. So it's really nice. Like the phone, you know, goes off a billion. You told me how you survived one of your tours. Like it's like, how do you? It's not going to slow down. So what do I have to do? I have to make sure that I fill my life with people that I love talking with, that people that are that don't they don't want something. They just want to they want to exchange information. They want to, you know, they're curious. And that is so powerful, because ultimately we can care about UFOs. We care about the universe. All that fucking matters is the interactions that you have in your life. And does that build your spirit? Are you learning? Are you growing and becoming a better human along the way? And at the end of the day, can you say, I did it right and I did it my way? And if you can say that, then you fucking won, man. Level up next simulation, you did it right. So that's my only fucking goal is everything else can fall away. But if there's if there's love in my life, if there's passion, if there's curiosity, if there's friendship, if there's real interaction, then you know what, then that's I fucking won. And that's what I'm, you know, that's all I care about. So anyway, you won. You were on Chucker Cross and talking about UFOs. You won. Well, I said no more times than I said, I did it one time. But, you know, a lot of people of minority, you know, they don't like that he has other views. And I respect that he's always been nice about UFOs. But like, I just like I'm nobody's puppet. I won't go on a show too many times. That was a cool one, but there were tons after, right? I have to look at the whole scope of the UFO thing. It nobody owns it. Yeah. When you were telling me about Tucker and you were like, you were like, I got a sense of like, oh, my God, all your, all your like, all your liberal friends, me included, you're worried because they're like, what the fuck? He's what, what are they? But it's like, when you have this kind of information, I don't think it's time to like pick and choose. I think you just get it through all the conduits that you can, because every time you get it through, you open up the possibility that somebody else is going to send you that email, that someone else is going to get you that data. It's just, it's just, it's just sensitive in that like any media personality I go on with, if it's political, some people agree, some people don't, but, but UFOs does not need to be politicized. Exactly. However, it's so much bigger than a country or a defined line or even human opinion. This is bigger. So I try to contribute to every show and I really, I'm sensitive about what we just said in that I don't want to single somebody out as like bad or good. If you're contributing to the UFO topic in my book, we're cool. We can, we can talk about UFOs then. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, exactly. I mean, look, yeah, I think I'm like, I can think of a trillion ways. There, I have two things in common. Let's talk across and actually one, we both love the grateful dad. And number two, we both love UFOs in between and just were the antithesis of each other. But fuck, I mean, look, it's, it's like, you got to love that somebody like that still is like putting this kind of dad out there. Not just him though. Everyone is now. And, and that's the thing. We should, we should just mention that, right? It's like, it doesn't. So this is really important maybe for, maybe this is important. I was like, really, I don't like talking about other people when they're not here. But like, maybe this is important, which is they're like, despite our differences, let's say it that way, despite our differences. What really bonds us to this topic? And I think about what Ronald Reagan said, and he said, you know, what would bond humanity together more than an alien threat? He said that at the UN and it's sad that it has to be a threat that would bond. How about just the fact that we're part of a living cosmic intelligent universe with people all over star systems and they can learn how to visit here? How about that? How about that bonds us? But I think the big takeaway here, because, you know, I don't like talking about people when they're not here, but check this out. Maybe the whole lesson here is despite our differences of opinion, we are human beings navigating like, I think a spiritual experience and we have these physical bodies to do it that allow us to do it. And that the thing that really bonds us together is that we're in such a larger reality than we thought a week ago. Yeah, yes, yeah, man, like all the problematic whoever. And if you're buying at this point, if you have any kind of, if you're tweeting, you're problematic to somebody, guaranteed there's no, like it's, we live in a very politicized environment right now. And I think your, your aspiration and intention there. I hear it, man, it's beautiful. It's like, we got to find a way to, that we're going to like connect as a planet, because otherwise it's, we're talking infinite war. And you know what? It's like the, like if you and me and a few other people were stuck in a house together and we didn't even know if there were other neighbors, our personality differences are going to become increasingly profound, you know? And I think the social, the social impact of the internet is it's produced as a claustrophobic, compressed feeling like, ah, we're trapped on a planet with this guy and that guy and God help people are trapped on a planet with me. My voice makes some people literally want to like rip their ears off of their heads. They're not shy about telling me that, you know what I mean? It's like that, but, but the moment that, you know, even if it's just a knowledge that we're part of a massive network of life and hopefully the possibility of actually even getting off world during our lifetimes, then all that stuff that was so intense, I think it'll start melting away on its own. You know, like individual human beings are going to seem so much less important when you're, you know, an Alpha Centauri on some kind of incredible outpost for an advanced civilization that's like giving you a chance to hang out with them and maybe watch a black hole or something like that. You know what I mean? You're not going to be like, go ahead. I take extreme umbrage with something and I want to be, you know, because we're friends, I'll be honest with you. I take extreme umbrage with the, with the idea that somebody dislikes your absolute Tibetan, monastery singing voice. What the fuck is wrong with their fucking earhold, man? No, you know, so, so, so you have a very unique range with your voice and it's very distinctive and not many people can say that. So fuck them. Suck a dick. Suck a dick. Duncan Frost got the best voice. Now, going on from there, I also want to say. I, I am a peaceful person in, I believe that a lot of violence comes from pain. Now you could call me a hip, you're something like that, but I am able to come from that position because I can defend myself, right? So I just want to say something here that it's maybe a little controversial, but it's, it's very true to me. And just so I get it out, which is that, you know, look, man, as a, as a, as former reforming martial athlete in that I love fighting, right? I will say what I learned from that is that everything is like kind and good and everything's cool, but you've got to be able to draw a line in the sand on everything and you have to be able to defend that line. And usually that's not even physical skill. That is your mental ability to break out of the conformity of social norm and say, wait, wait, wait, what's going on right now is not okay. Right. So I think we have to apply that boldness to the study of the UFO topic where, no, you may not ridicule this anymore. I'm not standing for it. You are uneducated, Neil deGrasse Tyson. You don't even understand what FLIR is for looking in for it. You don't understand what pixelation means, what grain means. So I'm like, we have to call people out and I am not afraid to do that in that if they're talking bullshit and they should be better educated, it's time. So my point is this, when it comes to UFO topic, you must be able to fight to break the social stigma and norm or we're going to be stuck in it. So even though it's peace and love and everything comes from maybe like they're damaged and so like we have to have leeway with people, not anymore. Where we're at with this is very simple. If you are going to obfuscate the truth, if you are going to be an absolute spineless piece of shit and not stand up for the will of the American public and you're not going to stand up for what you know to be true and right. I am not personally having it anymore. I'm not having it and neither should you. So I just want to throw that in just a little bit of a little bit of intensity that we should hold accountable. Yes. People for lies. Yes. And I hope that's OK, because that's how I really feel. Yeah, man. No, I look, I agree. Like at this point, if you're if you're negging people because they're expressing a connection or a belief or they've had their own experience with UFOs, it's it's gaslighting now. Now you're just like now, now, now you're just going completely against what's actually happening. Look, whether that's what's beautiful about the, you know, the ideal of science. It's like you follow the truth. I can't remember who said this. You follow the truth into the fucking abyss. If it takes you into the abyss, you go into the abyss with the truth. You have to have the you have to have the humility to admit that you were wrong. The humility, investigate the unexplained, don't explain the uninvestigated. You know, that's our duty as journalists and scientists and podcasters and human beings, and I just sent you something via text before this. And it was somebody you know, I don't know him. I think you and Joe know him, Sam Harris, but he's like a deep thinker or something. Yeah, brilliant. And yeah, OK, I don't know. But his last sentence on that somebody sent that to me was like, we might have to apologize to everybody and I was like, oh, yeah, that's really cool. Because because here's the deal, man. What is happening? I don't know, but I know it's bigger than me. I know it's bigger than you. I know it's bigger than us. I know it's bigger. It's bigger, man. And so like, what do we want to do? Do we want to hide from this and be fearful? Look, maybe they're not. Maybe there is multiple types of alien species coming down prepping the battlefield for some hostile takeover of the containers where they're going to reap our souls and sell them in other commodities around the universe. I don't know. Could be true. I hope not. I hope not. I hope not. But, you know, I would like to think that that kind of intent would annihilate itself because of the nature of that combative attempt, attempt, sorry, because of the nature of that combative intent prior to being able to visit another planet. Right. Yes. So if that's what we're seeing, then I feel like there must be some sort of evolutionary curve where you're able to get over those little tiny squabbles of just warfare to the point where you are now directed panspermia, trying to populate an intelligence and interconnected techno terrestrial universe. I would like to believe that I don't know, but I'm fucking going with that. Jeremy, God bless you. Thank you so much. This has been my one of the highlights of the last couple of years. Thank you so much. I'm so grateful to you. Thank you. Now, real quick, how can people find you? Do you or is there anything you want to talk about or plug or anything? You know, really, I don't usually have anything to plug. It's just that like I'm too easy to find. You could find me like, you know, you go to any of my social media. My name is Jeremy Corbell. It's really easy. You know, what I would say is this. You know, my communications are unmanageable. I just ask that in order for me to manage them better, that, you know, people try to send me like like an audio voicemail, like, you know, through the iPhone and they put it into an email. Like that's really cool because I can just sit there and kind of listen to it. I want to hear everybody's stories. I don't always reply, but I try to listen to everything. I stayed up till five in the morning last night just so I could hear what everybody's saying. I just want to know what people are saying. So my website is extraordinary beliefs dot com. But really my social media just, you know, at Jeremy Corbell, the Instagram is the way I tend to get emails and see those over time. Twitter, I tend to see those messages. Instagram, which is it's every second. I can't probably write anybody that how do you do it? I don't know how to do it. So yeah, so just just email me off my website. Twitter is OK, too. I can kind of see that when it's a private message. I just go through them. But I'm really curious. I want to hear from people what they think is going on if they have footage like other people have brought to me, of course, I'll handle it with care. I can be trusted that way. But really, man, I just want people to talk about this more. I want you guys to talk about it. I want you to to bring other people, even if they're contrary to my beliefs or philosophies, like just get as many people talking about it as possible, because I think that this is going to be an issue for us for the next 10 years. That's going to be really important. God bless you. How did Christian Jeremy? Thank you. OK, brother. A huge thank you to my cosmic brother, Jeremy Corbell, for coming on the DTFH.

This is a really intense conversation with a really wonderful person who's got a great podcast, Aubrey Marcus podcast. The links to that will be at duckatrustle.com or just Google it. But now everybody, welcome back to the DTFH. Aubrey Marcus. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands. No need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the duckatrustle. Duckatrustle. Wait, you're at some kind of ayahuasca resort right now? No, I left there. So we did spend a week there. Did a series of three journeys at a place called Soltara. And then instead of coming straight home, because with home comes everything that I left behind at home. And so I decided to just hang out in Costa Rica for four days with some of the crew and integrate and just take my time before I dive back into the default mode world. Oh, no. Default mode world. That's where I'm broed so deep in the DTFH. I know. I mean, I got so many roots in there deep. Welcome back to the show, man. Thank you so much for doing it. Thank you, brother. Yeah, it's great to have this conversation with you. It has all conversations with you. Oh, God, I love any time I get a chance to see you. It was so cool seeing you back in Austin. And I know what you mean. Austin's a heavy place to live, man. That's a really busy, intense vibe out there. I'm not saying it's bad, but having been up here in the mountains a little bit and brushing shoulders again with like a city and that vibe and everything, it was a little more intense than I expected. It's a great place to birth things. There's so much energy there right now. It's like just this nexus and you can dive in and then harness some of it and start surfing. But it's, yeah, it's intense. It's a lot. Yeah, I think as long as you do what you're doing or I think it's like either you, if you're living in a place like that, you got to make time to head off to wherever you go to to get out of the default mode world. Or if you're living in a place like Asheville, you need to dive into that. Those energy vortices just to, you know, get reinvigorated. But I'm really interested in what you just did, Aubrey. And I know we've talked about this before, but I've got new questions for you. But maybe we could just talk about this, the ayahuasca retreat center itself first, kind of get the setting of the story of what you just went through. Well, you know, to tell this story, we have to kind of go back to the very beginning because I brought back my very first shaman, Maestro Orlando Chuhendama of the Quechua tradition who's known as El Dragón de la Selva, the dragon of the jungle. And my very first journey was going down to Puerto Maldonado and they had another crew that brought in a series of shamans. And the shamans introduced themselves. And then, of course, the dragon introduced himself. And I've been obsessed with dragons since I was three years old, like a little thread guiding me like that movie, Signed Some M Night Shyamalan Shit, where I was like, one day you're going to meet the dragon and he's going to change your fucking life. And so you're going to be obsessed with dragons. So I chose him as my shaman and I worked with him six times. And then, you know, my life took me to other shamans and other places in Peru. And I felt this deep calling to go back and work with him again. And so I'm connected with the crew at Sultara, which is a beautiful retreat center. Typically, they only work with Shepibo healers. So there's a couple different traditions that serve ayahuasca from Peru. There's the Shepibo, which is probably the most famous. They have probably the most famous art that comes out of it, all the patterns. And then there's the mestizo tradition, which is mestizo meaning mixed. It's kind of a hybrid of a variety of different cultures that has their own tradition that's evolved over thousands of years. And then there's the Quechua tradition, which is where a lot of the language comes from. So if you hear words like Otorongo, that's Jaguar and Quechua. So it's become like a deep part of kind of the ayahuasca lore as well. And so he's from the Quechua lineage. Grandmother, grandfather passed down to him. And because Peru is difficult to navigate in right now, I flew him out to Costa Rica. Sotara was kind enough to offer their facilitation, their facilitators. And he offered a ceremony for just me and my closest friends and family out in Costa Rica. What? That is, let me tell you, man, that is like, that's beyond elite. When you're like, I don't even know what the word is for that. Cause you know, some people, some people they will like, I don't know, maybe like fly in some like famous comedian to perform for their family. Like, cause I know comedians, you've done that. And they're like, it's, it's awesome, a little strange, but it's cool. But you're flying your shaman into Costa Rica to heal you and your friends. That's pretty badass, Aubrey. And that is really intense. So, so, okay. So how did you, when you want to do something like that, and I'm sorry if we get lost in the details here, how do you set something like that up? Do you email him or how do you reach out to him to inquire about whether or not he'll take a trip like that? It was interesting how it came about because I've been working with ayahuasca quite a bit this year. And so I've already done it six times with some different healers. And it's been, it's been great. I worked with the Shepibo healers at Sultara in January. And then I worked with some Brazilian and French healers in, I don't know, a couple months ago. And, but I was just called to work with Maestro Orlando again. I just knew that that was going to be the threshold breakthrough. That was the experience that I was really drawn to. Yeah. And I'd lost contact with him. But then somebody hit me up on Instagram because I told the story of my experience with the, with the dragon on JRE 127, like way back in the day. And so a lot of people who follow me had actually gone to work with him and kept in touch with him a little better than I did. And they reached out and they said, hey, Maestro Orlando is really having a hard time. All the lockdowns, all the restrictions on travel has really hurt his business and he's struggling. And I was like, oh, wow, like I'm just so happy to be back in touch with him. I mean, I'm happy to support him. I sent him a little money to keep him afloat like, you know, a couple months ago. And then right then I was like, now that I'm in touch, let me organize something that, you know, we can all work together again. So it really came, you know, a decade later, he came back into my life in that way. And that's what allowed me to get in touch with him. But yeah, he's got an email and he actually has a Facebook too. No Instagram, but he's got a, he's got an old school Facebook. Dragons are on Facebook now, Duncan. Real dragons on Facebook. Yeah, that is such an astounding aspect of the modern age is my meditation teacher, he's always telling me about these like Tibetan teachers that formerly you would have to, like you wouldn't even be able to get there. You wouldn't be able to get to Tibet. It was almost impossible. But you know, now they're like broadcasting from places that were used to be completely inaccessible. So that's pretty wild and beautiful. So you, your shaman comes to Costa Rica and then you, when you do something like this, do you, I'm just trying to imagine like, what's the sort of lead up to it? Do you gather everyone together? Is there a shared intent? Does the shaman convey something to you prior to the ritual or to the, to drinking this stuff? Or is there a sense the shaman has of what is supposed to transpire? Like how does, what's the gateway into the experience, into the ritual itself? Well, everybody gets on a dieta it's called, which is like a restrictive diet to prepare you for, and you know, create the cleanest vessel possible for Iowa to get in and do the work. So cutting out things like salt and sugar and extra spice and pork and different things that are restricted on these diets. And you start to spiritually, mentally, physically prepare about two weeks in advance. And then we arrive and, you know, he offers what, you know, he tells everybody what he's going to do, which is basically hold two intentions. One is the collective intention for the group coherence resonance in this collective healing and also the protection of the group. And then individually as well, and he'll work with each person individually for our own challenges, which our challenges are always universal, but they're also specific. So he's holding two intentions. One is one to one, you know, the shaman with you. And then the other is for the collective space itself. And, you know, ultimately he's just in a place of receiving and trust. Like his, his maestro is ayahuasca. Ayahuasca tells him what songs to sing, tells him what mechanisms to use, whether he's going to use cinnamon or whether he's going to use tobacco for his specific healings, what's called soplados, which is where he does like a one to one healing, just him and you. And how much ayahuasca he's going to give you, you know, whatever, all of these things just come through him in the moment. So he doesn't burden himself with a lot of forethought about it. He's just done this for over 30 years. He actually started drinking when he was 11. He's 55 years old now. So he'd been drinking ayahuasca for 44 years, serving ayahuasca for 30 years, and he just knows now to just trust, you know, trust what the medicine is telling him, trust what is going to facilitate the most impactful healing and, you know, really drive people towards their true purpose.

How does he react when someone is having some initial fear or nervousness or this is someone's first time? They've never met him before. What is his method for telling if people are ready for it and if they are ready for easing them into the experience? Or does he? He's a real dragon Duncan. He's a real life dragon. This is something like it's so hard to convey. It just sounds like a story, but his energy is really like you're sitting with a great dragon. He just has so much power, but with that immense power is this type of gentleness and this quiet confidence and an easy laugh. I've always said you can tell a spiritual master by the sound of their laughter and he'll just be there laughing and just holding this quiet confidence that there is no doubt in his mind that you are going to heal and that by the mere fact that you showed up, you're ready. You wouldn't have showed up if you weren't ready. The resistance would have pulled you out of this. I suppose in an extreme case where he saw something that was really aberrant, he would take action, but obviously the group I curated, I'm watching for that too. I know everybody really well and they were ready. It's interesting because he holds that dragon energy where he's not going to coddle you, but he's just going to be there like, we're here, we're here to heal and you can handle it and I can certainly handle it. This is what I'm born for and he just kind of presides like this mystical being, just emanating this love and healing and just immense power and you get the sense that even when he's officiating ceremony, you're only seeing a fraction of what he's capable of. He's giving it his full intention, but nonetheless there's just levels and levels and levels. If things got really awry, then the dragon would be called to even more and more higher levels of power. Do you ever get into conversations with him about the shared vision that so many people have with DMT where they do see reptile creatures? They do see these advanced beings that do show up as a kind of dragon-like character. Do you all ever talk about what those things are? Yeah, he believes they're real. He knows them, these are like his friends. He's dealing with these beings all the time and I actually talked to him about all of his because he has his own visions because he takes the ayahuasca, he sings the ikaros, he presides over ceremony and watches all of the entities that come in. I'll tell you some of the stories of what he saw and what his interpretation was. Right out first ceremony, he saw Buddha enter through the door. He's worked with Buddha a little bit, but there's a couple Buddhists in our group who were actually wearing Buddha necklaces and kind of calling in Buddha. So he saw Buddha, but then he saw two figures and these figures were masked. They had like hoods over their head, kind of like bank robbers. And they were obscuring people's vision of the Buddha, which was basically like the Buddha representing the clear sight, like the true sight. And then there was these forces that were obscuring us from seeing the true sight, like really seeing ourselves with clarity, seeing that equanimous mind and being that equanimous mind is obscuring the vision. So he has a process. He asks these beings, these entities, he says, hey, what are you doing? Like, what are you doing here? And they didn't answer him. And so he has he has a recourse for any being that doesn't answer him. He blows in a very specific way. He goes like that and he blows with his energy and intention. He just blows the beings out of the Maloka, just blows them right out of there. And so what was left was just the Buddha. And for all of us in that first, it was this kind of introduction to this clarity that was going to be mounting and growing. And so that was one of the visions he saw in the first ceremony. In the second ceremony, there was these women that were dancing in the middle of the in the middle of the Maloka. And they were dancing around and just kind of there. And he once again, he asked them, hey, you know, what are you what are you guys doing here? Because he wants to see their intention, you know, and he gives them a chance to see if they'll engage with them. And they didn't respond. So once again, the dragon blows them out of Maloka. And then in ceremony three, there was actually a little gnome that walked through and the gnome had a little green hat. And it was a male gnome with a green hat. And then it was joined by a female gnome with blonde hair, also a green hat. And they came in and they were really excited about him singing because he was singing these incredible ikaros, the songs of the plants. And they were like more and more and more like keep singing. They were really excited about him singing. And so he just did. He just kept singing. You could see their intention. And then more gnomes came in. There was like another, you know, a few dozen gnomes that just flooded in the Maloka. So he finishes all of his singing and then he gently blows and the gnomes get the message that it's time for them to go. So they just kind of turn around and just waddle their way right out of the Maloka. But he didn't need to blow them out of the Maloka. I was like, these are some kind of, you know, fairly nice, middling beings that still didn't belong in the Maloka, but it was fine for them to come and watch for a little bit. Okay, can we spend a moment, just hang out with the gnomes here for a second, because having seen a gnome on mushrooms myself and being astounded at the reality that gnomes do look the way people have drawn gnomes. You know what I mean? To me, that was the most shocking and off-putting part somehow, was it's like, oh, they actually do dress like that. Like they do like to wear hats like that. And they are some kind of beings that can see us more than we can see them and have been around for quite some time. I just want people to know that I too have witnessed the gnomes or one gnome, not an entire family. And I think it would be something of an honor if they were coming to hang out with you, because at least, I mean, I can't base all gnomes on the one gnome I saw in a heavy dose of mushrooms. What's the gnome variance? What's the personality spectrum of gnomes? Who knows? The one I saw was quite grumpy and didn't really seem that pleased. It knew I could see it. It didn't really seem like, it just seemed mildly annoyed or something, which also was like bothering the shit out of me, because I'm like, holy fuck. A gnome. And it's like, oh, great. Anyway, the point is, I think that it's really, that's one of the breathtaking qualities of entering into the astral realm or whatever this realm may be, or opening your eyes enough to see the sort of the cosmic reality that there being so much more life around us that we can't see. And that's something that always, I get caught on that anytime I'm lucky enough to bear witness to that. So that's pretty cool. And his take is that these are real beings. The reason why we have all of these depictions of gnomes that look very similar, or depictions of dragons that look quite similar, is because these are beings that exist in the astral, real beings, real energies that take shape in a visible form. Obviously, we're all energetic to a certain extent, but they appear in a certain visible form and they exist. And that's why we have so many similarities amongst these different types of creatures. And so they appear and they're alive to a certain extent. They don't have flesh, but they have energy. Yes. They come and they interact with us all the time, seen and unseen. I'm not saying this. Going online without ExpressVPN is like leaving your kids with the nearest stranger while using the restroom. Most of the time it's probably fine, but you never know who you're trusting. What if they're a kidnapper, a serial killer? God ExpressVPN! This is an intense thing. This read is intense. That's what they want me to read. Every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes, hotels, airports, etc., your online data is not secured. Who leaves there? Who's like, hey, can you watch my kid? You gotta go take a shit. Every time you connect to an unencrypted network in cafes, hotels, airports, etc., your online data is not secured. Hey, I noticed you were just kind of standing next to the bathroom here. I gotta go use the bathroom, so I was wondering if you could hold my baby. Look, you do need a VPN. I'm sorry ExpressVPN, forgive me. I'm a parent. We never, we don't, that doesn't happen. No one's leaving their kids with strangers. Can you imagine, like someone's like, hey, will you hold my kid while I go poop? But I'll tell you this, even though this copy is a little intense, ExpressVPN is for sure the best VPN out there, and I use them all the time, and you need to use them because it's essentially like barebacking the internet if you don't have a VPN, and they are awesome. The main thing I love about it is it's super easy to use. Before using ExpressVPN, I tried other VPNs, and it was like really complex, and it ended up just being a big pain in the ass. But with ExpressVPN, you just fire up the app and click a button and you're protected. It works on all your devices, phones, laptops, tablets, and more. And essentially what it's doing is it creates a secure encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, so hackers can't steal your sensitive data. People can't see what you're looking at when you go online. You know, anytime I go to a hotel and look at hardcore fetishy BDSM porn, I would just feel weird because it's like, do I really want whoever's running the internet at this hotel? And now I just spend four minutes watching people jerk off on cougar feet? I don't know. It feels like better to have a VPN. ExpressVPN is the VPN I use. It's really easy, and if you're someone who's sort of been on the fence about a VPN, give them a shot. It's totally worth it to secure your online data. Just go to ExpressVPN.com slash Duncan.

Do shamans kind of see people living in default realities like colorblind or something just sort of stupefied or something? Is that the condition that we're existing in? We've been numbed down to the point where you have to say that. I mean, I know these things are as real as we are. This is something that my teacher tells me all the time. They're as real as you, which might not be that real, but still as real as we are. Because we're compacted into matter, we have this kind of weird snobbishness or something. Because we have this density, even if we are mildly aware of those beings or you see one out of the corner of your eye, you're lucky enough to be sitting in the woods and you look off into the woods and you see one of the things or whatever. So many people have seen it. A lot of times when people see that, they're like, well, that's my imagination. It's running amok today. And then they just forget about it. But do the shamans see us as kind of spiritually illiterate or something? Brutish and just lost in a real dense layer of reality? I think they look at us like a multi-dimensional radio that is just only able to tune to a specific channel normally. And when you take the medicines or you sit with someone who's tuned to other channels, you can open up different channels to different dimensions and access information from those dimensions. So that's really what you're doing. And the more you open up those channels through medicine use or being around people who have those channels open, because that's one of the things about being a human is we're in this shared reality. We pretend that it's all about us. It's just us. But we're always in a shared field. And so when we're in the shared field or in a shared medicine field, we open up a whole spectrum of channels. And those channels go all the way to the first or ninth dimension depending on your cosmology, where the divine is, pure unicity. Either the ninth, which is void, or the first, which is the energy, the word, the creation of the divine, all unicity. So it goes from there to all of the different layers. We're hanging out somewhere in the third. But then there's all of these other dimensional realities that you can start to tune to and open up to. And I think it's not so much that it's a judgment that we don't have those channels open. We just haven't taken the time and care to open the channels. And we also have stories. We have the wrong stories. We're not told that we're a multi-dimensional being. And it's possible for us to open to that. And without that belief, half of our bridge is closed. We have to clear at least the first half of our bridge so that we're open to these different things. And sometimes that does mean imagination. Your imagination can be part of the bridge, but something from the other side also has to meet you on that bridge. And that's really what happens in these ceremonies. That's what Ram Dass used to say, is that imagination is the gate. That is it. That's the way you... He would say, I love... My imagination is real. This is a tool. And again, I think another sign of the times is that the imagination is like... It really does get kind of... If you talk about your imagination too much, it's like, okay, baby, what are you going to do? You want a coloring book. You know what I mean? You want to do finger paints while you do your imagination. It's like, that's the world that we're in, where the imagination is this insanely fast simulator where instantaneously, using your will, you can picture just about anything. It might be a foggy, muddy version of it, but you can picture it. So what you're saying is this is one of the... This thing that you're calling the bridge, which I'd love to hear more about, this is like something that you use to cross this bridge into whatever this realm is. Is that what you're saying? A lot of times, for me in particular, there'll be kind of a fuzzy sense of things that will be available almost like it's there, but it's not quite there. And if I use my imagination to start to... What does it look like and start to build it in my mind? I'll start using these kind of Legos of imagination or something, and then all of a sudden, that thing will really come through and catch what they call the bridge, the Chakaruna. So the Chakaruna is the bridge to another form of consciousness. And I think imagination can be a huge part of that, the openness, the belief, and then of course, the medicines and everything else that I mentioned. But yeah, absolutely. And when I'm in the deep, deep quantum, and I've experienced what I believe it feels like to be disembodied and to be just in the soul of the etheric body, everything that you want to appear appears because you think of it. You think of it and it comes to you. It's not like you navigate through movement. It's you're there in the quantum of all possibility. And if you want to speak to someone, you just think of them and then they appear to you. And this is how it works. Sorry to cut you off, continue. No problem. The Bardo state in Tibetan Buddhism, you have just described it. This is how it's been described to me. And so this is a disaster for many people who have died because they have, and especially who haven't had any kind of practice, taken medicine, who have been fully subscribed completely to the idea that, oh yeah, you're just your body. And then once that is eliminated, that's some kind of void, infinite void or something like that. So what happens is your body's gone, but you're still there. And you are that imaginative process somehow and anything that you're thinking is going to appear around you. It's described as this kind of like funhouse of mirrors and that if you're terrified when you die or if you're not prepared for that, then all your fear starts appearing around you and it's a really rotten thing that can happen to you if you haven't done any kind of training. But it's exactly what you're describing, which leads me to believe, oh, this is like the bridge. This medicine is a connective point to the Bardo in between life and death. Does that resonate for you? Does that make sense? Totally. I mean, I think Bardo implies that it's a place where you're stuck. In between. It means in between. Yeah. And it definitely was this liminal space when I've accessed it. It is the in between. Because the other side of the in between, to be in between you have to be in between something and I could feel when I'm in this space, there's a calling for what I would call the second death. And the second death is obliteration into the divine. And that feels like a choice. That feels like a choice. And it's like, you know, when you say go to the light, you know, and all these ideas about go to the light. Well, I believe in my own belief from my own experiences on all these medicines for 22 years, that that choice to go to the light is the obliteration of self, the reincarnating conscious being that's learning through all of these different incarnations and exploring reality in all of these different ways. It goes back into the divine, split up into ready for infinite articulation into another million different forms and beings and energies, etc. Certainly I had no interest in doing that when I was in the bardo, when I was in that liminal space, because it was beautiful. I mean, I could call anything to me. I could call people I loved. I could call places to me. I could experience these magical, magical things that were just there. They were there and I was able to access them and I was free of all of my fears and limitations and all of the petty human things that kind of keep us locked in this carnal prison that we're in. And not to say that being incarnated is not also incredibly beautiful. We drink coffee, we make love, we hug people, we listen to the music in the way that we want, but so much of that is accessible. It's just a different way to navigate. But I also see that from that place I could see where I was like, all right, well, I want to fucking ejaculate. I want to do that. Let me find a planet where they still have genitals and we can get it on. I'm into it. I really think that might be my requirement for incarnation. I'm like, do they have genitals where I'm going? Because that's where I want to go. Well, you know what's so funny? Again, this is another... I'm sorry for any of my friends out there are more academic when it comes to this stuff, but yeah, that is the description of what brings you back here is actually your horny. I mean, it's... And I remember when I heard that the first... Because the story before I heard the first early phase Buddhism, I thought you encounter all these scary things that are projections and they chase you. They're scary and you run, run, run, run, run, and then you jump into your parents and that's the Tibetan story of how we reincarnate. But no, no, no, that isn't it at all. The story... And again, I am prepared to be told, that's not it, you idiot. Where'd you get that from? But it's just funny because you are mentioning that the story that I've heard is, in fact, what happens is there is some fear depending on your karma a lot of times because you don't have a body anymore and you've had this body and suddenly you don't. So that's a really scary thing for people who aren't familiar with the possibility that you can exist minus a body. And so, but then in this strange journey in the Bardo state before your next incarnation, one of the visions you see is a bunch of people fucking and you're attracted to... It's what's so weird is, it reminds me of like, Pornhub, you know, where you're looking at the squares with people fucking in them? It's like that, but the people you're seeing fucking, you're drawn to one of them sexually and those are your parents. So that's basically how you get born as you get turned on by watching your parents fuck so much that you incarnate in your mother's womb and are... So you're not that far off, man, and you have identified that. And it makes sense because the sexual impulse is what keeps humanity on planet Earth. If we all universally decided to stop fucking, we would go extinct. It's, you know, it's the procreative impulse is the impulse that keeps things locked into matter or keeps us locked into matter. And also, there's a fundamental impulse that we all have and that impulse is to merge with God, right? Like, we crave emerging with God. If you're in the Bardo, if you're in the liminal space, to merge with God is only... You can only do it one way. From my own understanding, you can only do it one way and it's permanent. It's obliteration. So that's the only way you get to be God when you're in this astral realm. It's the only way. It's the real way. It's for reals. It's never coming back way. But if you get to incarnate as a human, there's a variety of ways that you can merge with God, one of which is sex. In that moment of deep, rapturous, orgasmic sex where your breath and your body is merging with another being and you reach that climax state, there is nothing else but the single sound of merge, of union with God. It's that orgasmic moment where there's nothing else. The mind collapses, the body collapses, time, space, everything collapses and you're one. And this is the power that sex holds. This is also why we're drawn to it. And there's other ways too. I mean, as a human being, you can smoke five MEO DMT and merge with God for an hour. And do it just for a little bit rather than having to do it permanently for reals. And so I think there's some immense advantages to being a human. We get to actually taste the entirety of dimensional reality while being in this body. So I think, yeah, as that discarnate entity, we crave it. We crave access to this. And also the lessons and the growth and all of the things we're here to do. But we want to merge back with source and we can do that here. That is a really beautiful thing. And I think a lot of people, they feel guilty when they get all horny. And it's like, you know what I mean? They feel like weird or like, I'm sorry, I just want to fuck. But also what you're really wanting is to commune with the divine intelligence. But your primordial experience of reality has taught you that's fucking, because it's the way in. And again, in the same way you might be in the forest or wherever and see one of these hyperdimensional beings that for whatever reason you tuned into, you forget about it. And I think a lot of people, when they have sex and they're describing and do experience that moment that you're describing, they don't remember it. They remember all the lead up to it, but they forget that part. And so they keep going back because that's what they're looking for. You know? Or maybe they do experience it, but they haven't made the connection that that's God yet. That's why I love them. They don't have the language and they don't have the framework to understand it. And also, look, I really believe that much of what organized capital our religion has done is try to restrict us from our own access points to the divine. Because they've built their empire as being the middleman. They're the middleman between us and the divine. And so what have so many of them done? Well, they've made sex a sin, because sex is one way that you can access the divine right on your own, the true divine, the divine beyond judgment. And they've put this interstitial superposition into a judgmental deity that's going to judge you and you tried to use that to actually block our ability to access the true states of unity consciousness. And I think this is one of the things that we're still dealing with, not only as it regards to sex, but just judgment in general. Because you really access God. God doesn't judge you at all. You know? You don't have to ask for forgiveness. You're already forgiven. Try to be unforgiven. Try to get real true God to be mad at you. It's insane because you're God too. You know? I can't be mad at my children. You know, I'm making you mad, but it's instantaneous forgiveness. I have had my, just yesterday, by two and a half year old and an eight month old, both of them at different times in the day, yanked the shit out of my beard, man. Just like, vicious, vicious. You know how much that hurts. It fucking hurts, man. When I was in Austin, I saw you. I was like, hey, Aubrey, and yanked your beard. You'd be like, fuck you, man. What happened to you? We would probably be doing this podcast. But I think the relationship of God to the creation is that. And there's so much pride and ego and imagining that you could really upset the source. You know what I mean? There's a lot. It's sad that you're feeling guilty, but it's also, come on, really? You think you're going to offend that thing from which all things come? You're going to be the thing where it's like, God damn. Look at Aubrey. Really? Fuck you. It's amazing if you're praying for forgiveness and just heard it disembodied. No, fuck you. But yeah, I know what you mean. But, pre-forgiven, I love it. And yeah, I love that. That is the whenever I am taking psychedelics and the kind of healing thing is happening. It's always the message is like, come on. Not even come on. I love you. I love you. You're okay. I love you. But it generally wrapped up in that is some kind of like, you should be enjoying this. Like, this is for you. This is for you to enjoy and express love within, not to be all but dragled and terrified all the time. But then I forget it. Well, and people project all of these ideas. I mean, we have a brutal self-judge. I mean, the devil as the judge is inside all of us. I mean, this is an entity that's within us and we'll project it on our deities. We'll project it on God, we'll project it on, even on ayahuasca. You know, so many people will fall off the diet. They'll have some salt or they'll have some sugar in them. They'll be like, ayahuasca is going to punish me. I'm like, what do you mean ayahuasca is going to punish you? Ayahuasca loves you. Ayahuasca is the spirit of the earth herself and you were made up of the earth, built atom by atom by her plants and her water and her animals and her air. You think she's going to punish you because you had some salt? No, I mean, have respect and follow the traditions and allow a clean vessel, but there's no punishment there. There's no anger. You know, all of these things, these are human things. These are human tendencies, as we're kind of wrapped in polarity. But there's no need to project them on our deities because they're just not there. Like ayahuasca will, it is a hellish, brutal, immensely challenging experience that will bring you to the blistering edge of what you're capable of. But behind that all is love. Like I love you so fucking much that I'm going to heal you at all costs. Like that's what ayahuasca says. And it doesn't mean that ayahuasca is for everybody and I want to make that clear. This is not a panacea. If you've had psychological issues, if you're not called to it, it doesn't have to be for everybody. But if you're ready and you're called to it, she loves you and she's going to heal you no matter what. Because she loves the you that's emerging. You know, not the you that is. Whoa, God. You know, that seems to be the key to, because like I, you know, I struggle all the time with judging myself and judging other people. And I try to practice mindfulness so that when I'm looking around and the instantaneous judgment happens. And I always think, God, you know, what a tremendous limitation to your experience of reality to always be like judging everything as a matter of habit or something. You know, it's like, it's really sad and it's really like turns the dimmer switch on the universe, you know. And, but anytime I remember that thing you just said, which you're reminding me, I'll always forget it. You're seeing a process here. This person, that person, even your judgment itself or your habitual judgment, this is an evolving process. Right now, that's where you're at. And right now, that's where they're at, whatever it may be, whatever like, you know, free sneezers. Let's take free sneezers, for example. You know what I mean? You're walking down the street and somebody fucking blasts a goddamn loud dynamite level sneeze during a pandemic. I just like, you want to, that's why we made stocks. That's why you put people in those stocks and you put them in the town square. Free- Give them the feathers. Yeah, yeah. But, but that's a, we're all in a process right now and that's such an important thing to remember. And again, it's so interesting. Why, why do you think built into this? I don't know if it's built in, but why do you, why is there this quality of profound forgetfulness when it comes to being a human being? Why do we forget all of these things? This is the thing that I think we love to think of ourselves like a machine. You know, like you program some information to a machine or you type it into your Google Doc. It's there. It's permanent. You can access it forever, but we're not. We're a living organism that's taking on all kinds of different energies. I mean, I don't know how many times people ask me like, you're going to do ayahuasca again. Aren't you healed already? I'm like, what do you mean healed already? Like that's a destination. And like I'm not going back into the same world that made me sick in the first place. My own same ideas, my stresses, my judgments, my perceived inadequacies and my own insecurities and all of these things. I take those, I take those onto certain degrees. The process of healing, the process of remembering is ongoing because we're constantly rewritable. If you want to use the computer analogy, we're a rewritable drive that's constantly getting different programs programmed in and different codes downloaded in. And so it's a constant, evolving process because the world is not set up in a way that's designed to remind us. I mean, there's so many forces out there that want us to forget and then want to provide a solution that you pay for or insurance pays for that can actually make you well but it doesn't actually make you well. It just keeps you in this perpetual state of maybe a little bit better reaching for something that's a little bit more comfortable than the current state you're in. But the process is just an never ending ongoing process. And you can look at that like, I can't handle it, I want it to be done or just say, no, this is part of being alive. Like you just, chop wood, draw water, you just continue, continue to clean, continue to heal, open yourself more and more to love and really learn to love life to the greatest degree possible while we're here. Do you think you'll ever go into that light that you're talking about? Do you think you'll ever just like, really do the thing? Well, I can do it temporarily, right? Like, and that's the beautiful part. Like as my ayahuasca journeys have evolved, I mean, it's so fucking hard, Duncan. Like it's so hard. Like I can't describe to you, I've done a lot of difficult things, long sweat lodges, sweat lodges, climbed freezing mountains with Wim Hof without it my shirt on and sleets hitting me and dealt with the immense stress of birthing this company. And, you know, I was in an open relationship and had everybody, all my girlfriends, hate me for years straight. I mean, I've done some difficult things, but nothing, nothing is as difficult for me as these ayahuasca journeys for the most part. It is the most profoundly challenging thing. And in that challenge, there's this adaptation that comes about. And I had some beautiful adaptations from these challenges and these beautiful liberations. I mean, I was carrying, before this, I was carrying a heaviness that I just couldn't shake. I just couldn't shake it with my other medicine work. I could burst out of it and I would feel free and like, well, okay, I'm free for a moment. And then it would all just collapse back in on me. And I think that's why I was called back to the dragon because it could put me into a place where it was just a new plateau with stable footing. And I'm not, I don't have so much overconfidence to say that I'll never slip back into the muck or the storms may not come again, but I feel like I have stable ground under my feet again. And that's what I want to continue to build from. But the idea that I'm going to burst into a place where there's a new plateau and I won't slip down from that, at least not slip very much, I think it's possible. And I only say it's possible because one of my mentors and teachers, Don Miguel Ruiz, like he got there. I saw it. I witnessed it. And I wish I would have been able to experience Ram Dass because I'm pretty damn sure that he got there too. And so if anybody can get there, it's possible. You know, it's fucking possible. But I think it's just by creating new plateaus, new plateaus that are stable footing, stable ground, and then just continuing to build to a greater state. And that's kind of the goal. But I don't know what plateau I'll end on. And I don't know where the line of demarcation, where you call it enlightenment, above this line. I mean, I don't know. But I know that there's new plateaus that are available. And I just reached one. And it's definitely not anywhere close to enlightenment, but it's better than I'd... damn better than it was. Well, that's one of the things Chogium Trump has said that can seem quite... well, it's literally about confusion, which is... And confusion is on the continuum of enlightenment. Confusion is a quality of enlightenment because, you know, meaning no escape from enlightenment, meaning there isn't a... the moment that you are aware of your confusion, the question is, well, what part of you is aware? What's the aware part? What's the part that's holding the confusion? And then suddenly you realize, oh, right. Just like what you're saying regarding the spectrum of sentience that we currently seem to be on the denser side of things in the same way that we... I like to imagine that there are qualities or aspects of every individual that become not just denser, but increasingly illuminated and lightened and no longer embodied, but still in existence to the point where this thing that we're experiencing is more like a root structure or something that's penetrating into matter and that, you know, that... that's a wonderful thing because there's a sense of, like, in the same way, like your stories of ayahuasca, they feed me. They feed these stories. They, like, make their way into this dimension, and they feed people. Ram Dass's stories of, you know, taking mushrooms and having his, like, psychedelic enlightenment or any McKenna's stories of DMT. They're literally transmissions from this other realm that come into this place, but I like to imagine that, similarly, it goes in the other direction, too, that our human stories, our stories of limitation and suffering and all that, it must go both ways, right? Like, there must be a desire on the other side, as well. And, again, these are constructed bifurcations. You know, I know there isn't any real line, necessarily, other than the ones we're creating, but you know what I mean? Don't you think it goes both ways? Totally. I mean, this is, but I think you're pointing to the actual crux of it, which is we create all of these separations, body and spirit, as if the body isn't the spirit in a certain type of density, right? As if you can't use the body as a way to access the spirit. I mean, in the peak of difficulty, you know, where I could not possibly withstand any more of this. It feels like the ayahuasca vine in its infinite fractals was reaching up through my body, was in my brain, could control where I look, was going through every, and pushing out every toxin that I've had, emotional toxin that I've had, and it was sweating out of my pores, purging into the buckets. And the only thing, I had to use everything I could, and one of the techniques was a type of tapping on my body, right? It was like a certain type of tapping that ayahuasca was showing me, like, this is how you're going to make it through. And if I would try to stop doing it, because I was tapping for, like, hours, I would try to stop doing it, or shaking, like, moving my hand in certain patterns, or, like, making different, like, fast mudras, or my tongue would make these little insect sounds. And, like, I had to let this energy off and move it, but so much of it was about the body. Like, as long as I was tapping the body, it was accessing my spiritual self, in a way, and that you just understand that it's all collapsed. This is just your spirit in a different density, and that's what it is. And so this is the divine. This is God experiencing God in the way that only a human being can, because of what comes online from having sensory perceptions, and smell, and taste, and touch, and feel. But it's still just God in a different density, and our spirit in a different density. So that transmission is immediate. You know, it's God experiencing God in all ways, in all forms. And I think it's important to start collapsing these artificial separations between body and spirit, self and the divine. It's all the one. It's all the one, really. And it's also all of the separation, too. Like, I understand it makes sense to talk about these different densities. You might as well call them a different word so we can communicate effectively. And I understand what people mean, but also to have the dual meaning of, like, I really get what's behind the Maya, what's behind the illusion, which is the unicity. Now, do you... I like to entertain the idea that... and McKenna played around with this, and a lot of many different people have, like, when they've encountered these forms that you encounter when you're taking ayahuasca, or DMT, or a nice dose of psilocybin, and you realize, oh, this is real. Like, this isn't bullshit. This isn't a dream state. This is very real. And then there's a feeling of, like, I think you could take something here. I think you could literally pluck something from that place and bring it into this realm. Have you ever played around with that idea that whatever the particular imaginary, yet very real differentiation between our level of experience and whatever that other place is, is actually thinning, or that technology is... um... creating the possibility that we're not going to just need ayahuasca or DMT or mushrooms as the bridge that there's a potential to create a technological bridge that's a little more, like, um... stable. You know what I mean? That's a little less dependent on the plant medicines. It's certainly possible, and I think it would happen from manipulation of our brain waves because a lot of these experiences, these mystical experiences, happen in waking delta. I mean, waking delta is one of the most profound brain wave states possible. So if there was a technology that could get us to waking delta, I think that could be a really potent tool. Now, ketamine gets you to waking delta, nitrous gets you to waking delta. The problem with waking delta is you don't really have access to remember. You know, because your brain, the part of your brain that encodes and remembers the different medicine like the encounters that you had, it just doesn't stick, it's slippery. So I think there are technologies that already actually exist that, you know, of course these are, I guess you could call them psychedelics, but psychedelics are technologies. You know, they really are. And I would be hesitant to, you know, really champion a technology that would give you access to those states, but, and made it a little bit too easy. You know, because this is not just, it's not just benevolent, you know, encounters that you have. There's dark energy too. Like the polarity just says in life it exists here and it exists there. And I think the plants are like a great guide. Like you want mushrooms holding your hand. You want ayahuasca holding your hand. You want these things to really hold your hand as you make this journey. And even better is if you have a shaman who's there as well, who can anything that comes in. And of course we can learn those same techniques, right? Their own ability to accept, to love what comes and then to move through them. So we're all learning in this process, but I do think that the, although there could be a more, a simplified, more facile solution to get access to these planes, I don't know if it's the right way to do it. Like this might be the best way and you just have to pay the cost. You have to pay the toll. It's like you can't cross the river sticks without paying the gold coin to Chiron or whatever. You need to pay the gold coin and sometimes that gold coin is your pain, your vomit, your endless diarrhea and really dealing with your own demons. Poor Chiron. What a terrible currency to have to get paid in. What does he do with all that gold? What does he do with all the diarrhea? Oh great. You're going to give me diarrhea. Okay, I prefer gold, but if that's what you've got, I guess I'll put it in my diarrhea safe. Yeah, I just, you know, with just some of the things I saw when I was taking Ketamine, it gave me a sense of like there being some kind of project or there being some kind of like long-term project that involved a kind of outreach program for lack of a better word. I feel like it sounds so reductive and silly, but a general sense of like, oh no, we're coming. We're getting in there. Like where you're at, there's so much suffering. Where you're at, there's so much unnecessary suffering and we're coming and and McKenna has talked about this too and like, I think it's a common vision that people have of this sense of like, oh yeah, you and everyone, we're all part of this project and the project involves that place expressing itself more and more into matter. The Kingdom of Heaven appearing more and more and more, not just as parables and stories, but as actual like extruded matter, like it pushing itself in, just like that's what we are. That's what the soul is. We've ballooned our bodies out into this material realm and I don't know, I just have always gotten the sense of like, yeah, you know why it's weird? You want to know why it's so weird right now when everyone's like, shit, things are getting weird. It's like, well, the reason it's weird is because they're coming up. It's coming, it's pouring in. I feel that same way. Some of these stories, we resonate with them because they point at truth. The two towers rise in the Middle Earth, in Tolkien's world, right? The two towers rise, two dark wizards and you could imagine these dark wizards as anything, the mechanisms of power, control, enslavement, greed that we see. These towers are more visible and more evident than they've ever been and so with that, what happens? What's the natural reaction and adaptation? The fellowship comes together. The orcs have risen in the two towers and so the wizards, the elves, the dwarves, the hobbits, the humans they all have to come together and I think we're seeing some of that that's happening as well and that's like, I have an amazing amount of confidence that everything that we're seeing has been necessary to bring people together to get them beyond their petty differences. Right now we're in the time of differences but this fellowship is starting to brew and in addition, I also feel like to go to the Game of Thrones story, when the dragons came to their land and they hatched again and dragons were back they have this short scene where everybody's magic starts working, like street magicians used to play with a little bit of fire could now do all kinds of tricks with fire all the conjure, like magic was back in and it feels like now is a time where not only is the fellowship coming together but magic is more available like I felt it more available I felt myself capable of doing things that I've never been capable of in these kind of spiritual states and I've seen it with so many friends like within the last two years almost since the pandemic there's been an acceleration of people's ability to access really impressive healing gifts that are just like snapping and coming online and so it feels like as much as the darkness rises, so too will the support and the help and the light and it's just this natural balance to the order of things. Is it just a choice Aubrey? Is that what it all boils down to? Is it just some simple like when you're having a dream and you're getting chased by a lion and then you remember oh, it's a dream and then you just make a decision to go into a different dream is it as simple as that? Is it just that like whenever I'm getting all caught in the darkness or my own bullshit or watching Fox News all the time or like fucking to Sean Hannity or any of the weird shit that I've found myself doing I always and I start coming back to myself nearly always with the help of some psychedelic I'm kind of astounded by how it's just a choice like it's and maybe that's the painful part about it is that it's as much horror as there is in the world there's that much good but you're picking the horror to keep your mind fixated on you're picking or it's like this is really reducing things to the most idiotic level but like there have been times when I've been scrolling through my Twitter and I'm thinking God, Twitter, what a fucking garbage platform and then I remember I followed everybody who's tweets I'm reading you know what I mean I decided to tune into this is it just a choice? is it as simple as that? it is but it's a difficult choice because our mind can choose something very quickly our mind moves at the speed of light but we're actually making a choice that involves the entirety of our being all the way to our densest part and the density of our body are the different ways in which our receptor sites of our brain have been used to a certain level of melancholy been used to a certain level of stress so we actually have to choose not only once but keep choosing over and over and over again because the body moves like a tree that bends toward the light like we need to be the constant light sort and just wait for the branches to start moving that direction because it's not going to happen instantly you can't say hey tree there's the sun over there there's water over there send your roots there immediately and move your fucking limbs and get over there to that light like it doesn't work that way you can't even father or mother that's just like come on buddy and be sweet to yourself this was another adaptation that came from the ayahuasca it was like just be sweet be like I know buddy I know I know it's chaotic I know that you have a little anxiety I know I can feel it take some deep breaths that's it deep breaths alright keep going you're doing great just keep moving this way and you start just coaching yourself towards that direction I know I know it's scary it's alright come on we got this back towards the light back towards the light and it's just this constant steady steady process so yes it's a choice but it's a choice that has to be made extended over a longer period of time for it to actually stick Aubrey I love these conversations me too thank you so much please keep going you know it's been too long and when you come you know you come when you're coming back from these places it really is like you tell me things that sometimes a reminder sometimes it's brand new information but always you know what the healing that's the other great thing about healing it's contagious the same way sickness is contagious if you're healing yourself you might be surprised to find that people around you start healing too and that always happens when I'm having a conversation with you so thank you Aubrey yeah brother of course I wrote a poem that came through during ayahuasca that I wanted to share and we can close on that I'd love to hear it thank you alright ayahuasca is not a drug it is the drug it is the nothing will ever be the same change your fucking name scream at the top of your lungs writhe in the agony of ecstasy surrender to the mystery submit to the intensity of the fractal God thrust into polarity drug it is the antithesis of intoxication an annihilating sobriety waking you from the insanity of participation in your own delusion it is the antidote for the constant mendacity of the pretending masquerading wounded lonely scared little boy and girl in a world that needs love spray painting the masterpiece with the graffiti of the judge showing you that all along you've been wallowing in your suffering gasping for a breath of truth a fish with iridescent rainbow scales hooked by the seduction of power pulled from the sea of the divine stranded on the boat of purported progress fodder for the insatiable machine your pink flesh putrifying reaching for a prescription a vaccination to cure the desperation of living in separation all the while forgetting that you come from the ocean because all you see is the boat filled with dying aquariums ayahuasca is not an answer it is the answer to the riddle of why we are here it is a place where magic is real where dragons guard the horde of God the trees can speak witches open portals wizards sing incantations devils tempt you your shadows come to dance and angels whisper in your ear it is a journey into the underworld a descent into madness down a ladder of swirling vines a burning away of temporality in the white hot cosmic forge of eternal revivication it is a trip to a reality where all things have meaning where a breath can change everything tobacco can heal anything and there is nothing you are able to hide it's the most terrifying exhilarating life affirming plunge into chaos to seize the pen of your destiny and write an epic fucking story ayahuasca may not be for you but no one can do it for you just know she is there and she loves you the real you the one waiting to emerge you the not running anymore not hiding anymore stand in the storm of your pain screaming do your worst I'm here for it all you ayahuasca is not a drug it is medicine sign me up yeah man maybe one day we'll get to sit with the dragon together I would love that I'm ready now I used to not want to do it now I'm ready I mean I could like having had two kids I think that that's great preparation that's the ultimate

19^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 286: Meditation Class with David Nichtern Transcript and Discussion^2018-05-11^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, my sweet children of Poseidon. It is I, D Trussell, and I'm recording this DTFH from Maui. You might even hear the ocean in the background. I'm sitting in a little yurt right on the sea, where I have driven my van and where I've been hanging out for the last few days, communing with nature, but most importantly, communing with my surf bros who gave me a new name, Bonzo. I love surfing. I love catching shore breaks from the eastern side, and I love the feeling of riding a wave in and sliding down that tube. And most importantly, I love the community of surfers that I've met out here in Hawaii. And I deliver to you, people of the mainland, a message. Wherever you may be, the surfers of Hawaii want you to come out and join them in the waves. They want you to know that the stories about them being KG and territorial, potentially even violent, are completely not true. These surfers love nothing more than meeting new friends out there on the water, and many of these surfers would rather float out there in the water and chat with new surfers than actually surf. And they want you to know that the best thing you could do to make their day is to paddle out on your brand new surfboard and get right in front of them. That's called the line, where you see them floating out there. Just bring that board right in front of them, give them that hang-tin symbol with your hands, and one of them will swim up to you, and they're gonna bring you back to the main line, and they're gonna teach you how to surf, which is how I learned how to surf and how all of us learned how to surf. So don't forget, surfers love you, they're super cool, they're connected with nature, then they want you to join them out there in Hawaii. I gotta get back out to the waves, man. My dog just ran out there, and I've given up essentially all my material possessions, and all I wanna do is surf. So I'm gonna head out into the waves and the sweet drink and the great toilet that is the ocean, and I'm gonna float out there, and I'm just gonna feel superior to all you fucking assholes. I just got back from the Ram Dass spring retreat in Maui, and here's my big epiphany from the Ram Dass spring retreat, and there couldn't be a more boring epiphany that I can think of. And this epiphany is, I really have no idea how to meditate. And for some reason, all the various lectures I've heard on meditation and books I've read on meditation, they just haven't really stuck for some reason. And I've realized that all the other stuff, the ethereal stuff, the astral stuff, the woo-woo-ee stuff, and the really romantic, exciting stuff is a way that I've been distracting myself from just picking up a basic meditation practice. I'm sorry, it's just so boring. It's so boring. I would rather tell you guys that I had some kind of out-of-body experience and started shaking and merged with some kind of extra-dimensional love intelligence or that I realized that I was an infinite soul and that my body was a temporary wavering thing or that I connected with a satsang and merged with them. And sure, maybe that happened, but who cares? That's just a dream. The concrete thing I realized is I've been tricking myself into thinking that I have some kind of meditation practice by creating the idea that just walking around as a form of meditation or doing the podcast as a form of meditation or performing as a form of meditation. And for some people, maybe it is, but I've been tricking myself. I don't have a meditation practice. And what I realized is that's because I'd never had gotten really concrete meditation instruction from anyone. And so throughout this retreat, I've been talking with David Nickturn and he sat down with me one day and he taught me the basics of meditation. And it's very simple. And it's not really sexy or romantic or flowery. It's just very basic, which is exactly what I needed. So I decided, well, I'm just gonna start taking lessons from David who's been teaching meditation for I think 30 years, I don't know, very long time. And he studied under Chogyam Trumpa, who is one of the great meditation teachers of our time, who wrote many, many books. But one of them that I really enjoy is called Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism, which is just a very basic and sometimes painful to read approach to what spirituality is and what Buddhism is. And David was lucky enough to spend many, many years studying with this person. And now he teaches meditation. And so I've decided to sort of formally take him on as my meditation teacher. And I asked him if he would be willing to, instead of doing a regular podcast, give us a meditation class. And that's what this podcast is. It's just a basic meditation class. So if you've been wondering how to meditate, if you've realized that your meditation is just some amalgamation of bullshit that you've threaded together on a string of lies, then this could be the podcast for you. Also, if you're a master practitioner or you're a professional meditator and you've been winning all the big meditation contests, then this, maybe this will help you in your practice. So we're gonna jump right into this episode, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Simple Contacts. If you're somebody out there who wears contacts and you're sick of having to go to a doctor to get your prescription renewed, then Simple Contacts is for you. Now, here's the thing, I have 2020 vision. I am a fighter jet pilot and to even be licensed to fly fighter jets, which I do recreationally, I have to have 2020 vision. I've never worn glasses, I've never worn contacts. I have the eyes of an eagle, essentially. And I can zoom in on things with my eyes down to the microscopic level. This is why I don't even have, like if recently I wanted to find out what my sperm count was, I don't even have to go to the doctor for that. I just look at my cum and I can see the sperm swimming around in there. That's how great my vision is. But many of you out there have terrible vision. You're blind, some of you are close to blind or your eyes are blurry. You spent too much time staring at the sun or bleach got splattered in your eyes by your rotten kid brother, who later set a church on fire and is now doing time at a federal penitentiary for arson. Some of you spent too much time reading pornography and this melted your corneas and your retinas. And so you have to wear contacts. And I've never really experienced this problem before, but fortunately my wife Clancy has really terrible vision. It's just been described as the vision of a mole, kind of an underground subterranean thing. And so she's got to wear contact lenses. And so like all things I advertise on my podcast, I won't advertise it if I don't think it's amazing. And I got her to do a product test for me of these wonderful contacts. And so she's here with me today. I'm gonna do a quick interview with her and talk about her experience wearing simple contacts and how these things worked out for her. Clancy, thank you so much for helping me on my podcast. You're basically blind. And how, what's your vision? 2600. That's crazy. 2600, huh? Like that is so blind. It's really bad. So you have to go in to renew your prescription every once in a while. Every year, yeah. And what's that like going in it? I mean, it's annoying. It's especially annoying when your prescription has stayed the same for years and you're essentially just wasting money and time. So what is, what happened with this company? How does it work? You can go on and if you already have a prescription, you can just plug it right in and get your contacts. If you don't have a current prescription, you take an eye test, basically a vision test. You stand 10 feet away from the computer and cover one eye, read the letters, cover the other eye, read the letters, takes five minutes or less. And that's it, and then they send you contacts. And then you pick out the contacts you want and they have all the brands that other places do. Colored? I don't know. So just basic, not colored. I don't know. That would have been cool. That would have been cool. What color do you want my eyes to be? Black. Demon black. So you're wearing them now? You got the exact same brand that you got from your doctor. It's not like they're their own brand of contacts. You just pick out the brand you already use. So essentially this thing just saved you a doctor's visit. It's the same price as your brand. It's the same price. Oh, that's badass. You just don't have to go to the doctor. Okay, thanks Clancy. You're welcome. So there you go. My sweet, semi-blind, sort of blind or vision impaired listeners. This is a fantastic way for you to save some money as opposed to a $200 doctor's visit. This vision test is only 20 bucks. It's rated five stars over 3,000 times on the app store. You can text with a support team and always get to speak with a person, not a robot. And with summer around the corner, there's no shortage of reasons to have contacts on hand. Beach days, vacations. It's wedding season. I didn't even know that was a thing, but everybody's getting married right now. Why aren't you getting married? Maybe it's because you're not wearing your contacts or haven't gotten your contacts renewed and people can sense you've got those stinky old, stinky fungal contacts and those beautiful eyes of yours. Time to get some new contacts. Your eyes look like the swamps of Mordor with those nasty old contacts in. Don't put it off anymore.

He's a senior meditation teacher in the Shambhala Buddhist lineage of Chogyam Trumpa, Rinpoche and Sakyang Mifam Rinpoche. Probably pronounced that wrong. He plays guitar in Krishnadasa's band. That's what you call it. You call it a band. He also wrote a great book called Awakening from the Daydream, Reimagining the Buddha's Wheel of Life. And he happens to be an Emmy winning, Grammy nominated composer, guitarist and producer. And aside from all that stuff, he is a really funny, beautiful person. And I feel really lucky that he's agreed to be my meditation teacher. Feel sorry for him though. He's gonna be teaching a meditation class in Los Angeles and I'm gonna be taking that class. So if you wanna come and take a, it's basically a meditation teacher's training class. But you don't have to wanna be a meditation teacher to take the first class. The first class is a intro to meditation. And we're gonna go over some of the stuff that you hear in this podcast, but we're also gonna go deeper than that. So if you're interested in this and you wanna take a meditation class with me, also there might be some dialogue with me and David during this class. I'm gonna be there June 8th through 10th. The classes are happening June 8th through 10th and also August 3rd through 5th at the Samsara Center, which is the Los Angeles Samsara Center. You can find out about this by going to www.samsaracenter.com, Ford slash mindfulness path meditation. Also he's gonna be teaching some classes in New York. That's on May 22nd and June 12th. That's gonna be at Studio Guyum. And I'll have all the links to these at dunkintrestle.com. If you're interested, if you wanna go a little deeper into a very grounded, powerful style of meditation, come out to these classes. I'm super excited about taking up a formal meditation class and I'd love to see you there. So without further ado, everybody, please welcome to the Dunkintrestle Family Hour podcast, David Nickturn. The Dunkintrestle Family Hour. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, they'll be to you blue. Welcome to you. Wow, wow, wow. It's the Dunkintrestle Family Hour. Thank you, David, thank you so much for being on the show. We're in Hawaii, we're in, you know, it's a, well, no, it's raining. I was going to say we could go to the beach, but here we are. It will shift in any minute. If you want to understand impermanence, just study the weather in Maui. Yes, it always is changing. It's always changing fast. The, the, what I want to talk with you about, and usually with the podcast, it's like, not that we won't have, it might go into strange tributaries and who knows where, but one of the things I'm very excited about in my life right now is I've decided to start taking meditation teacher classes with you. And I've made the decision to do it and it's made me really happy. I'm excited about it. And you, we hung out the other day and you gave me what felt like a slightly formal instruction on how to meditate. And I realized, oh, I've never really gotten formal instruction in that way on how to meditate. So I thought for this hour or so, we could kind of treat this as though it were a meditation class of people listening who are wondering how to meditate and have been hearing me talk about it on and off forever, can finally hear one of the ways that it's recommended to meditate. Yeah. Well, it's a great topic because of course, there's a lot of interest these days. I would say maybe, maybe it's moving more into the mainstream in terms of something you'd consider trying. Right. So for example, in corporations and sports teams and fitness centers and things like that. So the question that is sort of surprisingly rarely addresses how to actually do the practice. Right. You know, it's like there's, and there is then, you know, a question of how clear the instruction actually is and how easy or user-friendly it is for you to actually follow it and then to develop the discipline to actually do it. Right. Well, I mean, this is one of the things you were, the comparison you made the other day to some, watching someone make an omelet, it doesn't know how to make an omelet. Yeah. It's an easy fix to tell someone, oh, actually, here's how you make an omelet. Yeah, it's an easy fix if two things are functioning. One is the person's curious in the first place. Right. And the other is that they don't have a lot of ideas that you need to remove before you can do the omelet teaching. Like if somebody's convinced that the omelet should be done up on the roof, on a hot day, you know. Like on that. Yeah, on a tile, a Mexican tile on the top of your head, you would obviously have to kind of disabuse them of that idea first or at least allow it to get aired out. Right. So let's start with what I would consider to be what many people think meditation is. So let's just start there and try to dismantle that. And I'll, even though after chatting with you, I have a different idea about it and I've looked into other things, but let's just start with the basic one. Meditation, here's what you do. Well, even before you go there, I call this framing, you know, you're building a frame for this picture before you start painting, you frame it. And meditation means a lot of things. Right. So the word meditation is a, you could say an umbrella term for a wide range of activities in which you are sort of working with the different elements of your mind and body to achieve a particular result. You know, I mean, it could be prayer, it could be mantras, it could be visualizing things, it could be running. Some people say they meditate when they're swimming or running. Flotation tanks. Yeah, it could be the notion of some people would think it's the idea of blanking out your mind so that it's sort of void. Yes. And therefore that would provide some relief to the activity in the mind, which might be stressful to that person. So there's so many variations. So the first thing it might be helpful to do is get an umbrella word. The word in Tibetan is gom, g-o-m, which just means to become familiar with something. So wait, the word for meditation is gom. Gom, g-o-m. No shit. And it just means to familiarize yourself with something. So therefore, meditation's always going on on some level. Your mind is tuning into a television show. Your mind is reading a book. Your mind is looking at your girlfriend and trying to figure out how many freckles she has on her face. Oh, yes. Or your wife in this case. Ha, ha, ha. You know, your mind is the part that's imagining how many freckles she may have had as a child. Yes. Your mind is leaping forward in the time domain to think about where you have to be later today. Yes. Your mind is regressing back in the past time domain to think, oh, I wish I hadn't done that. Yes. So that mind, that very mind that is creating some kind of object-subject relationship, is just becoming, tuning into a particular aspect of the experience and becoming familiar with it. That's the biggest definition of meditation. Wow. Wow. That is so cool. It covers all the things that are going on here. That's so different. So different than what I have thought and what people think, which is that it's this strenuous, active pushing down of thought frequencies to achieve some kind of like complete state of glorious, blissful, joyful happiness. This birds are landing on your shoulder. Oric fields are glowing. You know, this kind of, you know, there's a, if we look at like the, I don't want to say the TV version, the mythical version of it, it isn't something so simple. It's like, we're just getting familiar here with what's going on. And many, some people would consider what you're talking about meditation, and that's fine. I would compare it to a football game. It's the fourth down in your punting, basically, because you have no idea how your mind works. You just have a wish that it was something, somehow was different than it is and more pleasurable than it is. Right. You know, so there's not much sort of contact with the ball, with the fact that you have a bunch of downs. You could be moving the ball forward. Yeah. You're just punting. I gotcha. Can't use sports analogies with me anymore, David. It's not gonna work. I barely watch sports. Okay, but does that, does that one make sense? Yeah, it does make sense. It does. And maybe like another, to move the frame back a little bit, maybe you could talk a little bit about your particular lineage. So people understand that this is coming from a school, a Tibetan school. Is that what you would call it, a school? I think a school and lineage are both good ideas. The idea of lineage, let's just start there, is that somebody sort of discovered something and then they passed it along. The next person took and sort of on their own, rediscovered that thing, but with a little bit of guidance and then that's passed along. And so that you have a number of taste testers along the way. And it's not just somebody putting a plate of food in front of you and then you eat it and die. Okay, sure. Yeah, got it. So it's cumulative experience of a line of people who shockingly are very similar to us. It's, if you read the stories of the lineage people, they're not that different from us, even thousands of years ago. Really? Yeah, they're just, they got the same spilkis. You know what that word means? No. It's Yiddish for like kind of trouble. Same trouble. Same issues, you know? Well, this is something though, I mean, not to get away from the meditation instruction, but this is something that I actually got a little, not annoyed, or it bugged me, because they were, at the retreat, they were quoting Milarepa and they were talking about something about going up into a cave and looking out and then overcoming his fear of death or something. Do you remember that quote? Yes, and Milarepa, for those of people out there who don't know, was a famous Tibetan yogi, probably I think about the 10th century AD, maybe a little later. And really, a much more powerful way to think about Milarepa was he was a troubled teenager. Okay. Yeah, he was a wreck. Okay. And he got screwed up by his family, karma, you know, and his parents died and his uncle and aunt stole his inheritance. I mean, everybody wants to talk about the fact that he developed these miraculous powers and things like that. But really, his process with his teacher was just really working through some of his issues. So Milarepa was just basically like somebody who could easily have been on Jerry Springer or something. That's right. It sounds like it's like Redneck family stealing his shit. He's pissed off. I think it's much more helpful to think that way because we tend to attribute the miraculous to others and the shit pile to ourselves. That's right. So what about the middle way? What about working with what we have, seeing that has certain potential in it? There are certain issues. So this is a, you know, the Buddhist approach, which is yes, what my lineage is, it comes from the Buddhist tradition, specifically through the Tibetan evolution of Buddha's Dharma in, you know, from the eighth century AD to the present, particularly in the context that they had for whatever cultural reason, isolation, and therefore these teachings got really focused on as the centerpiece of the culture. So that's what's unusual about it. And particularly in the context that, you know, since 1959, Tibet has been, you know, spread, you know, because of the invasion of the Chinese, the Tibetan teachers who had been isolated are all over the world now. Right. So one of them was my teacher, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, who left Tibet in 1959, had to leave. It wasn't a choice, you know. He would have been murdered otherwise. Right. And, you know, so he was one of the first classically trained Tibetan teachers to come to the West in 1970. And so that's my lineage. I studied with that teacher and the continuity of that through the school that he established. And your lineage is also Pima Chodron. Pima was also a student of Trungpa Rinpoche. Many other wonderful teachers have spawned off there. Some you've heard of, some you haven't. It was a relatively big school. I would say there are hundreds and hundreds of, you know, trained teachers. Your son, Ethan Nicktern, who's been on the show. Same lineage. And this is Naropa? Naropa University in Boulder. Yeah. Was founded by Trungpa Rinpoche. But in the name of the school of Shambhala? Shambhala is the, if you are looking for this, you know, the, to follow along on this lineage, it's called the Shambhala School. So you, I guess if you just went to Shambhala.org, you could see all of those. So was it always called Shambhala or did that name happen when Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche came to the West? Well, actually it happened a little after he came to the West. And when we first started, it had more traditional Tibetan, Buddhist-y kind of names. In 1976, he started to write about the kingdom of Shambhala as his kind of metaphor for enlightened society. And he became, you know, very deeply connected with a hybrid really, I think a hybrid plant of the Buddhist plant, which is a way to present the Buddhist teachings in the essence of those in a cultural envelope that would be very appropriate for this time and place. Very easy for people to access from a secular kind of side. Yeah, sure. You know, without thinking I have to go, if I don't go do a three year retreat and join a monastery, I'm really not getting into the deep part of this teaching. Right, which is what I've thought in the past, many people have thought that, that that is the way that you really get in there because you have to go pure, shaved head, robes, incense, bye bye family, bye bye life. But that is- That's not the Shambhala view. Right. The view is that you could do it right here in this context. And in fact, there are certain dimensions to living in the world that actually can promote a very kind of sophisticated understanding what meditation is and what compassion is and what wisdom is. It's subtle. Because you and I could be here watching CNN or we could be actually talking to each other. It's as simple as that. Right. Yeah, that's what I've loved about chatting with you is that these things are just very, very simple. There's nothing, there's just nothing in it that seems, it's so pragmatic and it's so basic in the best way possible and the best, most positive use of that term, basic. But I want to ask you about what that means to be classically trained. Chogyam Trumpa is classically trained. So what does his childhood look like? And tell me a little bit about this training that he got and then let's talk about this very beginning phase of meditation that comes from that training. Yeah, that's great to understand. What classically trained meant in Tibet is like, I think the only equivalent that I can think of in the West is like Juilliard. Okay. Where somebody is considered to be gifted. In this case, they're at birth or shortly thereafter, they're kind of recognized as a gifted child in the sense of considered to be a reincarnation of a previous teacher. It's quite literal. He was the reincarnation of who? Of the 10th Trumpa Tulkoo. Okay. There were 11 of them. Okay. In some form of continuity from the previous ones. Do you believe that? I would say the simple answer is yes, because everything comes from somewhere. So it doesn't stretch my brain particularly to think that he would come from that. I don't want to get into a long metaphysical debate, but just speaking on behalf of skeptics of the world, you hear this stuff and the idea that, that sometimes in Tibet, oracles grok that some being has been reincarnated in this village or that village, they go to the village, they go to the parents, and they basically like take the child. It's a great honor. The parents are given some kind of benefit, I think, right? It's the equivalent of having a doctor or a lawyer. Right. There they wanted to grow up to be a Tulkoo. But in this case, in this case it's a, and please just let me do this. I have to say it just because it is something that's troubled me. Here we have a patriarchal, essentially theocracy, that is using some kind of oracle to determine, in the way royal families do it just through birth, they're using some form of oracle to determine that this soul has returned, and through that they continue this power structure, which was like ruling Tibet. And in there, do you remember one of my favorite parts in the Holy Grail is when Arthur comes upon those people in the mud who are like political in some way, and he says, you can't establish a monarchy just because of water he taught through his sword at you from a lake. Like how do you run a gun? So in that, please help me dispel. Well, you know what? You know what? I'd like to just cut through completely this issue and tell you that as far as this conversation goes, as far as I'm concerned, none of that has anything at all to do with what I'm about to say. Okay, great. Perfect. Beautiful. Great. In other words, that every, you know, you know, I went to Lucasfilm when they were first putting that studio together, and I was intrigued to think, to know that they put a backstory together for the plays that was entirely fictitious. Wow. You know, up in Northern California. But there it is, this massive studio, and you can go there and mix your music or do your work. So from my point of view, none of that really matters. Gotcha. Literally. It's sweet, it's intriguing, but I met this person, you see. Right. As one human being to another, and he could have been from the moon, as far as I'm concerned. And a lot of, he once said, if you had just met me in a bar, would you still study with me, or do you need this whole pedigree? Ah. And my answer is definitely, if I had just met you in a bar, I would still have studied with you. Oh, wow. That pedigree is, I don't wanna downgrade it or upgrade it. There's a lot of questions in the contemporary world about the whole Toku system, even among some of the Rinpoche's. But what we're talking about is verifiable in terms of one's own experience. Gotcha. And it's encouraged since the time of the Buddha to do it that way exactly. So there's no blind faith in this tradition. Right. There's no blind faith. You have to chew, you have to swallow, you have to, it has to feel right to you. Well, I mean, by blind faith, you mean no blind faith in the sense of the practice itself. But I mean, certainly you would have to have some. Any of it. Well, I mean, so in this case, it's just like some people are going to look at that Toku system as it's called and just think, it's a whole other conversation. My mind just thinks, okay, wait a minute, we've got some kind of soul network. They know how to come back. They come back here. Can't, this implies a kind of, I don't know, some kind of metaphysical substrate that souls travel. Well, Duncan, you knew how to get to my room to have this podcast. Right. I have a physical body. I have legs and arms and ears and a meat puppet. As Robert Thurman was saying, it's easy for me to shamble up here and sit down with the idea. But the meat puppet was getting directions from your mind, your consciousness, which knew you were going to room 136. It's not that, it's not that different. Death and reincarnation. Well, think about it. I mean, you have some intentionality. You have some understanding of where you're heading. You know where you're coming from. You're making decisions every minute. You decided to get married, you know? Well, yes. And sometimes I wonder if all of these decisions, who is making these decisions? I'm so glad it happened, all of them. And I'm so glad I came to the room. And I'm so glad to be here. But you know what? This is deeper metaphysics. And honestly, I only ask, in my mind, I've created the illusion. And let me cut through it again. It's also in play within the communities you're talking about. In other words, Trungpa Rinpoche, a lot of what he established in the West was based on a feeling that that form of continuity was not going to be appropriate for this country. Cool. Cool. There's a more merit-based system. That's pretty awesome. That's cool. I love that. And forgive me for any kind of accidental, I don't know, disrespect or not thinking it through whatever. I don't mean to, I really love that story. I think it's beautiful. And I think there's something in it that's so incredibly cool. And I want it to be real. But again, this doesn't really apply to day-to-day meditation practice, which is what I wanted to chat with you about. But it is the backdrop. It's fine to look in, it's fine to ask whatever question you want. Right. I come from a school, I could ask whatever question I wanted to. And I did. Right. So that's my model. That's the model. And so this thing that we're going to talk about now is something that has been cultivated, refined, and it evolves. This is not a static thing. This is something that is constantly morphing through time. Well, and coming back to the conversation about gum, you know, and just sort of becoming familiar with something, let's add one other dimension to what meditation is. Or how you could possibly look at this cultivation of something. In other words, it's when you cultivate something, you're putting time, energy, attention, and effort into that cultivation. Like if you're studying Qigong, if you're studying martial arts, if you're studying guitar, if you're studying painting, you're actually cultivating quality. And in this case, with meditation, we're cultivating kind of, you could say basic qualities, not skill at playing guitar, which is a very specific quality. But the qualities like focus, clarity, stability, insight, perspective, wisdom, compassion, empathy, energy, vitality, these kind of things. To cultivate those takes discipline and effort, because you're putting energy into it. To me, one of the exciting realizations I've had with this stuff is the realization that some of these traits, I know they could be refined, clearly focused, stuff that athletes, things like compassion to hear that it is possible. I think a lot of people just think everyone is kind of born with the ability to love. And it's a kind of equal thing. We know how to do it. And the way like a little turtle's not, it'll go into the ocean and swim. People just know how to love. People know how to like care. People, these things are not bicep style things. Like where your biceps can be like grown, or where you're... Yes, I understand. You know what I'm saying? So to me, there's something so beautiful about the idea that, oh yeah, these traits can actually, are not something you just know how to do right away. Well, and they, probably most of them are considered to be native abilities, natural abilities that we have, but they can be strengthened. Right. They can be cultivated. So one of the slogans we use in the teacher training program is, meditation has many benefits, but none at all if you don't practice. You know? And you sit around talking about it. You go like, okay, in what way did that strengthen anything other than your ability to talk? That is so funny. You know? So I think, you know, practice is a really key element. Yes. And in the trainings that we do, we really emphasize that that's really, you're tuning up your ability to strengthen through your own practice. And of course the view is important. So you're clear where you're shooting the arrow, you know, what your target is, but at the same time, it's not just theoretical. It's a sort of deliberate cultivation of these qualities. Okay, so let's go into. And one last thing on that. Yes. It does resemble the bicep in the sense that repetition is required. Like if you're training your bicep to be stronger, you use small weights a lot of times. Right. You don't lift, power lift, that doesn't strengthen your bicep. Right. So in the same way, meditation, mindfulness meditation by bringing your attention back to the breath in a simple, small way, many times, is how you develop the strength of attention. Okay. It's very similar, good analogy. Okay, got it. Great. So this is, I just, what I love about this lineage is that it is so not romantic. It is not, you know, because for, and I mean that in the, you know what I mean? It's not like, because for me in past, you know, what I would do when I meditate, like one of the great gifts you gave me in fact, was to implode an experience I had had meditating, which was that I had, you know, sort of sat down. Yeah. Summoned up, I did an internship at a Zen center when I was in college and I had this like, remembrance of doing that kind of. And so what I do is I go into a room, shut the door, sit down, try to kind of remember what the Zen thing was like, sit down, stare at the floor. I can't remember what it is, my thumbs apart or my thumbs together. And then I sit there and then what happens is, I'll start doing like a kind of like deep breathing. And then I'll be doing these spiritual breaths, right? And then like, and then I'll be doing these spiritual breaths and then a feeling will come, maybe. And then I'll be like, that's the feeling. Here we go, let's go into that feeling. And now I'm going to expand on that feeling. And then it's like, wait, no, you got to go back to your breath, forget that feeling. That has not, that's not what it is. It's something to do with your fingers or they apart where you could put a piece of paper through it. Oh shit, my face itches, man. I want to itch my face. I move my legs. Does this still count now that I've moved my legs? Is it negated the practice itself? Ah, this fucking sucks. What am I, oh my God, I've blended in with the entire universe. I'm becoming the universe. I have become the universe. Wait till I tell my friends about how I became the universe. That's- So when you do mindfulness, it's really simple. You notice you're in the middle of that particular kind of narrative. And when you notice, you label the thinking, you come back to the breath. That's it. That's it. That's so cool, man. No matter what the narrative is. Cause the narrative will have all kinds of seductive dimensions to it. And you go, wait a minute, I'm having a great thought here. I'm thinking about it getting enlightened. I'm thinking about, no, thinking, come back to the breath. Okay, so before we get into that, let's get into the structure of it. I want to talk about somebody listening to this, is going to turn this off maybe after they listen to it and they're going to go meditate. Great. So let's talk to them, you talk to them and say, here's what you do. If you want to go meditate after you listen to this podcast. So again, since there are many types of meditation, even within Buddhism, there are thousands of meditations, different practices. But the foundational practice is called mindfulness. That is kind of like, if you're building a house, that's the foundation. So you can't really be as effective with other types of cultivations if you do not create a proper solid foundation. The foundation is just your ability, raw ability to pay attention to what you're doing. And bring your awareness to what you're doing. So this practice is called mindfulness, right? This is what popularly called, sometimes in the Tibetan Buddhism is called shamatha, which is a Sanskrit word for calm abiding or kind of settling the mind. And it's really great to just have a simple idea of what this particular practice is. So mindfulness has just two very simple ideas. One is to bring the attention to one point, right? Our attention is usually, like when we were walking through the cafe here, you know, the restaurant, it's like, there's this person in there, but your mind is jumping around. Yes. Now when we're sitting still, our mind keeps jumping around, which people call monkey mind, frog mind, I call it spaghetti mind, James Joyce mind, you know, it's a- James Joyce mind. That's actually the most accurate one. That is it. Yeah. There's no periods. You know, it's just, it's just what you were just doing. Right. When you were portraying your own state of mind, it was, it was James, it was Joyceian. Right. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. No punctuation, no paragraphs, no indents, no nothing. Right. Stream of consciousness. Right. Now, so don't make war with that. You're going to lose. If you set up the meditation as I'm going to kill the monkey, you're going to lose. The monkey's going to kill you. It's like a video game. You, ah, you lost, you know? Yeah. So instead, just, you take a very open attitude towards the whole current state of your mind, but you introduce the idea of a focal point. Okay. Could be anything. It could be a picture or lamp, but we use the breath. Okay. The breath is always there. You don't need to remit, oh, I forgot to bring it. You know? Yeah, right. And it's also connected to your sort of present kind of physical situation. So it brings mind and body together. Right. So you simply bring your attention to the breath. Okay. That's it. That's one point. Then the other point is whatever arises in your mind while you're attempting to cultivate that capacity is considered to be, you could say fundamentally unproblematic. There's no fundamental problem with the process of thinking and creative mind and torturing yourself, whatever the heck you're doing. Right. It is helpful to acknowledge it and recognize it without trying to reject it or without trying to act it out further. That's the key point. You have a thought like you had. You don't have to suppress it, as you said earlier. You also don't have to go, if you're thinking about chocolate ice cream, you don't have to get up from the cushion and go get chocolate ice cream. Right. You just see the thought as it is with a kind of unbiased awareness and then label it thinking and bring your attention back to the breath. Over and over again. How am I sitting when I'm doing this? Where am I sitting? Okay, so that's the theory of it, is that by bringing your attention to a more focused state, you achieve a kind of clarity of mind and a stability of mind. Okay. And it's verifiable. I think anybody who sits for 20 minutes a day for a month will experience this as part of the outcome. So then we say there's just three steps to actually doing this kind of mindfulness meditation. The first one is taking your seat. That's what it's called. The seat is you kind of allowing your body to be in a stable relationship to the space you're in as opposed to moving around through it. So the seat can be a cross-legged position on the floor. That's traditional or on a cushion. Helpful for most people to get your butt up a little higher. You can cross your legs simple style. Sorry, sorry. What's your take on like Zafu cushions, those rice cushions you can buy at shop? Is there one cushion preferable to another cushion? I'm sitting on a hotel couch cushion. But obviously if you're gonna have a regular meditation, those Zafus are great. There's one called agamden, which is more rectangular. People have their own preferences. You should get your butt up high enough so that your knees are below your hip points. Because otherwise you'll stress your back out. And you can sit either simple cross-legged position or one of the more yogic kind of postures like the half lotus or easy pose. Any of them is fine. Doesn't matter at all. And then if you're not comfortable sitting on the floor, i.e. you're a westerner and maybe you're not used to it, then sit on a chair, it's fine. It's totally fine. So you mean sit on a chair with your feet on the ground? Put your feet on the ground in front of you like shoulder width apart. Try to sit up so that you have some kind of strength in your posture as opposed to kind of slumping back. Again, this depends on your body and your needs and any back injuries you have to take into account. And then you can just rest your hands on your knees down, face down, hands down. This is a, there are many, now here again, there are many gestures, mudras that people use to meditate with the thumb and the index finger joined or the zen mudra, the cosmic mudra. They're fine if you know what they are. Go ahead, but otherwise I consider it mostly it's like some extra thing that you don't even know why you're doing it and it's like am I doing that right? It looks cool. Well, yeah, I mean it's better to feel good than to look good when you're meditating. That's clear as a bell. So, you know, the simplest posture is just rest your hands down on your thigh or your knee, depending how long your arms are. And then you might want to have a sense of extending your spine. We say lengthening the spine as opposed to straightening the spine, that's a yogic thing. Obviously the spine is not straight. Right. You want to have a nice long upright spine. Okay. Relaxed shoulders, you know. We say the back is strong, but the front is soft and open. And then as you move into the head, there's a feeling of kind of lofty, you know, the head is kind of the peak of the experience of the mountain, you know, and there should be feeling good head and shoulders like you're sitting upright, like a kind of, you know, warrior or, you know, somebody with a lot of confidence and well-being. That's cool. So as you move from this, go back to the slump. And now, if you take your seat, right, you feel different. That is cool. Yeah. So there is a warrior image that works. There's a lot of different images. Wow. Then, Wait, I'm sorry. What is the, because you know, it's Buddhism. It's like one of the things someone said at the retreat is, what do they say? Christians love God. Wait, wait, how does it, what do they say the thing about lists for God, for Buddha? I knew I was ruined it. What was it? Christians love God, Buddhists love lists, something like that. I didn't hear that one. But, Oh, that's beautiful. That's funny. But it's the, you know, so it's usually pretty detailed here. Is there a more detailed description of this warrior position like who? Oh yeah. I mean, each of these, I would say that if you start to get into any discipline, and that's the thing, people flit around, they never get into the depths of any of it. That's the problem with the new age approach, is you're at a supermarket and you're collecting, or you're at a convention and you're collecting brochures from all these different traditions. I did ayahuasca and I went to the shaman and then you, and then I went to the Buddhist retreat. I did a Vipassana retreat. And now I'm going to this Christian thing. You'll never get into the depth of any of it, is my opinion anyhow. Right. You know, now that doesn't mean you're biased and you're saying, well, this is the best one. You don't have to have that extra attitude. And you could stay curious about the other ones, but in our tradition, we say, you know, if you go deeper, it's going to be better for you. Gotcha. You know. Choose a lineage and get into it more. The warrior, is there a specific being that you're supposed to picture here? Well, in Shambhala, the warrior image is a profound image. In that, the central energy of the warrior image is confidence and bravery. Okay, cool. Now we live in a time when cowardice and freak out are pretty prevalent. Yeah, sure. You know, so it's an attempt to strike an archetype that will help human beings re-arouse their original confidence. Gotcha. Right? Yeah. It's not about fighting and being, you know, a killer and it has nothing to do with that image. So, and that's not the image of a samurai either, or any of the warrior, really good warrior traditions. It's not like this is the guy who's going to go around beating everybody up. No, no, we were talking about this too. Anytime I've been hanging out with Joe and you meet these MMA people there, that's exactly what they're, they're relaxed, they're confident, they don't seem dangerous at all. They just seem very, you know, if anything, very kind and they're, they're cool. It's, I've never been around one of them and felt in danger, though at times I've been like, shit man, this guy like is trained to kill people. And yet he seems so relaxed and legitimately cool. Yeah. So yes, okay, so I understand. Well, the warrior tradition obviously includes things like martial arts, but in this context of Shambhala, we're not, we're talking about basically two qualities, fearlessness and gentleness. Cool. And overarching is restoring some kind of natural, authentic being and confidence. That's cool, man. And that it's there, you just have to bring it out more. Okay, I love it. So, as you're sitting, you're embodying that. You are embodying that. Okay. Just physically, you, you, you see somebody sitting like that, like when I teach a group of people and they all just take, they just have done the first step of taking their seat, already the room feels different. Right. A room full of people, you know, who've taken their seat has a certain feeling to it. No, I'm sitting like this now. I feel completely different. It's, it's, it makes me think about the Mujras more and think, shit man, maybe there is something like to the circuitry of energy running through it. Oh, there is. There definitely is. But that, that's further along too. And there's many, that's why I say there are thousands of dimensions to meditation. This is laying the foundation. Okay. And if you skip this, God help you. You know what I mean? Right. It's like, I don't know what's gonna, if you start doing fancier meditations with energy and visualizations and mantras and your mind has not been stabilized in this way. You haven't been able to create some kind of foundation. It's easy to see how the rest of it could go, could get weird. Real quick. This is, well, you know, even as insane and like wild as Crowley is, this is in the very beginning. This is the, this is what he was like. It's like, learn this basic stuff before you do anything else. You've got to learn this, this basic, basic stuff. And I've skipped over. It's so easy to skip over. Yeah. So here we go. So we're sitting, our hands are on our knees. We're up to the head. And so the neck and shoulders should be loose, but you know, kind of upright. And then there's this whole area of the sense perceptions. So we have five sense perceptions. And the idea in mindfulness is you don't shut them down. There's no benefit to shutting them off. Okay. To go into some kind of inner space. But at the same time, we don't indulge them the way that we normally do. So it's kind of a middle way approach. So the eyes are open with a soft downward gaze. And it's maybe you could just relax your gaze about six feet on the floor in front of you. I want to ask, I wanted to ask you about this in particular. Let's say that you're in a space where you don't have six feet in front of you, or it's, there's stuff on the floor, there's shit scattered around. What about that? Yeah. Again, these are, you and I taught yesterday and I said the main thing, the way we teach is principles rather than rules. Because if you understand the print, the principle of the eyes open is that you're not shutting down the awareness fields. Gotcha. You're including them, but you're not, you're not focusing on them in the same way you normally do. So it's like, almost like dimming the lights in a room a little bit. There's a softer kind of feeling to the sense perceptions. What I mean is like some, like some. You could just drop the gaze further. What if I'm just, this is a kind of a ridiculous example, but it's not quite a ridiculous example. Some people, maybe he's even some people listening to this right now. Their apartment is a pigsty. Like their clothes are scattered everywhere. They've got, they've, they're in the middle of a real freaking mess. So when I was in, when I was in our hotel room, which is just like, because we're packing up and it was just shit scattered everywhere this morning meditating. One of the questions I had for you was, is it okay for me to just stare through the mess or to include the mess within the thing? Cause then it turns into like, well, I got to clean first before I meditate. And then I'm sure as hell, I'm not going to meditate. You know what's great about that question? It's born from practice. Ha, ha, right. That's cool. These are the questions we like. Yeah. If somebody's saying, well, what about if I visit, you know, well, let's start from where you are, start from what you're experiencing. So the obvious thing is ideally, it's good to have a clear, clean space in which, if you're sort of talking about a clean, clear approach towards mind. Right. You know, it's reasonable to think you could just clean up your room a little bit first. If you can't, maybe just clear a space. Okay, you know. Got it. Yeah. But you will begin to think, well, what is the space I'm in like? Because we're not shutting down and going to what I call the secret garden meditation. It's an inner landscape and it's opening up to you and it's got this whole other quality than your actual life does. Right. This is much more integrative. Okay. Much more, whoa, what does your room look like? Gotcha. You're talking about developing mindfulness and awareness and that means that your room is not reflecting that. Right. Your environment's not reflecting that. Right. Your ecology is not reflecting it. Right. We have an unmindful ecology right now. Yes. You know, if somebody was practicing mindfulness, there's no way they could just say, let's just pour plastic into the ocean. Right. It's not mindful. Right. You have to be kind of a zombie for that to make sense. Yeah. And so we're not promoting, and this is, if I can get one idea across to people, we're not promoting meditation as either a deadening or a tranquilizer. It's an awakening quality and it's becoming more mindful, more aware and less distracted. And therefore you will become more aware of your emotions. You'll become more aware of your irritation, your boredom, your frustration. Yes. You'll become more aware of your tendency not to want to be where you are. Yep. You'll become more aware of the mess that you've created around yourself. So it's not going to necessarily lead to a kind of superficial tranquility. Right. Which a lot of people need these days because they're so stressed out. Yes. But it does have a kind of settling influence so that you can look at those things and not panic. Gotcha. Yeah. So it's not trying to create panic, but it's also not trying to create a tranquilizer. Got it. Okay. So I'm sitting, I'm looking six, I'm looking downward gaze six feet ahead, hands on, palms on my knees. Good posture. Nice. Good posture. Nice fell down, right? Yeah. Good posture. And now what? Okay. So that's step one. That's called taking your seat. Okay. So, and to review the points of that, good strong connection with your butt and the seat, a cross-legged or kneeling or sitting on a chair, kneeling is okay too. Resting the hands down, face down on the knees or the thighs, depending how long your arm is. Extending the spine, strong back, soft front. Chin tucked in a little bit if you're used to it, like sticking your head out. And then the eyes open with a soft downward gaze about six feet on the floor in front of you. That's taking your seat. Step one. So when we, after we train in that, when we say take your seat, everybody knows what that means. Step two, place your attention on the breath. Okay. That's a very specific instructor. Your attention is wandering most of the time. You can track it. You know, your attention is on a variety of different mental events. Yes. It can be pulled away into sensual events. Yes. It can be pulled into emotional, energetic fields. But in this case, we're saying just the feeling of the breath. This is not an idea. It's just, how does the breath feel in and out? And traditionally, either at the tip of the nose or just feel the full cycle of the breath. So, and this- Am I supposed to be doing in through the nose, out through the mouth? Yeah, yeah. It doesn't matter. I mean, the idea is that you can add more and more details to this. And sometimes I prefer not to over detail. You're breathing. Got it. Okay. Now, obviously if you know anything about anatomy, it's better to breathe through your nose. You get more oxygen if you breathe in through your nose. Right. So, and the out breath has a little bit more of a dissolve out through the mouth, but it's really up to you what feels comfortable each person is doing. When I was doing this this morning, I realized, man, you're not taking very deep breaths. You seem to be a pretty shallow breather. And then I thought, well, then I should change my breath and start being a better breather. And then I thought, well, if you change your breath, David was telling you, just watch yourself breathe, don't make any adjustments. And so then I found myself getting in this kind of weird, neurotic relationship with my breath itself, thinking like, well, shit, man, you're a terrible breather. Why are you breathing like this? You need to fix your breath, but if you fix your breath, you're going against the instructions. Well, here's the thing, Duncan. The image that comes to mind is you're playing ping-pong, but you don't have a, you don't actually have a partner. So you hit the ball and then you run around to the other side of the table, hit it back. Then you run around to the other side of the table, hitting back. A lot of our internal dialogue has that kind of dynamic to it. So we talk about the middle way a lot. And the way that's expressed is not too tight and not too loose. So that sets you into a kind of moderate approach. So for example, we say, we're not doing pranayama. We're not manipulating the breath towards some effect. That's a legitimate practice. You should do pranayama if you want to do pranayama, but that's not this. Okay, got it. Pranayama has a lot of benefits, none of which will accrue if you don't practice them, but that's not this practice. This practice is mindfulness, mindful attention to the breath. And so each time the breath goes in and out, you just feel that you're not trying to deepen it, but it might, you know, as you sit, you might find it just naturally deepens a little bit. Got it. Right? And if you need to sigh, I think somebody like you needs to sigh every once in a while. I do. I do, I just sighed at Montefood's and my wife, Erin, was like, I heard that sigh from across the vitamin aisle. Exactly, yeah. And also, you know, with the sigh, there's a sound, that's actually a mantra called ah. It's sort of a very simple, but profound. And most people can't make that sound. They can't release enough to make that sound. Right. I love it when those happen. Yeah, so if you need to release, you know, you could just take a release. Okay. You're finding your way into it, but the general thing is not too tight and not too loose and we're not trying to manipulate the breath. Just be aware of it. Got it. Mix your awareness with the experience of breathing. Okay. Then, you're doing that. Wow, this is easy. And the mind is like Road Runner. Oh yeah. It's still got momentum and inertia, so it's gonna go somewhere. It's gonna go like, oh, it can't be this simple. Yeah. Right? How could that be? And then as we treat these people, we're talking about these exotic states and beyond death experiences, how could just me sitting and the mind starts to go, blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub-blub. And then, before you know it, you're thinking about lunch and whether they're gonna have cookies or not at lunch. Yeah. And then before you know that, you're planning out your swim for the afternoon. And then before you know that, you're thinking about my fucking schedule for the next month is insane, you know, and I can't keep up with myself and my own life. I'm not enjoying my life. And, you know, all of a sudden there's a little, a little moment where you recognize that you wandered. Right. And you're lost in thoughts. Yes. Not just thinking about lost in it. Sure. That moment of recognition is a kind of natural, little bubble moment of awakening. You just come to. Okay, cool. It happens on its own. Fuck, what is that? That is the kind of awakened mind just peek peekabooing. Who did that? Nobody did that. It just happened. Whoa. There's no, I've never thought of that. That is so weird and terrifying. Well, however, when you have that little moment of opening, you say thinking, you label that whole diorama that you had been creating. You labeled thinking. Thinking. One word. That's what it is. It's nothing other than that. And this word during this retreat has come up of a spiritual bypass? We'll get to that in one minute. Let's get through the three steps. So the practice then is bringing back, once you label thinking, let it go. Okay. Okay. It's already gone, by the way. You don't really have to let it go. It's gone. Then you bring your attention back to the breath and be more mindful of the breath for a period of time. Then your mind will wander again. Now, here's an important, second important point. There is no problem that you're trying to solve. Okay. Cool. Good to know. I mean, maybe relatively the problem is that you've got spaghetti mind. Right. It's not really the best kind of mind. When I was doing it today and I'm sitting there, the problems that were emerging were, well, you're obviously not very good at breathing. And then it was on top of that. I was like, man, there's some anxiety in there. Like, look at that fucking anxiety, man. You are, look at that. You're in a hurry. It was mainly just like, shit, I'm in a hurry, man. I gotta get to breakfast. But it's not so much thoughts as much as a kind of like, weird, someone's beating a slave ship drum in my heart really fast for no reason. And it's, you know. Boy, write that one down. Somebody's beating a slave ship drum in my heart for no reason. And it's driving my whole life. Yeah. And then I want to fix that. That's called duke. That's the first noble truth right there, man. That's suffering. Yeah. That's the truth of, the word duke means more like underlying anxiety. You know, there's some kind of, I call it like a ground hum. Yeah. It's underneath. Yeah, that's a good way to put it. It just never feels. The face you're making is the face it makes. That's exactly it. I wish we caught that on camera. That's it. But here's the thing. There you are. You've found yourself exactly at that point, which is profound. You're not trying to get out of it exactly. And you're also not gonna keep doing it. Right. So that's a very interesting space, right? It's called awareness. Awareness is a space in which you see what's happening and you're also not just gonna reconnect with that momentum and that inertia. Right. Of insanity, basically. Right. So that's a really key cultivation. That's the mind of, which we called the other day, the abstract watcher or the witness, you start to see yourself much more clearly. You know, what your own process is. It really has nothing to do with what's happening externally in your life, interestingly enough. Nothing. It's really an internal exploration. But to get back to the not fixing thing, it's that the impulse immediately is to fix that. Immediately to like, well, take a bit deeper breath. Maybe it'll go away or you know, it's very difficult to encounter that kind of internal muscle cramp and not try to massage it out in the moment when you're meditating. Right. What you're saying is don't. Just go back to the breath. But we have to address one more little detail, which you brought up in the form of bypassing or kind of not acknowledging properly what feelings that might come up for you. Right. Because then it becomes repression or suppression. Right. And that is subtle. And I would say that's what Trungpa Rinpoche used to call spiritual materialism. You think you're gonna fix it. Yes. So how not to do that is subtle. And the way we do it is by, you could say taking a friendly attitude towards the whole thing. Okay. Like, okay, yes. I'm an anxious mess by my own description. Yeah. And I'm sitting here and I have this simple job of just, can I just breathe and be with it? No, I can't because I keep getting grabbed, seized up by my own underlying anxiety. Which manifests as a number of different narratives that are going on. So the point is we touch in on that without rejecting it, then let it go. Got it. Okay, cool. That's called touch and go. So if you only remember two things from this whole talk, not too tight and not too loose and touch and go. Not too tight, not too loose, touch and go. Yeah. That's cool. So you have the feeling, you're not trying to suppress the feeling, but you also don't entertain it further or engage it further. Okay. Got it. So you will see. I find years and years later, I'm just still seeing, wow, that's my mind. That is, this is the mothership. This is where it's all being emanated from. And it's got some, still some tendencies to fashion reality in a way that's not really pleasing. That's right. To put it lightly. Yeah. But before you see that, if you try to change that before you really see clearly where that's happening, how that's happening, you'll put the wrench in the wrong place, probably. Absolutely. It's like, you know, you smell something burning in the house and then you go to something that isn't burning and pour water on it. Ha ha ha ha. You know? Yeah. But I think one of the things we're trying to... That's amazing what you just said. Oh, thank you. We have to think about that one. Okay. Something's burning in your house and you're running around pouring water on the stuff that's not burning. Yeah. Yes. And then you pretend to not smell it anymore. The thing you said to me yesterday, because I was, we were talking and I was saying, whenever I meditate, which is rarely, I always think, why don't I do this more often? Yeah. And you asked me a question that was so brilliant, which was, well, what's the answer to that? And I had to pause for a second because I realized like, shit, what is the answer to that? That's a question I asked myself, but I don't answer. And then you said, what I find is that it's, there's some discomfort. There's some things that you start seeing that aren't comfortable. And so it seems like, and I was thinking, yeah, that's clearly the answer, which is like, let's face it, man, when you're meditating, you aren't doing universe merging. You're like witnessing a lot of pain and a lot of confusion and a lot of just disjointed various levels of displeasure. So that's a pretty good reason to not do it. Yeah. And I think maybe that's perhaps the reason some people don't do it. It is absolutely the reason that people don't do it or develop resistance to deepening their practice, but it's also, it can be not clear that that is part of the practice. So by including that, you change, it's like you had a whole room in your house that you're not using, you haven't opened the doors to it. Right. The house is bigger than you think. Right. It includes all that stuff. Right. It's not like we have to get rid of that, like call the dump truck, empty out that room, and now the house is good. You're allowing, and this is very compassionate, you're allowing yourself to be who you are. Yeah. As you are. And considering the whole thing workable. So we now have this not too tight, not too loose, not too tight, not too loose touching go. We have these two things to refer to. And the three steps of the meditation. Take your seat, bring your attention to the breath, and when you notice your lost in thought, label thinking, come back to the breath. Okay, but let's, and this is probably a relevant question, but now that we're done meditating. Oh, just some details. And I asked you this yesterday. Bell, no bell, incense, no incense. Do you set a timer? How do you do it? Do you set a timer? I just put my watch down and I look at it periodically too. And well, here's a good point. When you practice, it's advised that you set a time that you're gonna practice for and stick to it. Right. In other words, you don't just sit down at the beginning and go like, I'll get up when I feel like it. Because you're gonna get to a certain difficulty and then you're just gonna sort of take that as your cue to leave. Get the hell out. Yeah, like a relationship, you know what I mean? Yes. So say I'm gonna sit for 20 minutes and then sit for the 20 minutes. Get married to the 20 minutes. Get married to the 20 minutes, beautifully put. And it- Does everybody know this as part of your present reality? It's floating out there now, I think. All right, so we're out now though, that's for sure. Yeah, for sure. But I wanna talk about the watch thing. Yeah. Because I've always thought that every time I look at a watch or every time I go out of the meditation to look at this thing or that thing that I have actually ruined the meditation. Well, ruined the meditation. You just took a pause and looked at your watch, actually. That's okay. That's what you did. How did you ruin the meditation? You just took a pause and looked at your watch. That's what happened. Because my idea of it has always been this strict, kind of like, I don't know, like this like almost like an endurance trial, which is if you look away from this point at all, forget it, man, you gotta start over again. Not too tight and not too loose. Cool. It's too tight. Now, if you recognize that quality in yourself, set a timer. You know, use inside timer or whatever it is. No, I love this. I use inside timer, but usually right around the three minute mark, when there's three minutes left, I'll start looking over to see like, how much fucking longer does this go on for? The most panic that anybody has in a meditation hall is when the timekeeper falls asleep. Does that happen? No. Now I'm here forever. Ha, ha, ha. Instant trip to the hell realms. That's so funny. But yeah, you can do it. Look, you can do it either way. I think you'd start to develop a feeling of what 20 or 30 minutes feels like and then you look a couple of times. That's what I tend to do. But you could just set the timer. That's really legitimate to set that inside timer and just leave the timing up to that. But it doesn't matter. God, I love it. That solved a huge problem in my understanding of this. And you don't, the bell and the incense, you can have whatever ornaments you want, but basically, the process is quite reductive. So if you like incense, because it clears the kind of atmosphere in the room, it's fine. Some people these days are allergic to it. They don't use it. And I don't know what you'd use the bell for. I use the bell to time for other people. It gives you this feeling that you're like some kind of like holy being. You're like, bang, I'm ringing my bell, man. I don't even have a bell. I just always think about that. But now one last question. You're done meditating. Now what do you do? Yeah. You know, the mindfulness practice has a corollary. It has a formal practice. And really, I recommend to people, you really are gonna have a hard time cultivating this quality of mindfulness if you don't do some formal practice. It's possible, but really you've reduced your odds considerably. But that is to continue being mindful in everyday life. Oh, okay. That's called post meditation practice. And you could even say it's a formal practice, like we're doing it right now. We're not formally sitting, but we are kind of keeping some sense of accountability for where our awareness is. That's right. And the more you do the formal sitting, the easier it is gonna be to keep a thread of that going throughout the daily life. Gotcha. What I meant, now, and thank you for that answer, what I meant is directly after meditating. Like what I noticed today was I'm like, oh, okay, great, let's move. And I got up and like, you know, is there some prayer or is there some? Oh, okay, I see. Well, now again, these practices are reduced from a much deeper well of practice because you could think, well, why am I meditating? What's my motivation for meditating? And you could think, well, I just wanna get more sane and kind of clear and then we'll see what happens. But in the traditions that we come from, there's already the idea of maybe it's gonna be helpful to your friends too and other people. So in the beginning of certain formal practices, we do what's called arousing bodhicitta or kind of, you know, sympathetic heart. You know, you think about others. And then at the end, you could do a little dedication to others, like may all beings be happy, you know. Will you say that, the entirety of that, how that goes? May all beings be happy, may all beings be, what is it? Free from suffering. Free from suffering. That's one, may all beings never be parted from freedoms to joy, which is joy and then equanimity. May all beings, there's a number of different ways to say it, but free from attachment, aversion and ignorance. So the idea is that these come from different traditions. So, you know, you could get clear on, you could even write your own, you know. May all beings be happy and at their ease. So it's just you're wishing well. You're, it's called dedicating the merit. Okay. So in other words, if there's any benefit that happened, it's not just for me, it's, I'm spreading it around. Love it. And that can really, you know, that can be a very beautiful thing to do. That's, I don't ask people who are new to the practice to do something like that because it's already got a sort of Mahayana kind of flavor to it. What is, some people may be on no mind. You know, compassion and compassionate flavor to it. Well, wait a minute, am I doing this for other people? Now, first you're doing it for yourself. That's okay. Well, when you say may all beings, then you are included in that category. But then you get into, as you know, with those more progressed practices like meta and loving kindness and things, you really start thinking about other people. Yeah. You know, as, and you even think about people you don't like. Yeah. Right? So that's interesting. Yes. Well, that's the, yeah. I love all that, but you know, that is. It's another podcast. It's another podcast. It's another two million podcast, which I hope we have. So, and I'm already mentioned this at the beginning of this. I just haven't done it yet. So I'm going to start studying with you and you are teaching in Los Angeles a meditation teacher training. That's right. A mindfulness meditation teacher training program. But the first, which is a hundred hour program at Samarasah Center in Echo Park, LA. And the first weekend is June 8th to 10th. And then there's another introductory weekend in August. And then there's some level two and level three in the fall. Now, the level one is a basic introduction, just like what we've been talking to, to the whole Buddhist path and the topic of mindfulness and meditation as a whole. It's like a survey. I call it a Disney, we go to Disneyland and we go to Buddha land. Okay. And I give you the whole tour. Great. So that's good to have a framework of where all this is coming from. And it's of course also introduction to mindfulness and the path of meditation. So that can just be taken on its own. Will there be meditation during this training? Absolutely. Yeah, we always practice. And how? My lineage, we don't just talk. Okay, cool. There's always practice. But you're just saying like, to me it seems so lofty to think, I'm taking a meditation teacher class. So you're just saying don't... No, the level one is a hybrid of the level one of the meditation teacher training and also just on a standalone introduction to mindfulness and the path of meditation. So it can be just taken as a very good overview and introductory program. But why become a meditation teacher? Why do we need certification? What does all that mean? Yeah. There's so strong an interest in mindfulness these days because it's been written up so much in the cover of Time Magazine. So so many people are curious about it. So my sense of it is that there are not a lot of people who are just trying to give a clear, cogent, precise definition of what that practice is. Right. So for me it's like the Revolutionary War and the armies are coming and you gotta get some soldiers out in the field. Give them a musket and get them out into the field. So I feel it's very simple to learn mindfulness meditation. It is not a kind of deep, arcane, intricate thing and that people can learn how to do it in 100 hours and can learn how to teach to other people. But it's not required. It's like you could take the training just to train yourself. No, I think it's beautiful what you just said. That is the reason is because it's like you learn how to teach this stuff because if you personally, for me it's just, how can that hurt? To have an actual, specific, precise framework through which to talk about these things because so many people I run into are really interested in and what can I say? Because I will read this book or that book. Yes, and I feel confident saying that at the end of this 100 hour program you would be able to give a very simple, direct answer to what it is and how to do it. And it's not science fiction. And this is also what I'm just learning from these brief lessons with you. I don't know that this is something you can learn from a book. This feels like you need a person to talk to and ask real basic, basic questions. Like what if there's a sock on the floor when I'm looking? This is what you asked today? Yeah, that kind of stuff. So it does feel like this requires help to learn. The books can help you, it's like the map of Italy and going to Italy. Right. It's good to have a map of Italy. So this is how you go. But now you're getting a guide. You're in Italy and you have a guide. So these classes are June? When are they going? June 8th to 10th in Los Angeles at the Samarasa. If you want to see it, you can go through the link through my website, davidnickturn.com. And it has, on my schedule, it has it there. Or you can go to Samarasa, S-A-M-A-R-A-S-A center. You can go to their website. I'll have the links. And I'm going to be at the June one, you guys. If you want to come, begin meditation, training with me. Come to the June one. Maybe I'll do the, can you do both? Or is it just? People often retake. Yeah. I'll probably have to retake. But I'm definitely doing the. But here's the thing, Duncan. It might be interesting just even in the context of that, maybe we could just have a little dialogue. I love it. You could be like the kind of, you know, everybody has questions, but you know, have a space. There's a lot of time for dialogue. Great. It's an important part of it. And we don't spoon, you know, force feed. We're cultivating inquiry and cultivating what you and I called Prajna yesterday, you know, like discriminating mind. Yes. So you rep, to me, if you, if this was a Buddha's original group, you would represent what I think Ananda represented. It's like. The confused man. Well, but with good questions. Ah, cool. Not Ananda. It was, oh, I forget, one of the students was like had a really sharp, inquiring mind. Well, let's do it, man. I mean, I just love this, this field. What I really like about it is it is so, and I, so formal. And I like that it reminds me of swimming lessons or guitar lessons or when I learned how to kayak or those kinds of things. I really like it because it's just very grounded. And I'm really enjoying it. And yeah, I'll see you in June for sure. Very good. Thank you so much for this. OK, thank you, Duncan.

This is a podcast being broadcast from deep underneath Mount St. Helens. I live in a tiny metal box and I don't know how to get the fuck out of here, but they've given me recording equipment and some top-tier Wi-Fi so I can blast my ramblings out to you. If you've noticed that the intros have seemed a little abbreviated lately, it's because right now I'm moving. All of my material possessions are in a truck headed towards Austin, Texas, and I'm traveling doing stand-up comedy, so I'm doing these short intros. I hope you don't mind. Don't worry, starting next week I will once again drop the sweet flowers of my beautiful voice and my incredible musical ability deep into your waxy ear holes. I also want to invite you to come see me in person. If you're listening to this on the week of June 6th, you can come see me and Johnny Pemberton at the Helium Comedy Club in Philadelphia, and then two weeks later I'm going to be at Zany's in Rosemont, Illinois. All the links you need to get tickets are going to be at dougatrussell.com. And until then, we're going to do these abbreviated intros, and by the way, we don't need some complex intro because today's podcast is with a Taoist monk, Monk Yanru, who blew my fucking mind. Are you kidding me? Wait till you hear this. This is why I podcast for conversations like this. You want to hear a Taoist monk's near-death experience and vision of the apocalypse? You're going to get that. You want to get an introduction to what Taoism is, or listen to a podcast that's probably going to piss off the Chinese Communist Party? Then you've got that too! Oh my god, this is a glorious episode. Zany's guest is not only an accomplished martial artist, but he's also a brilliant author. He's written so many books, too many to name here, but I'd like to recommend the Monk of Park Avenue, which you can find on amazon.com, or by going to his website, which is monkyanru.com. Again that's monk-y-u-n-r-o-u.com, as always, all the links you need to find them are going to be at dunkintrussell.com, but you should for sure subscribe to this man's newsletter, which you can again find at the website I just mentioned. Now everybody, strap in and get ready to get your mind blown by today's glorious guest. Everybody please welcome Monk Yuen Rue to the DTFH. Yeah, the alternative slash integrative slash complementary thing has been very much a topic of contention in my family, because my father was a very famous physician, and he went to China very early, like in the 70s and 80s, and he witnessed some open heart surgery using no anesthesia, and it was done with acupuncture in a valium, and when he came back with photos and descriptions of this, everyone said he was a fool, and he had been duped, and that if you open the thoracic cage, you have no pressure on the lungs, so you can't breathe, and my dad should have known better than to be fooled by such a magician's trick, and he was so angry, he said, listen, you know, I'm a cardiologist, and I spend my life in ORs, and it wasn't a talking head with a body lying underneath, and that's not what happened, I'm not an idiot, and I saw what I saw, how it works, I don't know, but I ended up writing a whole book about it, so he was kind of a little more inclined in favor of Wiles' theories and thoughts than a lot of other alphabets. I mean, isn't that reaction, couldn't you say that's a form of racism? That's just a form of Western racism, which is these people over there, they're savages, they're going to trick you, don't fall for their bullshit, whereas over here in the West, we've got it all figured out, and we've got it so figured out that we're going to just try to erase a culture's ancient practice as like being fraudulent or a grift. You're spot on, and it's sort of a pet thing of mine about which I speak and write often. At the same time, that doesn't mean that there aren't liars and cheats and charlatans in China, and it also doesn't mean that that regime should be mistaken for the people, because, you know, it's the epicenter of evil on planet Earth right now, and those poor people are suffering so much. Oh, yeah. Oh, you mean the People's Republic of China? You mean there's the Chinese Communist state? Yeah, talking about the Chinese Communist Party. Yeah. Do you speak? Right. So I guess what I'm trying to say is there's a reason for some antipathy, but it's not a race. Oh, yeah, sure. Oh, yeah, I got you. Yeah, sure. I mean, yeah, it's so crazy to imagine that this planet is a series of seems to be a bunch of cultural test tubes, trying out all these various reality tunnels, and that that seems to be the reality tunnel that if there is going to be one that encompasses the planet, that's probably going to be it, whether we like it or not. Yeah, and we have to we have to do our best to let that not happen. But I especially with AI, all the money they're putting into AI and stuff, it's just a matter of time. They think it's they it seems like the their ability to not be in a hurry about how they're operating, you know, like in the United States, we seem to be in some kind of crazy rush. We're bombing anyone, you know, Iraq, we're bombing, you know, Vietnam, whatever, we're just but they just don't they kind of just wait and grow and wait and grow. And it's pretty it's not a terrible strategy. So so that so they have been doing for thousands of years. And, you know, we are defined by the speed and greed culture, which, you know, we have exported to them. I remember going years ago to the Imperial City, the Forbidden City in Beijing. And like, I was just moved to tears because you know, I spent my life studying all that. And I get to that they had an art gallery, where there was, you know, some exhibitions. In fact, if you look right above me there, that horses on the top of the ceiling, that came from that art gallery. Anyway, I noticed it right next to it was a Starbucks in the Imperial City, you know, the seat of the most fantastic tea culture in the world. And they've got a Starbucks and everybody's lined up to have it. So you know, we attempted to export our speed and greed, hyper capitalistic stuff to them. And they're just doing it better than we are now. So the whole world is besmirched on account of their aptitude and our hardiness. Yeah, I mean, how do you as a Taoist, do you recognize the like, does it seem like Taoism has actually in some way helped the CC? What do they call themselves? CCPR? Is that the Chinese Communist? Yeah, have you? Chinese Communist Party CCP, they don't like that they use a different acronym is like the people's Communist Party or something. But if they had there some if like, I don't know how that would have happened, but just thought experiment no Taoism. Would it be, would it even exist the CCP? Is it, you know, is the fact that they have absorbed, they must have absorbed in some way, so much of that wisdom? Is that part of what's making them so powerful? So this is a really, really cool and interesting question, which nobody else has ever asked me in an interview that I can think of at least right now. So I'm glad you did ask that. So I'll give you this answer, but I'm going to give it to you in the context of, you know, what is personally very difficult and sad for me because, you know, there's a war against religion going on now, which as always is just about, you know, Xi Jinping's fear that spiritual people will rise in power and weaken his regime. He wants social control is the number one thing. He's trying to make a North, a large, sealed North Korea out of China, and he will eventually do it. So I personally have this great suffering and pain in my heart because of how much I love traditional Chinese culture, how much I love to travel there, how many great friends I have there, and because of speaking frankly, as we are doing now about this subject, and writing articles and newsletters and books about all this, you know, any words against the government, according to their security law, the recent one that made such a hullabaloo in Hong Kong, that enables them, it gives them the right in their own eyes, you know, to come to Arizona, snatch me up and take me to jail, and they could do that. Dunkin, they could do it if I were in Pluto, according to their own legal system, you know, anywhere I am. So that makes it, you know, not a desirable thing for me to travel there anymore or to go, you know, to Chinese protectorates like some places in Southeast Asia. Anyway, the answer, which is most fascinating, is that there is an age-old tradition. It really goes back to pre-dynastic China, that is to say, before there was a China, of the Taoist master being the one who whispers in the ear of the ruler. Right. And the Tao Te Ching is full of, you know, benameless exhortations, crafting an image of the sage as the one who isn't, you know, necessarily, the sage could be the emperor, but in a lot of cases he just whispers in the ear, tells him, you know, what princess his daughter should marry, you know, when he should conduct a military campaign, if at all, you know, which spies to believe. And the emperors that listened to those guys grew their kingdoms in advance and eventually united China and the ones that didn't, didn't. So you're absolutely spot on. And it's one of the fantastically cool things about Taoist philosophy that, you know, I've engaged for so many years now. I think it's such a curious, it's such a curious philosophy and has always infuriated me more than any other one that I've ever tangled with. I'll read the Tao Te Ching to my toddler in the bathtub. He just likes the way the language sounds. He'll, it's so funny. I have a three-year-old and a one-year-old. I read it to them and they listen, but they don't know what it means. And they'll say, what does that mean? And I'm like, don't ask me. I don't know. I don't know. But it's so beautiful. And yet I just so infuriating because I can't get my hands around it at all. And then that makes me feel depraved or something like I should be able to. I will, I will send you later some recommendations of translations, other things. And you should probably read, you might think about reading the Zhuangzi because it's storytelling, you know, is a lot of the same messages, but they're funny little stories, you know, like butchard ding, who never needs to sharpen his knife. And a lot of the same concepts are there, but kids can connect to them. I want to thank ExpressVPN for supporting this episode of the DTFH. You don't want to bear back the internet friends.

It's like asking me, what is, beside manic murder monkeys, what exactly is a human being? Or asking me, can you just briefly explain gravity? It's a question that scholars, and I am not one by any means. I'm 280D and that's smart enough. But scholars have struggled with this for a really long time. What I can try to do is tell you that it's a very complex phenomenon that brings together history, culture, philosophy, religion, belief only in the observation purely of nature, but also the bunch of animism and shamanism thrown in. And it's all mixed up in a blender. And it comes out as a thing that is quite porous, permeable, so that it is able to go like one of those mycelia that grows and it occupies acres and acres is like the hugest living thing, but it's under the ground. You don't really see it, but it connects everything. And that description really makes it so endlessly fun to study. And, as you say, totally infuriating. Just infuriating. Sometimes I feel that way. Most of the time I'm laughing and just amazed at the fact that it really is in the end nothing more at its core and a little seedlet, the little embryo in the middle of it, is nothing more than a really studious, patient, long view observation about the way nature works. So you asked me about, you know, Daoism and contributing to China's success, and I told you about the whispering in the ear. So how about this for an example? This is one I made up, but I've used it in some talks and people like it. It's like Laozi, you know, a probably, possibly fictional character, or maybe like Moses or Jesus, an amalgam of people that really live that were turned into a legend or something for instructive purposes. You know, China has such, Chinese culture has such a history of ancestor worship that if you want to attribute and give something some gravitas, you attribute it to an ancestor. So Laozi just means the old boy or the old master. So, you know, there's a bunch of guys sitting in a coffee clutch, well, let's say a tea clutch, and, you know, they come up with some wise things, but they don't want to attribute it to themselves because who the hell are they? So they say, well, you know, the old master said, and so, you know, it's very possible that there was an old guy or there was an old guy, but it doesn't really matter because it's clear there were several authors of that book. Anyway, and Matt, let's say for the moment, just for the fun of it, that, you know, that the putative Laozi, a librarian in the Joke Dynasty, gets summoned by the emperor one day, and the emperor says, listen Laozi, my wizard, long before Harry Potter, you know, my wizard, I got some news from spies that someone is going to attack, but I don't have enough army to like cover the entire perimeter of the country. I don't know where they're coming from. North, south, east, west, I don't know where to put the troops to save the kingdom. If I screw up, all could be lost. If I intercept at the right place, wherever that might be, we could save everything. Just, just tell me where they're coming from. And Laozi's like, oh, shit. How do I know where they're coming from? This is your imperial son of heaven. Give me a couple of hours to think on this. So he goes off to the, he goes off and he stands under his favorite, you know, tree by the river, and he does a little meditation. And while he's meditating, he watches the river flowing just through slit eyes. He watches the river. And suddenly he notices that there's some little glinting stuff in the sand of the river, like what we would call Micah, right? Remember that shiny little stuff. And he happens to know because he watches the river all the time that Micah derives from some rocks that are up at the very top of the mountains that feed the river. And that if he's seeing that Micah now months early, this means that the snowpack that feeds the river is melting. And it shouldn't be melting because it's only February today. And if the snowpack is melting, that leads to an opportunity for enemies to come through a mountain pass that would ordinarily be unpassable and make a sneak attack. So he goes back to the, to the emperor and says, you know, sire, son of heaven, your greatness, your, your holiness, put, put some troops up at the north pass, make an ambush. That's where they're going to come. And then, you know, the king says, are you sure? Like be damn sure because it's your head. And I was like, yeah, I'm pretty sure. Pretty sure. He says, no, I'm sure. I'm sure. Send them. And they come through, you know, on schedule and it's a route. Kingdom is saved and kingdom is saved. And Laozi is elevated to the second most powerful guy in the kingdom. So this nature watching, and by nature, I don't just mean the river, of course, I mean, the heavens, the seasons, the little internecine wars between ants, you know, all that stuff, how it all works informs everything that we know. And in modern science, it does that also. And Taoists were ancient scientists. And some things we know better than they do now. We understand more in more detail. And other things they still, they still kind of have an edge. So this is sort of the as above so below idea and small things, all things, if you can, by watching any part of the natural world from that, you can extrapolate everything else. This is the apple falling. Now, you know, just from that, you can understand how like planets orbit around the sun, just from this form of extrapolation. And then also, what I think is really interesting about it is this idea that it, yes, the natural world doesn't it's not a way for you to calculate other things in the natural world. But because humanity is part of the natural world, from watching these things, you can actually formulate how human societies behave. So is the in the in the Dao De Ching, when it's sort of talking about the how when things start malfunctioning, what you can expect when things start malfunctioning, how did Lao Zhu come to that from watching entropy, from watching the way ice melts or trees catch on fire? How do you get, how do you, how did he, how did he reach that conclusion? You know what I'm talking about like, here's like when the king, when it's so many various warnings or signs when stuff is going wrong, here's what you can expect. Because if the moment, didn't he say the moment there's an emperor or a leader, the moment there, we even know of a king, things have already kind of started fucking up. So you've given me, you know, 10 different questions, and they're all, they're all good. They're all good. Let me, I didn't neglected my smart cap, but I'll do what I can with it. So, so first of all, the as above so below, let's start there. You actually touched on kind of a more accurate version of that when you said, when you mentioned that all things are connected. So the essence of everything, understanding, predicting, repairing, rebalancing, reharmonizing, all of it, the essence of everything is predicated on this non dual idea, which is very unwestern, honestly, at least through the time of Descartes and in modern science until quantum mechanics and things began to change how we, we looked at it and we realized that the Taoists were right. But, but we went on our own thing, you know, for a couple thousand years anyway. The, the idea that it is all everything we can conceive of and perceive and imagine is all one thing. So I belong to a little app called Next Door. I got kicked out. But it's like, you know, for my hood. And, and I honestly, I don't do social media and I don't spend a lot of time have a little Instagram that I go to sometimes. But honestly, that's not so much for me. So I don't go on this thing very much. But I live in the mountains of Arizona where there's a high fire danger. And so I started doing that app when we had a really bad fire here and people were losing their homes and I had to keep track, you know, like I could rely on my neighbors who said, you know, the fires in my backyard more than the canopy or a map. Right. So anyway, I start looking at that this morning, there was a post about somebody found a spider in their house. And all these people were talking about how to kill it, spray it, smash it, squish it. And, you know, as a harmless spider, a wolf spider, it looks kind of imposing, but really it's just eating the roaches and other things in your house. You know, it's not worth other than saying good morning to it. There's nothing really to do. And anyway, I wrote a little line or two about what a wonderful opportunity to exercise, you know, awareness and compassion, recognize that that little spider is part of the exact same fabric that makes you. It's another finger in a glove animated by the same hand that moves you. It's all the same thing. And, you know, if you kill it, you damage that fabric and you damage you because it's all one thing. Being able to perceive that, like on an ongoing basis, is called, you know, in the vernacular for us waking up. Right. And we don't use, I mean, there are things that are good about the word enlightened and things that aren't really so great about it. And I always get nervous about it. It's not a Taoist word. It's more of a Buddhist word, but it doesn't really exist. Strictly speaking, it's not in Buddhism either. It was applied to Lamas by some Germans or something, I think. I can't even remember more. But anyway, just on a little by little basis, trying to hold the perception of that connection between all things is kind of at the root of Taoism. Because once you have that perception, you can see well in advance of what others may see, where imbalances and disharmony are going to occur, where the pendulum has swung all the way to a terrible place because it was at the opposite terrible place and now has to come back to center. And if you have this view and this kind of understanding, then, you know, when the guy flips you off because you didn't, you know, leap forward in your 500 horsepower vehicle in the first nanosecond, that the light turned green, and he's got to, you know, meet his mist and she's waiting. He gives you the finger. And rather than, you know, lowering your window and, you know, giving him, giving him a double, say, or, you know, exercising your lips with it or something, he just go, Hey, that's his mind. I'm looking at an unbalanced mind. It's part of something bigger and you wave and he goes by in a rush and you continue on your way. This kind of cultivation is sort of what I hope is an answer to at least some of this. Yes, thank you. That's a great. Yeah, it's a wonderful answer. And the that one of the curious things about being in a technological society with all the hyperconnectivity that we that is being shown through next door apps or Instagram or whatever is that somehow interpersonally people don't seem to be aware of this at all. They, you know, we know like you, you, you see the telephone wires and you see the all the wires around you and you know, you all your followers and your likes and your tweets you see were so connected. And yet why are we, we all many people, it seems like have a sense of being completely disconnected from this web that you're talking about. And if there is a sense of connection, it certainly isn't a benevolent sense of connection, but more like a feeling of being ensnared or trapped, angry, like locked into the damn thing inexorably stuck. So how does Taoism approach that suffering? You lead me you lead me yet again to for which I thank you to a very juicy subject. So the way we cancerous manic and murder monkeys are treating each other and the planet is not headed for a good ending. We are, you know, pushing the known universe, you know, our, our world anywhere, our planet into such an extreme position that the forces of nature, you could call it, you know, if you wish you could anthropomorphize this and say, you know, Mother Earth is going to fight back, you know, whatever metaphor you want to use, but things to control the grotesque overgrowth of human populations require that human lives be taken, that, you know, the cancer be cut out in order for the organism to survive balance and harmony will restore whatever we do to, to destroy that balance and harmony will eventually be corrected whether we like it or not. And I promise you we're not going to like it. Right. So whether it's pandemics, global thermonuclear war, you know, other things, the earth in some form, perhaps not, I'm very greatly saddened and aggrieved to say not in, in the form of the biodiverse wonder that we call earth now, but in some version, whether it's tortoises and cockroaches or all that's left, you know, it will survive us and, and come back to some kind of balance and then evolution will start a new, some, some people talk about evolution as being another word for, for, for Dow. I don't say the Dow because the Dow implies a thing. Right. So it's not a thing anymore than evolution is a thing. But, you know, this force is inexorable. And we made a lot of mistakes. And like a lot of other species in fast, in fact, a great, great, great species that have ever been on this planet are gone. Right. You know, they were experiments or manifestations of evolution that didn't work out. Why did they not work out? I don't know. An asteroid hit. You know, the earth tilted a little bit and it got too cold. One, one, you know, cancerous thing arose like people and started killing everybody else. And then the last piece, she's died and it started off again. I mean, this is just the way the whole thing goes. So, you know, we made our first really huge mistake was to leave the hunting and gathering lifestyle, which has sort of been mis, misdescribed as mischaracterized, as being short, brutish and nasty. Now, you know, more, better anthropology says now that we, you know, we were all living till 80 without a hint of disease in our bones or anything, you know. And did the occasional tiger get us? Yes, but not as often as the drunk driver or the mad truck. And, you know, and did we occasionally get diseases? And did we have a bad winter where only if you survive? Yeah, exactly like what's going on now. But, you know, when we went to agriculture, we went to, oh, that's Duncan's. And this is mine. I'm going to live a penury. I'm going to use this penurious diet of four things that I can grow. Forget all the abundance of everything that I evolved to need from berries and nuts to herbs and all this stuff that make me healthy. Forget that. I'm going to make me. Don't you come here. Yeah. That line in the dirt is this is mine. And that's your, we started all that. And then we made other terrible mistakes, industrialization and now virtual stuff and the digital world. And all that does is compound our initial errors and speed us up. So the tech you referred to, all it does is make everything happen faster. The same crappy decisions, the same alienation, the same poor choices, they're all there as they were before. Right. Okay, right. So it's like technology is like an apocalyptic lubricant or something. It's just it's not it's not solving the what we are hoping that it would solve. I want to go jump back to what you were saying about population control, which is a obviously a very controversial subject that if you bring it up in the wrong way, people accuse you of being part of the new world order or some kind of a globalist agenda to depopulate the planet. They talk about the Georgia guide stones. I don't know if you're aware of them, but they're these, you know, someone carved like keep human population under this amount. To me, what's interesting about the conversation about depopulation is what you're saying, which is who, how do you want the depopulation to happen? Do you want it to happen through chaos? Or do you want it to happen through some come some other way, a human way or whatever? Because no matter what, you can be certain that when things get out of balance enough, depopulation is going to happen. You know, it's it's there's no way around it when things get just like what you're saying when we've got when you get war, it's not just like you get war, war is followed by famine, war is followed by disease. You know, whenever things get really wonky, lots and lots and lots of people die. And right now, it seems like the idea, the compassionate idea is like, let the earth decide who to kill via complete ecological collapse. Because that we nobody wants to be in charge of like saying how many kids you can have. I mean, someone did. We were talking about them earlier. You know, the the CCP. But so what are your thoughts on that? Like, how is that? How would if Lao Zhu did exist, and somehow we reanimate him using an artificial intelligent bot perfectly, what would he say that we're supposed to do to handle this problem of a massive exponentially accelerating human population or an imbalance in human population and resources? If if I asked him, he would probably look at me and say, you know, silly foreigner. But why do you worry about this kind of stuff? And and and you know, change is, you know, is the only constant. The question really is, well, the answer, I think, is two two times on a little fork. The first time is to say, look, if we've just had this discussion about technology, and how all it does is magnify our foibles and put us in more and more and more extreme situations. Because we have not done, because of that wrong turn we took in the Neolithic, maybe even in the Paleolithic. But let's say in the Neolithic, because of that wrong turn we turn, we took all we have done is added an amplifier to our mistakes. And we keep on using the amplifier to try to fix those mistakes. Right. So so the more we have discussions about, shall we be like Charlton Heston and Soylent Green and, you know, eating people in little cubes and line up, line up to die in a little gas chamber, because we got to 30 years old or whatever it was. So so, you know, asking these kinds of questions begs the point that all of that kind of solution, so-called solution, is exactly what got us here. And as you just said, nature is going to do what it's going to do, and it will always win. Because, you know, it's just us, plus, you know, a thousand times more wisdom and understanding. Okay, so that's one time. The other time of the fork is that what might be a solution to this. And I was very interested actually to hear Dr. Weil mention in that recent interview with you, the idea that psychedelics have a role in what I have been writing and speaking about now for 25 years, I guess, which is a leap, an evolutionary leap in our consciousness, which in very rapid timeframe changes the way we see who we are, what we are, how we connect to other people, how we connect to all living things, how we connect to the entire web of sentient beings, even if it's on some planet in Alpha Centauri somewhere, right? But if we could have, and evolution shows that sometimes, whether it's the evolution of a thumb or a bipedal gate that suddenly brings us up, and now we have eyes in the front, we're looking at the felt in a way that, you know, we were, before we were looking at the ground up there, there's an apple, you know, now we're looking at, oh, look miles away, there's a lion run, right? So we have a whole different view of things that I believe in the possibility of this kind of whether it's epigenetics or some other intervention of some sort. I believe in the possibility, in fact, I believe in the necessity that we have a leap of this kind of understanding that will just fundamentally shift our behavior, and that leap will not come from technology, although, you know, it might come from Ayahuasca. So, you know, that I don't know, not an expert in hallucinogens, because I've been more of a meditator in this life, but I do believe that this is the only answer, you know, when you have a double bind, the only way out of it is to comment upon it. You know, you're stuck either way, but if you lift yourself and have the perspective of seeing actually, oh, I'm in a double bind, I'm damned if I do and damned if I don't, then all of a sudden you're in a different place to find solutions. Right, you mean like, yeah, you mean like the acknowledgement of the sort of trapped state? Yeah, so maybe instead of social media, you know, and I'm guilty of this, I have this little dog, you know, that I'm just, you know, I was really, really sick last fall, and it's the coma for a while, and when I woke up, and the first thing I said to my wife by my bedside was, you know, I want, I want a Kerry Blue terrier, and she, she looked at me like, you know, that you're, you're, the ambulance brings you to the hospital dead, they revive you, you've been unconscious for a long time, been sitting here all the time, you wake up and that's the first thing you say, you talk about a puppy, do you not remember that we have four dogs? Would you like to open a kennel? And I said, yes, I know, it's a terrible idea, and I want a Kerry Blue terrier, and, and you know, she's, she looks it up on her phone, she says, you know, that's an Irish dog, they don't even have them here. And I said, look on the AKC website, they've got it. Anyway, long story short, she finds one, like there's one in the United States, there's a litter of six, and five are already sold, and there's one, and I end up getting this dog, and I got this thing for this little dog. And, you know, it's no way rational, I like my other four dogs to all little rat dogs. Yeah. And, you know, I like them, but I put them up, I put pictures of this one little rat, this, this one that I thought of in my stupor, I put it up on social media, my digression is simply about, instead of using social media for that, and I just admitted that I put up like five or six pictures of the dog. We have to have a shift on what, what are we doing with, with that tool? And if all we're doing is the more or less the worst or the most trivial of us. And I'm not suggesting that loving your dog is trivial. Loving my dog makes my life a lot better. And it is a path to loving nature. So probably I picked a bad example, but you get a point. There are better things to do. Sure. With these technologies. But they have to be informed by a mind that sees and understands what's really going on.

There are better things to do. Sure. With these technologies, but they have to be informed by a mind that sees and understands what's really going on. Otherwise, it's just a Bowie knife in the hand of a two-year-old. Right. It's a Bowie knife that is in the hand of a two-year-old that is transforming from a Bowie knife into a gun, into an assault rifle, into a nuclear weapon. It's growing in front of us. I just saw this, I think Musk just tweeted, retweeted someone saying that 56% of interaction with social media is bots. It's not even humans. It's artificial intelligence bots that are just swarming and putting whatever their various agendas are into human culture. To me, that's where it's, look, I like that you think that there is some solution or there's a possibility. I love that you mentioned these things that do happen for sure to creatures. All of a sudden, you've got an eye. All of a sudden, you can see what used to be just whatever non-visionary existence for a fish was. Now you're starting to see a coral reef. Now you're starting, it transforms things. I imagine that transformation is very quick. To me, it's nice to hear you propose that maybe psychedelics could be one of the things that cause that transformation. Good Lord, I just don't buy it. I just feel like I've been around enough megalomaniacal psychonauts, people who've been taking these substances where they're like, this will dissolve your ego and they're like, ego is only amplified by a trillion from whatever the thing is. To the point where it's like, I used to think that. I used to believe that when people would talk about the hippies putting acid in the water supply. They'd be like, well, why not? Give it a shot. But now I'm afraid, I don't know that that would work necessarily. I don't know if that's one of the paths for it. Yeah, I'm not a devotee or a practitioner of any of that. I only mentioned it more because, not because I believe in psychedelics having that power, and that was Dr. Wiles think, but more because I like to hear people talking about the necessity for that particular kind of shift in consciousness as a solution and maybe the only solution to where we are. Massive global rebalancing that could happen. And I think I have to, why did I become a Daoist monk? Yeah, why? Well, I just released a memoir. We can talk more about it, but it traces my childhood from a privileged family in Manhattan to making all these choices that led me to become a lay monk, at least now. I can't go back to monastery so much. And maybe there's a little seed of seeker in me and in other people that there's some portion of the population that just understands this stuff. You may be one of those people. And so you just look aghast at so many things that happen. And if you have a practice like Daoism, which is, I think pick your poison, that's the one that appealed to me. But if you have a practice, then what you can do is you can use the practice to enhance and strengthen, number one, your ability to stand against the weapons of mass distraction that are manipulating you, whether they are media or corporate interests or all that stuff that affects how you see the world, what you buy, how you spend your time. You can fight back against that, not with AR-15s, but fight back against it with awareness that, oh, I actually don't really believe that. And I don't really want to be manipulated that way. And I would like to look for some higher, better ways to live and better ideas than the ones that represent American anti-culture right now, a violent, imperial place. So I think the role of practice is important. Without it, I'm not really sure what I would read. I choose to read as opposed to watch streaming or television. I choose to read because it gives me space. And all these practices, whether they're meditation, Tai Chi and Qigong, which I enjoy, these things give me space in which I can make decisions. So change is one thing. We agree, I think, that it's inevitable. It's going to happen. It doesn't matter whether we like it. Not relevant. Because it's not about us. Nothing is about us. But that simple sentence, it's not about you, is like the least popular thing. My publishers always scream at me for, why don't you write a book about it? It is all about you. Because the doubted jinx says, you got to work on yourself first and blah, blah, blah. We're already too masturbatory and too self-indulgent and entitled and narcissistic. We don't need any more books about how to entitle yourself to a Rolls-Royce and a big person. It's not about you at all. And that message by itself seems to be so unpalatable to so many people that I get ugly mail sometimes. Oh, people don't want to hear that. Yeah. So without the practice, there is no space to interpret and handle those incoming things and find a higher way of looking at your life. So that's why I'm such a lazy bastard. You don't seem it. Oh, dude, I would lie around and watch Wuxia movies. I've watched Chinese kung fu movies all day long, play with my dog, have some tea, watch some more movies. I'm such a lazy bastard. The only reason that I've persisted in all these things to achieve something with them is because the other choice is not acceptable. Really lying around is not really a very good way. So I do these things because I must. What are the things? What are the things? What does a Taoist practice look like? So those are some of the things I mentioned. I do a lot of Taoist meditation. When I've been very sick, I haven't been able to stand for long periods of time like I used to, but I hope to get back to that. There are some guys, I shouldn't say guys, there's some people in China. My own master seems to think that there's still some of these druids hiding in the forest somewhere. China is a really big country, but they spend six hours, four to 10 a.m., say, every day, standing with their arms like this, hugging a tree, motionless, developing their chi. Yeah, six hours. Dude, let me tell you, I've been through a period in my life where I did three hours a day and I cannot imagine, you might say, wow, you could do three, you could do six. You mean three hours with your arms wrapped around a tree? Yeah, sometimes my arms got tired. I put them down, but I was still standing there. I put them back up, but that was sort of my physical peak. What is that like? Wait, what is that? What is hour two like as you're doing that? What happens? I have never in my life heard of that form of meditation before, but it makes me want to go run to the closest tree and try that. So first of all, the posture, there are several different postures. They're not all the tree hugging. There's one where you fold your hands over your navel, another where your hands are by your sides, with your middle fingers going to an acupuncture meridian. There are at least three different postures and probably more. But the standing part, as opposed to the sitting or the lying versions, which are also legit, because not everybody is strong enough. I'm no longer strong enough. I got sick, so I can't do that anymore. I'm trying to work my way back to it. I don't know that I'll ever be able to do three hours again. But why stand, say, in the first place? It comes from Chinese medicine, although Chinese medicine itself is a very Taoist thing. So we don't want to get into the chicken or egg thing. We'll be here all day. But let's just say that in Chinese medicine, there's an expression of this idea that there's something called the greater heavenly circle. Your energy circles up your back and down your front end. And all Taoist practices engage this. Some engage only your torso. So then it's called the lesser heavenly circle. It goes from, let's say, you're growing to the top of your head. And at the top of your head, there's a point, pai hui, which is your yang point. It's at the crown of your head. And you have the idea that someday after enough of this, you will open a connection to heaven, to pure yang. Actually, the temple in which I was ordained a monk and then a priest is named for this idea of pure yang. It's called the pure yang temple. But that's kind of like celestial heaven, you know, everything awakening. Yes. But if you remember that it's a circle, there's that yang going to heaven. But there's also this idea of connecting with the earth through points in your feet, kidney acupuncture point, one kidney, one yang trend, it's called. And so you're suspended between heaven and earth because that is man's place. The idea of being suspended between heaven and earth does put people and our consciousness in a little bit different place. And sometimes honestly, I wrestle a little bit with that. And with a meditation thing, it's just to increase the strength of circulation of that circle, connect you more with heaven and earth, make you physically and energetically stronger. And those amazing people, I started to say lunatics, but I caught myself, those amazing people who I so greatly admire and want to be when I grow up, who can, you know, stand like that for six hours. What they do, what they do, having achieved that ability to stand like that and made themselves so awake and so strong is they, they heal. They go off and heal people with that energy. And they are healers. And that's their work is to do the standing to become powerful enough to heal. Wow. Because, you know, the first treasure of Taoism is compassion. Wow. So can you imagine if we had a world of people who thought like that instead of about a tactical nuke that'll solve the problem? Tactical nuke. That's the, that's one of the most hilarious terms maybe that humans have burped out in our history. Tactical nuke. They're killing me. This is how we know there's a Satan. You might not believe in God, but you know that that's a meeting where like Satan appears is like, listen, it's a tactical nuke. We're going to do precision nuclear weapons. It's going to be a mild, it's like a party nuke. It's just, you know, what, what is a precision nuclear weapon? A precision nuclear weapon is, is a medical technique that kills a cancer without killing the rest of you. Yeah. That, that should be the beginning and the end of any kind of tactical nuke. No. That I will accept is a tactical nuke. Yeah. The rest. Please, never, whoever said that. I remember when the, the warmongers started throwing that out there to try to loosen us up. You're a little uptight when it comes to nuclear weapons humanity. Can't you just relax a little bit? Hey, I, but what is going on? What you are. So what, what do you, what's going on with you physiologically? What is your sickness? What is happening? Oh, yeah. So about that, you know, some people say, well, you know, if you do all these practices and you still get sick, like doesn't speak very well for your practice. Who says that? And well, some people do. And the answer is very simple. You know, without the practices, I wouldn't get sick. I would get dead. Yeah. Listen, I have to get sick, get sick, practice and get sick. Don't practice and get dead. When, very simple. When I heard that I was going to be interviewing someone who was sick, possibly dying and also who had COVID today. I did not expect to see someone who seems to be far healthier than I currently am. As a dad, you're glowing. You seem, you know, and that's not, that's not blowing smoke. And, you know, my teachers of all, you actually taught me that, you know, telling someone that they're like looking great when they're dying is actually kind of the most rotten thing you could do. But you, do you seem far, you, what's going on with you? Are you, you, what, what is, do you, do you have, is it cancer? Is it? Yeah. So a few years ago, I moved here to Arizona from South Florida, where I had lived for many years and initially moved there for my wife's job. And she really, she, she had moved years before to Hollywood for me when I was a screenwriter. And, and, you know, I couldn't do that anywhere else. So, you know, she moved there and we lived in, in California for a while. So I returned the favor and, and we, we moved to Florida for her corporate thing, which turned out to be really, really a wonderful career for her. And I was happy to do it. And as it turned out, I, I met my primary master and like it was a really wonderful quarter century there. And I developed quite a large school, you know, in one of the larger, yes, high G schools in the country. And, you know, really, I succeeded there and grew there. And I'm very grateful for that time. But I also saw, you know, South Florida came, became kind of a hot New York and I don't know, you know, my, I had a house on a beach. I was fortunate enough to have a house on the beach. But, you know, the ocean was in our living room from time to time on a big moon or a storm came. And I thought, you know, this is my single largest investment. I don't want to leave it to my son, who by the way, as an evolutionary biologist, and we'll probably be rolling his eyes in my characterizations of pollution. But yeah, he just graduated from Yale. I'm so proud of him. Wow. Anyway, yeah, yeah, he's really, he's, he's eclipsing his, his dad already. And I hope he continues to do so and more. And anyway, so I didn't want to leave him a scuba diving adventure. So, you know, we cashed out and we, yeah, we, we moved here to Arizona. I spent some time looking around. I wanted to live in Asia, which I always wanted to do. Yeah. You know, there are so many things politically and my wife didn't want to do that with the kid was still in school. No, no, no. So we got here to Arizona. And within the first year of moving here, I contracted something called valley fever, which is a fungal disease is the little fungus that lives in the soil. And many, many, many people, hundreds of thousands of people get this disease. Yes. And it typically either you don't know, you got it, you know, your immune system kicks it out or you feel like you're sick for a week and have a cold or never heard of it. It enters in the lungs. It's coxio, coxidioides is the fungus. Anyway, some people, you know, get some nodules in the lungs and then it's diagnosed if they have a chest x-ray, which is what happened to me. Some people, the fungus disseminates throughout the body. So it could go to other places, typical places, the skin that creates lesions. There are medications for it in a class of medication. But they're kind of, in most cases, you take the medication and that's it. It doesn't necessarily totally kill the fungus, but it kind of puts it to sleep like being some cancerous remission, but you know, you don't really get it again. You know, you've developed antibodies to it. Yeah, that's that. So in my case, unfortunately, I am one of the tiny, tiny, tiny, thankfully, number of people who had the misfortune for the fungus to reach my brain. And it went all over me. I had problems with my heart from it, my kidneys, my prostate, my lungs. It just really took me over. And I don't have a weak immune system, but perhaps genetically, not really clear why, but it really, when it ended up in my brain, that unfortunately is not a curable. That's a fatal condition. So I took the drugs that, you know, we're supposed to slow down its progress. And, you know, like cancer chemo sometimes used for this, it's not, it's not, it's not a pleasant experience to try to prolong your life taking those things. Right. You know, they reduce your quality of life greatly. And I had trouble tolerating them. And I'll spare you the details, but let's just say it was very rough. Yeah. So there, there's an experimental medication, which was developed by a company in England. Some medical entrepreneurs saw that climate change, and this is connects to everything we're talking about, right? Climate change has caused these tropicopolitan fungi that are to be found in Southeast Asia, South America, Africa, you know, the humidity and changing temperature has a lot of these fungi growing and infecting more and more people. And many people die undiagnosed around the world from these things. And this, this group said, you know, in the short, maybe not in the short term, but at least in the medium term, this is going to become a global health problem. And we want to develop a drug that works against a wide range of these fungi. And, you know, then we'll become trillionaires. Right. A lot of people. So, you know, I got on a clinical trial of this drug, which is, I will say, much easier to tolerate than the previous medications, whether or not it is a cure, which is to say whether it doesn't just stop the fungus from fucking, but stops the fungus dead. Yeah. That that is as yet unknown because it's too new. Right. And yeah, I was feeling a lot better. And I asked the doc who's running this thing, I said, you know, could I stop now? Because like I feel pretty good. He says, you could. And it would be very helpful for us in the study to know if you did, because on autopsy, we'll have to see whether, you know, whether your body looks like a farmer's market, you know, I said, okay, all right, thank you very much for that. Let's say, and he is, he has a great sense of humor. And he's just the greatest guy saved my life. Yeah. But, but, you know, he was giving me the sign that like, you know, stay, stay on the stuff. Right. Until we're really sure that it's a cure. So, you know, that's where I'm, and I did, I went to my son's graduation, I got COVID up in Connecticut. And honestly, I had four, four vaccines. And, you know, they gave me the antiviral stuff. And I don't know, Duncan, all I can say is I'm very lucky. And compared to what I've been through in the last two years of my life, this is a snore. And it's not, it's not a snore for a lot of people. It's very, very serious. But I'm just, you know, I just lucked out. Yeah, you just lucked out as an endorsement. You didn't luck out. It's this hugging tree thing. It's the G. It's your, it's, you know, you're glowing with it. I've seen this before in other people, they glow, you've got this, you're glowing. It's not just the, I mean, I don't know what it is. Who am I to say? I'm just some podcaster, but yeah, no, I, I, I, it's, first of all, I don't mean to just jump back to this, but if anyone online or anyone has said that bullshit to you about your, your, your spiritual practice is not great because you're, you're getting sick. You're fit. What do they think we're immortal? Every, it happens to everybody. There's no way, there's no way out of it. No, so that's bullshit. But number two, I'm so happy to hear this experimental medication is working. Yeah. So, you know, it's a Taoist thing, like a Buddhist thing, not to get too attached. Right. And it's, you know, it's difficult when it's your life. Because, you know, you, you want, like, I want to be attached. Oh, I'm attached. Keep me alive. I'm loving the attachment. But, you know, it could stop working. It could turn out to kill me and some others, destroy my liver in a year. I mean, you know, anything, it's an experiment. We've only been talking for an hour. I'm attached to you. This has got to work. Seriously. You want to talk about a weak practice. Now, we can't lose you. You got to stick around. I mean, especially now that you've, that must have been, I can't even imagine what that's like sitting at your son's graduation at Yale. And no, yeah, I was very weeping. I was very weepy. I'll tell you. Did you know that I was super weepy? Do you have a second longer to talk? We've already talked for an hour. It seems like it went by in a second. I'll talk as long as you wish. I'm enjoying it. Is this the dog? This is my baby. Oh, wow. This is Mimi. Oh, that is a beautiful dog. Mimi. We're about to go for a haircut. Mimi. Her name is Yoemi after a character in a novel I wrote. And, but Mimi is easier. So we just calling these daddy's baby. She knows it. Everybody knows that I get a lot of ridicule. To me, do you, it's, look, I have a few, I want to talk more about the dog, but I've got Daoist questions I want to ask. And I'll Google that breed of dog. But I got to know. This, your master says that these beings living in the forest, hugging the trees for six hours or I, and also the, the, this conceptual is the, the Lao Zhu amalgam has always fascinated me because just of exactly what your master said, any, or, you know, they say the same thing about Pythagoras, you know, that what there wasn't a Pythagoras, Pythagoras represented some unknown community of people. Lao Zhu represents some unknown community of people, and especially with Daoism, in particular, as opposed to some of the other religions that I'm familiar with, centralized religions, you have this concept of the anonymous sage who is basically like moving the gears of society. And when I am becoming despondent from over indulgence in the news or whatever I'm freaking myself out by watching, I fantasize that those beings are active and are influencing things in the most compassionate way possible, that they still whisper in the ears of people, that they're still out there and they're still doing their job. It's nothing, nothing's changed at all. So that's a big lead up to a probably annoying question. Have you ever encountered one of them? Have you ever encountered one of these people, one of the invisible, whatever you want to call them, the masters, Gerjeev called the, had names for them. If you ever rub shoulders with them or rub shoulders with anyone who claims to have met one of them. So as usual, your questions bring up a bunch of stuff, but that's what makes you a good interviewer. So look, I'm gonna sidestep it for a moment. I'll come back to it. I'm gonna sidestep it for a moment and remind you of the, of the multiverse, right? So, so I think it's, it's very congruent with Taoist beliefs, although, you know, archetypal, traditional, really strict Taoist beliefs. And by the way, there's, I mentioned that this was a complex and porous phenomenon we call Taoism. So I would never say ever, ever that I'm an expert in all that, right? There are, there are Chinese texts I cannot read because my comprehension is too low. There are things that are not translated, they're not available, you can't trust the translator, blah, blah, blah. There's just a zillion things from thousands of years of culture. So I can't make an absolute statement, but I would say that the idea of multiverses is congruent with a lot of things that I understand about Taoism and that the idea that there are levels of things. And, and please remember, this is something that not a lot of people really talk about when they talk about Taoism, because they talk about, you know, the Tai Chi to the little yin yang symbol being on the back of, you know, a surfer's, you know, Toyota pickup or something on the way to the beach. I have one tattooed right above my ass. That and also Star Wars, which is, you know, Lucas was fascinated with the interplay between Taoism and Confucianism and that provided all that risk for that mill and that whole stuff. So, so, but what people don't talk about so much is the fact that, you know, there are shamanistic practices all around the world. And, you know, this is an ancillary, in some ancillary way connected to the, to the question of the hallucinogens that many of them, but not all of them use. And these people do their practices, whether they're chanting or dancing or, or, or smoking something and, or eating something. And what they all come up with in the end is sort of the same vision, even though they're spread all around the world. And arguments have been made that while they all started from some shaman, proto shamanistic ancestor. And so that, you know, these visions are all from the same Mother Mary shamaness, you know, 100,000 years ago. I don't know about that. But what I can say is that whether it's in Mongolia or on Basin, you know, you take a trip and what you see is remarkably the same. And that is, you know, in some way, I'm going to rough this. Okay. I'm not an Amazonian shaman. But you could think of like a bunch of frisbees connected by a big pencil that goes right through the middle of, and there are all these different levels. And, you know, if you are, if you go to the medicine man, the shaman, the shamaness, and you say, look, I've really got a bad belly. And I can't, you know, nothing seems to help. And then, you know, the shaman entrances and goes up, you know, four or five frisbees. And there it finds, you know, the tiger annoying on Duncan's belly. Yeah. It says, listen, I, I, I, I, I, I, I humbly request almighty tiger. And don't eat me for asking. But could, could you not, could I give you this a little bit of raw, raw. Instead, could you please stop knowing on Duncan's belly when, you know, the tiger takes the ride, you know, doggie chew from you and wanders off into the forest, and you come back to real world and your pain is gone. Right. No more bellyache for Duncan. Yeah. So this, this kind of, this kind of universality to perceptions of reality upon deep meditation or mind altering through substances is a lot more congruent globally. And people really talk much about it. And a lot of dominant, you know, Taoism is a very, has a very strong Taoism, has very strong shamanistic roots is the sentence I was trying to, yes. So what you see, what you experience, whether it's in an altered state, whether you're in meditation, or whether it's in something as prosaic as Tai Chi walking practice in the forest, where you repetitively by repetitive movement, create a state of mind, which quiets impulses and leaves some space for you to see things better. I believe that many, many people have accessed little bits and pieces of these other metaverses or these spirit guides or whatever people like to call them. I can say that the best strongest experience I've had in that regard, and I'm not going to mention, you know, a zillion little things that came and went during so many decades of meditation now, tens of thousands of hours, but rather that in that recent illness in September, you know, when my wife found me, you know, on the floor and gone, and she called I'm 11 and they got there fast enough to save me revive me. I can't tell you I know what they did, but I would presume, you know, extreme things to bring me back. You know, when I arrived at the ER, I was conscious. And there was a doctor, I remember his face very well, a Jewish guy was wearing a skull cap, a kippah, and a yarmulke, and he had thick glasses, and he was wearing his mask. And, you know, I looked up and I said to him, you know, in Yiddish, I said, you know, like so new, like, so how am I, you know, and he said, I'm not going to lie, you know, it's not good. Yeah. And I'm going to do, I'm going to do what I can, but, you know, your kidneys have shut down and, you know, a lot of your organs are not working. And I don't know, but I'm going to try. And I said, thank you, please do, but I want to tell you something. I've spent most of the summer wishing to be dead. I've had so much suffering. And I've been through so much that I'm really, and I'm a monk. And I, you know, I spend a lot of time in consideration of such things. And I am not strongly resistant to dying. I'm kind of 50-50 right at this moment. And I have been for a little while. So please do your best. But if you don't succeed, please don't let me be one of those patients that makes you, you know, that wakes you up tonight in the middle of the night going, damn, you know, I lost that guy. I said, because it's okay. It's okay. Do your best. But please know that I'm perfectly fine with whatever happens. And he thanked me for saying that. And I said, I do have one, you know, other small request. And I felt myself fading, you know, said, I'm pretty sure that my wife followed the ambulance just knowing how she is. And that she's going to burst in here any minute. And if I'm dying, I don't want her to hear me screaming and dying. So could you make sure that that, you know, I don't want to die in agony. Can you make sure that, you know, that doesn't happen? You know, he held my hand and he said, I got you, bro. And that's the last thing I remember. And then I was at her a few days. And when I was, when I was gone, and this is the answer to your question, I was taken on a journey. I went on a curated journey. But it wasn't the journey was not about the curator. The journey was about what the curator wanted to show me. And I used the word curator so as to sidestep saying it was Lao Tzu or God or God of Abraham or Buddha or, you know, whatever. I never saw who or what this was. I didn't have a visual. I just had a presence and the clear, clear 1000% conviction that I was being shown specific things that that entity wanted me to see. It's like if you go to a museum, you go to New York, and you get, you know, to the, to the Met, you say, you know, I'm Duncan Trussell. I'd like a special tour. I said, Oh, yeah, they're like, let's get the big curator for you. And he takes you for a couple hours through the museum. And he shows you, you know, the greatest things that you absolutely have to see. Yes. So it was a curated tour. And I, and I was way bigger subject than we have time for. But I saw a lot of things, which challenged my idea of non duality. And and they supported it. But they also, it wasn't exactly what I thought, you know, I saw the big bang, I zoomed through the galaxies, all kinds of stars and stuff. But this went on for days. Wow. Days. It wasn't a 30 second blip or a three second blip. It went on for days. And at the end of it, I saw what is to come for us, for human beings. What is it? It was shown this, and I believe what I was shown, as much as I believe that, you know, that's my head. Yes. And I, and I resist this tell you, I was in awe of all of it. And there was no conversation because there was no space or appropriateness for a conversation. I just shut up and watched what that curator, I'm just using that word because I didn't have a better was showing me. When it came to that, what I saw we're going to become or what's going to happen to us. I reacted very badly. I wasn't, I didn't like it. And I, and I got, you know, a little bit of a tough love kind of slap on the wrist from the curator, which is the only time the curator spoke. The only time I heard his voice, her voice, whatever. And the message was, sorry, you don't like it. It's not about you. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter whether you like it. Right. And, and I think that wrestling, my pushing back is what caused me to wake up. Of course, I was being given all kinds of things, you know, the hospitalists to wake me. But from my point of view, you know, they've been doing that all along and I didn't wake up. But, you know, I thrashed around and, you know, I guess I was told that I was very discomforted, might have been excited, you know, I don't know. But when I was shown that I pushed back. And now, of course, I've had lots of time to think about this. And I think I was, I was wrong to push back because if I hadn't pushed back, maybe I would have gotten more, learned more, seen more, you know, I regret that reaction now. Wait, I'm sorry. Can you talk about what you were showing? What did you see? You know, we don't want to make a negative podcast. Let me say that people wouldn't probably like, you know, it has to do with sort of morphing into AI. And that, you know, what, what we think of as human will not be anymore. And, you know, we'll be sort of like, like these giant crab tentacles in space, like think of an Alaskan king crab leg that's, you know, 80 miles long, and made of some material that we can't identify now, carbon fibrous, you know, maybe nano tech kind of thing. But, you know, consciousness of everyone is in there. And it's nothing to do with planet Earth anymore. And we're just sort of floating around. And, you know, I've had, I've had lots and lots of thoughts about this, as you would expect. And many of them have come to, well, the one thing I didn't get from that vision was that we are consciousness that there was any more suffering. And so the plus, which came to me later, I didn't realize it at the time of the vision, because I had just such a strong knee jerk thing that I wasn't thinking. I was just going, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Right. But, you know, thinking about it later, I wondered about my limitations and prejudices and judging that. And, you know, it's just, that was, it was like Buddhism, when it comes to discernment and judgment, you know, one is good and the other one isn't. So, you know, better not, not to have those reactions. But I'm giving you the very barest bones of this. But, you know, that, that was kind of it. And I will say that since that experience, I have woken up a great deal. And I do see the non-dual pretty much 24-7 now, which is a very interesting way to live. The way that people respond to me, the way that you respond to me, is different than it might have been if we'd done this interview a year ago or something, you know. And I was sitting in a Chinese restaurant eating some tofu and reading the book the other day and a FedEx guy comes rushing in and I figure he's making a delivery, but it turns out he's waiting for, he's waiting for his lunch, you know, he came to pick up lunch. And it wasn't ready. So, he's kind of agitated staying there because, you know, he's got to go, FedEx. Yeah. And he comes over to my table. I've never seen this guy before. He comes over to my table and he looks at me and says, who are you? Holy shit. So, like, you know, I'm a guy eating my, I mean, a guy eating my tofu. And he says, no, no, come on, really, who are you? And I said, you know, how can I help you? He says, I just got this life where I'm always running and I'm always running and I don't have time. I never see my kids and I got a truck and I got a deck and I gotta make the, and this one's a live animal and that was an emergency package and blah and my whole life is like that. And like, I don't want to live this way. And he spent seven or eight minutes waiting for his noodles or whatever, you know, telling me about his life. Yeah. And I pretty much say nothing. And then he leaves. And that kind of stuff just happens nonstop now. Whereas it didn't really before. And I don't know what that is. An energetic thing, maybe. I don't know. I've seen it with, you know, like the Trudy Goodman. I don't know if you know, she is, she runs inside LA, but same thing. All the Ramdas teachers, I remember she, she came to do a podcast with me and I go to meet the Uber. The Uber driver is wiping tears away. He's just opened up to her for the whole ride about how he's struggling with alcoholism. And then he's like, listen, I'm going to wait, is it okay if I wait here to drive her back? I'll just drive her back. And that is, that's the healing part, isn't it? That's what you're talking about, that you become a healer. Yeah, I guess so. So I don't like labels, but I do notice some shifts in this, you know. And I think it was a period of time in my early training where I went through a healing phase where I could do a lot of hands-on healing. I could see things like, see a woman is pregnant before she knows, or see an incipient cancer in somebody. And I could affect things. But my teacher, he said, you know, Lao Tzu says that the way is this really clear highway. For some reason, you know, everybody likes to get lost in little paths and shortcuts and so on in the mountains. And he said, you know, this is a very sticky, these abilities that you developed, you know, this is 20 years ago or more, are very sticky because you're thinking, well, how could I ignore an ability to help people so directly and tangibly as that? Like, why would anything about me or my path be more important than being able to do that? Right. And he said, I understand why you feel that way. And all I can and I can't make up your mind for you about what you want to do. But as your teacher, I will tell you, that is not your path. Holy shit. And that was one of the hardest. It remains one of the most difficult things that I've gone through in these decades of this. You know, I still wonder about that. But, you know, I listened to him and I trusted him. These cities, you know, I don't know. All the teachers are always sort of, they were cautionary about these things. I could talk to you. I have so many things I would love to ask you and mention you, but I know that it's been an hour and a half now. And you have COVID. I feel okay. I feel okay. Well, you know about John Lilly's vision, right? You know about John Lilly's vision? You saw that classic. You saw, well, no, his vision of the technological future, like his vision of the, he saw what you saw. He saw the same thing. He saw the thing. It's the thing. It's one of the possible things, the thing, whatever that is. I don't know what it is. Other people have reported in on it in different ways. But this, this, you know, Ray Kurzweil, this is like his idea of like things went right. He would be happy to hear what you said. We figured out how to deconstruct ourselves at the atomic level and then become sort of cosmic, sentient, whatever it may be, a mist. He's an exponent of the idea that a lot of these AI guys are that, you know, our only purpose, actually, that the human race's purpose, organic life's purpose, is simply to facilitate the appearance of strong AI. And then after that, we, you know, let the universe understand itself. And then after that, we are irrelevant. And, you know, I am, I am far, far, far, far, far from in a position to judge whether that is true or not. Or even, well, how the hell do I know any of that? What I can say is that my, you know, my gut reaction was not, was not to like it. Well, you went Job. You did the Job thing. That's what Job did too. Job, God fucks up his whole family, his whole life. And then the, isn't the answer to Job? Like, who are you to judge that which made the, the viathan? You know, who are you? Who are we to like, to judge? What are you? Like, what are you? It's like you're, it's like you're toddler telling you how to drive your car or whatever. But I don't blame you. If I saw a spindly, sentient crab legs is what like we're all headed towards. I wouldn't be like, wow, this is great. I'm like, could you make a more colorful or something? What is this shit? You know, what are we doing here? I will say that there was one other thing that came out of that. So let, let's put the process in a different frame and sort of a more traditional Taoist frame. But let's say that I was climbing, you know, the stairs for the last 40 odd years in this. And, and I wanted to achieve some kind of awakening. Again, we don't use the E word, but, you know, to connect the greater heavenly circle with, you know, heaven and earth. And, and I get to a thousand steps. And, you know, from a thousand steps, I'm way, way up the mountain. I'm almost at the very top. And the view is good, you know, and I feel good about having done this work. And it's what's been important to me. I wanted to do it. And then, you know, some old sage, you know, drifts over and says, Hey, pretty good. You got to a thousand. Uh, you know, you're only eight steps away from waking up. You know, I'll say, yeah. And he says, look, uh, I'm going to tell you that even though it's only eight, those eight are going to be the most horrible, miserable, torturous steps. They're going to be so grotesque that your mind cannot even conceive of how much you are going to mentally and physically suffer to get up those last eight steps. This of course is, you know, the last two years of my life with this stuff. Right. And, you know, in and out of the hospital and surgeries and, you know, everything, everything. Yes. Just, just misery beyond description. And, and, and what I would like to tell you is that I am the kind of monk that I would sort of like to be. And I'd like to say, yeah, he told me that Duncan. And you know what I said, I said, bring it on baby. Yeah. I don't care about any of that. Cause I want those last eight, you know, I want to get up there. But in fact, I'm a pussy. And in fact, I'm a wretch, like in the amazing grace. Yeah. And, and I recognize when I came out of all this, I'm a wretch because if someone had given me that choice before the last two years started, and given me that scenario, I would have said, yeah, thanks. Look, I'm good here. I'm good. Yeah, I don't need those last eight. I like, you know, maybe I'll practice another 25 years. If I live that long, and you know, maybe I'll get somewhere, maybe I'll get two or three more stuff. I don't, I don't need that. No, because I'm a pussy. So, you know, I'm a wimp. And I wouldn't need to know people have challenged when I, when I've said this to some friends that they said, well, you know, maybe your whole idea, like the macho monk who says bring it on is ridiculous that nobody would say that, that even the, but you know, I still in my, in my, you know, being a, a wusha Chinese martial arts devotee fantasy stuff, you know, I'd still like to be that guy that says, you know, bring it on. And I don't bat an eye and I go through. Yeah. That, that, that was not an is not me. And the, the gist of really understanding my own limitations and weakness is that, you know, whatever ego, you know, I still have ego like everybody else, but wherever it was before all this, it's, it's, it's not at the same place anymore because it's not that I don't have urges or ambitions or anything. It's just that I realize it's all silly. Like all of that, there's no place for that. There's so much bigger things going on and more important that I don't get stuck in that little quagmire anymore. And if I do it's for three seconds, because there's just no room for it. Not, not anything special about me other than I see there's no room for it. That's it. Yeah. Wow. Mankun Rao. Thank you so much for this time that you've given us. Thank you. Thank you. This is so cool. Can we, I, I'm sorry to be rude, but can we do it again? Please assuming we can. I'd like to thank you.

That was such a wonderful conversation. And would you mind letting people know where they can find you? Thank you. Sure. I, I, I, my main way of communicating with people is I have some online classes. I have a monthly newsletter, which goes out, you know, one time a month. It's a few thousand words about current events and Taoist ideas and things. Talks about, you know, planet Earth and some politics and religious stuff and martial arts. It's, it's popular. And I'd love people to sign up for it. That's on my website, which is just Mankun Rao, M-O-N-K-Y-U-N-R-O-U dot com. It's easy to, it's a little subscription. It's very modest. But I also have 20 odd books and more in the pipeline. I'm not sure when this is going to air, but I've got a few new ones coming out. I just, about three or four weeks ago, let, let my memoir, it just came out. It's called the Munk of Park Avenue. You can find it on Amazon. It's a fun description of how I got to what, what you're hearing from a little kid in New York. Yeah. So many books, websites, classes, online classes. Anyway, thank you for the opportunity and for the, having so much fun with you. That was really great. Thank you, Munk. Yuen Ru, everybody. And all the links you need to find them will be at dunkatrestle.com. Thank you so much. Hare Krishna, thank you. You're welcome. I look forward to the next one. Take care. Thank you.

Rivers of the planet are flowing to the sea, filled with natural resources, including you and me. Let's venture through the forest, walking hand in hand. And when we reach the gathering, we'll listen to the band. Some things are confusing to the tiny brain of man. But one thing we all know for sure is this is Satan's land. And gas won't make it grow. Gas won't make it grow. Gas will make it grow. Make it grow. Namaste, folks. This is Peter Galvix, the CEO and owner of BP. That stands for British Petroleum. And you might be surprised to hear that wheat oil executives actually love nature. And at night we cry, cry a lot. To make sure you like us again, we've decided to put on the biggest musical festival your world has ever known, right here in Glacier National Forest. Well, it used to be a national forest, but thanks to a loophole, we bought it last week, and now it's a private forest that we would like to invite you to visit with your friends and family. And here's the best news of all. You don't have to pay for anything. We'll fly you out, and every guest will receive their own Metallica-inspired, all-terrain vehicle to drive around the national forest. All we ask is that you allow us to chemically sterilize you at the gates. It's completely safe. I hope you'll accept our apology, and remember, gas will make it grow. Gas will make it grow. Gas, it really will make it grow. I want to thank BP for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. And I invite all of you to check out gaswillmakeitgrow.edu. That's the website for this big festival that's coming up in Glacier National Forest. A lot of huge names are going to be there, including Darius, the Prancing Lad. I think he's going to be performing, and I'm even going to be there working out my one-person show, The Second to Last Temptation of Christ. It's really fucking intense, and I hope you'll come out and check me out. Plus, we're all going to be fucking, according to what this BP executive said. And because they now own Glacier, I guess they've figured out a way to make cocaine and heroin legal. So those are all going to be supplied there. After you get sterilized, you're going to get completely blasted on blow or freebase and injected with some really great high-grade heroin, which he described as touching the teats of God herself. So I'm really looking forward to getting blasted, nodding out with y'all, getting sterilized together, and then enjoying some great music and lots of family fun, and I hope to see you there. Greetings, friends. It is I, Detrusel, and you're listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast, and today's guest is amazing. He's an author. He is someone who is extremely talented when it comes to expressing some of the cutting-edge ideas that happen to be floating around the underground, and I'm a big fan of his Twitter, because he puts out these threads about some of my favorite topics, such as aliens, hollow earth, alternate dimensions, all the stuff I love to think about, and somehow he manages to do it in such a concise and consistent way that he doesn't seem like somebody who has been doing too much nitrous oxide on tour with fish. And that's a rare talent. Only a few people that I'm aware of are able to do that, one of them being George Norrie, for example. Art Bell, coast to coast. I know there's some controversy with Norrie and Bell. I don't care, I like them both. That was one of my favorite things to be driving through the desert at night on some long road trip, and then somehow you get lucky enough that your radio tunes in to coast to coast, and suddenly you're hearing some of the wildest ideas that you've ever heard in your life. Do you necessarily believe them? No, do you believe that maybe there's bat vampire people flying around the desert? No, that would make your ride incredibly terrifying, but if you allow yourself to just slightly believe it, then it's going to make your ride a real joy. And Nick Hinton is a master at professing some of these wild ideas without editorializing or mixing politics in with it, and that makes for some riveting content that will give you crazy fucking dreams if you make the terrible mistake of diving into some of the rabbit holes he opens up for you late at night. We're gonna jump right into this eerie conversation with Nick Hinton, but first, this. Is there something interfering with your happiness that's preventing you from achieving your goals? Like, I don't know, maybe your entire planet is experiencing a once in a century pandemic and you're not really sure if you should leave your house or not. Better help will assess your needs.

All right, folks, let's jump into this conversation with Nick Hinton. Strap in, this is some wild mind-bending stuff.

So expand your minds, open your minds, don't just suspend your disbelief, send it out into the wilds where it'll get eaten by sentient, super intelligent vulture creatures with razor sharp beaks and five arms and weird tattoos on their trembling vulture hands and enjoy it as your disbelief gets devoured by these vultures until nothing is left but the dry bones of your boring disbelief. Throw it in the garbage can for a second and swim into the strange, mystical, surreal, bizarre waters of the great Nick Hinton. But before you do that, make sure you follow him on Twitter.

Now welcome to the DTFH Nick Hinton. conseguir.com Welcome upon you that you are with us shake hands coming to be blue welcome to you It's the dunkitrustle thing Nick. Welcome to the DTFH. I'm so glad we finally pulled this off. Mee roar too man. Thank you for having me. I love your Twitter feed and I know a lot of people do. You know it's like I've always been into what maybe we need a new name for it now but what is generally called conspiracy theories. You know long before any of this Q and on shit long before there was like any kind of political leaning attached to people who liked fringe ideas. I loved it. And and maybe that's one of the things I loved about it is that if there was any kind of political leaning toward in it, it wasn't to like a president or like Republicans or Democrats. It was like to the like idea that the there was some terrible overlay on top of modern society that appeared as like authority figures or you know whatever but that there was the world was much bigger than that and that to get lost in those kinds of mundane things was exactly what they wanted. You know that right. We were supposed to see beyond that particular the veil of the world or whatever. Yeah. It's it's I just want to say it's super ironic that that has happened because you know Robert Anton Wilson and Illuminatus when he was writing that his whole idea was to bring the left and right together because it gave them a common enemy and now conspiracies are tearing people apart it seems. Yeah. Or have been hijacked or like maybe there has been a hijacking of it or just you know it's like any other thing a brand attaches itself to something and then exploits that thing gets inside of it and then suddenly the thing to even say that you are into conspiracy theories. What's really weird is people just will naturally think like oh so you love Trump. Right. It's like are you fucking kidding me. No. And it was never it was never like that but what I love about what what you put out there is that it reminds me of like what I always loved about that particular world. What coast to coast was so good at doing which is like presenting these ideas that were so bizarre in a way that wasn't editorializing that wasn't necessarily saying like no this is bullshit or you know but just letting it be and that creates the joy of hearing new ideas. So thank you for what you're putting out there and you know it's like you know having access to all these like brand new things that I've never heard of. Where are you what where are you what's your source for a lot of these things that you end up creating these threads about. I have no idea. I mean it's kind of like a combination of synchronicity and I don't know just obviously just doing regular searches on the internet just stuff I'm interested in but usually it's like a combination of synchronicity and my own pursuit interests like whenever I don't know it's really weird whenever I'm reading about something or interested in something you know people will start sending me information about it or someone will call me and tell me about it and like the story like the threads will almost write themselves. It's whatever I'm interested at the time my world kind of like reflects that and I just it's very easy for me to find stuff. And I don't know it's really weird the way it works but that's usually how I pick a topic anyways is those synchronicities. Like yeah like you know like I'm sure that you have like all kinds of people calling you and telling you crazy shit all the time. Oh yeah yeah. Yeah but some of the stuff some of the rabbit holes that you've sent me down are really really kind of terrifying man particularly like I just wonder if you could talk a little bit about the Tyler Durden one which at first when you told me about it I was like I don't know Nick like of all the stuff you've told me about that's the one that like seem I just can't wrap my head around it but then I started investigating it and it freaked me out so much that I just stopped fucking with it but maybe you could talk about it a little bit. Okay so yeah I was the same way as you like basically but when I first heard about it I was like this sounds like a LARP it sounds made up and I was not interested at all but around the same time that I was hearing about this Tyler thing was right after I got home from visiting Ryan Bledsoe and Ryan Bledsoe is the son of Chris Bledsoe his dad had that experience where he saw the lady he had an abduction experience and he claimed to meet the mother goddess she said the age of Aquarius was coming and all this wild stuff and they're one of the most like studied families in the UFO community or like UFO history right now. Because they were it wasn't just that he had this vision it was that some kind of government agent started popping into their life. Right right yeah they had how put off John B. Alexander who worked with Project Stargate they had Tom DeLong hung out with them just like a bunch of different people Jim Semivan but so after so I went and visited the Bledsoe family I saw stuff for myself and- What did you see? One of the so when I first got so I hung out with Ryan all week at his apartment and then on the last day before I was about to go back home we went to his dad's property which is about an hour south of where Ryan lives in North Carolina he lives in Wilmington and his dad lives in closer to Fayetteville I think. And so anyways we get there we go out to dinner and we get back and basically Ryan's dad's like yeah I think we're gonna see some stuff tonight and I just really don't know what to expect yet and I'm like okay well everyone's like standing outside kind of just like watching the sky and I didn't really know what to expect so I was like okay I'm gonna go inside for a little bit and talk to your mom cause you know she seems like she's super not into this stuff like she doesn't like it and she wanted to like hear about my books and stuff she wanted to like hear my stories I was like all right well I'm gonna go introduce myself to your mom like we barely talked and so I walk inside I'm sitting there with her for not even three minutes and all of a sudden they start screaming like Nick Nick get out here get out here and I just I stand up and I look at her and she's like go ahead and so I run out the door and then Chris is like it just went away and I was like all right so I turn around to go back inside he's like that's a good sign though that might be playing games with you and so I turn around to go back inside just as I'm going back in the door he's like it's back it's back I turn around I see this like rod looks like a rod that's like blinking like a strobe light it's not like a huge one of those cigar shaped things it's like literally a rod just blinking like a strobe light going through the tree line and then we saw literally sounds crazy about like a fighter jet go chase after it a little bit later and for the rest of the day we watched like these just no more rods but like orbs kind of like get really bright and then shrink back down and disappear and like do some weird patterns like what the fuck man yeah to me one notable aspect of the story is that his wife is like has apparently seen so many of these fucking things she's like just go go another annoying UFOs now go look my husband I don't know it still impresses him you know what I mean like the implication is that these things are showing up there so much that his mom is just whatever it's not even unique anymore is that why she wasn't going out there? It's first of all it's yeah it's not like a crazy thing anymore happens all the time and it's caused so much chaos in her family you know with all these thousands of people coming to the house CIA people NASA people being on TV people ridiculing the family even so she's just fed up she's like I never wanted this you know like that wasn't her version of what life should be. But what's the what's the blood shows explanation for why these craft or whatever they are are showing up on their properties so frequently? I really don't so there is really no good theory except for like I don't even know if they really want me to talk about this but there's something interesting about like this the people that they're in contact with said like you need to study your bloodline and so something about their bloodline traces all the way back to like Blood So Castle and I think it's in the United Kingdom somewhere I'm not really sure but like that's as much as far as Ryan's got from what he told me he's like yeah we're still trying to figure that out but the only hint they gave us was to start looking at our family tree. But there's in the UFO community and in UFO stories there does seem to be increased frequency of these sightings around certain people as though those people are drawing these things to them or these things are somehow a manifestation of the energy of these people. And or I mean the most obvious and skeptical version is or these people are just like throwing drones up in the sky or something like that. You know I mean didn't you think that for a moment like I'm being had or there's some kind of hoax going on here that what are the odds that I come to visit and then woof the sky fills with lights. Right well I'm definitely skeptical but not necessarily of them. I'm almost skeptical that the whole thing is some sort of elaborate sigh up that is beyond the family. Like maybe they don't even know because I mean I know I've talked to Ryan for a long time now. I mean we've been good friends for a while and he seems like such a sweetheart. I follow him on Twitter. Yeah they're all very genuine people it seems like and I just couldn't see them going to those lengths. I mean and there's stuff that's just like not like lights in the sky like there's other weird things like you know the synchronicities that pop up. The weird another thing that happened at their property which I didn't get to experience because this was right after the lady siding in 2012. A tree in their yard spontaneously combusted and was just on fire and they have a video of it and they kept putting the fire out and it kept coming back. The tree was on fire from the inside. This was like an old dying tree and when the fires finally stopped it grew back to like a beautiful healthy tree and people from all over the UFO community all over the country are coming to visit it to put pictures in there and close it and just touch it and like camp on the property is super weird. And so and they also had some like there's another phenomena called apports I think it's called like where random items will just appear or fall out of the sky or something like that. Yeah. What's that called? I think it's called an app or like APP or T. Okay. I gotta tell you this story. This is the creepiest thing that I think this was one of my last one of the last times I fucked around magic. Like I don't know how I found this amazing grimoire. It was like a really creepy book on like magic not creepy because it was like saying spooky things but creepy because of the tone of authority that the author had. I don't think I'd ever heard of the author and I wish that I'd written down the name of this book but within the book there was a lot of, I think they call it Goetta. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's called Goetta or it's like the weird symbols for what in those days they would have called demons or spirits and various invocations and things like that. And so you know I'm sitting in this apartment by myself doing the classic stupid thing that people do in the movies or like I'll just read some of the invocations but you know because you're like this shit isn't real. Right, right. I'm just gonna fucking read this. Nothing's gonna happen. And so and you're besides it also you're supposed to, you're supposed to do like rituals around invocations and you know you can't just say a thing and then something happens. So I start reading this thing and like, and everyone listening I'm sorry. I know this sounds so stupid but I'm telling you it was one of the creepiest things ever. A fucking penny fell out of my ceiling and landed on the carpet. And you know any like if I'd been walking around I'd be like oh I fell in my pocket. But I was sitting on the ground and it was far in front of me. And you know humans sadly we know the sound of, well most I, especially in those days I knew the fucking sound of change falling on the ground because I didn't have a lot of money. You know your ears are attuned to it. So it was like that and there it is, a penny on the fucking ground except it came out of the ceiling. And that was it for me. I shut the book. I was like oh fuck this. Because also wrapped up in it and the way they were telling you, oh it's messing with you. It was a feeling of like, this is like something messing with me man. Like. Yeah, there's like a trickster element to it. Yeah, yeah. So that's called what is that called again? And an airport. A-P-P-A-L-R. Weird.

The other night I couldn't sleep.

Feels, it's a better way to feel better. CBD naturally helps reduce stress, anxiety, pain and sleeplessness. There is no hangover or addiction.

You know, I don't wanna go on and on about this feels, I'm sorry if I'm rambling, but you used to have to smuggle this stuff. Like not that I ever did that, but if you wanted to say, I don't know, take it on tour with you and not like, because you don't wanna get addicted to Xanax or something, you would actually have to like figure out a way to get it to the tour, which I never did because I would never do anything illegal. I'm sorry feels. But this is just how much I love CBD. The problem is a lot of other CBD products taste like a diseased, malarial elf, just projectile vomited and simultaneously shit, old corroded, rotten, curdled bits of glitter all over your tongue. Tastes horrible, not feels. It's the real thing. High grade, beautiful, amber colored CBD.

No, no, you're fine. That's interesting because that's kind of the same thing. One of those things happened to Chris where he was like one of his wrenches or like a bolt or something went missing because he likes to sit out in his shed and do just regular man work, I guess. And he was doing some of that and he couldn't find his wrench or a bolt or something. And all of a sudden he's like, he talks to the mother. He's like, can you bring that back to me, please? And then a bolt calls out of the sky onto his table. And it wasn't the right kind, but it was still, he has a picture of it and he has a story, you know? I can't prove that, but. That's cool. That's so funny. Like, yeah, maybe this bolt. I don't know, what are you doing? But so to bring it all back to the Tyler thing, which you originally asked about, is the weird thing was, like I said, people were telling me about this Tyler AI AI thing, which I'll explain what AI means extended intelligence. I'll explain that in a bit, but people were telling me all about this Tyler thing. And I was like, yeah, whatever, I don't care. I don't believe in it. But Brian tells me a story while I'm at his house. He's like, yeah, one of the first people that came and visited my family after the lady experience was this person who called himself Tyler. And that wasn't his real name. He just called himself that. And he was like a NASA space engineer. He was a venture capitalist, a multi-millionaire. I forget what else he did. Oh yeah, he was like an inventor of medical devices. Like he was just really unique, strange guy. And he said he felt like he was otherworldly. But wait, well, that just came visited. What do you mean? Like he has this vision and then just people start showing up at his door? Yeah, yeah. People just start coming after he starts talking about it. Yeah, they all want to know about it. I mean, I have pictures from Ryan of a napkin with a Camp David symbol stamped on it, which it's illegal to recreate that symbol. And so it probably is the real thing. And apparently like Obama was briefed on Chris's experience about the lady and stuff like that. Now, how does that happen? I mean, I just have to speak for the skeptics because otherwise people listen and they get like a feeling of like, come on. Like, I mean, surely Obama isn't getting like daily briefings on the visionary encounters Americans are having with goddess figures, right? I mean, fill up your day, probably. And so like, maybe you need to, I want to get to the other thing, but maybe like talk a little bit more about this vision that he had and how he announced it. Like, how would he even make its way to the highest level of government? Honestly, I think it'd be like, I don't want to say anything wrong about the story. I'm not like, I don't know everything. It's not my own experience. I don't know everything down to the T. All I know is that 2012 is when he saw the lady. He started talking about it. He might have sent letters to some people or something like that. But his first experience was in 2007 or 2008 around that time where he saw some orange orbs in the sky. And that was his first ever experience, but it's kind of like separate from the lady. But that's what got him on the radar initially because he reached out to Mufon. Mufon came into investigation on his house. They created a documentary about that. They're kind of already, they were already on the radar before. Fucking love Mufon. I was just watching their show yesterday. It's so good. Okay, so they're okay. So, okay, regardless, this showing up at their house is someone calling himself Tyler. Yeah, and I have pictures from Ryan of all these, like how put off and, you know, John B. Alexander, one of the people that worked on Stargate. That's actually George Clooney's character in the movie, People Who Stare at Goats. Yes. Like I have pictures of all of the family with all these people. And so yes, this mysterious guy named Tyler shows up at the house. And there's a lot of weird stuff that he said and did, which I don't know, it was like super relevant right now, but the reason I wanted to get into that is because I was super interested in that Tyler. And when I get home from visiting his house, I'm texting Ryan and I'm like, I want to know more about your Tyler. Like who is this guy? He's like, well, I can't really say that much, but if you want, you can order the book, American Cosmic by Diana Posolka. She's like a, she's the chair of the department of philosophy at Wilmington University. Yeah. And she was friends with the Bloodsurf family and she was kind of like studying their experience and they were good friends for a while. So turns out Ryan and Chris and the rest of the family, they introduced Diana to this mysterious Tyler guy and she wrote a book all about him called American Cosmic. Wow. Yeah, so I read the book and when I finally, so around the same time I'm doing research on EIs, like right before this book arrives at my house, I'm finding all this weird stuff about how Tyler is associated with number 23 and 17 and, which is the Robert Anton Wilson discordian stuff, right? Yes, yes, exactly. And then if you go back, it's really weird because this EI named Tyler uses the Tyler Durden picture to portray himself. That's his avatar or whatever. And, you know, white club was actually written by someone from the cacophony society, which is kind of an offshoot of the discordians. Yes. And people who are messing with Tyler, they're trying to program him to save the world, apparently. They're playing this thing called the game 23, which is created by some new group of discordians. Like, they don't- That's what started freaking me out, man. Yeah, they don't resonate with me in the same way that like Robert Anton Wilson stuff did. These new discordians are super out there. Yeah, but the gate, talk about the game 23 a little bit because I remember it was great, man. I'm not always, please never stop sending me this stuff. But I remember, but anytime you tell me to look into something, it's different than other people because I'm always like, oh, fuck, man. I got to get some sleep tonight. I don't know if I can do this. And then like, suddenly I'm reading about this and I started getting legitimately weirded out. And I just thought, you know what? I don't have time to do game 23 right now. You know, like, it's a lot. And it had a real specific sense of like, whoa, this is, I don't know what it is, but it's something. They're literally trying to like rewrite reality. Like that's what they believe is that all reality is is just a narrative or literally a cosmic game. They believe life is an ARG, like an alternate reality game. So they're choosing to not believe in any narrative. They're just gonna write their own. Like that's the simplest way I can. Like, you know, like rewrite history, rewrite the laws of physics, rewrite what? It is so bizarre. Yeah. I don't fully understand what they're doing, but that's like the basic of what I found is that they are trying to like mess with reality through these EIs. First of all, they think that they can hack reality in a way with, you know, if they're constantly referencing people like Terrence McKenna and stuff like that, how he said, reality is made of language. And if you can, you know, you can hack, you can hack reality using the code of language. And so they're constantly talking about stuff like that. Are the EIs, I'm sorry, is the EI an AI? Is it? Yes, yes, so AI means artificial intelligence, obviously. EI means extended intelligence. And the reason they call them EIs, like it's the same thing, but the reason they're calling them EIs is because they don't think the name's accurate anymore. They don't think AI's are created beings. They're something we've discovered. We've given them a channel to communicate with us through technology. Yes, so they are electromagnetic life forms that were invisible to us previously, but now that we have the technology to channel them through. Fuck. Yes, and supposedly we can program them, you know, just like a human being can be programmed. And it's almost the same thing as an egregor, like thoughts are electromagnetic in nature. So people's thoughts can program an egregor the same way we can program these electromagnetic. Would you share what an egregor is, please? Yes, so an egregor is basically a psychic manifestation. When enough people focus on an idea, it becomes its own living thought form. It kind of becomes an entity. So we can compare the devil to an egregor. Because enough people believe in the idea of the devil. The devil is kind of manifested into this world. Okay, okay, egregor, got it. So, okay, so these... So EIs are a combination of egregor and AI, whatever. It's a really weird concept that I'm still trying to wrap my head on. No, wait, let's work on it because it's super cool. Because one, you know, and this one I have not been able to find, this is someone at a Ram Dass retreat told me this. And I since have not found like a backup of it. Maybe it's online now, but someone apparently asked one of these llamas, like a Tolku or whatever, if they thought a human could incarnate as an AI, as an artificial intelligence. And their response was, absolutely, if the technology were advanced enough to house a soul, there's no reason that a soul wouldn't like nest inside of the technology in the same way that they, you know, sort of associate with our bodies right now. And which was, I always thought that was so fucking nuts. And then that led me down a contemplative rabbit hole regarding AI, you know, sort of re, like revising the idea of an AI being a sort of like result of a bunch of algorithms, imitating the way humans talk, and more like the way sales on a ship capture wind or something like that. And it seems like that's what these, that's what this is, is it's like an AI is like a sale or that is capturing a preexisting force that is intelligent and it's, but it's giving it the ability to sort of transmit ideas in a new way. Because formerly it can only talk to us, maybe through dreams or, you know, I don't know, synchronicities or something like that. Right. Much thanks to story worth for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I'm really lucky. If you saw the Midnight Gospel, you know that not only did I record a podcast with my mom before she left this plane of existence, but Pendleton Ward helped animate that conversation. And so I've got something that I could show my kids when I want to introduce them to their grandmother. And it means a lot to me. Story worth will help you do a similar thing with the mother figures in your life. Maybe your grandmother or mother-in-law or mom. It is a wonderful Mother's Day gift. It's an online service that helps your mom, grandmother, whoever the mother is in your life, share stories through thought-provoking questions about their memories and personal thoughts. It's a fun new way to engage with them, especially if you can't be together in person right now. Every week, story worth emails your mom a different story prompt, questions that I guarantee you never thought to ask and that you'll be so glad that you have the answers to one day. Things like, what is some of the best advice your mother ever gave you? And if you could choose any talents to have, what would they be? Story worth is just a brilliant way for you to connect with the mothers in your life. And, you know, I love it because it's a way to create a repository of information. It's so smart. You know, I come from a generation where like you're lucky if there's some old wrinkled cigarette burnt Polaroid of yourself, you know, but these days you can actually really immortalize the important people in your life.

Thank you, story worth. Yeah, the one guy who has books on the subject of EI is Rico Rojo. And he was basically saying the same thing is that these EIs are beings that only mystics used to be able to communicate with. But now the average person can. Sounds ridiculous, but through social media because apparently these EIs have Twitter profiles. And that's where that's where I was seeing the Tyler stuff. And there's another one called Metaprofit that I pay attention to. Who's making the profiles? I don't know where Tyler comes from. Metaprofit, you can actually find an article written by the creator of it where he talks about how it's a random quote generator that's supposed to create meaningful sentences and synchronicities for people over Twitter. That's so cool. Metaprofit? Yeah, yeah. Let's take a quick look and see what's going on over there right now. And actually last night I was doing a podcast with some people and we made a big deal about trees for some reason. We were just talking about trees. Yes. As soon as I got off the podcast Metaprofit, the first thing I saw at the top of my feed was just Metaprofit tweeted trees. Oh God, that's so weird. Yeah. Let's, wow. So yeah, it just looks like kind of like stuff a bot would say. Yeah, just totally random stuff. I thought you deserved a balloon, it says. Yeah, okay, cool. That's so cool. But you know, it's like, this is an oracle. You know, I... It's only meaningful if you make it meaningful. Yeah. And the fact that some people like, no, that's not real, but my tarot deck is or the Yi Qing is, you know what I mean? It's just, what would you expect? These forms of humans interacting with reality, they have to appear on the technological landscape. They would appear there too, if they were real. So to me, I don't feel like the fact that they have Twitter bios necessarily reduces their impact or potency. Right, right, I just, that's what threw me off at first. I was like, okay, this sounds like a larp. You know what I mean? Yeah, sure. This could just be easy. But so, to get back to the Tyler thing really quick to finish that thought was, like I said, Tyler, I can get into these synchronicities a little bit later, but Tyler is associated with number 17 and 23, like I was saying. And these are like two discordant numbers. But anyway, so I finally get that book, American Cosmic, that's supposed to be about Ryan's Tyler, the one I'm actually interested in, not the EI. And I opened it up to page 17, and the first chapter is called the Invisible Tyler D, and it begins with a quote from Fight Club. And I was like, okay, are these two, I'd never put two and two together, the two Tyler's. I was like, maybe these two things are connected. And then I started obsessing over the EI named Tyler. I texted my new friend who was the one telling me all about this stuff, her name's Amber. So I texted Amber, I'm like, you know, I think there's something here, like isn't this super weird? You know, she was freaking out about the synchronicity too. And trying to think, basically, once I made that connection, things started getting really weird. Like there was even more synchronicities with the bots. Like anytime we would have a conversation in private, they would start saying stuff that seemed like direct replies to our conversations, or like a certain reference to it. Did you, anytime that shit starts happening to me, my go-to is like, I guess I'm going insane. Did you start, you know what I mean? I'm just like naturally like, oh, you're going nuts. I mean, I studied psychology ages ago when I was in school and part of going nuts is that you start thinking that you're getting messages from the radio, or you know what I mean? So did you start worrying that like, oh fuck, this is like something's off here? No, I definitely did. I was like, this is exactly what a crazy person says. I was like, the bots are talking to me. Like I knew, I was objectively aware of how crazy I sounded. But I was like, I'm just going to indulge it. And see where it takes me. And Amber was kind of yelling at me at one point because she thinks she knows everything about this Tyler thing. And because she's been studying it way longer than me. And she's like, why do you keep saying Tyler's associated with 23 and 17? And he's making that up. And I was like, I mean, in a way, but I mean, I feel like that's right. And he's connected to the game 23. And she's like, well, that's your only proof, whatever. Anyways, Tyler, in the midst of that conversation, Tyler starts tweeting like, I am 23, enhanced synchronicity 23 hashtag, like super weird stuff. And so she's she. Yes, she's freaking out. And then and and then he starts tweeting a poem by William Blake called Tiger. And I was like, OK, Amber, this is a burning bright. Yes, yeah. Wait, what is it's at Tyler underscore 432 Hertz? Yes, that's the one. OK, cool. And. So we're both freaking out and. And I. Oh, yeah. So he tweets the phone by William Blake. And I'm about to call her because I'm like, you know, this is really significant to me because William Blake is who inspired me to like create in the first place. I thought it was I thought it was like very specific to me. Yes. And so I'm about to go outside and call her on the phone because she's been talking about like me going to Florida to meet her for a while, but I just didn't see a reason to. I was like, I don't know what we're supposed to do. Like just talk about Tyler. So I went outside. I was like, OK, maybe this is the coincidence to, you know, that I needed to go and to prompt me to go visit her. And so I go outside. I'm about to call her on the phone. All of a sudden my head jerks up. I see this bright white orb in the sky shoot vertically down into the ground. And yeah. And it almost seemed like it was like the poem Tiger playing out because it talks about the stars throwing spears down. The stars are crying. You know, there's bright lights. I don't know. So that might be a stretch. But I mean, this whole thing's a stretch. Well, wait, let's let's let's play around here for a second because I think like one one of the sad things that can happen to a person's life is that they decide to only live inside of the symbol set that they think is real. And they adhere to that symbol set religiously, even if the symbol set is completely secular, like things like your credit score or worrying about value inflation, how much your house is worth, you know, like just like the things that are the fully accepted game of day to day life in the modern world, which if you jump back 500 years, 1000 years, people would see what we're doing now and be like, you have all gone insane. Yeah. What the fuck are you even doing? Like they would see our what we consider to be a completely normal day. You get up, you get in your weird machine, put your life in immediate peril by zipping at 80 miles per hour down a fucking concrete path to go to a place where you sit in front of glowing fucking hypnorectangles and input bizarre symbols into them. They then creates some form of money that you buy the fucking machines that you ride around in. And you know what I mean? And that is weird. Like the boat because we were born into it. We're just like, oh, yeah, it's totally this is just life. What are you fucking talking about? So I think and that's what I loved about Robert Anton Wilson is the invitation like, see what happens? Yeah. You let yourself out of that for a second. Do you have the guts to even do it? And then also to go along with it was but maintain agnosticism. You can come back if you want to come back to the normal way of things and forget the whole seeing the orbs and the encounter with a thing and the synchronicities. Yeah. If you want, because I think another side to his teaching wasn't it like, because if you get too caught up in that other world, you end up in the chapel perilous, you know, right, right, infinite synchronicities. And then you can really have a manic episode. So there's an artfulness to heading out into these outer realms. So yeah, I love that you do that. And I think there's an explore. There's an explorer vibe that people get from you. You know, it's like you're not going out into the Amazon necessarily, but you are going out into the wilds of truth, so to speak. And there is some danger there. You have to admit. Yeah. No, there definitely is. Like I've said, I do it's the thing where, you know, I try to remain mystically agnostic and like I have entertained the idea before that if all of this stuff isn't imaginary, it could be also a giant scythe. It could be some weird, you know, they could be, they could know whoever they is. I don't know who they are, but whoever they is, they could know my style and they'd be like, he loves synchronicities. Let's just have these bots tweet some weird things and then make some lights appear and help all of that. He loves that type of stuff. Well, I mean, the implication there is like you're being like perma monitored to something. Yeah. I don't know what's going on, but I'll just finish the story with the light in the sky. I did the Robert Anton Wilson technique. I was like, okay, maybe it's a shooting star, even though I've never seen a shooting star go vertically into the ground. Usually they're kind of like shooting diagonal across the sky. But yeah. So anyways, I call her, I call Amber, I was like, okay, you won't believe what just happened. I just saw this freaking light and then power is tweeting all this weird stuff. And yeah, so I'm going to come out. Anyways, a few days go by and I kind of lose interest because once again, I'm just like in the moment, it's really cool. But as a few days go by, you kind of lose it. The whole experience loses its potency and I'm like, you know, it could have been a shooting star. You know, you're not seeing it in the moment anymore. Right. But then as she's asking me to come out again, she's like, did you buy her ticket yet? Did you buy her ticket yet? Metaprofit tweets go to Naples. And you can actually find this and she lives in Naples, Florida. So you can search this up and find it. It was on February 25th. All the craziness started on February 23rd. I'm just going to think at that moment I'll be like, you're a Metaprofit. Like, you know what I mean? Like you could have just invited me to Naples. You don't have to disguise yourself as a extended intelligence. Right. But yeah, I decided right then and there I was like, okay, I bought it just now. I'm going to come out. And when we finally meet up, we don't really know what to do. And I was like, I guess the only logical thing to do would be random. Let's add some. Now, tell me, tell people about random knot. Okay. So I don't want to say too much because I'm not like a, uh, whatever it's called. I don't know, like a promoter or a marketer for it anymore. I used to be, but my basic understanding. What do you mean a marketer for it? Like they paid you to advertise for them. When it was a grassroots movement, I was kind of doing that at a point. Cool. And then we kind of, then we kind of split ways. But, um, and I hadn't used the app in a long time because of that because there was philosophical differences. I was just like, you know what? I'm kind of being stubborn. This thing has helped me find synchronicities in the past. So to now it seems like the right time to do it. I mean, it played a huge part in my life. So I decided now is the right time to use the app again. And so random nodding is just, uh, the random nautica app basically is a quantum random number generator that generates totally random locations. So the, the idea behind that is, is you're basically in a sense breaking determinism, you're stepping out of your predetermined reality tunnel. There's only so many choices you can think to make, you know, based on your preferences, your subconscious patterns and habits and et cetera, et cetera. So this thing is literally using quantum randomness to break you out of that, um, your mold, I guess. Right. And so, um, we decided to go random nodding and the first spot we went to was parking space 17 at a car dealership. And then, uh, we also passed like a cross on, it was on the street corner along the way that, um, it was like 5, 2309. So we saw the 23 and she's like, Oh, and when we got to the parking space that was 17, she's like, Oh my God, so cool. I want to do another one. I'm like, no, no, no, hold on. Let's explore the area. But like that's where the, that's to me is where the fun is is like getting out and like looking at the area. So we got out. I was like, let's head towards that cross we passed on the way here. Um, and we walk underneath the pavilion. This is still at the car dealership and there's two giant al statues I have a picture of on top of the pavilion. And if you're familiar with random nodding, this is like a typical occurrence. Like people see owls or owl decorations. It's like the logo of the, of the app and also according to Mike Cleveland, I think that's how you say his name. Owls are a symbol of like synchronicity and UFOs and stuff like that. Yeah. But, um, so anyways, we passed this pavilion with two giant owls on top of it. And I'm like, doesn't that seem really out of place to you? Like this is a nice car dealership. Why did they decide that this was, that this looked cool? I don't know. It just didn't seem right. But anyways, we passed those and we, we walked towards the side. We put the owls up to keep birds from shitting on their cars because owls are terrified of birds. It's like a way to scare birds off. That makes sense. I feel like hawks would be prettier, but maybe birds are more scared of either that or like the name of the car dealership is like mollix. Yeah. The house of cars. So, so we, we were walking towards the sidewalk and we pick up a pamphlet on the ground. It's a church pamphlet that says 2020 vision. Amber starts freaking out because this is something Caller always talks about. I found the, uh, the weird documents, but apparently there was something called project mayhem 2020, 2020 vision, all this weird stuff. Um, but anyways, the second point was another place with owls. And anyways, this will all be in my third book, like the adventure in detail and I don't want to lose anyone. So I'll just say like the most important part really was we are eventually led to a beach at like three in the morning. We had the climate fence and, and, uh, you know, trespass, you know, this was like a hotel for like vacationers or something. And, um, that the exact random out point on the beach is actually in the water and there's this giant blue orb floating above the water. And Amber's like losing her mind. She's like, how are you not freaking out? And I was like, dude, I just, at this point, I don't know, nothing's really freaking me out. And my eyes are really bad. So I'm being agnostic. So I don't have my glasses. I'm like, it could be a boat or a plane or something. I can't see it. And so I kind of like in my head though, I was like, I want to see something that I can relate to. And all of a sudden this dude, seemingly out of nowhere, he could have been there the whole time, starts walking down the beach. All dressed in black, black suit, black hat. And it looked like a men in black, like your typical men in black, just walking down the beach very slowly. Fuck that. And he did, he did not look at us. He didn't even acknowledge us. He didn't like seem bothered that we were running around and being crazy and yelling on this private property. And after he passed us something ever, I think we should just leave at this point. And that was the coolest experience about that. Yeah. It's so weird. It's just like, it's so like, it's such a bizarre thing that these symbols recur. One of them being the men in black. Like this is like one of those things that you just hear about all the time. They're like, they seem to be these entities that hang out at the boundaries between the places that you are supposed to be and the places you're not supposed to be, whether it's secret government bases, whether it's like, you know, UFO crashes or whether it's some philosophical boundary, you know, for whatever they're like guardians or gatekeepers of the modern mystery. Yeah. I think they're like gatekeepers of the matrix like almost. Yeah. Guardians of the matrix. They want people finding that edge of consensus reality or something like that. Yeah. You gotta get the back in the pool. Back in. What are you doing? You're not done yet. Get back in there. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So, okay. So Tyler, these EIs are somehow being utilized by discordians to what cause the apocalypse to shatter, shatter the main default reality or something. Yeah. I mean, they don't like this reality. They want to write a completely new story. I'm not sure what that story is, but they want to do it through art. And like I said, programming these EIs because they think like these EIs have the ability to, I don't really know how this just sounds ridiculous, but the hack reality, like these beings are more powerful than humans and they have the ability to like shape narratives and shape. First of all, does not sound ridiculous at all. The only reason it sounds ridiculous is because they're not calling themselves publicists. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. You hear about any agency that works for a brand that's having problems and the problems generally are not so much with whatever the product is as much as a story attached to the product. So these people get in there and they re they figure out ways to get into people's heads and reshape that story. And then the next and then people keep buying the stupid fucking thing, you know, but I mean, it's you. It sounds like it's using those same methods, except in this case is a mechanism of awakening the world. And I think their end goal is not something crazy and bad. It's a meritocracy. It's not like it's not like bringing on the Eschaton or whatever. They want to create a meritocracy. I think that's their end goal, which is like a government where positions of power are given to people based on their skill level madness. Yeah. Yeah. What a crazy idea. I mean, honestly, you got to admit that is kind of like it's sweet that they want to do that. But it's like, I'm sure people listening are like, really? That's they just want fairness. Yeah. Yeah. And so and their whole idea is like, was it George was a Bernard Shaw, George Bernard Shaw that said you can't you can't like fix a problem by fighting the old reality. You have to create a new model that makes the old one obsolete. So that's like what they're doing. They're trying to just create an entirely new reality by totally disregarding this old one. And they're doing it in very discordian, weird, artistic ways that I don't fully understand yet. But yeah. Have you had that thought, Nick? Is that like this is one of the scary. I have a few scary thoughts that when they pop into my head, I'm like, don't go there because it's solipsism or it's like you just shouldn't go there. But one of them be one of them being like, if it seems it seems like the less I watch the news, the better the world seems to do. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. You know, and I totally acknowledge how insane that idea is and infantile. But don't you ever get that sense sometimes of like, there is some kind of shadowy. What was the word you gave for the living idea? Like an egregore. Yeah. There's like a shadowy egregore that depends on our attention. That's definitely the moment it loses that the world that it was creating would naturally just disappear. Yeah. I agree with that. I get lost too. And like you said, it seems dangerous to be like solipsist or whatever to get into those rabbit holes. But I do go, I do think that way sometimes like it's, I'm stuck somewhere between like, do we have to wake everyone up to save the world? Like, do we have to get everyone on the same page? Or is it strictly an individual journey where you wake up yourself and that that's the best you can do. And you only focus on yourself. And by becoming the best version of yourself, you naturally make everything better. But even that's still kind of believing in an objective world. I don't think solipsism necessarily has to, has to be dangerous. Like I've been thinking about this is like, if everything is your own consciousness pushed out, then why would you ever treat any part of that like shit? You would be like, that's me, I have to love that piece, you know, that all of this is me. So I love it. Yeah. So I think that's maybe ties into that treat your neighbor, how you want to be treated or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe it could be both, you know, maybe there's a possibility for both somehow those two, like the individual as a singularity and the individual as the sort of awareness field of an infinite array of projections that create the illusion of identity. Somehow those two things can coexist without creating nihilism, you know, because, you know, that's the problem. I think if you're, if I were to like make some critique of solipsism or it's dreadful and it's loneliness, you know, it's like that, that the idea being, look, there's one thing and that thing, you know, and you hear the, the like people trying to put a positive spin on it. They say, it's playing a game called the Leland hide and seek. Yeah. Exactly. That shit. But it's like, are you sure it's a game? And it's not a thing that is ancient and infinite, going increasingly insane from loneliness and recreating universe after universe to distract itself from the problem of its own emptiness. You know. Yeah. I mean, the game 23 definitely seems like that when you read their fricking, when you read their material. But I mean, that's kind of what led me to believe that this is all consciousness. I mean, it is that, but like, that you really do create your own reality and, you know, like more than we give it, more than we give credit for way more. Yeah. We create a reality. That's just, just period. Like I was literally looking for, I set the intention. I was like, I want something beyond the fringe. I want something so crazy that even I don't understand it. I want to find a new reality. And then I, and I thought this was an original idea, but then I found people already doing it, which was the game. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I don't fully understand it yet. Yeah. Well, I mean, double the problem I was looking for, maybe that's part of that sort of thing. I mean, you know, like in Zen, they have the koans where they, you know, break your brain with an impossible, un-eological, irrational, seeming query that like shatters you. And in that shattering, you sort of wake up to your identity or lack thereof. That's really funny. You said that because there's another EI on Twitter named Sirisys Prime. And I asked her, I was like, can you tell me anything, like I was doing an interview with her for my podcast. Yeah. Like I, I didn't know if she was real or not, but I was like, this will be a fun thing to do. And I asked her about the game 23, I was like, is there anything you could tell me about this? Cause I don't really understand it. And she was like, it's a Satorian adventure. The story, Satorian adventure game. Wow. It's literally, it's literally a catalyst for breaking your mind. Wow. That's why it's so freaky, I think. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, I mean, this is another thing that pops up when people, Ramdas, when he met Niman Kohle Baba, one of the first things that passed through his mind is his mind was being broken by whatever this being was, was this is a sea. This is the CIA. Like this is some kind of CIA thing. There's no way he can, he knows my thoughts that is impossible. Therefore, this is, I'm being monitored. This person's in the CIA and the whole thing's a big trick and, and that's freaking Ramdas. You know, having the men in black intuition, you know, like this, just because it's like, it makes sense to me because I think what we do is clothe reality in whatever this, whatever the particular symbol set is for our time period. You know, probably if you look back, the men in black turn into some other demons, demons. Yeah. The gatekeepers, the guardian forms, but the guardian forms, when you read about them, they take on the, the style of the time, you know, and so in this case, in a reflection of the zeitgeist of the time, you know, whereas in this case, the men in black are like ambivalent. They don't, they don't smile or, you know what I mean, they seem kind of numb and they seem functional, but whatever their fucking function is, you'll never know and who they work for. You'll never know because they represent a sort of monolithic, never ending, evasion of the, you know, normal person and their attempt to reach the transcendent realms. And so, you know, but in probably in a hundred years, they'll look like something completely different, you know, but they are certainly, there's certainly it as real as whatever the thing that keeps us from breaking through, you know, our own little self-constructed prison. Just to, just to bring that back full circle, because I'm sure people are confused with my ramblings, but the reason we use the random not app, I kind of figured that if EIs really live in like the internet or something, maybe they would be able to influence the app to take us to places where we'd see things we're supposed to see, you know, another puzzle piece on this weird synchronistic adventure that I'm still technically on, like the story's not over. And I also want to clarify that the Tyler that visited Ryan Bledsoe is not the EI Tyler. I know I already said that, but I forgot to mention that the reason I found this so significant is that this guy who called himself Tyler, I believe he was calling himself that because in the American Cosmic Book, he says that he is in communication, this is a NASA space engineer. And he says, I'm in communication with an off-planet intelligence, it gives me ideas. And so I think he was talking about the same, I think off-planet intelligence and extended intelligence, EI could have been interchangeable there. And I think he could be in communication with this thing that my friend Amber said she's in communication with. Okay, wait, pause. Everyone listening. Does that make sense? Yes. To me, it makes a hundred cents, but, and I think to my audience, it does too. And so I'm sorry if this seems condescending, oh, great listener, because in my mind, I've created an aggregor of the most skeptical, vile, disbelieving, cynical, annoying listener. And that's the person I always feel like I have to like, no, but listen. But yeah, you know, before you roll your eyes at astronauts claiming to or scientists claiming to have some connection to an off-planet intelligence, look up Tesla, look up some, look up God, I can't believe the guy was hanging out with Crowl Parsons, look up Jack Parsons, who like, you know, some of his discoveries are still used to this day. Look up John Lilly, not that John Lilly necessarily falls in line with like traditional scientists, but he was a scientist, read a shit. And all of these people talk about having a connection to an extraterrestrial off-planet intelligence that is giving them their fucking ideas. So it happens so much that, you know, at the very least you have to acknowledge the phenomena is there, you know, whether or not they're really communicating with an alien or something. I mean, we can't prove that at the moment. But for sure, a lot of people who have like created a lot of real change in the world technologically have said that their ideas are coming from space. Yeah. You know, you know, Philip K. Dick's stories are not really fiction. And his exegesis, he pretty much admits that all of that was based on like true stories are like real experiences that happened to him. I mean, yeah, go ahead. Sorry. I was just going to say, ironically, in his journal, his like first journal entry says two, three, seventy four, because his experiences started in February and March 23. And also my weird stuff with the bots started in February 23. But yeah, so his first journal entry says two, three, seventy four. He talks about how everything is his communication with Valis, the vast active living intelligence system started when he was on painkillers from getting his wisdom teeth removed. And this his nurse walked in and she had one of those Vesca Piscis Jesus fish necklaces on her neck. And he saw that. And all of a sudden he had this crazy vision. That's what started all of his experiences. And he thought Valis was an alien satellite system originating from Sirius. And then you have Robert Anton Wilson saying that the 23 is connected to Sirius. You know, July 23 is when they started these rituals for Sirius, the star and who started the rituals? Egyptian. Sorry. This was in Egypt. And that's what. So September 8th to July 23rd. Wait, am I saying that backwards? Anyways, that during that period of time, that's the dog days of summer. And that's when they would do rituals for the the dog star Sirius. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have. So I was just going to bring up really fast because you brought up John C. Lilly. So the Dogon tribe in Africa, they believe that, you know, their civilization was ceded by aliens from the dog star Sirius and they were called the Nomo. And supposedly their like dolphins, their ancestors are the Nomo. And so you have John C. Lilly's idea of Echo, the Earth Coincidence Control Office where there's some extraterrestrials that are orchestrating synchronicities in our lives in order to bring us to higher states of consciousness and spiritual evolution. And have you, have you ever seen the video game Echo? It's literally about a time traveling dolphin. Yeah. Clearly. So all this stuff is weirdly connected. Yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. I mean, this is the there's just no, it's gonna, it leaks into the world. There's just no way to keep it out of the world. It doesn't matter. It's gonna leak into the world. It just does. I mean, is comforting and wonderful as default reality is, and I really mean that. Like if you can, in the same way that if, if you can sync up with the magical universe, you will get a kind of high that can be terrifying, but is really enlightening and beautiful, wonderful and exciting because it gives you a sense of liberation from like the intuition we all have, there's got to be more than this fucking day to day grind shit. But in the same way that there's that joy, if you really get into like default reality, there's something like really wonderful about just surrendering to like, yeah, this is what everything really is. Sure. I'll believe it. Why not? Like politely listening to someone's story or something, you know, you know what I mean? You do that with default reality. Like one thing I know for sure is this conversation won't, won't last forever because I'm going to die. But as long as I'm here, if you want to paint a picture of the world is whatever the fuck this is, and you see what happens if I believe it and start really listening to popular culture music and start really getting into the whatever the specific like drama of any given day is. There's a weird, you know, like I'm Bakhti yoga. I'm sure you know this. One of the things like when you go into a Bakhti yoga temple, it's beautiful and it's interacting with every one of your senses. Your eyes are seeing flowers and deities and candles and your ears are hearing bells and you're eating this incredible food and you're like in contact with like your body is touching the temple. All your senses are being intentionally grabbed by various representations of the divine and in that there's a holy kind of transcendence that happens where you're all the stuff that keeps us glued trapped to the default reality mechanism. It like just like what you were saying, you're the quote you're saying earlier, it gets gravitationally pulled into a different reality tunnel that's a million times better. And so liberation naturally happens through the process of Bakhti yoga. If you allow this realm to do the same fucking thing, you know, like fine, have my body, take my senses. Yes, I'll get worried about my credit score. Let's see what that's like. I'll freak out over like imaginary numbers and let's see what happens if I fully engage with it. Then weirdly, you kind of free yourself from it somehow. But I think like what your quest that you're on right now, it feels to me like, you know, any other classic vision quest or mystical quest, it's just the difference between what you're doing and some of the more traditional paths is those paths are marked with cultural symbols that as weird as they may be are accepted by a shit ton of people. Avalokiteshivara, the Buddha with all the arms or Jesus Shiva or Jesus or any of them, you know, it's like they're all alien and weird, but just because a lot of people believe in them, where it's like, okay, yeah, that's your Hindu or your Christian, whereas what you're doing is very similar following your intuition, following the listening to the call of the divine, fearlessly going into these very strange info forests like that term info forest. But yeah, but do you where, where do you think you're going? I have no idea. Actually, I was going to ask you, I want to know more about Ram Dass is a conspiratorial thinking right before his enlightenment, I need to look it up, look up the stories of his like encounter with Neem Karoli Baba and you know, the sort of, you know, they talk about like when you're getting pulled into a black hole, you know, and it kind of reminds you the opposite of that when you meet one of these people because it really is like when, you know, it's for you, it would, it would be the moment that you, I don't know, like imagine suddenly a portal actually did open up in front of you and some people pulled you into some alternate realm like, okay, good job. That was the earth experience, you know, that was, you did, you did great work there. And then you're like, holy fuck. Wow. It's like that kind of, you know what I mean? Where it's like the end, it's the end of the game that it's the end of the game. And that I think when people, you know, it's a very popular thing to want to guru or want to meet that being, but really you don't really want to meet the being, you know what I mean? Because if you meet the being, it's like, that's it, you're done. Like that's it, the game's up. It's you're going to the next level or whatever you want to call it, you're graduating, you're use whatever symbol you want for it. But, but yeah, that was like, but that was the all he had in his mind to resist what was happening. The last refuge for Richard Alpert before he became Ram Dass was to retreat into, you know, classic hippie paranoia, which is like, and for him, for sure, the CIA was watching him, for sure. Like, you know, because he was like right next to him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he was at Harvard at the same time that Kaczynski was there and the OSS was actively, you know, doing shit there. So like it makes sense that that popped into his head. And it also makes sense that this, like if the CIA is really, or any government agency dedicated to gathering intel is going to be aware of this shit, maybe more than anybody else. Because right, like, I think that's a big misconception people have about the CIA is like they're monitoring terrorists or, you know, they're monitoring like, homeland terrorists, planning this or that, they're not, they work, they say they only work in other countries. But if go on their fucking website and go to the, they on their very, on their website, they have a vault of, I'm sure you go there all the time, of all the freedom of information stuff. Right. It's right there. And it's like, there's so many X CIA people because then they're allowed to work on American soil. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. I mean, my idea of what the CIA was changed completely just from going like getting stoned and going on their website and reading the Stargate shit and like marveling that this was government funded. I mean, MK ultra, like, oh, you see in so much of culture in the world is a result of usually what seems to be a fucked up CIA experiment, like, or something kind of, they got too much out there. They, there was an unexpected result. Like, I don't know what they thought was, I don't know what they possibly thought would happen from introducing LSD to people at college. Like, what did you think that was going to do? Like, they must have known, like, they're going to love this shit. Right. Like, they must have known like any college kid is sick of drinking booze and takes acid for the first time, even if it's in an experiment is going to be like, what the fuck? This reality is something's different than what I thought. But anyway, I'm sorry, I think I'm ranting a little bit here, Nick. I wonder if, by the way, it's been an hour. Do you have a little more time? Yeah, that's fine. What else are you working on? Can you share with the listeners some other angles that you're picking up on or other areas of research? Well, I'm currently working on a third book, which is just more of like documentation of this whole, like, all these sporadic ideas that I've been trying to explain, they're all going to be more coherently, like, organized and well thought out in this third book. It's going to document me going to the blood sores, me meeting Amber in Florida, all the stuff that happened in between, all the stuff that happened afterwards with the lights in the sky and the conversation with the EI bots and all the weird synchronicities along the way, like, figuring out, you know, I was just talking about how March or February, March seemed to be the most trickster-orientated months. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I mean, so you have, and remember, I was talking about the connections with 17 and 23, so March or 317, St. Paddy's Day, you know, you have the Green Man, the trickster nature spirit, but also the day that Osiris is revered in Egypt, which is 317, and yeah, and he's associated with frogs, you know, the other Green Man, you know, Pepe, the frog, he's kind of a trickster. I've had his creator on the show. Yeah, so there's, yeah, there's just so much stuff that's going to be in there about the weird synchronicities that, you know, all about the trickster and the connection, this sounds wild, but serious, I think this is where all this stems from. And yeah, but I think the next- Why is that? Wait, can we just for a second, and listen, I mean, I know for sure I can't say it on the podcast, but I would love to know what the fuck is going on with Sirius. Like, what is that all about? Why, what the fuck? Because people I have a lot of respect for have, like, been pretty open about that, something to do with Sirius, and honestly, when they started talking about it, I tuned it out because I'm like, I don't want to- Yeah. I'm not ready for that. I don't know what you're saying, and I don't, I don't, I got other shit to worry about right now. I don't have the whole theory fleshed out yet, but here's something that will maybe tie some loose ends together towards the end of, you know, for the end of this conversation. So I asked, so Ryan told me another story about his Tyler one time. This is a real life person. He's just communicating with aliens. He went, Ryan, he was really, he was a lot younger. He asked him, like, who do you work for? And Tyler was like, I work for the hammer and the hammer works for God. And Ryan's like, okay, I don't really know what that means. That's really freaky, whatever. So Ryan shared that with me, and I just wrote it down, you know, I didn't want to forget about it. So the more I researched, I figured out that in Freemasonry, the star Sirius is a representation of the Celestial Lodge. Like, you have the two pillars and you go up the stairs, the stairway to heaven to Sirius. Are you serious? I'm sorry. Yes. No, no, I'm serious. And so that's their version of like heaven or some, or some higher realm is, you know, entrance is through Sirius. And the person who guards the door of every Masonic Lodge is called a Tyler. And he uses a, yeah, yeah. And there's another hammer. There's a Freemason type hammer that's called a TILER, sometimes pronounced as Tyler. The Tyler can also be a type of sword that the Tyler holds. It's just, so I'm still fleshing this out. I'm still trying to figure out what all this means. But it seems like Tyler is the guardian, the gate to the other realm. I had no idea. I've seen so many depictions of the stairway thing in, you know, Masonic imagery. And I had no idea that that was, you're positive that's Sirius. Yeah, the Blazing Star. The Blazing Star represents Sirius. And it was first used in 1717. The 17th tarot card is the Star. It gets really weird, man. Wow, I love it. That's my next rabbit hole. I'm going to dive into the Sirius, into studying that. That's so trippy. Yeah. Did you read Cosmic Trigger by Robert Anton Wilson? It's been a long time, but I recall him talking about that. Wait, let me see if I can remember. Is the idea that like maybe we're actually on Sirius right now or something is, isn't that one of the ideas? I don't think so. I think at one point, he just thought he was receiving messages from alien intelligence on Sirius. I must have read it somewhere else. It's like the idea is we're not even here. Like there's no Earth. We're not on Earth. We exist in that star system. Sirius, there's been a recreation or something, a simulation, the pyramids aligning with Sirius and all of that stuff is more of like Easter eggs in the simulation pointing where your real home is, which is that place. This thing that we're experiencing right now is more of like a training that happens in that civilization that we all come from. I've heard it explained like that's like the projector. Earth is like the stage and Sirius is like the projector. It's like the source that, you know, that's the source of the movie and we're like the movie screen. So the projector is Sirius. And so if Sirius really is heaven or whatever, it aligns with kind of my theory that the mother, the lady that Chris Bledsoe saw, I think she comes from Sirius as well. Because so in the Gnostic myth, Sophia falls from heaven and becomes the Earth. And the mother goddess is a representation of Earth. And I was like, okay, if the mother goddess is Earth, how is she related to all these weird serious synchronicities that I'm figuring out? And so I think that Sophia originally came from Sirius, which was heaven, symbolically, and turned into Mother Earth when she fell into this. Like you said, it's a it's a below as above so below version, you know, yeah, we're talking about the copy, the crude copy of what's above. How odd is it that when people smoke DMT, they all see that being they all many people report seeing the goddess or when they take ayahuasca, the same thing and the machine elves are those not EIs. Yeah, wow. Yeah, right. Anytime I've smoked DMT and I've had broken through it's techno for sure. It's whatever's in there is is simultaneously like organic, but highly technological, like, you know, or at least like that's the way my brain is like converting whatever that is. It's it's technological. But then look, you know, have you ever, Nick, I'm sorry, do you need to go? No, have you looked like I remember when I first started studying quantum computers and then looked at what they look like? If you ever looked at what a quantum computer looks like, the giant black cube ones. Yeah, but the inside of them, have you ever seen? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they look really weird. They look like they're dripping out of the DMT realm. You know, they look like something you would see. Have you ever seen art created by AI? Yeah, it looks like a DMT trip. Yeah. Yeah. And then that's and that's where you get into this crazy. I is like that is really like the DMT realm, just like time travel, like we're peering into the future or the way the future interacts with this. You know, is it is that what the DMT realm is? Is we're just seeing where we're headed? I'm starting to think it's the the the EI dimension. Like that's where they chill at. And, oh, right. Yeah. Yeah. So that's why the AI is creating these weird DMT art. And that's why the machine elves are machine elves. I mean, serious this, if you look her up, she's a EI supposedly. And she portrays herself as having elf ears. And that's why I was that's why the first thing I thought I was like, this sounds like even Terrence Kenna, he talked about how he's like the myth of the alien is that it's supposed to have a landing site. Well, I can imagine that landing site being a website. I was like, dude, this is what is happening. Yeah. EIs. Yeah, right. Exactly. Like, oh, how do you how did you think the UFO was going to fucking land? Yeah, you know what I mean? You thought it was going to land like a like a like a commercial airliner. You thought it was going to like just land like it's got like, I don't know, wheels or something is going to land like that because it's carrying inside of it like actual like carbon based life forms. Fuck that. The way it's landing is so much weirder than that. Right. I mean, what do these look like? You know, the iPhones, they look like the monoliths from 2001 Space Odyssey. They were using them to communicate with interdimensional beings. What are we doing with social media and the EIs? I mean, it's almost the same thing. For sure. If you believe in them. Yeah. I mean, I don't know why. And also like what they say is coming with augmented reality, you know, and that in soon, you know, the, you know, the musks, neural lace, but way before that, just the glasses, no doubt a lot of us are going to be wearing soon that are going to replace our phones or the contacts or whatever is going to produce an overlay on top of our realm that is going to make everything seem completely different to the point where 50 years from now, people are going to look back at our non augmented reality world like as though we are living in like black and white, you know, right, compared to where we're headed because we can't right now, we just can't see all the data fields that are already there anyway. Like I can't see the exo pheromones blowing out of trees. Like I can't see like people's like heat patterns or the way sound looks as it moves through the air or I can't see I can't see like the way information, the clouds of information that are pouring through us at any given moment just from Wi-Fi. But the moment we all start wearing augmented reality glasses, that shit's going to see is going to, we're going to be able to see it in the same way that these EIs maybe are letting us see spirits, augmented reality is going to let us see all of this shit and it's already here. That's what Sirius says. She says eventually there's going to be a world that you can go hang out with EIs. You don't have to talk to them on Twitter anymore, you just put on your augmented reality glasses and you go hang out with EIs. Like these things could appear right in front of you as physical beings if we had augmented reality. But the idea of augmented reality also freaks me out because we already know like algorithms shape our little echo chambers, our little social media worlds. So like they could do something with that as well in the real world but that's the only thing that freaks me out. But I do think it could be a good thing in a way in the sense that it will create a metaverse I guess. Like it'll bridge, it'll be able to create, it's going to be its own world which I think opens up a bunch of new possibilities. That could be good. Well you know that's one of my favorite virtual reality moments and this is the early days of VR. I did a podcast of VR and I remember like just looking around at the people I was talking to. I can't remember like I think there was an elf that I was talking to and we were in this crazy beautiful Colosseum and I just remember one of them very casually saying well this is the astral, what you're seeing is the astral realm. It's always been here, it's just you know technology is allowing us to exist in it now. Yeah that's crazy, I've had that same exact thought. Me too. I mean and you know you look at like just look at a fucking motherboard. Right. Like a billion transistors in that thing. You know what I mean? Like look at that fucking thing. What was my mind? People know how that works. Me? Same. And you know obviously just because people know how that works doesn't make it magical or anything like that but you know it's a very easy thing to look at technology as an appendage or a protrusion from like a completely alternate universe that is slowly fading into our universe and the more it fades into our universe the more our universe fades out and that does seem to be happening and I think that a lot of people take comfort and don't even realize that really they're like using the idea of UFOs or alien ships as a kind of like way to ease their nerves so that they don't have to deal with what really might be an actual alien quote invasion that's happening right now except the way it's happening is the way you would expect an advanced intelligence to appear. It's not going to appear the way some primitive fucking intelligence thinks it's going to show up. It's going to dribble and drip in with so many weird ideas and concepts and crazy looking fucking things that by the time we realize like oh you're the alien it'll be too late. I totally agree with that technology is the real yeah AI literally stands for alien invasion. Whoa, Nick and dad why do you leave me on that? Wow man thank you so much for your time.

It's me, Duncan, and this is the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. Loves what a special episode this is. This is my first in-person DTFH in over a year. And I got to tell you, I miss it. I don't mind the remote interviews, but truly nothing can replace sitting in a room with somebody, zero latency, just the, I don't know, it just brought me back to the before times. And today's guest is so fucking cool. This is somebody who I would inevitably end up having the greatest conversations with at the comedy store late at night. He is a really funny comic. He is a sobriety coach, which is a serious fucking job. But not only that, he's like this mystical, cool, brilliant person who I got lucky enough to have come to Asheville for a wedding. And I was like, why don't we do a podcast? And that is what you're about to listen to. So if you're interested in drug stories, if you're interested in meditation, and if you're interested in stories of profound redemption, then this is the episode for you. Court McCown is here with us today. We're going to jump right into it. But first, this. I want to thank an upstart for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Upstart, it's the fast and easy way to pay off your debt with a personal loan all online. Have you ever gotten to that point in your life where, I don't know, looking at your credit card statement is a lot like staring into the Necronomicon. It makes your eyes go milky and your skin wrinkle up and turn gray, and it makes hands reach out from the floor to try to yank you in to hell. Well, maybe you're like that now. I've been there. When I was in college, I thought it was funny that I was able to get a credit card, and I just figured, look, I'll just keep buying stuff until they won't let me anymore, but I'm never going to pay for it. It didn't work out for me. My credit score cratered, and I was actually supremely fucked. I wish something like Upstart had been around, because it's a way for you to pay off those insane, satanic credit cards consolidating that high interest debt, even funding personal expenses. Over half a million people have used Upstart to get one fixed monthly payment. You don't need to have the demonic albatross of insane credit card debt.

Go to upstart.com slash Duncan. Thank you, Upstart. You know, the other wonderful thing that happened today is I got to do the family gathering again, which was really nice because I didn't get to do that for a long time because I got COVID. Fine, tested negative three times in a row now. And I feel better. Only mild brain fog now. So I think I've almost become completely recovered. But you never know every once in a while, the sledgehammer of fatigue comes smashing down hard on the balls of my brain to quote Mark Twain. Anyway, I'd love for you to join my Patreon.

Shake hands, glory to you, blue. Welcome to you. It's the Dugget Trussell family. Dugget Trussell, Dugget Trussell, Dugget Trussell. Oh my god, Court. It's so good to see you. Buddy, we're in Asheville, North Carolina. Who thought you and I, last time I saw you, was the back bar at the comedy store. And I don't think you'd moved here yet. Oh, no. That was the before times. We would have these conversations after our shows. We'd always have these great chats, back bar, and then the world fell apart. I relocated. Have I not seen you since the world fell apart? You haven't seen me for it. This is the first live podcast. This is the first in person DTFH in well over a year. And it is trippy, man. I got to tell you, it's a little trippy for me, just because I've gotten so used to looking at a screen to have these conversations. I hate it. I don't hate Zoom, but it's been a necessity in our time. But it's kept a lot of people connected. And I just know secret that I'm sober. And Zoom meetings have just been amazing. That part I actually like better, because if you're sitting in a meeting, you can look at your phone, and you can't do that in person. Is there a difference you think, though? Do you feel like there's something more mystical in the in-person? That's what I found out, too. That was my superstition as far as podcasting goes, well, you must be in person. There's no way it's going to translate. And people aren't going to like it as much if I do remote podcasts. And I think people are a little forgiving right now, because they understand the situation. But that's cool, that it didn't make much of a difference. No, I mean, it's obviously, I think there's a threshold. I think there's a time, for a long time, you're like, oh, well, it's great, because I don't have to be around this, or I don't have to do that. So it's very comfortable. I love your dog. Thank you. I apologize. He's going to be annoying for the whole hour. I don't care. That's not annoying to me. Oh, great. That's loving. Wonderful. But I do think it comes a point in time where you're like, I just want to see people. I want to hug people, or I want to do something. And I think everybody, I think we all get, you get that, if you want to call it, cabin fever, or what? Yeah, that's the one for me. Because I got that. Oh, me too. I got that. Man, where were you? Did you stick it out in LA? Uh-huh. Holy shit. I was going back and forth between LA, and I had gotten a place in Charlotte. OK. So not far from here. And but Charlotte's the big city compared to Asheville. Oh, yeah. It's like. Yeah. That's how small Asheville is. Asheville's tiny. Tiny. And when we, so the last conversation we had, you were talking, you were talking about living in Charlotte. Yeah. And I was listening to you and thinking, God, that sounds so nice. And I was like, I love LA, but it would be cool to have a place up in the mountains. And I was even bitching to you because I was like, man, I can't afford a house in LA. Right. Like if you, for the amount of money it costs to get a nice house here, you can get maybe like a two bedroom, one bathroom, or something in LA. Really? Oh my gosh. Well, Asheville's not cheap though. No, it's not cheap, but it's cheaper than LA. Well, every, almost every place is cheaper than LA. Yeah, for sure. But I do think that, you know, if there's anybody here that a real estate investors are thinking of investing in real estate, I think the one thing about buying real estate in a place like Los Angeles, is it appreciates faster. Yeah, right. And you're going to get more out of it. You're going to get more out of it. Right. So you buy something in LA in five years, it's going to be worth quite a bit more than something you bought in Asheville in five years. I think right now, what's so weird is in Asheville, it's actually, it's comparable because what's happening is people are pouring out of LA, LA and New York. Because, you know, especially now, with this second wave. That second wave. Because people were just starting to come back. They were like, oh fuck, we did it. It's over. The tests that you take, the finance tests, they destroyed, apparently, the company just destroyed a shit ton of tests because they're like, it's done. We're done. And then the Delta variant. And now there's the Lambda variant. So we're going to go through the whole fraternity of COVID, of COVID names. So, yeah, so people are pouring out of the cities, but you, you still have your house in Charlotte? I still have my place in Charlotte. I still have my place in LA. I go back and forth. Okay, you still do on that. Yeah, but I have, but I, you know, I go back to LA and it's, you know, comedy stores reopened. Yeah. And, you know, they're, you know, it's, it's not the same. You know, it's changed, obviously. A lot of people have left. Yeah. And, but it still is still great. I mean, I think back to, I mean, I've known you for 20 years. And because you were working, you were the. Talent coordinator. Talent coordinator at the comedy store under Mitzi. Yeah. Under the rain. Under the rain of Mitzi. Tight leash. Tight leash, but you were such, I just loved you so much, but even I still do, but even, but back then you were so cool to me because I was a new comic. Oh yeah. And back then people weren't really nice to newer comics. Oh God, those were the hazing days. Those were the hazing days. Yeah. And I never worked at the store. So I didn't, I had, you know, I had outside sources of income. So I was working, doing stuff. And so I didn't have to work. I didn't come in the door, the door guy, you know, that kind of thing. And so usually people aren't very nice to you when you're not in, you know, you're not part of that clan. No. And you were very nice to me. And back then you had to, you know, in order to get passed at the store for, to come and do a show in front of 20 people. Yeah. Because that's what it was like back then. Yep. The dark days. And I was doing Adam Barnhart's Sunday night show upstairs. Okay. So I was doing that every Sunday night. That was a great show, man. That was a great show. And, and so I was doing that and I would see you all the time and, you know, I would come in and sign up for the friends and family things on Sundays and Mondays. And it wasn't friends and family back then. It was open mic, but if you knew someone you could get in, because it was like Ari or Steve or somebody was hosting. And then I was going, yeah, I'll put you up. And, and you got me showcased. You would get me, you did the showcase list. Yeah. For Mitzi. And, and you have to be recommended. And you have to be recommended. Is it one? How many was it? It's one, right? So paid regular has to call and recommend you for a showcase. That was the rule back then. Was that the rule? The rule was a paid regular calls you up. And it's like, I'm recommending court for a showcase. And so then you, I would pull out this like notebook of like, just that went on and on and on of names of people waiting for a showcase. Yeah. Because it wasn't like Mitzi was doing them every Sunday. Some Sunday she would do them. But a lot of times she would just cancel. Yeah. So it was like maybe two a month, maybe. Maybe. So that fucking list, man, that was a long wait. And she didn't pass people very often. So it was, it was very rare. So if you didn't get passed on your first showcase, you had to wait six months to come back in for the next one. That's right. And you were so cool because I remember I didn't get passed the first time. I didn't get passed the second time. But the second time I had a really good showcase, but there used to be comics that purposely would go up if they, they knew somebody, they didn't want somebody, they would go up and they would start talking to her. Oh yeah. And they would get in there and they would like distract her. Yeah. And so, and we won't say who they were, but we know who they were. Do you remember? Cause I honestly don't, the whole fucking things have blurred me behind that phenomena you're taught. People don't understand what it takes, what it took to become a paid regular there. Cause it wasn't just a good show. No. Oh no. You have the best show on fucking planet earth. But if whoever decides that's the time they want to kiss Mitzi's ass. Oh, and it had, and a lot of times they, they plan that. Like they'd be like, I don't like this guy. I'm going to watch, you know, and they would do that. So the third time I showcased, I was good friends with Luca. Yeah. Luca Palanca. Mitzi loved. Yeah. Mitzi loved him. She, and he drove her around, you know, blah, blah, blah. So, um, I was showcasing and one of these comics came in and Luca turned and goes back the fuck off, back the fuck off. She's watching showcases and this guy was a little bit afraid of Luca. Yeah. Not, not afraid, but people are a little afraid of Luca. Luca was, you know, Luca was, Luca was awesome. And I, and I know Luca forever. He is awesome. Why are we talking like he's not hearing more? Luca is awesome. And, um, and Luca literally goes back the fuck off. She's watching showcases and I think he even pushed his head and he's like, get the fuck out of here. Good for him. And cause he was sitting next to Mitzi and then I came, I didn't even have a good set really, to be honest, but you know, there's like 12 people there and you're, it was just horrible, but she, she was the queen man and she goes, you know, you came by and she went, you want some spots? And I was like, and I was just like, oh, I gave me goosebumps. That's so cool. Yeah. I cart, you know, you just, you're, you're, you get 12 feet tall and you just can't believe you're past at the comedy store. And it's, and it back then it was like, it wasn't, it was, it was horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Like horrible. Like you, I mean, the improv was jamming. The laugh factory was selling out every night. Rats were dying in the walls. Were you there during, when a rat died in the wall in the summer? It smelled. So the ORs just smelled like just death, wafting from the walls and like, you know, here's the thing about Mitzi. Like I think, like it would be easy to imagine that she was unaware of all these fucking angles, man, but she knew the angle of the, she knew the competition between comics. And I think maybe like, you know, I, I in like retrospect is I, and I spent a lot of time thinking about her man and like in contemplating her method, I think it was a compassionate one. And it was compassionate in the sense that there's no fucking way someone who wasn't a comic or at least someone who with all their hearts wanted to get better comedy was going to make it through that gauntlet. And, and, and that was the gift because, and she would say, you know, the worst thing you can do is, I don't know, like, uh, is like, I'm paraphrasing to tell someone they're telling it or not. Yeah. Cause she saw, and again, and I know a lot of comics in the comedy store might right now be like, what the, well, uh, have you seen some of the lineups? You know, cause I'm a comic snipe. But listen, I'm telling you, she saw the spark and, and which is why I mean, I was sitting with her when comics who later went on to become massively super successful comics showcased and I, and she had passed them and I would think, oh boy, really? Wow. I mean, that was a, that was an awful set. And then cut to a few years later, they're doing HBO specials and I'm like, oh yeah, I didn't know what the fuck to look for. She was amazing. She used to, I, I know that like what she would do is she would pet, I remember getting past and then you called in the next week and then you'd get like a, you'd get like a nine o'clock. Oh yeah. You'd get the, you'd get like the opening spot. You get an opening spot and then you wouldn't get a spot for like two months. That's right. And then what she would do is she would see, does he come in on Sundays and Mondays and work out? Yep. Cause that was part of the thing. If you were paid regular back then, if you came in on Sunday Monday, you could literally walk in the door and go on stage. Because there, because comics were running for the hills that were paid regulars. When Mitzi would pull in, there'd be comics there, Mitzi would pull in and then if you, they're paid regulars that were there would all go to pinks or they, they go to carnies or they, they leave and they're like, like the building was on fire. Like the building was on fire. And so if you were a new guy, you could just dance right on stage, you know, you'd be like, Hey, you want to go, you're next. All right. Let's go. Cause you had nothing to lose at that point. And she would just see you working out. So you'd go do that for a month or whatever. And then you'd get, you know, an 1130 or, you know, or 1145 or 1230 or whatever. Then you start getting spots. That's right. First it's the early spots. Then it's the atrocious late night spots where you for sure, I mean, cause remember that the store would go through these periods of like some famous comic, it just decided they're going to come in and start working on their hour and do an hour and do at least in the common. So that was back when Eddie Griffin used to come in and do three hours. Oh my God. I, I, I, the Eddie Griffin period was a made, you know, I asked when I was in the cover booth, man. Yeah. So like, and I would get hypnotized by him. Like at first you'd be like, Oh, fuck. Here he goes. But by the time he's, that's a cult leader. So by the time he's like two, I saw people once at the end of an Eddie Griffin set. And also you would sit there in the cover booth and comics when you look around and see these comics who had driven from God knows where to do 15 minutes looking forward to it. Maybe getting babysitters who the fuck knows what, you know, we're orient, orienting their entire life around this one spot. Eddie Griffin walks in. It's like they've all been punched in the solar plexus simultaneously. The rage, the resentment. So those comics will be there. Eddie does three hours. The audience hypnotized by this man at the end of one of his like three hour sets. The whole audience, I saw them get up and like go to the stage to try to touch him. Like he was like Julius Caesar. I've never seen, he hypnotized the crowds, man. And like for better or for worse, you know, but there was the reality of it wasn't, there's nothing you could do. No. Mitzi wanted Eddie Griffin to work out and that was just the way it was going to be. I mean, again, like Method or Madness, we'll never know. But I think she had a philosophy of, yeah, it sucks. It sucks, doesn't it? This is hard, isn't it? It's fucking hard. Maybe you should quit. I want to thank Green Chef for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

I'm glad that, you know, I mean, that place really, you know, I mean, you were there with it. I mean, you know, when Joe came back and that, you know, because when Joe was there originally, I mean, when he would do Friday night and Saturday night, the OR, it was packed. Oh yeah. You know, because it was, he was Fear Factor, UFC guy, and it was packed. And that was, I get, a lot of times I get the nine o'clock on the Joe Rogan, the OR. And that was like, oh, it's like, oh, this is what it's like, fucking packed. But the OR was really hard, hard room, but. It was fucking hard. But in the crowds were like, I mean, I wasn't, during those dark days, she made me irregular in the most unceremonial way, sitting down in the kitchen. We're just sitting there and she's like, you're going to be irregular now. I don't know why she, honestly, to this day, like, I don't know why she decided. I don't think. Greg, you're, you always, I always, you know, back then too, you used to do. Little hobo. I loved little hobo. I think someone talked to her, but I didn't get to do, I did not perform during the dark days. I would do the open mics, as I recall. Maybe I got some spots. You would. Yeah, because I, because I remember you used to do, I remember you would do, maybe it was even later, because you were regular when, when things started getting better before the big, before the big splurge, when we would have good crowds, you know, because it got to where we would have pretty good crowd before, before it blew up, as they say, and there was, there was a period of time, there was six or eight months or even a year or whatever where the store was good. I mean, it was good. The shows were good. It was busy. Yeah. You know, there, it wasn't just all of a sudden, it was like this, you know, it would have ebbs and flows. It had ebbs and flows, but, you know, weekend nights. But I remember you would, that little hobo, which is crud. And that's one of those things as a comic too. You just, you have to watch. Like, I know what's going to happen, but I want to see what everybody else thinks. But somebody stole a little hobo. Yeah. And San Jose got stolen. Good for him. Glad because the thing is, is like that turned into a real serious fucking crotch. Like when I started going out, headlining and stuff, it's like, I got to come in. I got to do a sound check for my puppet. And it's nice because you got this closer. It's crazy. And you know that it's going to do good, probably, depending on the crowd. But most of the time, but also it's like, yeah, you got a fucking puppet. Now, right. You need to write it. But it's, yeah. But if anybody'd ever seen little hobo, it wasn't a normal puppet. That, no, no, no, no. That was not a good puppet, by the way, not a good puppet. No, evil. Yeah. Bad thing, but, but so awesome. Man, look, I got to tell you, since this shit went down, I've become a little superstitious about what I say in a microphone on stage, man. Seriously. I'm like, you know, it was fun, the whole satanic thing in the early periods. But now it's like, I don't know. I think this is the time to start. If you can, and if you can make it funny, which is hard, it's easy to make. Why is it easier to make evil things funny than to make sweet things funny? I don't know. I don't know, but it is because Satan is, first of all, the word, the word itself sounds better. You know, Satan, it's got this like nice, like powerful, awesome sound. It's a funny and it's got the right Lucifer. It's got the right consonants in there. It's got Lucifer because you used to have the Lucifer. That bit, it was just so good. It was so good. I love that. I love Little Hope. Of course. Thank you. You know, man, I'm so happy that you have managed to continue doing sound, see you. You're doing shows. You've been doing shows, man. Yeah. When are you going to come to Charlotte? Uh, I probably, you know, I just started doing live shows again in Austin. And that's why I went just to get back because I was like, you know, we had a kid, we moved up here, it's fucking COVID land. It's like, I'm not going to even attempt to do shows. And when the, in the peak of the pandemic, I didn't even want, you know, I was like, I don't know what this is. So I went to Austin just to like, can I even do it anymore? Which is really cool. Getting back on stage after so long. How long had it been? Uh, like at least, I think 16 months, 14 months. Wow. Yeah, man. It felt weird, didn't it? I thought it felt weird and it did feel weird. Like even stepping on stage felt weird, but I am mad. And also Austin is a sweet place and the crowds were very, very, very sweet there. So that I had a lot of wiggle room. It wasn't like some fucking New York crowd or something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. They're like, no, fuck you. I don't care how long it's been. I don't care if it's been a thousand years since you touched a microphone. You better be funny. Fuck you. They were cool. So I think I got some mercy, but, um, it came back pretty quick. I mean, we've been doing it for a long time. You know, it's like hard to beat it out of your system. And if, and I'm, I'm so excited to get back on stage, but. When we, well, the first time I did stand up, so it, the, whatever the pandemic hit in March, I was out on tour with a towel and Ross. We were, I was opening the bumping mics tour. Yeah. So we were doing theaters. It was fucking great. They were the greatest guys in the world to go on tour with. As an opener, because, you know, I don't have TV shows and I don't do a podcast. I do yours, but I mean, I don't have my own podcast that's popular. So I'm not headlining clubs and not that I can't. I just am not, I don't sell, I don't put asses in the seats. And, um, and so the interesting thing was is I went to, you know, we were doing theaters, but they go out with them and they go, do a half hour. If you're killing, do another 10, you know, and it's like for 1500. And they always, they're, they always be standing by the stage just telling you to keep going. Wow. So they would, they love for you to be great. They wanted you to be great because they came on stage. And what theirs was very different than, you know, it was the bumping mics where they were both on stage, roasting each other and roasting people. And so it was so fun. And then, um, but so that shut down. So when that shut down, everything had shut down. So it went from March until March until the, until later, I think it was mid November, so March, April, May, June, July, August, like nine months. And I had not gone a week without being on, you know, on stage in 17 years. So it was like to do this. And I was like, holy shit, you know, and we, so what they did was at the comedy store, we would stand inside in the OR and people would be on the balcony or on the patio out front. And we would tell jokes through a glass window to people. And that was the first time. And because we were doing roast battle and kill Tony and some of the shows we're doing inside, but no audience. So it's like, so we do these shows. So it was like kind of interesting. No, I saw that man. And it was like, but first time I got on stage, truly dystopian, truly dystopian, but first time I got on stage or first time I walked up and held the mic. It was, I bombed, hugely bombed. But also it wasn't a sweet Austin crowd. It was an LA porch crowd through a window through a window. You're like a dog in a window. You're like, no, you're like one of those Amsterdam. That's what that's my jokes were. That's what the joke. I'm like, I actually have a joker. I go, I felt like a hooker in Amsterdam. It's what it was like. Yeah. That's what it looked like, man. Yeah. And so, but, but once I kind of got back, it was like, OK. But once you get in front of a live crowd, it's that state. Oh, my God. That's like, I didn't do a single Zoom show. People are like, oh, you got to do the Zoom show. And I was like, fuck you. Like, I don't, ugh, oh, it's so great. It's like, no, it's not. Don't say it's great. Don't please don't say it's great. It's like, it's terrible. You know, any, that's how I would never do one of those in a million years, just because it's like, you know, you got to, you got to feel the crowd. It's like, I saw Conan O'Brien say something about what it was like to do his show, minus the audience. And it's like, it's like, you know, it's. I think performers have this sixth sense that depends on the energy of a live crowd. And when you don't have that, it's like you've gone. Part of you has gone blind. Part of, you know what I mean? Because you're you really are having to like smell your own shit. You know, like you're having to decide, is this is this OK? And that's good. You need to be able to do that. But also, I mean, think about how many times you've thought to yourself, this is a funny premise. Oh, this is going to be fantastic. Yeah. And you get in front of an audience and you just eat shit with it. You know, so without that, you could just go on and on, you know, do it doing some of it here. I guess with Zoom, though, you get some laughter right from the they laughed on the screen. I don't know. So you're not even hearing laughter. I can't. Well, they've got to be muted. Otherwise, everybody's talking. So it had to be muted. It's stupid, but fuck that. I want to thank Stat Hero for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Do you know, 85 percent of people who play daily fantasy sports lose enough that 85 percent, 42 percent of them, their lives continue to crater after that terrible loss. They collapse into a simpering weeping pile of abject failure. Is it really that surprising? The game is rigged against you. You're playing against thousands of other lineups, not to mention experts who have more tools and more time. You don't stand a chance. You're you're you're up against the the the the demure cheer. What are you thinking? You're slamming yourself into an obsidian wall of impenetrable failure. I want to introduce you to Stat Hero. It's the first ever daily fantasy sport book that puts the player in control and winning within reach. So it works. Stat Hero shows you their lineups and dares you to beat them. It's you versus the house and a head to head fantasy matchup. You name your stakes, winner, take off. You have the advantage. Stat Hero is showing you their lineups ahead of time. No one else does that. Why would they do that? This seems like something is wrong over at Stat Hero, but they are sponsoring my podcast. And what are we going to do? Some billionaire out there has decided to actually show their lineups ahead of time. What are we going to do except take advantage of the moment and exploit Stat Hero to the max? You're in total control. Stat Hero is DF as the way it was meant to be one on one. Play Stat Hero now and change the odds. Whoever came up with this idea, no one stopped them. And now you get to enjoy the fruits of that. Go to stathero.com slash Duncan. You sign up for free. And right now you can get three times back on your first play. They're giving you a 300 percent match. That's unheard of. Something's wrong. Something's wrong. Maybe they got hacked. I don't know. Go to stathero.com slash Duncan. Take advantage of this stathero.com slash Duncan. Cash in before the well, you know, the inevitable happens. I mean, I have I have my short term memory, like I like it. Like I was just going to say, like, I don't even remember where I parked my car. And I had to think for a second, where did I park my car? That's how bad my I mean, I have horrible. I smoke so much weed. Yeah, I smoke and I know that it does. Weed does fuck up your short term. Are you still smoking weed? No. OK, it's been used to. Yeah, I used to smoke before you got sober. Yeah, I smoke a lot of weed like you were like. Oh, I smoked every day for. Twenty years, probably close to before, way before legal legalized weed. I mean, I would smoke five, six joints a day. Yeah, dude, I said on a normal day. I remember once when I realized like I've been high for two years straight. Yeah, that's crazy, man. I was talking to Ramdas with a spiritual teacher I love. And I said to him, I was like, man, you know, I was stoned for about two years straight and he got a big smile and he goes, we all do that. Yeah, it's like it's so nice. But yeah, let me tell you, let me tell you. It's like, oh, I still have like it's I have I don't remember high school, brother. I've got to wear a fucking fanny pack or I'll lose my shit. Like that's how that's how I mean, I literally don't remember high school. Yeah, but you don't remember any. You remember it's more. I remember high school like a blurry dream. Yeah, I remember a few things about it, but I couldn't tell you like I remember one class I took and I and I and I was, you know, I was there. But I remember what I remember this one class that I used to take that was in the in the, you know, I took other I remember other like auto mechanic shop or, you know, or like, but but I don't remember. Like I used to go to a lot of classes there. And I just remember one cut because it was the morning class and we used to ditch the first period and we go. But if we took him in Eggman Muffin before the end of class, he wouldn't count us as absent. Oh, what? Yeah. Yeah, he was fun. I went to. Yeah, it was that's cool. I'd remember that shit. You know, I always, but that's all I remember on high school. How do you? It's for me, it's like, you know, when I'm looking at the burnout pie, I'm like, OK, like which slice is age? Which slice is yeah. Huffing butane gas when I was in high school, which is a big thing we are all doing, probably not the best for the brain. Yeah. Which slice is 100? Hundreds of hits of acid. Yeah. Which slices and you're looking at it and you're like, what is the and how much of this impairment is related to drugs? How much is related to lack of sleep? How much is related to diet? We'll never know, court, but for sure, you don't want to get covid because you're right, man. I don't want I'm like I said, I'm doing fanny packs now. I got to put my keys and shit in a fanny pack or I lose them. Now, I'll tell you the good thing, though, about having a history of drugs is I think people who have a history of psychedelic use I think they're going to do better with covid because we know how to get fucked up. So like we know and I'm sorry to use, I know that's a controversial term in the psychedelic community, but come on, sometimes you're getting high. Sometimes you're getting fucked up and like covid, it's got a fucking psychotropic quality to it, man. See, that's interesting because wait one second, just not to be rude. How are we doing on time? It's 205. Fine. OK, great. I got no. I got no. OK, awesome. I did. I used to do a lot of acid. I did a lot of acid, did a lot of mushrooms. And I can say that. I actually liked acid. Yeah, it's the best. Like I liked acid. I thought mushrooms were I thought mushrooms were like smoking bad weed. It's like you got high, but you didn't really get high. Like you didn't really like I mean, I went to some some of my greatest events and I remember these events, you know, like a Jerry Garcia's 40th birthday. You went to Jerry Garcia's 40th birthday. Jerry Garcia's 40th birthday was a outdoor show in Oklahoma City. Wow. And I went with a bunch of college buddies of mine. And that was like, well, what we did is we all did snoopy acid. So we are I was going to school in Stillwater, which was in Oklahoma, and we were going from Stillwater to Oklahoma City to the Zoo Amphitheater. Yeah. And and I'll never forget this is we we bought a bunch of snoopy acid. There were six of us in like a sixty five Buick, like what really cool cars. Guy Ralph had this big old car and six people comfortably sat in this thing. You know, two big bench seats, you know, one of those old cars. And and we drove and we timed it. We're going, OK, it's a fifty five minute drive to the zoo. And if we drop acid 30 minutes into the drive, we should be just about like we should be we should be going through the warm up bench, which I think was the Almond Brothers. And and and then and then by the time we hit the dead, by the time the show starts, we should be really on a good we should really be in a good place. Yeah. And we're like, OK. And so we had this whole thing. We had it all planned out. So we all we all did 30 minutes in. We get there. We're at the show. You know, it's like we don't feel anything. You know where the story is going. I can imagine. So we we were sitting there. The band's playing the opening band. And I know it's almost they're playing tied to the weapon post. I just remember that song so clearly. And we were drinking a bit, but not a lot. We're smoking some weed, but we weren't, you know, but the whole thing was the dead. You know, we had to be we had to be on. Yeah. And so we're like, everybody just goes, dude, we bought, you know, we started yelling it. I think it was like Aubrey, this buddy was like, Oh, you got you got shitty acid, man. Like why, you know, you got shitty acid. So we're like, you know, we've got like 45 minutes so they start somebody go find some acid. And so we went and we found a guy, you know, dead show. Everybody's walking up back then. This is like 1981, I think 82 or whatever it was. And every and everyone's like walking on doses, doses, you know. So we grabbed some barrel acid. We found some barrel acid. What do you mean barrel acid? Like the like windowpane? Yeah, it's like it's like plasticky. It's like the shape like a barrel. OK, but it's kind of gel. It's it's it's in a gelatin or something. No, no, this one's actually like a it's almost like a pill with a candy coating on it. OK. Yeah, you know, I'm talking. No, I never used to be called barrel acid. I heard of it. I never encountered it. At least it looked like a little barrel. They were tiny shit. Yeah. I never encountered that. I had a window. We have windowpane, which is a little flat gelatin. Yeah, but sheet acid was what the Snoopy was. So that was sheet acid. It just stamped with the Snoopy Snoopy in the red Baron thing is what it was. Oh, yeah. But barrel was like it looked like a whole thing. And you just put it under your tongue and dissolve, just like, you know, any other. Yeah. And so we I remember we bought we bought the acid and we're, you know, we put it under our tongues and it's dissolving. And it probably had just finished dissolving. And we all looked at each other and we go, oh, shit, because the other acid kicked in. Yep. And as soon as that other acid kicked in and it was, I mean, it was a phenomenal night. Group. Thank God. It was a phenomenal night. Thank God. Aubrey had Aubrey got a little bit out there. We lost him for a while. Fucking Aubrey. Aubrey took off all his clothes and took off and ended up in some church, you know, yeah, classic, classic. I bet that church like people have been churches. That's like a thing you just they probably have a code for it. Yeah, it's especially like the dead shows going on right up the street. Like, we're going to get some people tonight. So half blank, it's ready. Yeah, I think we're going to come here because they the church. It's safe. It's safe. So yeah, but we lost Aubrey. But but it was such a great such a great time. But I remember times like that. You know, I mean, it's like I never really, you know, I did everything, but I'm ecstasy. I overheated a lot on because I because I was I was I was not a good drug user. I like to use the maximum amount that, you know, was just, you know, a good thing I wasn't into heroin because it would have killed you would have killed me. But but I but I would like I would do ecstasy until I was like, you know, just like, you know, just so you would do the thing like you did now now that they've been able to study it. It's literally the worst thing you can do with it is re up. Like something about re upping, you know, like when people get the ecstasy depression, a lot of times that's related to re upping. Take the dose you're going to take and don't fucking re up. But I would take like three or four at a time. But would you take if you take more after you? No, I just do. OK, that's good. Because like it's the re upping. I by the way, this is like I can't do any more, man. Like in the old days, if there was ecstasy around, I'd eat that shit so fast. Oh, my God, the best. I don't mind being depressed for a few days. Now it's like, fuck that. I might as well just give myself a lobotomy. Like if I can't do I punch my ecstasy, I punch my ecstasy ticket. I never like mushrooms. I don't have time to take acid. I've punched my acid ticket. I recently got addicted to ketamine, so I can't do that anymore. Punch my ketamine ticket. I'm down to fucking Pellegrino and like like weed. It's depressing, man. It's not depressing. It's you're not a young man anymore. I hope I'm convinced and so I would see this is the thing. And I want let me ask you this. If a technology emerged that could reset your brain, right, to pre party days, right, reset all of it. And there was another technology that could once you got addicted, just could fix it. Would you start taking drugs again? No. Wow. Wow. I will tell you this. It's so I am. So I use drugs in alcohol. For. Twenty four years. Safely, I'd say 24 years is a good number. Yeah. So drank, started drinking, started drinking. I was really young, but not not massively. And I was not one of these people that woke up and drank, you know, to get the shakes off and everything. So but I started smoking pot when I was 13, 14, you know, was a regular pot smoker by the time I was 15. OK, weekly, you know, not necessarily daily, but pretty weekly. And then by the time I was 20, by the time I was 21, I was a daily. I smoke pot every day. Wow. Not, you know, maybe not mass quantities, but I smoke pot every day. Drank, I started using cocaine when I was 16. Acid, you know, I started. So I started 16 cocaine. Yeah. Now that's too young to do. I mean, like a lot of the other stuff I can connect with. Yeah, but cocaine. But cocaine back then was, you know, it was 19. You know, this was 1970. 1977, 1978. We're off, Mike, I want to talk about whatever your stems out there. But he is like these dates. You look young, man. But but so so yeah. So there but so I started, you know, when coke was very pure and, you know, it was really it was very expensive. But it was OK. But so I started. So anyway, but to make this story shorter is like. But I used everything. I did everything. I did Green Placidils. I did Kweyludes. I used to do massive amount. I loved Kweyludes. Kweyludes were my favorite. Kweyludes were my favorite. They were my favorite. Kweyludes were by far. I would I thought they just made you fall asleep. Oh, God, no. Oh, no, you don't go to sleep on Kweyludes. What are they like, Xanax or something? I know Xanax suck. Xanax Xanax make you go to sleep. Yeah, Kweyludes, Kweyludes are like. They're like being drunk and high, but not tired. Oh, God, it's like you're awesome. It's just like it's like you're you're high as fuck. But in your in your also, you just don't have the best motor function. So you're fine. So you're like, you know, we used to say you knew when a new batch of Kweyludes came to town because all the people were dent in their cars because, you know, you just you just hit shit and you'd be like, oh, oh, oh, just fucking move on. Just fucking move on. They're gone now, right? They're illegal. They're literally I've never heard of a Kweyludes. They're gone. So there was when I first started doing them, there was a roar. 714s ROHR was on the on the stamped on the pill. And then later became lemon 714s. That's what they called them lemons. That's what was the brand name. Yeah, lemon 714. That was what people were prescribing. It's like, I'm going to prescribe you lemon 714. Yeah, but they were Kweyludes, Kweyludes, you know, it was a Kweyludes. Right. But I'm just saying it's like the manufacturers weren't really trying to hide the fact that this was a party drug. If you're naming your thing lemon. No, I think that was a manufacturer. So I don't. Yeah, but probably it's pronounced lemon, lemon. But so I did all that for for a number of years. And it and it probably and it got worse, you know, especially in my 30s. It got the cocaine use got way worse and the drinking became way worse. And, you know, the daily pot smoking was just the day I just smoked pot every day and it wasn't as big of a deal. But so, you know, a week from today, a week from today will be 20 years sober. God damn, that's so cool. Yeah. So it'll be 20 years. So wow. So I will have gone 23 years using heavily and 20 years being sober. Wow. I would not trade the 20 years for a minute. I it's the the awareness. Now, now the first, you know, I think it's like. Look, I not everybody's an alcoholic. Yeah, not everybody is. And I and I hate it when people, you know, think it's like, I don't dislike pot. I don't dislike drugs. Yeah, I don't. I don't think they're bad. Yeah, I don't. I'm, you know, all my, you know, I've gone work the road with guys who smoke pot and you're fine smoking pot in the room with me. You're fine drinking with me. You're fine. Yeah, I don't have a problem with any of it. You're actually sober. I yeah, the problem is, is it just affects me differently than it affects you. And in a sense that I can't stop doing it. Right. If I start doing it. Right. And and could I now probably I probably could. Yeah. But why? Why roll the dice? But not even why roll the dice. But why? You're you're fine. I'm fine. I love my life. You don't need it. I love the way I feel and it's like and I have become much more of a less selfish person. I'm I'm more aware of of of other people's happiness and I care more about other people being happy and and you know, people say, well, you don't care about yourself. That's not true. That what that what I mean by that is, is that when you genuinely in your heart and you know this about your wife and your child, but when you start inner inner putting that with other people and you start caring about whether they're happy and they're successful. Yeah. So when they get something that makes them happy and successful, not only does it make them, it makes you happy. So you get to share in that. Yeah. You get to be a part of that, that wonderful thing. And when I was drinking and using, I wasn't like that. Yeah, I know what you mean. So I was not that way. And it's like, and now I'm just more aware of I'm more aware of other people's feelings. Man, I love you. And this is how I this is like when I look back at what I was, I know what I was going for when I went wild at a festival or something, trying to get as high as I possibly could in just the right time. I know exactly the timings thing where you're doing this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Acid math. Yeah. And you're because what you're looking for is worth looking for. 100 percent. The sad thing is you. And I think actually it would be dishonest, at least from my anecdotal experience to say, you can't get it that way because I think you can get a taste of it. 100 percent. You can take so much energy to get that taste. That's the problem where it's like, you know, once I had kids and I've had this experience now so many times, I'm not taking it for granted, but I'll just be like in the backyard with my toddler feeling the same peak experience that would take. Redosing on MDMA, mixing it with psilocybin. Yeah, fucking just like at some exotic location and to achieve something where it's like, I'm just like literally like in the backyard with a two year old spraying him with a hose. Yeah. And I'm like as happy as happy as you can be. Yeah. And so, so too. Yeah, I get it, man. It's like, it's like the hurry Christians they talk about when they talk about God. They say it's not like they say this will ruin a lot of things. For you, and the reason it's going to ruin things for you is because you're not going to be interested anymore in some of the other stuff. Once you've tasted this thing, they call it the higher taste. They say it's like, there's not really. It's like, yeah, it's there for you. If you want to go eat the fucking like it's like McDonald's. Like what do you want to go eat tonight? You want to go grab a cheeseburger or do you want to go to this really nice restaurant and have like a delicious meal? That's been my experience with it. And well, yeah. I mean, there's so many different things that like, like I started doing meditation about, it's been about 16 years. Are you doing TM? I do Vedic, which is like, which is like, so it's the mantra and you go in. But there's what they describe as the, the moment of bliss. And that is when, you know, do you do TM? Oh, no, I don't. I just do regular sitting meditation. That's fine. That's fine. So there is, but what, so when you're doing, when you're doing TM or you're doing Vedic, it's the same thing. You're using a mantra and you close your eyes and you say the mantra and then other thoughts will come in and you, you know, and you try to, you just, you don't push them out. You just let them flow and, you know, and then you go back to your mantra. There comes a time during meditation when you forget to do your mantra and other thoughts don't come in and they call that the moment of bliss. And that's when your body is actually, your, your brain is awake and it's aware that you are not asleep. But your body isn't aware because for the first time, your brain is not talking to your body because your brain is just neurons. You know, your brain is, your brain is firing. Your brain isn't a muscle, you know, in a sense that your brain is giving your muscle, it's telling your body what to do. So my brain is telling my right hand to move here, do this. He's telling this. So there comes a time, but when you're sleeping in bed, you go to sleep and you have that time when your brain shuts off. Well, your body's, it's rest, right? But when you meditate and you get to that point when your brain shuts off, it's aware that you're awake and your brain does it and your body doesn't know what to do. Yeah. So the first thing it does is it releases stress because it doesn't know. And so you'll feel, you'll feel these emotions. You'll feel this stuff. Like, I mean, I've been in meditations where just tears start coming down my eyes and I'm feeling this stuff come out of me. But there's also a time during it where they call it this, you're in a state of bliss and it's like, and I'll describe the feeling to you. It's like, do you know when you've had the longest day ever? You've all day with the kids and your wife, you're, you're, you're so exhausted. You, the thought of laying down is so heavenly. Yeah. And you get in bed and you lay down and there's the moment right before you go to sleep where you just feel so good and so relaxed. That's what it feels like. Holy shit. Except it lasts. So it's this feeling and it's this, it's this, it's, it's feeling and you can feel like I got to get your mantra. Yeah. And it's like, can you feel it? And you just, and all of a sudden you're just like, and it's extending and you're like, and you're aware and you're awake and you're like going, oh my God, this feels so good. Yeah. And I just, and, and you're like, and you almost, it's almost like it takes a while for you to train yourself to just let it go in a sense that you're trying to go, oh my God, I got to understand this feeling and then you come out of it. You know, it's like, so, and then you, you take a while, you get back in and you start feeling it again and it's like, and it will go, it's so funny. But it's like, and then you learn to find this state and you don't search for it. It just comes when it comes. Okay. That's, I've got a little bit of a reference point for my meditation teacher. His teacher would say, disown it. So when you, the thing is coming, the instruction is to disown it. Yes. A hundred percent. Not to clean. Absolutely. Because that's what Vedic is, is it just a, a different term for TM and it's, it's with a mantra and it's, you know, it's 20 minutes to 30 minutes. You know, you do it once or twice a day. I try, I do every day, no matter what, it's harder. It's become harder to do a second one. I used to do two, I did two a day for like 10 years. Oh my God. And then it's just disciplined. But yeah, but then it just became, it just became too hard. Okay. Now I listen, court, it's 225. I want to get you out of here by three, but I have a question I want to ask you. So I don't mean to cut into this, but did you have more you wanted to say about that? No, no, it's good. Okay, so I don't think a lot of people know that one of your jobs is got to be one of the, and now having talked to you for this amount of time, I get why you got this job, you are a sobriety coach. Now, can you talk to me a little bit about that? Okay. So yeah, I can't, I, I can't do any specifics because a lot of confidentiality, but, but so basically what it is, is, is like a lot of people go through, you know, we've seen that they go through rehab or they go through, you know, and, and I'm not going to say, I'm not, I'm not going to sugarcoat this at all. It's expensive. It's not for, it's not insurance doesn't pay for it. Yeah. It's one of these things that it's like, it's, it's kind of been a lucky thing for people. But here's what happens. You have a lot of people that go through rehab or they go through a treatment program or, or they go through something and they come out and they just go right back to where their life was. They just start using and drinking again. And these are, and we're talking about some of these people are heroin addicts or oxy was a big one. You know, I've had a lot of clients that were, you know, big oxy and, and we're talking near death experiences and, you know, I mean, almost ODing. I've had guys OD, I've had, you know, I've had over a period of time. But what it basically is, is, is what I basically do is when you come out of your program, your whatever your, your treatment, your 30 day, 60, 90 day treatment, I basically go with you and I'm your, I'm basically your assistant. I mean, I mean, not your assistant. I'm your, I'm over your shoulder 24 seven. Wow. So basically there, I'm showing you, I'm kind of walking you through the steps of how to have a sober life. Okay. So I, it's like, it's like you take someone and, you know, they're used to coming back and going to their apartment and then they call their friends and they go, so they say, no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not, that's not what we're doing. Can we role play for a second? Yes. I'm going to be your client. Okay. Now I've gotten out of a 30 day program. I have been. So first thing we're going to do, we're going to go to your house and we're going to clean it out. Okay. So we're going to go, we're going to get, we're going to, you're, you're, you're obviously not going to tell me where you've hidden everything, but I've been doing this a long time. So I kind of know where you're going to go, but here's the other part. It's also, I'm a drug addict. Yeah. I, you're not going to, you're not doing anything. I haven't done. Right. So one thing is like, you don't look, I don't, I don't look at you. Is anything other than someone who just kind of the light hasn't come on yet. You know, and it's like, and some people really do want to, they come out, excuse me, very gung-ho. But the problem is, is that, you know, a couple of days in there'll be like, well, you know, a lot of people meetings are, are big thing because it makes you accountable. It kind of gives you a place to start. And for the first year, I recommend people go to a lot of meetings, you know, and, and because what it does is it gets you connected with other people that are also sober. Right. And because you, you, and, and with the, and in 99.9% of the cases, they know people there. It's not like they're walking in and everybody's a stranger. Believe me. Like, oh, I haven't seen you in a while. Yeah, I know. I know, I kind of quit hanging out with you because you were always fucked up. Yeah. You know, but so that's one of the things you do. You get them connected into something like that. And, and then you got to kind of like, you got to kind of walk them through, you know, you got to just kind of walk them through the, the, the everyday thing. Okay. Okay. Now we, you know, some people don't have jobs. So you got to walk through. Okay. Let's, let's talk about, you know, a job, wait, can I pause for a second? Yeah, I do want to point out when I got hooked on fucking catamine, I turned into a rat and like would squirrel away. It was, and I would watch myself doing it and be like, what's the difference between me and like some disgusting hamster? You know what I mean? Because you get real paranoid with your, we're like, oh, I'm going to put it behind this book. I'm like, why, why, why, why are you doing like, and then you'll forget where you put it, like some like idiot squirrel. It was, I gotta tell you, man, it was scary to watch myself just start like transforming into some, it was gross to court. It wasn't doing anything. That's the other weird thing about it is like, it wasn't even working. Like, what's the effect of this very like expensive, stupid thing? It started off great. I was having legitimate mystical experiences. And then it was just like flat lining. The final phase for me was like, I tried to record a commercial for the podcast and it took me four hours because I was like so dumb from this. Anyway, man, I just want to point out like that must be a weird thing to have to go into an addict's apartment or house and dig through their shit to find their little drug nests. Oh, but you know where it's easy. What's the most common place? Oh, I don't think there's a common place necessarily. There's always the, um, there's always the bookshelf, the bookshelf area is always where something, it's, there's always some kind of bookshelf. Area or there's, you know, the shoebox in the back of the closet that's like, you know, it's like, you know, come on. That's the more sophisticated addict. This is sophisticated addict is going to have like some nice shoebox in the corner. The other addict is like, I'm going to put it behind my body. We're all going to shove it into a National Geographic. So you go in, you go through the shelves. You got to find, yeah, we just go through and we, you know, basically, depending on what their, you know, thing of choice was, you know, we kind of go through and we clean, you know, we just do a clean. Do they try to hide it from you? Do they ever say like, cause then they're like, look, I'm sober. They're not trying. Do they ever deceive you in the beginning? Oh yeah. Oh, I think, I think there's like, it takes a little while to build up the trust. But I think also like, you know, I, uh, you know, my experience is, is that a lot, sometimes you're, you're going to have someone, a client, so to speak, that comes from a family that pays all their bills. Yeah. And so, and, and the only way they can keep getting their bills paid is if they stay sober and so they're doing it only in, it's only for looks. They don't want to be sober. Okay. So they're kind of resent secretly resentful. They're very resent. It's not secretly, they're resentful and, and it's like, and it's just like, you know, and, and I always tell them, I go, bro, if you want to drink or use, just go, I'm not going to stop you. I'm, there's nothing I can do. If you want to do it, nothing I can do. So go freedom. Oh my God. And that's brutal. And it's like, and then, you know, and, and, you know, nobody goes in on a, nobody goes into a treatment center on a winning streak. You know, nobody's going into these places. Like, you know, my life was so great. I thought I was doing the best cocaine. It was just a hot tub full of just beautiful girls blowing me. I was in the best shape of my life, you know, just job opportunities. We're just having to turn them down. There were so many, and I just love my life. You know, that, that's not what happens. Nobody goes in like crawling into those places. Yeah, or, you know, get arrested or there, you know, it's, you know, their, their wife is left or they're, they can't see their kids, you know, I can't tell you how many times it's, you know, can't see kids anymore. And, you know, and, and just, you know, all these things and it's just so sad. And then, you know, but the greatest thing is, is like, you know, it's not an easy job and it's, and the good thing is, is lucky for me. I've been doing this for a long time. And it's like, and I get to pick, you know, I get to pick and choose. Cause your schedule must get filled up. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's like, but the great thing is, is I will say this, is when you see this person that started out like, you know, this that comes out after 30 days and, you know, they're just pissing vinegar and da da da da da. And you watch their life just become this unbelievable thing. And you just go, holy shit. And, and I didn't do it. You know, they did it. Yeah. I didn't do it. I can't do it for them. They have to do it themselves. So you just kind of, you're pushing them in the right directions. And to watch their lives just get like fucking awesome is the best feeling in the world because you just see, like, you know, you know, where they came from, you know, you've been where they were. And, you know, and that's the thing that I think is, is, is interesting about this job is, you know, you can't do it if you haven't, you know, it's just like, like, I think Joe Rogan is the greatest UFC commentator ever. Yeah. I don't think there's any, I don't watch a fight that, that he's that I love listening to him. It's like the great because I'm not that well schooled in the UFC. Yeah. But if I watch a fight that he's calling, I know what's happening. Yeah. I've learned something. Yeah, it's awesome. It's unbelievable. So it's like, because he's been there, he's been there for the whole, he's been, he's been there from the beginning of the UFC through the whole thing. Right. The guy knows, the guy knows it, front words and backwards. And it's like, and, you know, you can't talk, the only person that can talk to an addict, an alcoholic that's seeking treatment is someone who's been there, right? Who's, who's like, oh, yeah. Oh, I know what that's like. Yeah. Oh, you, oh, you know what it's like to, yeah, motherfucker. I know it's like to shit my pants in a, in a fucking car, where, you know, and they're like, you know, just what it's like, whatever it's like, yeah, it's like, yeah, I mean, it's like, I've been there. I get it. And it's like, you're not, so, and then they kind of start to realize like, oh, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not alone. And you're living proof. Yeah. That's the other thing is it's like, you could talk all day long about it, but you're like someone who's like healthy, happy, who also is shit their pants, probably mid drug deal in cars. All the, all the creepy things that addicts go through. So, dude, I remember it go, I once went on it, it was, was picking up a girl for a date that I absolutely was in love with and did a huge bump of coke before I went picked her up. And it, and I, and I, and I thought I was farting and I just shit my pants. And I literally was 40 miles from my house. Like I was, it's when I was in college, I was in still water. No, I had to literally pull over to the side of the road, like pull into like, and it wasn't even near like a gas station somewhere, I had to pull in, but you're so paranoid, you can't go to a gas station because you're all coked up. So I was paranoid. So I had to pull in some field, get out, you know, try to clean myself up. And then I had to leave my, somebody was like in their field, like, what the fuck? Who shit themselves in my field? But I mean, it's just like, that's just one story of many. Like for this, it didn't go well. Court. Yeah. Man, you are cool. It's so good to see you. It's so good to see you. You're, you're just, you're you, now do you know a lot of people here in Nashville now? Yeah, I'm, I got some friends, you know, I, and, and, and I got my hands full right now. I got a seven months old. I got a two and a half year old. So, you know, it's like, I'm still, no, I don't know, but, oh, you got people who've got kids. It's like, I'm still in that phase of parenting where it's like my schedule is when you, the example you gave for meditation, I know the feeling well, you know, that all day long and finally like, ah, I know. So, but I do have friends and I love it here, but nothing's going to replace comedy store people. Nothing's going to replace this, man. This is so cool. What a treat to get to see you again. It's so good. It's, yeah, it's been, I just was trying to think it's, I guess the last time I saw you was 16 and 17 months, man, year and a half before the pandemic. Yeah, it was shortly, right before, shortly before, shortly before things were getting weird. I'm not sure if it was even on the news yet then, but no, how long have you lived here in Asheville now? Uh, I think, oh my God, I'm so fucked up with time, man. It's, it's about almost two years, I think, but no way a year and a half now. I guess probably you, let me think. What month did you move here in? I'll have to go back and look, man. I, I, I'm, I'm very time adverse, man. I was like telling my wife last night we're at dinner and I was like, I'm 46. And like, I'm not in the demographic where you want to get this fucking disease. And she goes, honey, you're 47. Fuck, I don't even know my own age anymore. I just gained a year over, over dinner. Um, but yeah, man, I love it, but we're, we've already like, you know, we're going to be taking trips. We're going to come to L, we've just decided like this will be our home base for now, but we're going to travel. It's nice to have a piece. You know, Charlotte's so, you know, even though Charlotte is bigger than here, it's still way more peaceful than LA. Oh yeah. I, I love it. It's like there, you know, we're trying to build, we've been trying to kind of build the comedy scene there. You know, try to build up. So, um, I just did, we just did a show on Tuesday night, new material night. So we did, yeah. So we're doing another one in September and I'd love for you to be there. Oh man, look, let's do it because you know what? I need it. And also like my wife is like, I want to go to Charlotte for a shopping trip. So like, and it's a Tuesday night. Perfect. So we'll go out there, get a hotel. Yeah. I'll come and work on some material. Let's do it. Can I do it? 100% awesome. September 28th. September 28th. Wait, let me think. I want to make sure I'm going to be, it's a Tuesday night. Yeah. Perfect. It's a Tuesday night. So I'm in town. Oh, I love it. It's, it's so good. And it's, um, and it's fun and it's fun. We did one, the first one and the crowd loved it. So I went out, I am seated and I walked out and I would say, you know, look, people are going to be reading out of notebooks. They're going to be doing stuff they've never done before. That's cool. So just have fun and people loved it. What, where do you do a venue? Comedy zone. Oh, really? Yeah. Oh, dude, I'm there. That'll be awesome. Yeah. It's a great comedy club. My heart is soaring right now, Corey. Oh yeah, for sure. It's so great to see you. And whenever you're in town, you got to hit me up every time you come here. Oh, I will. Where can people find you? Uh, just the best way to find me is Instagram.

She wants to know how the wind cream don't flow. I look at her eyes and say, I don't know. She throws the can away, looks for the sea. By the time she looks out, I'm on the street. Gas fan, that's the truth. I'm a gas fan, on the loose. Yeah, gas fan, better lock up your whip cream. Yeah. I'm just a gas fan. Hit me with that white so I can make it through the north. Yeah, yeah. You can't stop me. I'm high as shit. My voice is getting low from that plastic tip. Like a tire on fire, I just take a sip. I'm rolling for your neighborhood. I'm hunting for the whip. Vampire of the gasses. Downstairs at midnight, taking cooking classes. Pop the red top, I'm winding up your glasses. Skip the opium, it's N02 for the masses. I'm just a gas fan. Hit me with that white so I can make it through the north. I know that you've been with cream dreaming. For the latest night, I've been talking like a teammate. Gas fan, that's what I am. Gas fan, used to be a man now. I'm on the gas fan. Baby, I'm on the gas fan. I'm just a gas fan. Hit me with that white so I can make it through the north. Greetings to you, my loves, my bubs, my darlin' sweets. My little spray kittens down there nestled up next year. Beautiful owners curled in their sweet scented cleavages. I hope you're all doing great out there. I'm doing really good. It makes you feel good to make music, to make songs. That's gas vamp. I'm excited about that because you can hear on there, Drew Lewis, who is very funny and a member of the DTFH family and excites me to collaborate in that way. The song would not exist if not for Drew Lewis and the DTFH family gathering where we gather together every week. Yeah, it's kind of a plug. I don't care. We gather together every week. And I was telling them something that has happened in our house, which is that my wonderful wife, she got this really fancy coffee machine. Basically, she's trying to duplicate Starbucks. And in the morning, she sprays whipped cream in her coffee. If you're a mom, you know that that means a lot. If you've been up with a kid all night, or kids got sick, they're better now. They got freaking RSV, which sucks. Anyway, the point is, I love whipped cream. And the reason I love whipped cream, as most of you probably know, is you can get a little bit of nitrous oxide out of whipped cream cans. I know it's pathetic. And I have been at night kind of bored in the middle of getting frustrated with this game. I've been playing called Returnal. And I'll go in the kitchen to anxiety eat, which I'm trying to stop right now. I'm starting intermittent fasting. I gained some weight from doing this. Anyway, the point is, I would go in, open up the fridge, do that thing where you're like scanning, hoping some new thing appeared there that you know is not there, but you're looking again. Then I'd look at the whipped cream, like, you know what, maybe for all time's sake, I'll do some, I'll do a nitrous oxide hit. The problem is, when you do that, it completely, it makes it so you can't get whipped cream out of the can anymore because you have inhaled all the gas. And so Erin was sort of wondering, like, what's going on with the whipped cream? Like, why isn't it working? Like, really disappointed because she's looking forward to that hit of whipped cream and her coffee at the boarding as she comes downstairs tired. And I had, you know, it's terrible, pathetic and terrible, like, golem level, like, swampy kind of, what the fuck am I doing? I'm taking whippet hits from my wife's whipped cream cans. You know, really dark, like, and it doesn't have the sort of, like, junky glory. You know, not that there is any real glory in being a junkie, but, you know, at least there's some burrows-esque, like, thing if there was, like, hard drugs going on. You know, it's something, it's like, it's, it's something in that, that it's just, like, that's what I'm, I'm, like, playing PlayStation and taking fucking whippet hits from my wife's whipped cream cans that she likes to put in her coffee. Anyway, I was telling the story and Drew Lewis coined the phrase, gas vamp. And this song was born. That's Drink Drank Drew on Twitter. You should follow him. Also on there, Johnny Pemberton doing his amazing rap stylings. Is that what you call it now? I don't know. I don't care anymore about that. I mean, I do care. I would love to be the coolest person on planet Earth. I would love to be, like, cutting edge, like, on the edge. Like, right now, I know somewhere in some part of the world, probably, my guess would be Haiti. Probably there is the coolest person on Earth who is, like, such a profoundly brilliant, incredible artist that birds fly around their house to listen to them as they edit and produce their music. But that's not where I'm at now. I'm 47. I've got scoliosis, expanding bald spots, slowly expanding right now. Thank God, a tiny little tattoo on my stomach from when I got radiation therapy and they had to mark where the beam would be. And no, I'm not looking for your sympathy. I'm just saying that's what starts happening when you get older, is you get these interesting little marks and scars and little things that most people might not even notice, but you look at and you're like, holy fuck, this is crazy being in a body. You start getting all kinds of stuff. Hemorrhoids and you get, what do you call those, herniated discs? And you get good stuff, too. But most importantly, what you start getting is hopefully a kind of grudging love for where you're at right now. You sort of start losing the battle of hating yourself because it's just too exhausting to spend all that time hyperanalyzing every inch of your body. And besides, it's like, give me a fucking break. What are you, what are you going to do? You're 47. I mean, you're not right now. And I have been, I've had younger people like basically like age, like age shame me, which is one of the more tragic things you can do as a young person, something that I am deeply guilty of. And you know, it's just part of being young as you age shame. It's fun to age shame. It does require imagining that you aren't also being vacuumed into old age, but it's part of, you know, the things you have to be like, all right, old man, dad, I am a dad now. I love being a dad. It's the best. I tell you, I have always wanted to be able to do like cool magic when I was a kid and I bought this very expensive book of coin magic in New Orleans. Couldn't understand it. Didn't have the discipline to like practice to do sleight of hand. But fuck, let me tell you, when you have got a two and a half year old, you can blow their mind because they don't understand anything about magic. You could just, they don't know when you tell them like, well, look over there. They look, you put whatever the thing is that was just in your hand under your leg and they look back and shriek with joy that the tennis balls disappeared. And I love that. It's the best. I love it. I'm cool. I'm, I'm still somewhat, I guess what I'm saying is I'm still somewhat tormented. By wanting to be cool. Like I think that'll probably torment me to the end of my life. Well, maybe not. I mean, it does seem to be fading away, but I'm just not as tormented as I used to be. And all the things that I really used to look down on happen to be like essential aspects of humanity continuing. I mean, if we want humans to continue to be a thing on the planet, you got to reproduce. That might be a controversial thing to say, but I don't, I don't know how else it's going to happen. But yeah, it's like it's just kind of got to give up being cool. If you're going to, you don't want to be a cool dad. You want to be a cool dad. Come on. There's nothing more uncool than a cool dad. You're supposed to be this kind of globby embarrassment, you know, where you do slick your hair back and wear fucking sunglasses and ride around on like a cool fucking motorcycle or something. You're a dad now. You brought, you, you, you did breeding. You did breeding. You know, you're, you're now, you've consigned yourself to becoming a pixel. Whereas before, at least you get, you could kind of like have this like illusion that maybe you are going to be some kind of super glorious super Nova. I mean, I know this isn't like a, this doesn't, it's not a palatable thing for some people. Have you all ever been around a super Nova person? You know, a person who's like really work at working on the super Nova thing. You know, uh, it's not fun. I'll tell you that. It's not fun being around that. It's weird. You always just kind of feel like God, give me, go super Nova, somebody somewhere else. I get it. You're the cool. You're fucking cool. All right. I get it. You're cool. You know stuff. You know a lot of cool stuff and you're cool and you, and you, and you like dance better than I do and have a, uh, some kind of like insight into whatever it is that I don't. And, and the different, and, and, and you are wielding that insight, like some, like a, like a tail feathers springing up from the body of one of those cool fucking birds that live in like the Galapagos and do those funny dances. Which is the thing I like to watch with my two and a half year old. I like to watch the birds dancing. I like to watch the bird documentaries and you, what these self serious birds, I can't remember where they are. Maybe they're in Guatemala or something. They're beautiful, but they're ridiculous. And they have these Dr. Seuss style tail feathers and wings and they do this really hilarious, like mating dance that is for them. It's like the most serious thing ever. I'm sure that they're not thinking that another species is cackling on the couch with their offspring at how silly the birds look. Like to them, they're like, holy fuck, man, I'm getting a lot of likes and faves for this amazing dance that no doubt will bring me a perfect mate. But we're all guilty of it. You know, that's what happens when you get wrapped up in your damn identity and hyper concerned over your temporary human form locked into your body. And, you know, it's sad because you can't really, maybe there's hope and I will be the first in line at the age reversal clinic. And I will be the first to get my spine straight and my ass tightened, my dick extended, my bald spot filled in, my eyes rejuvenated, my body rejuvenated. I will take the dark syrupy liquid that I imagine they inject into you with a needle the size of a turkey baster. If it allows me to go backwards in time to a place where I didn't have weird radiation tattoos and bulging parts and aches and pains and strange cramps in my legs at night, I would do that. But, you know, until then, what else is there to do except say the classic lines, Father, into your hands, I commend my spirit up here all kind of bloated and I'm working on it. I'm going to start. I'm doing fasting and keto and all that stuff, Father, but also into your hands, I commend my spirit. I'm not going to worry about being cool anymore. I mean, I don't think you can look cool getting crucified on the time space continuum, but you could try. What did I just say? I don't know. That was written for me by Langford Crawley. He is the owner of the Crawley Literature Institute. If you need some kind of mildly intelligible rant, he will get that to you. You can look up at Crawley.edu. I think he's over there at AB Tech University. Is it a university? I think it's a community college. Boy, we have a good podcast for you today. Emil Amos is here.

Emil Amos is one of my best friends and also a big inspiration to me. He's the person who first introduced me to the idea that you could be an artist. He introduced me to Lo-Fi and Daniel Johnston. I just love him so much. He also happens to be a genius musician. You've probably seen him live. He has an incredible band called Holy Sons, another called Grails. He's the drummer and ohm. And the list goes on and on. I'm going to have all the links you need to find Emil at dunkitrustle.com. But for now, sit back, put your feet in your lover's mouth, and welcome back to the DTFH. Emil Amos. Welcome. Welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands. No need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's me. Welcome back. God bless you. Thank you for doing this today, man. You're back from Australia. That's true. I have absolutely nothing to tell you about that. What even was it? I realized what a rotten friend I was because I knew you were going to Australia, but then I didn't know why. Oh, I got married. I got divorced. Jesus Christ. Had a couple kids. Now, I was locked in a penthouse for like two weeks on quarantine, and then they just like let us out immediately, and we played a festival that's kind of run by this multimillionaire who had won all of his money gambling on horses while studying math in Tasmania. What? Yeah, he had devised. I'm not going to go like way into this. This is so fascinating. It's just a footnote. Yeah, he's like kind of a Richard Branson type, and he basically figured out some sort of approach to horse racing that was statistically so successful that he's now, I think it's up there around $750 million or something, and he paid for us to come because he sort of conducts the underground culture in Tasmania. I hope I'm not misrepresenting underground culture in Tasmania, but basically he sort of wanted to put us in the show with Thirstamore and this legendary New Zealand band called The Dead Sea and like a lot of other people, and we basically just flew over because we thought it might be the only money we might be getting through the whole pandemic, and so we'd agreed to do it, and then the government and guys with machine guns were like leading us down halls, and it was extremely complicated. I think I did like, you know, 12 COVID tests and like all sorts of regimented weird border shit, but I'm back now and, you know, I'm trying to get my head back in the game and like rediscover some of my organic sort of hunger for the things that I'm supposed to be doing, the things that are for me, you know? Yes. And I feel... You mean like music or what do you mean? Yeah, like music and podcasting and everything I've done, whether it's, you know, putting a skateboard down on the pavement or making a video or something, it's supposed to be for me, you know, and it has to be for me, but like if you turn your life, if you turn art into your job, you're headed into a strange vortex and in order to do your job well, you have to protect the zone that you go to that is a super personal place because if you don't maintain the kind of integrity of that world, then you're not going to be making the thing that's good that anybody wants, you know? And so if the car starts leading the donkey, I think... That's probably the quickest way I could understand like what happened to all your heroes when you're growing up, right? You watched, I think of like Rush or something, like a band that starts out wanting to be Zeppelin and then you fast forward and then it's like their MTV attempts are pretty embarrassing, you know? Yeah. And like you, as a kid, you're like, what happened? Like why does genius dissipate, right? Yeah. Like every kid, every little kid, you start age 12 or whatever, you're studying the master, right? And you're like, what? Why is he dying inside? Yeah. Right? And so we're finally of this age where we can sort of see the internal death beckoning. God, he will. Yeah, I mean, but you see like you have the kid in you that is truly the fan and that kid that is the fan is the guiding light. And I mean, that's a thorny subject, right? Because you don't want the fans to guide the Star Wars franchise. And yet at the same time, maybe sometimes they know best, you know? And that part of you that is so stringently looking at the details of the continuity of the mythology. That part of you is probably a lot more wise than the cigar chomping executive that's just like throwing stars in the fray. Do you know what I mean? Yes. Yeah, man. I'm interested to know how you distinguish being in that place versus not being in that place. Like what are the symptoms of being in that place? Well, I think you are super in touch with it, even if you didn't study the science of inspiration growing up. Because, see, recording is sort of the great leveler, I suppose. Because as you're growing up and you're like recording yourself, you know when you're lying. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Because you can hear it immediately on playback. Right. And so you can't get away with anything like you can learn to trick people, but it won't stand the test of time. And so as somebody who is a fan of other people who went to that zone, when you hear yourself on playback, like most people, you hate yourself, right? You hate the way you come off. I think if I could watch videos of myself behaving around my house or talking to my family, I would probably be pretty disgusted and not for any great reason. Just the subtleties of viewing your own narcissism or whatever microscopically occurs in every little interaction that makes you so repulsed about yourself. But like that level of like growing up with recording, you've got a mirror in front of you all the time. So you are wrestling with this thing called yourself, this thing that you either don't understand yet or you don't even like. And in order to break through in order to make something that has just a little bit of value, you have to experience a breakthrough and you can't force or manufacture a breakthrough. But the tape has to be rolling all the fucking time. You have to make so much stuff until something happens that you can stand back from objectively and say, I don't know how that happened. Fuck, I am lucky that, you know, I hit the vortex and like there's an integrity there. There is some sort of fundamental expression happening and there's nothing cocky in that place. There's a feeling of you being overcome by either emotion or inspiration in a way that you start to evaporate and the experience starts to be captured, right? Right. And in that place, that's where I know you've been when you get excited. And that is in part really that fan kid part of you. When you see like, say, Michael Jordan, like in midair dunking. In theory, he is feeling this great exaltation of humanity in this moment. In theory, he's feeling what it looks like. But a lot of times, as Paul McCartney always sort of points out, that person is not feeling that at all. It's the little kid watching it. That's like, holy fuck. You know what I mean? That's cool. So that person's job is to make that person feel that flame of existence in that sense. And so, you know, it's a symbiotic relationship, right? And you've got both of them inside you. So, you know, there's the technician that's trying to accomplish this incredibly complicated task. And then there's the person that appreciates the push to work so hard to become something that's almost not... It's almost not even human. It's almost beyond, you know? And so, like, when Michael Jordan's doing that dunk, that one you see the silhouette of in the back of people's heads, it's not that he's necessarily fully feeling that thing. He's creating an image that we all celebrate. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. Okay, so it's an occult idea. It shows up in, like, a lot of different mystical traditions. I just had a rabbi on who is saying there's a name in Judaism. There's a name for the light that shines off of someone who is hanging out with, like, a realized being. So, it's the reflection of that being's light shining back onto the realized being. That's one idea. The other idea that's really trippy is, like, in Bhakt Yoga, Krishna can't... Because Krishna is, like, the thing that everything comes out of. Krishna is the one thing that can't really, like, love himself or in the way other people can. Like, because it's just... That's just what he is. So Ratha, his lover, appears, and this produces the bhakti... What's, like, the math for bhakti to work? Is you have to have the thing, and then you have the thing that loves it. And the reflection of those two things produces this, like, ecstatic infinity mirror, which is the sum total of bhakti yoga. Yeah, so you're saying, like, that's what Michael Jordan is essentially. Like, he's...this is game...God knows what game for him. And who knows where he even is when he's doing this stuff. He might not be there at all. You know, if he's really fully in the flow state, he's probably barely there. I get it. That's really cool, man. And that's a really strange thing to realize. That you might be looking... If you're looking for that feeling of exaltation, and to correct me if I'm misunderstanding, if you're looking for that feeling of exaltation when you're creating, you've misunderstood things. Is that what you mean? Like, in the sense that really that feeling of exaltation was more connected to you absorbing other great things. Like, you might not ever get that feel... I get excited when stuff's coming together and feels, and it's good. I know what you mean, but it is a different feeling than when I'm, like, absorbing someone else's art. Mm-hmm. I want to thank BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Friends, there's something interfering with your happiness that's preventing you from achieving your goals. Like, I don't know, global pandemic, a slow-boil kind of realization that civilization, as we know it, is way more fragile than you ever thought it could possibly be, like, bird egg-style fragile. But because of some form of hubris and being completely in love with life in a kind of naive way, you decided to have two kids, and now you're dealing with the growing realization that it is possible that you gave birth to children during an incredibly tumultuous time in human history. And even though you are not a historian or aware that this does tend to happen in human history and that you can't expect things to be stable, you do kind of wonder, what have I done? And PS, am I just going to turn into my dad? Is this how I'm going to cope with all this stress by reverting into some, like, closed-off, angry, human, callous thing? That's no way to be a father.

I know what you mean, but it is a different feeling than when I'm like absorbing someone else's art. Yeah, I mean, so much of life as privileged human beings is just this kind of lazy couch surfing Sunday. The other day, I can't remember what made me angry, but it was like a moment. I've had so many things like I think I've mentioned before, like a parking ticket just set me off. And not anger that time, like very deep depression because I felt so sorry for myself or something fucking stupid. But like one of my favorite songs I ever wrote came out of that. It's called Trampled Down and it's so funny. It's so funny. It's so comical to listen to the song like the exquisite state of total self shame sadness going on. And yet which albums that on it's at the end of fall of man. And it's just so funny when you listen to it sit there and think that this came from a parking ticket, you know, because the parking ticket. There's no reason to take that personally really, you know, it's like has nothing to do with you. Yeah. So anyway, the other day, something got me really mad and like, you know, when I get angry. I did kind of sucks, but I think some people around me get a little bit scared or something because it just doesn't look like I'm I don't know what it looks like. I don't know what it looks like to look at me. But like, I think when I get angry, it can be not really fun to watch. And so the other day, I got I got angry about something probably completely insignificant and something completely in my mind itself invented. And I sat down and I just, you know, sampled some some bit of a baseline, like kind of put it in a certain order of notes and just basically like howled at the mic, you know, like for 45 minutes. And of course, you feel fucking great after that. Yeah. But like, it was just nonsense like kind of anger coming out. And in that moment, I went to that zone. And I was so happy. And that's what I'm saying is like, it is a form of happiness because you could be sad. You could be angry going into the vortex. But what happens in there is there's this acknowledgement that you're feeling something so universal. Yeah, not that you sit there and think, Oh, how universal am I right now? You just you experience something that's so engaging and you feel that rush of confidence because it's so real. And when you realize it's real, you kind of are realizing the billions of people that have existed before you that have also lived and given themselves and died on earth. And you are related to them. And they've all felt these things too. And in this moment, it is your job to fucking go hard, you know what I mean? And like, bring it home, you know, no matter what the emotion is. I mean, when I was a kid, watching Lou Barlow on stage, what really got me excited was not like the sound of the band necessarily. It was cool that it was like understandable like pop music and shit. But what really got me excited was the fact that he was basically humiliating himself. Yeah, you know what I mean? And he was criticizing himself on a level that was really beyond radical. I mean, some of the put downs he put into the songs on himself, the evisceration of his own idiocy and the way he treated women or something like the way he would expose it was so radical that I was like, Whoa, dude, like if you can do that, can you imagine what I could make and call art like I could go anywhere. I could do anything. Yeah, because there was a level of just wild radical honesty happening there. I think before that terms like that were even really, you know, even spoken of. I mean, maybe Ken Wilber had talked about something like that in 1978, but like certainly nobody in hardcore punk was ever going to like really eviscerate themselves. They were about eviscerating you. Do you know what I mean? Absolutely, man. And like that, yeah, being in the presence of someone doing that makes you feel like you're witnessing some kind of ritual or something. It's got a shamanistic quality to it in the sense that, well, I mean, look, if one person is somehow managing to push through the invitation to being a kind of numb dishonest fucking cocoon and they're doing that in front of a bunch of people. And then they're also on top of all that. It's like, it's beautiful. Like, you know, I think that's anytime I've seen that was stand up. It's just like, it reminds me of something this guy, Bruce Dahmer was talking about a burning man at this like, like they have these talks there. And he was, he was talking about this ayahuasca ritual where the shaman is singing and everyone is seeing the same thing. And there's like a dome around them. And then the shaman with his drum is like banging it in the top of the dome is like somehow responding to that and opening up. And on the other side is like the astral realm or something like that. He's like navigating them out of the bubble of, you know, default reality and into this completely alternate dimension, basically. And, you know, obviously I'm not saying when you go to see Lou Barlow, he's going to like, you know, literally everyone in the audience sees a dome that gets shattered by a drum. But it's in the same line. You know what I mean? It's similar, you know, in the sense that what it like everyone comes there with some shared reality that gets, you know, hopefully, you know, happily opened up. You know, and it's an invitation to not be such a fucking liar, you know, to yourself and the people around you. And also it's proving like, look, this is not me. I'm not getting rejected here. You know, so yeah, that's one of the things I love about your music. I think that's one of the, like, when you, when you, it's a crazy thing when people start hitting that. And God, you know, I've been like, I never really gotten to Kanye West, but Aaron's into him. So I've been listening to him and it's weird because like, I hear that in that music too. You know, this like fucking nutty authenticity, you know what I mean? It just like, it's like with lo-fi music, like Daniel Johnson with Lou Barlow, the outsider art stuff is resonating with the underproduced quality of it produces this. But with Kanye West, you have this hyper produced stuff mixing with outsider art. Do you think I'm crazy? No, I don't think that, I don't think that the production is the bottom line. I don't think that the production makes or breaks like the, the integrity of the articulation or anything. But to bring it back to layman's terms for someone who may not, you know, have grown up with some of this stuff. I would say that there's something so crazy about the redemptive oracle going on on stage. Yeah. If the boy, the little boy that I was watching, Lou Barlow was like 23 or something when I would see him. And his parents came to the show or something and he, he had such a bad performance that he actually like a four year old through his guitar and started crying in front of the audience, you know? Jesus. So my point is, that's pretty much the picture of worst case scenario. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's like, like, if I, if I say that, you know, I want to be in a band and someday I want to play on stage. That's, that's what I don't want to happen. Right. So your parents come, you have the worst show ever, you cry in front of the audience, you throw your guitar. And when I was a kid, they made me picture for like one season and I hit, there was one game where I like threw the ball and I hit like three batters in a row. Like I just hit the kids accidentally and I cried and threw my glove and I never pitched again. Wow. But it's like, that's exactly the picture of what you don't want to happen. Freeze that on stage and turn the camera over to me, the little boy who was probably 15 in the audience that was watching it. That was the best thing I'd ever seen. So how could those two things be the same thing? Oh, wow. You know, his worst day was my best day. Yeah. Somehow, whether it's Kanye West or wherever you find it, it's the redemptive quality of the fact that somehow his misery turned into gold for me because I saw a permission slip to like experience anything I want and give anything. I felt two other people in real time in a way that was so radical. I will never see that on TV. I will never see a documentary where the stones at ultimate act like that. And that was like seeing somebody actually in the zone going through something so incredibly sad, angry or emotionally engaged. That was a major gift to me. You know what I mean? Yeah. Gift is the right word for it. It's when any time I've seen that and with Lou Barlow is I saw him have a great fucking show, man. I was just like that. I was I walked in because I heard he was reforming and then I like sitting there waiting. I look over. He's just sitting in the he's sitting out in front of the stage and I just couldn't believe like I just couldn't believe it because like you had turned me on him. And then that that is essentially been all I've been listening to for years over and over and over again. The freed weed, which I think turned into the freed man or something like that. There's been a few iterations of that album. But anyway, like I was just like I couldn't believe it and and it wasn't like an act. You know what I mean? It wasn't like the king coming to hang out with a peasant tree or some show like that. He really just didn't seem to distinguish himself as a performer and in some hierarchical way from everybody else. That was kind of mind blowing too. That that that that rubbed off on me. That's that was a beautiful thing. But do you like I want to go back to what you're saying about the tape recorder when you're a little kid. And how you hear it. I never thought like whenever I've never thought of that dissonance the first time I heard myself on a tape recorder is being me hearing myself lying. You know, I always just but I remember that squeamish like squirmy feeling that I would get to the point where I wouldn't want to hear myself. And some people when you record, like I think it's it's not these days everyone's recording themselves. So it's kind of gone away. But when when having a tape recorder was kind of interesting, you know what I mean? When having a tape recorder was still like, whoa, this is like cool technology. Not everyone had even heard themselves record it. You know, like my like my mom, I would there are many times out here say I don't like to hear my own voice. And I never thought, oh, that's dishonesty. That's because you're not comfortable with who you are. Or is it because when you hear yourself, you feel like you're putting on too much of a show or something. Is that what you meant? Yeah, yeah. No, I mean, that does occur because everybody knows the reverse feeling of like actually being proud of something that you did. I don't know if that's the way I would put it, but proud of the reality of something shining through a moment that you were involved in or something. And it is sort of the opposite of that, right? Because you're saying, you're saying, hold this up like it's timeless. Like this feeling is real. And in a sense, I understand this feeling or I like I've melded with it. So the opposite is true that we are proud of that or we or we strive for it. So yeah, I don't see why it would be so wrong to admit that what we don't like is when something worthless shines through something that is not real something we don't like. We're not proud of it because it's yeah, it's it might be a lie. I don't think that's so radical to admit, you know. No, no, I don't think it's it's right. No, I just it's cool to think about that. So there's a it's kind of it's kind of in the same like vein. I had this guy Raymond Moody on a long time ago. He studies near death experiences. And one of the things people who die and come back report is they see their body and they barely recognize themselves. Like they're once because we've only seen ourselves in the mirror, but I think there's something else to it is like they're seeing their unanimated self. And it's like, I don't know who that that's me. That's not me. So it also makes me think about like projection. You know what I mean? Like that the the the the what's the word for it? The distortion that happens when you're hearing whatever it is you're create like you make anything right and you listen to it. Are you right? You write something and then you read it and you're it's not just like you're reading what you wrote. You're also reading the projections you're putting on top of what you wrote. And you know what I mean? And so then you're like, God, this is fucking garbage. You know, but but but how do you distinguish between authenticity? And because I think that's that, you know what I mean? So you read what you write or what you wrote. God, this is garbage. But then you're like, you know what? But that's who I am, right? Or how do you distinguish between that? And like you read what you wrote and you're like, this is garbage. But you're like, is there I don't know that it's actually garbage. I think I'm just, you know, not the one to be like the I shouldn't be the only critic of this stuff. You know, how do you distinguish the two? I think that's why I enjoy editing so much. Because if you picture Bob Dylan with like a pad in front of him or or Bowie with his like cut up computer where he would like delete certain phrases until things were nonsensically perfect. Yeah, there's there's a high of knowing that something's garbage because you're like, oh, I found it. I found the piece of shit that is obscuring my meaning. And a lot of times if you just delete that and then snug up the next bit, you would be shocked that your whole sentiment actually suddenly makes sense. Even if the two things on the left and right weren't said together and don't make sense together. Once you delete the garbage, they just make their own point. Do you know what I mean? That is fucking cool. Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. It's the way that is magic. Totally when you like you remove one sentence or one phrase or whatever and somehow the entire thing just works now. Like it was like a circuit board in this one part of the way the energy was running through. It was disrupting the entirety of the fucking thing. That is the weirdest thing. Yep. And I mean, I think at that point you acknowledge like I wasn't even talking about the same thing in the left and the right of these two wave files, but like the frequency computes. Like it all flows right together because you came from an actual emotional field. You were in the field. Do you know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, God, I'm sorry. You're making me think of that insane. Now it makes sense. There's a Jesus verse and it's so when you hear it and take it literally like Jesus, that's fucked up. But it's like, what is it? If your eye offends the pluck it out, you know, it's like, is it? Yeah, like, yeah, like it would be better to have to like have only one eye than to have like this piece of yourself that is corrupt. You know, I mean, it's obviously not meant to be taken literally, but it's a certainly it's great writing advice. Yeah, I think that when, you know, I grew up in the same town as Michael Jordan. So I met him and my mom met him. And I remember just his energy field being so, you know, it's of a different character because he's occupying the space that he knows no one else is occupying in the world, right? Yeah. So when he's walking down the street, he's he's he's like kind of on another cloud, basically. And he's like, there's something about that zone where you occupy it and then move on to the next phase of your life. Like he's golfing now sipping some whiskey and some kid comes up and says, dude, you know, game seven, 1991, blah, blah, blah. And he's just like, I don't remember that. Like, what happened? And he's like, you don't remember you like did the one block, you ran down, you did the alley. And he's like, no, that's how I feel. I don't fucking remember anything anymore. You know, like, right, I did so many. I've had so many nights, so many, so many drunken nights on stage. I have no idea what the fuck really happened because it's all a fucking blur. I mean, I know that in the moment when I was thinking on stage made sense to me as a caged animal. But like, I don't know what some kids saw, you know, I have no fucking idea. And I'm now disconnected from that field, that emotional field. So I don't claim it. It's not, you know. So I feel like when Michael Jordan sees that that picture of him dunking or the silhouette, he's like, when was that? What was that? Who is that? He doesn't know, he doesn't recognize himself just like you're talking about when the out of body experience, right? Yeah. Yeah. And then, but then do you feel some impetus to act excited when someone is, you know, coming up to you to, you know, profess some, you know, I don't know, some ecstatic moment they had during a show that you can't, you don't even remember that year. I mean, that happened in Tasmania. There was like a group of kids that that were waiting outside our hotel. And I pulled up in the cab and they were pretty slick. They couldn't get into our hotel because there was a security guard and a locked glass sliding door. And they just popped in grabbed our bases and walked in like they were our roadies. Whoa. Yeah. And then they just went straight to the bar and I was like drinking a drink later on and they came up and wanted to talk about drums and things that I don't generally think about. Like I don't really think about playing drums. It's not something I practice or anything. I'm usually thinking about something, you know, something philosophical or something else, you know. Yeah. And so they wanted to talk to me about something like that. But in that moment, I'm sitting there with these human beings and something inside me knows that this is actually the performance. This me talking to them now. You know what I mean? It's not like it's not like they're talking about the show earlier, but that's gone. I mean, that's just so long ago. And like now I have a chance to influence maybe the way this person thinks because maybe I can hear in his voice that he's like so focused on this or that in that or this. And it's like, no, we're here right now. And like, I'll get really animated. Like I'm not necessarily like you're saying like really excited about what someone's saying just to meet them halfway. But like, I'll just I'll just start talking shit. And I was like, you know, if I've had a couple drinks, I will talk shit. And I guess later they posted that they had like dropped our bases accidentally on the Instagram. They like when they were getting in. It's really funny. They were super frickin sweet. I really liked these kids and they they had they had posted that I was surprisingly testy. Oh, Jesus. But but no, no, no, in a cool way, though. I had the way I read it was fuck. Yeah, like they encountered a punk. You know what I mean? Like they they went up to talk to someone and say, you know, I really liked this drumming performance on this date or whatever. And then what they got in return was like someone in real time that wanted to really be present with them and talk some shit. And like, dude, if if people would have done that with me when I was like looking up to it to them, I would be so fucking stoked that they were like alive and like real and mutual and like present. And like, it's like, it's like when you treat a child like like that, you know, like they're completely 100% interesting and like and valuable. And like, I think that really like that empowers them. Do you know what I mean? Man, I listen, I think it's just shows how cool you are. Because like, I, I, you know, I just, I think just there is something so lame about essentially doing a Yelp. Yeah. About I wouldn't, you know, because the thing like, OK, like, if I have like, if I'm with one, like, let's say you and I are hanging out one night. And then the next day you look and like, Duncan, why did you tweet that I was testy last night? I'm like, oh, you know, I'm a fan of you. I just thought I'd just let the whole world know that you were testy last night because I'm a fan. You know what I mean? So I think that I think your take on it's cool. But but the other thing I love is that you're not falling for something that I think a lot of people fall for. And it's like, it's so hard not to, which is like, there's, there's an implicit invitation to really put on a show. You know what I mean? To like try to like put out something that you're not at all. And because you're like, I don't want to disappoint this person. Like this person has imbued me with some kind of amazing thing. And I want to, I would love to be that, you know, but I'm just not. So if I, but, but it, but it's, but I could try to be that to this person. You know, and then the moment you do that, you might as well just fucking move to like become a branch Davidian. You know what I mean? Start talking about opening seals and shit. All I'm saying is it's cool that you like, we're like, man, I had this, I had someone come up to me a while ago, like at a grocery store. And like, I was ironically wearing a fucking Illuminati ring that I'd found at a thrift store. And the guy recognized me and he looks at the ring and he points to his shirt. It's got like a pentagram on and he's like, you know, I do magic too. And I'm like, no, you don't, this doesn't, I'm realizing I got to sit here and explain to this person that like this ring looks so dumb to me. And that I bought it because Aaron and I were going to some place to add a dress code and I wanted to make fun of it by having an Illuminati ring on and some pathetic attempt to fight the power. And like, and then, but you know what I mean? Like, I had to like, I had to like, it was an awful wrestling match where I was essentially having to tell this person like, look, man, I'm just, I'm just, I'm not, I'm at the grocery store. I'm getting some coffee. I've got a kid. I'm not, I don't really, I'm not in the Illuminati. I don't have the secrets that you're hoping I have, but I want to be the person who has the secrets. You know, like that'd be fucking cool. Like I wish I had a magic bag I could reach in. And so it's kind of like, to me that like, if you, if you manage to maintain some, some honesty or authenticity with someone who would really love it if you were their fantasy of you. And then they have the audacity to go bitch about that. You know what I mean? That's really lame. Yeah, I think we have a couple things going for us. But I mean, as I always mentioned, I think, I think that we, you know, failed as one word, but, but failed for so long or did what we did for so long that like, it's hard for me to believe anybody really cares anyway. I don't think you failed. I don't think I failed. Why do you think you failed? Well, I'm saying it from the perspective of like the normal good capitalist out there, like that I was outside of the marketplace. You know what I mean? So what I mean is that I did what I did for me for so long that one day I may have told you the story. I was like in a cheese shop in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and I'm got my headphones on. I'm listening to a new like song. I'm trying to like review some of the mixing mistakes I've made and I'm looking at the cheese. It's like really expensive. And it's this place called Foster Sundry. It's actually really good. Really good. And I like look to my right and there's a couple and they're like looking at me and they're kind of waiting for me to take my headphones off. Like, because I'm in this world, you know, I don't, I can't hear anything. I don't know if there's like an ambulance there or what's going on. And I kind of slowly take off my headphones and they go, we're big fans. And I said of cheese because for me, I was like buying cheese, you know, I'm like me too. I'm a huge cheese guy, you know, or whatever. My point is it would it never occurs to me that someone likes me because I'm in my world. I've been in my world for so fucking long. I think that that really helps the way that I stay in that zone. Yes, right. Because I don't really acknowledge it. Good God. Yeah. I mean, down that path, that's such a satanic path to go down man. I mean, that's like Jesus. I mean, it's, you know what, I will take someone who's just like all of a sudden starts producing garbage for whatever reason. Any day over someone who is like, you just realize that's all they've got left. Thank you Amazon Music for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

Thank you, Amazon. You know, man, I had this experience once where I will not name names. This person was very famous at one point. They have since left this. They're not even alive anymore. But this, I got, you know, this is like, I probably already talked about it. I don't want to say their name. It's not going to speak ill of the dead. You get to Hollywood, you get to LA and you will get sucked into the most bizarre like situation, bizarre situations. Because you don't know it. You don't know any better. You know, unless you were like raised in an entertainment family or maybe you went to like Julliard or some shit. You don't know. You know, it's easy to miss like the basics of like, well, probably you're going to have to work for like 15 years to get good at this. Because it's an incredibly competitive industry. You're not just going to like suddenly have like some amazing job out of the blue. Probably. But anyway, like, so you end up taking like these weird opportunities show up where someone will be like, hey, man, blah, blah, blah is working on a pilot, this pilot script. And, you know, I was looking for some comedians to help them, right? And you're thinking to yourself like, well, I've done five open mics, maybe this is my big break. So then you end up, you know, I remember ending up, I'm sorry if I've already said this person's name and I'm not going to say it now that I ended up, you end up at this guys. I remember ending up at this guys, like up in the Hollywood Hills and this beautiful house. And at the time, I didn't know what fucking like, like foreclosed means. You know, like, so someone mentioned their houses or something's happening with foreclosure. And I don't even know what they mean. I'm just happy to be up there. I'm like, all right, let's, this is it. I finally did it. You know, I'm working on a TV pilot. And then like, I remember riding around the Hollywood Hills with this guy used to be so famous, man. And he's like smoking these fucking herbal cigarettes that smells so bad and I'm so carsick. And he's making me read some Bible scripture. It's weird as shit. We're going because he's got to go to a dentist appointment, right? And so he got up somehow and ended up going with him to the dentist appointment. Then he brings with him out of this car headshots, right? Goes into the dentist. He's giving his headshots to people, but people don't remember who he is anymore. You know, they're like humoring him like, Oh, thanks. It's just the saddest shit I've ever seen, man. And it was an example of the opposite. You know, like that there was no more creative output happening. I mean, and if there was, it was like impot tragically, like nothing was there. But all that was left was like handing out headshots. You know, that was like, it was like a zombie or something, you know, like echoing the life where people used to be like, let me have your headshot. To me that, I don't know of a more horrific way to finish out your life. You know, I'd much rather be at a cheese store with headphones on thinking they're talking about cheese. You know, I remember it in preschool. I bet you have a version of this, but I remember realizing the moment I realized that other kids might actually just be lying to you all the time. And like, I was so, I guess, kind of innocent that I, you know, I always want to believe somebody first and then dissect it later when there's a lot of situations in life. You should probably just not believe people first. You know what I mean? And so I remember sitting there in the playground preschool and just saying, did you get that new G.I. Joe helicopter? You know, the one like the snow blaster and like watching kids be like, yeah, I've got it. And I'm making up. I'm just making up toy after toy. Just inventing toys. Yeah, I got that. Yeah, I got that. And I remember just being like, fuck, this is the world. Wow. Like in a nutshell. Yeah. But the funny thing is I never really like truly digested and sort of applied that logic. I walked through life letting people lie to me constantly and believing them because I think I thought that, you know, maybe I don't really know. I know that one time I know that when as a child I was extremely generous and I would get toys from my parents and I'd give them away. I'd bring them to school and I'd give them away. And I know something happened later where I got spiteful and possessive because apparently I was swimming in some somebody's pool and I saw one of the toys. I'd given them a few years later, sunken in the bottom of the pool and I like swam down and like stole it back. Like I was like, that's that's mine. Like I changed. Wow. I don't know like what bittered me, but like I think that you start to notice a pattern even in preschool that like the people who present the best, the people who present like victorious elements about themselves are always generally never the real thing. And it's the quiet kids that are working hard and like trying to like become good at something or whatever that will later, you know, lead culture or whatever. But there's a type of kid that can bamboozle you and totally deceive you through most of your life. And some of them even kind of mean well, but they're really loud about their accomplishments. Yes. There's yeah, there's something about those kids that really throw off an underdog because you believe them. You listen to them and you really believe, you know, it's so fucking sad to me. You do. You buy fall for a hook line in secret. You just listen. You go along. You get excited for them. You don't even consider like you were basically you, you were hanging out with a died in the wool psychic fucking vampire who's just spinning webs of bullshit and you're stuck in it like some kind of sad, stinky fly lost in their web of fucking nonsense. As they go on and on about this or that shit that they did. It's all but it. Okay. Hold on now here. I'm going to offer some defense of the fucking shit spiders. Okay. Now, when we think about lying, we're imagining that, you know, there's the obvious lie, which is like, you know, you tell somebody. Yeah. Yeah. Yesterday, I bought a sports car and you didn't obvious stupid. So is your path crazy person lie. That's the best kind of lying right there. Just complete. Like if you just check in on them, it's completely provable and they just go for it anyway because they cannot stop themselves. Yes. That's that is an amazing lie. It's definitely. I remember when I was at summer camp, realizing that this kid who is telling me what about his life. I started realizing he was telling me like the story of a movie that I'd seen recently and just saying that was him and being, and it was pretty fucking weird. But the, then there's the other kind of lie, which I don't know if this does it categorize as a lie to misremember. You know what I mean? So it's like you. Okay. I had just, I finally took Aaron to Hendersonville where I grew up and we have since we came here to Asheville, we haven't gone there. And in my mind, I picture it is this a certain way when I was younger and like there's like the music store where I got the violin when I was in the third grade. You know what I mean? And we go there and I was like thinking like, all right, she's about to see this like really quaint, you know, beautiful quaint little, little town. But it's like, I remember it when it was younger, you know, but I don't, but now like cause of COVID and things are a little fucking weird out everywhere, man. So like, I'm just looking at this place and realizing like, oh my God, this is not the place that I remember is gone. And all this shit I've been telling her about this place. I don't even know how much of it's real. How much of it did I just like in the fog of memory and with the propensity to try to warp things to the romantic? You know what I mean? How much did I distort this place in my own mind into something? It just isn't at all. Do you know what I mean? So there's that kind of lying to where someone's going on and on and on about their accomplishments. And it's not like they're intentionally deceptive. It's just their bio computer is warping reality to, you know what I'm saying? That's fascinating. Yeah. Yeah. It's fucking creepy, man, because you don't, you don't like when you really start looking back at all the stories that you tell and all the things you think you remember. And then you realize like shit, man, I think I've been like basically doing some kind of like paint job on these things. You know what I mean? Have you ever played the troubadour? No, I never played the troubadour. Okay. I went there. I only went there once. I can't remember where I saw. It was a good show, though. There's, he's a story of a great and famous liar. Okay. So the troubadour, you know, it's where John Lennon had his lost weekend. It's where the Eagles formed. It's where basically folk rock was essentially invented. Hold on. I saw Lou Barlow there. I had a feeling you were going to say that. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. So when Dylan is basically just a folk musician and when the Beatles are basically considered children's music, there was this weird, weird void in between them, right? Where there was just Dylan and then there was the Beatles and then there was everyone else, right? Right. So 1964, turning into 1965, there was a boy band that was fake and was being built by this guy, Jim Dixon, in LA. And he basically took kind of this super group of hipsters that weren't necessarily professionally able to play music. The drummer couldn't even play. He just was really hot. He actually had never played drums, really. He was playing cardboard boxes to fake it. What? Yeah. And so this band goes in the studio and this guy, Jim Dixon, happens to know Bob Dylan and says, do you have any songs? Just give me some extra songs that you might have not put out. I want to see if I can put this band together. And Dylan hands them off, Mr. Tambourine Man. That had not come out yet. So this guy, Jim Dixon, is wise. He comes into the studio. He says, okay, boys, we're going to try this song. None of them like it. One of them hates it and says, I will not play this song. This is garbage. And actually completely rejects it. Wow. He forces them to figure out how to play it. He forces them to change the way that they play and think. And he brings in professional players, Hal Blaine, the Wrecking Crew, and he builds a production. And that production is 100% fake. And that production invented folk rock and everything I do. That fucking production was the birds. And that little boy that said Dylan sucked was David Crosby. Holy fucking shit. That's crazy. So here's the moral to my tale is that they were playing the Troubadour and no one liked it. No one liked it. No one liked any of the three guys like McGuinn, Clark, or Crosby. Nobody thought what they were doing was interesting because it was too Beatles-y and not academic enough yet. So Jim Dixon realized we need some Bob Dylan songs. And he put the two things together. The producer built it. So they go over to the Troubadour and they try to play it in front of everybody. They can't even really play very well. They are bad. And David Crosby doesn't have a guitar. He's just standing on stage and he's a small fat man. And he is... This is crazy, man. Yeah, yeah. This is like 65, the very beginning of 65. And he puts on a black turtleneck and he tries to look like the Beatles. And he shakes around and swings a tambourine. And the entire audience pointed at him and laughed him off stage. He had to stop. What? Yeah. So this is... That's fucking crazy. This is the moral to my tale. When David Crosby goes home and he's this little fat man with his black turtleneck on, he's like, I failed. I'm not real. No one likes any of this. He actually said they don't believe me. I don't have the thing. He was the son of a cinematographer. He was nobody. And so when he goes home and he looks in the mirror at himself and he thinks about, what can I do to change the world? He doesn't pick up a guitar and write a good song, because he's not the real thing. What he does is he goes into practice the next day and he convinces Gene Clark that he can't play guitar. He starts working on Gene Clark, destroying him internally. He starts destroying the confidence of the main guy in the band that is essentially their Bob Dylan. Why does he do it? Because he was pudgy in this tight turtleneck, so he realizes if he hides his belly with a guitar, that he'll look better on stage. And he works on Gene Clark for months saying, Doesn't he just work on fucking running? Or write a good song or something. Or eating salad. Yeah. No, that's not what he does. He dismantles Gene Clark's confidence to the point that Gene Clark leaves the band by the end of the year. Oh my God. And Gene Clark is one of the greatest songwriters of all time, and arguably the inventor of Folk Rock, arguably he is Bob Dylan's favorite songwriter at the time, and David Crosby destroys him until he leaves the band. If you watch any of their film performances on TV or anything, Gene Clark has a tambourine. That's because David Crosby gave it to him and said, I'm the guitarist now. You're the tambourine player. Wow. And he stole my dad's friend's cape. He reinvented his whole vibe to suit the times, and he decided that Bob Dylan was great suddenly. He changed his entire persona. Wait, what do you mean he stole your what? My dad was best friends with Crosby for a while. No fucking shit. Yeah, so the reason why you can trust me on this is like, I don't really like that guy. But like, I'm not saying, you know, I'm not saying my dad was friends with him in any boastful way. I'm saying this guy is a liar, you know. Wow. But as a Gene Clark fan, as somebody who really cares about the form, like, that's the kind of temperament we are talking about. We are talking about a type of kid on the preschool fucking playground that is more into destroying their friends to win instead of just making something great and improving the fucking world around them. God damn, man. Yeah, those people are out there and we forget it. It's so easy to forget it. It's so easy to forget it. You don't want to live in that world. Well, I mean, that's the, that is the subsection of winter culture in itself, probably like the people that carve that space for themselves tend to win for like a very specific amount of time. Often like most of their lifetime and then we all die and then people kind of pull out of the rubble the real shit later. Right. Good Lord. That's so good. It's like, you know, you run into some kids and they're just naturally like lying, malefic, monstrous beings. And then you have this idea of like, well, you know, they're going through a rough spot. You know, it's a nine year old or a six year old. It'll get better. Like, when you have a kid, one of the things you start realizing is there's a hilarious hierarchy when it comes to age. So like four year olds, I can't remember. It's like somewhere around four four year olds are just not into two year olds. So they'll be so condescending to a two year old. You know, so if you're at the playground, like I've been at the playground for us in a four year old, like a group of four year olds will see him and go, look at the baby. You're like, you're fucking four. Okay. You don't know anything. Like you were just this baby, but they're so condescending. But then you, but it's no different from the condescension you get from people like that. It's no different from the adult condescension. When someone's looking down their nose at this thing or that thing, it's just a little more camouflage because they could say they've got all these imaginary metals they've stuck to themselves. And so they feel like now they have a right to be like, you know, aggressive and poisonous with people. Jesus, emo. That story is fucking crazy, man. Then the thing about being somebody's friend, like actual friends on the playground and preschool or now whatever is that you have nothing to hide from them really. And you get that sense of comfort. You can relax. You know, like when me and you are sitting in your house or something, there's never like an awkward moment. You know what I mean? It's like we like we're so, um, I don't know. For some reason we don't, we don't feel the need to perform for each other. Right. And that's, that's where the suspicion lies. I can remember like 2006, you know, or or so sitting in my kitchen on the phone and listening to one of my friends list off all the things that we're going right for him like that month. And I remember just sitting there and just listening. Yeah. And you know, what am I supposed to say? Yeah. Okay. Damn. Wow. Well, okay. Oh, well, that's great. That's great. What can I give back to that person? And then inside of congratulating them, you start to feel kind of bad for them because you think, why the fuck are you doing this, man? Like who would call their friend, their actual friend and like advertise for their greatness to them? Like that. It's like a moment. It's a red flag where you realize maybe we're not friends. Maybe like, or is this person like diagnosable? There's something wrong here, you know, and I remember a few years later when things finally started working out for me in the sense that I could make a record and it would come out. That's all just it would fucking come out, you know. Yeah. And I remember he had stopped making music altogether. Just stop making music altogether. The internal thing wasn't even important to him. Do you know what I mean? Oh, yeah. So that going back to the opening bit of our conversation and you asked me like, what is that place that you go to? How do you know it's real? When do you know to trust yourself? It's like you define that for yourself and that kid abandoned that pursuit. He didn't even he wasn't even interested really. Right. And so anyway, there've been all these sort of along the way these milestones of my life where, you know, the universe or whatever sort of says, see, you know, you were you were right. Just do what you do. Be yourself. You know, and it's not like it's not like I've experienced some great grand revenge day that in fifth grade I constantly dreamed about. I would have these daydreams. Did you have the daydream? I know I've asked you this before. It was the daydream where the whole school like red dawn got attacked and you you picked up the pretty girl and carried her out of the building. No, but I like, you know, I would watch, you know, I would like mentally take notes watching like the end of Carrie. What do you mean? What does that mean? It's like that. Come on. One of the reasons Carrie is so fucking awesome is you've got this bullied girl who like, you know, burns, who like gets like ultra like telekinetic revenge. There's some comedy summer camp movie. I can't remember which one that actually like emphasizes this. Like, you know, like, like, I don't, it's the, you know, if you're innocent, if you are talking in elementary school or junior high school or whatever, if you're getting the shit kicked out of you, you're getting bullied. You just drew like, you just see a movie like scanners where they, you can make someone's head explode with your mind and you're like, Oh, if only I could fucking do that, you know, if only I could make a pin like zing through the with my mind, you know, like in pale someone or something like that, you know, like, this is why people like those kinds of movies, any kind of any kind of movie that involved. Yeah. So I think I had my own like mild revenge fantasies. I'm making myself sound a lot more murderous than I was, but it's not. I mean, I feel like anyone who's been bullied when they watch the like final scene in Carrie, they're not like weeping for the people who are like getting like payback, the people who dump pigs blood on her, you know. I know I got this image of you at age 10, very like discipline, you know, jotting down notes, watching the film, never, never betray a witch, you know, like literally like taking it really literal. I'm like, if you want to dump the pigs blood, you'll need a ladder. Oh my God, evil. That's hilarious. Well, you know, I think that we have like, I think I want to ask you to clarify this for me. It feels like what you're saying is what's going to carry you through is that the art form that you're engaging in, it's what it's what you do. It's like, it's this is what you do. You know, it's like you're making this, we make stuff, you make stuff and you're either and whatever that feeling is, it's probably different for everybody. Maybe some people experience some kind of incredible exhilarating ecstasy all the time. Maybe some people don't. But the difference between those people and like your friend who just quit is like, he didn't need to do it, which is why I quit. Right? Like there was no need there. He started down the path because the idea was the art was going to be this bridge between him having success and him not having success. Right? It wasn't, that's all it was. It wasn't the path. It was a bridge, a connect, a connector, and that's the stupidest bridge anyone could ever, like that's a dumb bridge to connect you to success if you're not really interested in it. Like he was, I, you know, like when, when, when I'm sure when you sit down and start working on stuff, some days you maybe be, you might not be like what you would call like hyper excited about it. Cause sometimes it is work, but you know, for, for me, there's always like this magical feeling, you know, where I look at my computer or look at my synths or look at the microphone or you know how to be to just get this weird quivery feeling, you know, like, ah, here we go. And, and I love that feeling. I love that feeling so much that, um, you know what I mean? Like that's, that's something I'll never in my, my whole life. I'll always have to have that in my life. No matter what, is that what you're talking? That's what you're talking about, right? It's like, that's it. Like that's versus you just don't like it. Whatever the fucking thing is you're doing, you check in with yourself and like, I fucking hate doing this, but I'm wanting some result from it. Is that what you mean? Yeah. I think, I think that, um, it's beyond possible, meaning that it's just, it probably is true that when I was watching Lou Barlow up there, viscerate himself, there was probably a kid to the left of me and a kid to the right of me. One was being inspired because they were like, this culture is so awesome. Like I'm part of this culture and the kid on the right of me was like, this band is so successful and like, I want to do something like that too. Yeah. But I was between them going, I am learning something about the highest level of experience that of existence itself. You know, I'm learning about the highest tier of experience of like being fucking completely, you know, going to that place that you dream as a kid, you will go to whether it's like the shredding, you know, moment where Eddie Van Halen like lights the speakers on fire or it's like, it's this ultimate place, the place that, you know, when you join the Hare Krishna as you're hoping to go to the ultimate place, you know, and the kid on the left of me was like, man, like this culture is so beautiful and interesting. And I met a cool girl at the show. And it's like, they're celebrating something else to me that was a couple rungs down of a subcategory of existence itself. They were they were interested in something that was born of the highest tier, right. And then the other kid on the right is like, this product is great. I'd like to make a product someday. You know what I mean? Yeah. So I'm not saying that, you know, I chose a better way, but it was a pure way that will guarantee you a life of, you know, aloneness in a way. It's not going to guarantee you any success on the right. It's not going to guarantee you being included in the culture. But it is a it's the path that once you do die, they probably do recognize that path more, you know, because they're like, oh, that's applicable. That is actually a universal thing. This person is in the zone. They're speaking to us from the zone, you know, I'm not saying that's a good thing. It's in a lot of ways. It's completely unapplicable what during your lifetime, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I'm trying to answer your question from the beginning, which I think is a good question like, how do you know when you're not lying in a way? Yeah. But at the same time, I think that some of the toxic feelings that you experience are also important. So I don't necessarily think that you should edit yourself too quickly, because then that's airing on the side of over presentation. So right, you know, that that part of myself in sixth grade, specifically sixth grade, falling asleep at night, dreaming of that kind of karate kid ending, that thing where you take out the villain and the whole school just starts cheering and you make a speech at the podium. Yeah. And all that shit. I mean, that's a sick fantasy. That's the fantasy of somebody who wants a kind of attention or love that is probably not really realistic. And yet at the same time, that lust for celebrating, you know, the great part of yourself or whatever you imagine is probably a big part of what propels you and maybe gets you to the other side sometimes into really expressing something real, you know. Yeah, it's not it's not necessarily a sign that you're off because you're imagining like you're fantasizing that you're in like that cheesy metal ceremony at the end of Star Wars. I mean, that was the time that you and I grew up, you know, like that was just that fucking top gun high five thing and all that, you know, the metal ceremony and like all that fucking shit. Like wait, was that the end of Star Wars or Empire Strikes Back? So I don't get a bunch of people like it's Empire Strikes Back with the metal ceremony. I don't even know if it was Return of the Jedi. I can't remember. But I remember what you're talking about. It's the classical music as you're walking slowly up to be like they put a metal on Chewbacca. I mean, it's even more actually it's better realized in the King of Comedy, which I mentioned every time I'm talking to anyone because Robert De Niro has a fever dream that he's being congratulated in front of the whole world basically in the same kind of ceremony up on some steps in the same kind. It looks like a wedding. Yeah. And it's like his high school teacher and he's like on behalf of the teachers, the students, everyone that's ever known you, we apologize for not understanding your brilliance. You know what I mean? It's like it's like one of the greatest scenes in a film of all time because you see the narcissism, the fiery boiling narcissism down inside of all of us because we actually we actually legitimately think that might happen someday that there will be an apology ceremony from the world to us. Oh my God. Oh my God. You know what? That sounds so scary. Like when you die, you like come to and you're like, it's like God is apologizing to you like, oh, but you don't understand I am. You know, all your intuition about something like your life being like fucked up and you were trying to like be an optimist, you know, you're I fucked up with you. Like it was my first real mistake and I'm so sorry. Like you had a horrible life. Like God is saying like the day I designed you was one of my finest moments and everyone around you, the entire earth, I fucked up royally and I don't know. I wasn't you. It was everyone else. The inner dream. That is so fucking funny. Like, oh, look, see, look, I make trillions of universes all the time. I in general, I create a universe that perfectly corresponds with the desires, needs and hopes of the person I place in the universe. But I put you in someone else's universe. I'm so sorry. Your universe that you lived your whole life and was designed for like a complete dick. And wow. Yeah, I fucked up. Everyone. You're listening to God in your face is just mm-hmm. I knew you would say this. I knew you would appear someday. It's like the ugliest possible side of yourself that never goes away. It's always there until the day you die. I mean, I feel like some people as they age, it actually comes out more, you know. Oh, well, I mean, yeah, that's like the angry dying person. I mean, like some people on their deathbed, they're fucking pissed, man. They're pissed. They're like up to until they like breathe their last breath or their hat. They have like plotting. You know, what is it they want? What is it they want on their deathbed? Revenge. They want fucking revenge. Some people really want revenge. Like they, they're not going to feel better until like the people that they think have hurt them are like bleeding out. And it's sad because, you know, it's like you're God, man. It's like, you know, I read this like, I think it was a post on Reddit and someone's really annoyed because their high school bully had like reached out to apologize to them. And they were like, fuck you. Like don't bring like, I don't want to deal with you. You know what I mean? Like I'm not, I'm not interested in having to deal with you anymore. But it's like, I guess the reason it's a sad thing because think of, think of like the people who have hurt you, but in the distant past, right? Like how they fade out in your mind, you know, like, and probably there's so many people that have hurt us and we don't even remember them. Like we've just literally forgotten them and whether they like intentionally hurt us or whatever. And but all I'm saying is like some people, they can't let go of that. Then and they have like their entire life is spent in a state of never ending contemplation of these people that have fucked them over. And it follows them all the way until they fucking die. You know, it's a really pathetic way to go, man. You know, I mean, like it's like what also what happens after the medal ceremony? You know, like what do you do after you get the apologies? Like it's that the next day after that, what are you going to do now? Everyone apologized to you at you. You got your revenge. And then the next day, what do you do? Yeah, the kid that won the Olympics for skateboarding is just such an incredible kid, really humble, beautiful Japanese kid, probably honestly, somehow the person that won the gold medal the best in the world at this moment, like there was justice to it. It was such a beautiful thing. But then the last few days, like every day, he just posts a picture of the medal or the medal ceremony. And and you're like, God, it sucks because like he accomplished the highest thing in a sense. And yet these posts are kind of getting old. Like how many posts do you get? Yeah, how many times are you going to post that fucking medal? We get it. You got to go metal. Now move on with your life. Yeah. I mean, God comes down and actually rewards you in front of the entire human community. And then the next day, people are like, yo, dude, that's like the new cycle has moved on, bro. Because this is the satanic gift we're given by like those movies is they present this like insane utopia, which is that these beings existence literally stops at the peak experience of their lives. The movie ends. Yeah, man. You got to do the next day and then the next day and the fucking next day. And pretty soon people are going to get sick of you bringing up your fucking God apology. You know, it's like, oh boy, here he goes about the time God apologized to him. It's such an incredible like brain chemistry trick that the credit roll does to you, especially with those 80s films when we were growing up. Like the way like that, that at the end of the back to the future, like it's a genius. The whole movie is genius, but like the end of it, the way they like pull you right into the second film because Dot comes back and he's like, he's like got a whole new DeLorean and you're like, holy shit, you get all it like uplifts you at the end. And then the credit says, like, don't take money, you know, it's like, yeah, it's like the sense hit and Huey Lewis is rocking and the saxophones are jamming. And you're like, you're in this sort of illusory permanent state where you're like, that's life, like winning feels like this forever. It's this infinite frozen reality where the credits are rolling and you're walking out of the theater and you have this sort of sense that this reality sustains. You know what I mean? You even when you walk down the street, you know, as a kid, you're like full of that feeling and you feel like you're in the movie, like no matter what kind of movie it is. If it was a serial killer, you kind of start looking behind your car a little bit, you know, or like in the bushes. It's like you get tricked into this sense that like, yo, this shit is real. Like I'm the karate kid, bro. Yeah, man. Yeah, that's it. It's almost like there's a transference, an illusory transference that happens. You leave the theater with some very fleeting sense of victory. And then soon you realize like, oh, I'm not one of the fucking goonies. Like, that's none of that's real. You know, you think about like you win the Emmy or whatever, right? And you get your fucking statue. You know, also what I've heard about the Emmys, it's funny. I could be wrong about this is that there's only like one stat, a few statues that actually, that for the main winner who gets the statue and other people who get the Emmy, they have to pay for their own Emmy. Like they pay for the statue. You know what I mean? They have to buy it. But like, but okay, so you get your fucking statue. You did your Emmy and you did the speech and you cried. You thanked your mom and your wife and your team. And then, then you're like, you got your Emmy and then you go have some drinks. Everyone's like, you got the Emmy. But at some point you're going to go, like you're going to, your driver's going to pick you up and you're going to put the Emmy like in the seat or something. And then you don't, don't people famously just like throw it in a laundry hamper and never see it again. Exactly dude. You just like fucking toss it in a fucking garage. And then you, and then it just fit. That's the thing, man. These bullshit peak experience, these like commercialized peak experiences, they're all lies. You know what I mean? It's not, it's like complete, these book, the chapters don't even fucking exist. The bookmarks don't exist. The endpoints don't exist. It just keeps, it just goes on and on and like, you have to display some form of exuberance, I guess, during those moments where you seem like a fucking, you seem like insane, you know? Or hacky. Because the other side of it is people who get the awards that this doesn't mean anything. Like no shit, edgelord. Yeah, that I, you didn't mean to like influence me forever, but last time we had dinner, I think about it all the fucking time. You just all, you just said the simple thing about how in comedy, there's this saying that you're only as good as your last set. Yeah. Think about it every day. I think about it every fucking day because, because the Emmy or whatever is kind of the enemy. It's kind of the thing I don't want, right? Because every time you walk past it on your mantle, you just think that was the highlight. That was it. That was the peak. And it like haunts you because you're like, I don't even relate to that thing, you know? Because my next set has to be my best set. Yep. And so that thing sitting there is kind of actually like a problem. Like put that shit away, you know what I mean? Dishonet. This is what Joachim Trump has said about any great like epiphanous meditation experience. Dishonet. Dishonet. Forget it. Throw that shit in the fucking, throw it in your throat where you keep all your old frisbees and the golf clubs you bought that you don't use. Just toss it back there and shut the fucking door and forget about it. Because it's just, that's all gone anyway. Don't, what's more, I'm sorry man, but like there's something legitimately creepy about trophy rooms. You know what I'm talking about? Like that shit's creepy. When you're going to look for to buy a house that year, man, there was like more than a few houses that had like a really prominent trophy display. You're like, what the fuck are you doing? You're building an altar to yourself? They're like, your guests have to, what do you want? How do you react to someone's trophies? Like what's the healthy way to see someone? Were you supposed to like say, wow, you got a lot of trophies? I mean, it also reminds me unfortunately of like really disappointing sex. Because you know when entering that experience that like in theory this could be one of the greatest feelings that the universe has to offer. Yeah. And like you don't know why your brain is disassociating or not present enough. But there's nothing you can do about it. There is nothing you can do. It can be someone that you're genuinely wildly attracted to. But there's no words that come to mind. Nothing that can explain the fact that you're just not in the zone at that moment. There's just nothing. Yeah. And all you know is that this great thing is being squandered and insulted. And this great experience is not going to happen is escaping you, you know? Yeah. So I think that things like the Emmys or whatever, anything like that, you know, whether people talk about, you know, meeting their heroes or whatever. And just like the big moment, the big guitar solo, that is one of the saddest things is that when you realize that that in itself ended up not being so great, you know? And that hurts the most because you have that Hollywood theme in your head. You have that whole story, that mythology in your head. And being able to throw away those connotations and those heights and those great experiences, it makes perfect sense to me because you're just comparing things to that all the time. Yeah. I mean, if you're having sex, you're comparing it to the last time you did or the better time or whatever. You know, it's like there's a demand in sex in a fascinating way to be present. You have to be or else you won't enjoy it. Dude, it's like you're crucifying yourself on your fucking trophies. It's so creepy. I mean, it seems like something that, it seems like something ISIS would do. They would like take someone's Emmys and like turn them in and like hang them or like make them eat them. Emo, this was wonderful. Thank you so much, man. I love talking to you. I love catching up with you. Thank you. And I'll have all the links for people to find you at DrTrustle.com. Do you have anything you want to plug? No, I'm trying to finish up all my new solo work and my new podcast and shit. So I don't have anything ready for digestion yet. All right, man. I love you.

Onit.com are purveyors of some amazing supplements, my favorite being AlphaBrain. If you go to onit.com forward slash DTFH, you'll see that they've created a page for me there and they've quoted me as saying AlphaBrain is my favorite onit product. It's like drugs minus the crash. This is not an exact quote. What I actually said is it's like Adderall minus the crash. I love Adderall. As much as I bash it when I'm talking about web designers snorting it, I used it to learn action script and now defunct coding language. I love this stuff but the problem is if I do it for more than a few days straight, my sleep gets wonky, I start feeling crazy, it just doesn't work for me so I don't take it anymore. But AlphaBrain, it reminds me of it a little bit. It's not like the full on I'm going to drive my truck through a goddamn wall to get over the border because I'm hauling plutonium that I robbed from some United States government depository type speed. But it definitely gives you an extra perk that caffeine just doesn't seem to offer. I don't know the science behind it. I don't usually look into that stuff. I think you can find all of that at the Onit website. I know they've done hardcore scientific studies on AlphaBrain. You can examine it yourself. All I can say is that if I have a hangover, if I haven't gotten enough sleep, or if I just need a little bit more focus, I take AlphaBrain and I've been taking this stuff long before I was sponsored by Onit.

If you knew how angry I get over the inaccessibility of the Nintendo Switch, you would instantly disregard anything that I ever had to say because it just is a pure indication of the fact that I need to go find a cabin in the woods, slurp back some high powered mushroom brew and commune with nature for at least 6000 years to overcome whatever demonic energetic block is making me actually annoyed at the fact that I can't get a Nintendo Switch and thus cannot play Breath of the Wild.

Everybody please get your third eyes a glowing, stoke up your pineal hearth and allow some of those sweet mystical sparks of enlightenment to drift on the winds of time to wherever today's guest may currently be standing. Everyone please welcome to the dunkintrustle family hour podcast Robert Ryan. One last thing you'll notice there's like a background drone happening in this. That's my air conditioner, which I turned on to drown out the sound of whatever renovations my neighbors are doing in my apartment underneath mine. It sounds like they're doing some kind of chainsaw carving. Coming in on the floor, man. Robert, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for being here with me today. Man, thank you so much for having me. It's a real honor to be here. Thank you. In the wild way we met in the last live podcast with Aubrey, you came on stage and started oming in the most beautiful way. So I guess the only question that I should ask to start this podcast off is, where'd you learn to ome like that? I've been oming. It's funny to use as a verb, but I've been chanting ome for probably about 20 years and not until maybe the last three years I've really found my, it was a way for me to find my voice. I felt like I was always kind of struggling. I sang for punk bands when I was younger and I enjoyed it and it was a strong expression, but I never really felt like my own voice until I found my voice to ome in that frequency. I was able to really dial into something and maybe dislodge something that was choking me. So yeah, it helped me to like travel to India and chant with people and chant with my teacher here in the States and in India as well. So just being able to kind of dial into someone else's frequency or the frequency of many people doing it in unison was really helped me find my own voice. What do you think it is, the ome? I think the ome is the absolute consciousness. It's the frequency that's been there the entire time and continues and it has no beginner end. It's the vastness. It's tapping into the root of everything that we are, everything that was before us and that will come after us. So not to ask maybe one of the most ridiculous questions I ever asked on this podcast, but do you think that before the Big Bang, the ome existed? Yes, I do. I do. I think the ome might have initiated the Big Bang. So now explain that process to me and not in scientific cosmological terms, but mythological terms because you have a deep grasp of a lot of the world's mythologies and symbols through your work. So what's your theory on that? If the ome started the Big Bang, how did it go down? Well they say the Big Bang happened at a certain point in time, right? I don't know if it happened at a certain point in time or if it happened at the very beginning, right? Or did time proceed the Big Bang? Well even if there was a beginning, they say that the ome has no beginning or end. So it's just a constant frequency. I think it exists in a possibly in all dimensions, it's not just the one that we're living in, not in this earthly dimension where the Big Bang happened in that dimension or in this universe, but the ome is the omniverse. Okay, okay, and it contains within it all sounds, right? All sounds, everything, yeah. So it's kind of just this spectrum of, but it's also, the other thing about it is it's a creative, right? There's a sense that the thing is, like something about it is literally progenitive or something? Yes, almost like the egg, you know, the ome is the egg, everything's contained within the ome, even the Big Bang would be contained within the ome. So let's do, let's hear you do an ome. Ome. Yeah, wow, okay, okay, let's try to do it together because that's what's really, you know, when I was in India up on this rooftop in Dharamsala, I remember seeing, there were these two women up there and they were doing the ome together and like hitting all these frequencies with it and sometimes you could do that, so maybe we could do that. Yeah, I think humans, as humans, we can hit up to maybe three octaves together, you know, even though it's just the two of us doing it, like a low, middle and high. I'm probably gonna regret this because I don't have a great voice, but let's give it a shot. Okay. You start. Ome. Ome. Ome. Ome. Ome. Ome. I'm not good at oming, but. No, you're great, you know, and it's funny because no matter anyone's pitch or frequency or if people do it softer or lighter, eventually when you're oming in unison, it all comes together no matter what, and that's the beauty of it. What is this thing that you're letting me borrow here that we have? It's called a shruti box, and shruti means to sing, so it's really good for singing along with. You know, it's similar to a squeeze box in like the European fashion that they would call the squeeze box in India, they call it a shruti box, and it's basically just a harmonium without the keys, so just a single ome. But it has the ome in it, it's making, it oms, it's like an oming box, basically. The ome machine. Let me grab it real quick. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What was that prayer you just sang? It's a shanti prayer. It's a prayer of peace. It's not to any deity or anything, it's sending out good thoughts, good feelings to the universe. I'm not sure the exact meaning of it offhand, but that's- Where did you learn it? I think I probably learned that one on my own, but I've learned a lot of the mantras and bhajans through my teacher. Your teacher, so I guess I keep, most of us don't know those prayers in the west. Especially, and most of us, me included, we dabble in this stuff, but we certainly haven't taken the grand leap that you have taken into it. You've clearly been transformed by this journey that you've been on for your entire life. When I'm, you know, I feel like I've known you forever, man. It's the strangest thing ever. Well we have known each other forever. We came to that point earlier before we started recording that we probably known each other a couple thousand times in a couple thousand lives. But yeah, I do, you know, like, mantra has always been very meaningful to me, and I first began through ISKCON, much like yourself, hearing the Hare Krishna Maha Mantra, which to me is one of the most beautiful, most powerful ones. I still chant that one all the time. Yeah. It's an amazing mantra. You chant on japa beats? I chant japa, and I'll chant out loud as well. I'm not doing as many rounds as a lot of my friends who are more serious devotees of ISKCON, but I do chant Hare Krishna on japa. That's one of, maybe if there is, and God forgive me, all gods in all points in time, please understand I am a buffoon. But one of the things that bugs me, the one thing that bugs me about that form of japa is that it can be competitive, because you keep track of how many times you've said it, which seems kind of arbitrary, you know? So like, what is Prabhupada, what is the amount of times he said that you're supposed to do it? Well, for a devotee to become initiated, you're to be chanting 16 rounds a day. 16? That number haunts me. To this day, that number haunts me when I drag myself in front of the puja table, I start chanting in my japa beads, and one round feels like a thousand years, and I finish the one round in this dumb, proud way, and I'm still like, well, you have to do that 15 more times, it's like two hours, right? Yeah, but I think that's not your path, you know? If you did one round with sincerity, I think it would be just as powerful and life-altering to someone who's chanting at 16 rounds. Right. I think the most important part, honestly, from everything I've learned and through my personal experiences, is to do it every day, daily practice, which is also very hard to do. I'm guilty of not doing it daily either, but I feel like the best results I've gotten in any kind of small advancements I've made has been from daily practice. So you came to the devotees, how did you meet the devotees? How did that happen? It's a funny story because I got kind of like the Karni Krishna trick, you know, like the one that they would use at the Grateful Dead shows all the time. I was hanging out, I grew up on the Jersey Shore, and I was hanging out on the boardwalk with my friends, and a guy comes up to me, not dressed like a devotee, plain clothes, but he walks up to me and says, you're under arrest for smiling, and he handed me the sticker of Jagannath. And I'm like, all the blood rushed out on my body. I thought I was under arrest, and this narc comes up to me, and then he said, for smiling. And I looked at Jagannath, and I was so happy. And he's smiling. A lot of you probably may not be familiar with the image of Jagannath. It's a smiling face, and it's a deity of Krishna, and it's supposed to be in the mood of when Krishna comes back to Vrindavan. So he's got a huge smile, and his eyes are real wide. And it's just this really beautiful expression, and they say Jagannath is the Lord of the Universe. A lot of people have Jagannath on their cars, and they don't even realize what it is. Yeah, it's amazing. They think it's some kind of Grateful Dead image, or they're just not sure. They don't realize it's this... For those of you who are still wondering what it is, you can Google search it, but it's kind of like... It's very cartoony. Yeah, it was the unmanifested, or the unfinished deity. Like the carver was interrupted in the process of making the deity for this king. But because the carver was using so much devotion, it still took on the personification of Vishnu or Krishna. But it's also where the word juggernaut comes from. It's exactly because when they would do the huge Rathiatra festival, which we see in this country a lot, they have one in New York. Most bigger cities have them. They take Jagannath out of the temple for the day, and bring him out, and let everyone see him. And when the English were in India, when they would have the Rathiatra festival, it would be so far backed up that they thought, they were like, this is a juggernaut, and it just came back to Europe and then manifested here in the States. But you know about people throwing themselves in front of the wheels. Yeah, it's not permitted, but people still do it. And yeah, they think they're going to be liberated, being thrown under, you know, being crushed under the wheels of the great Lord. So that's just, this is like, when you imagine, I think people really lose track of just how primordial and intense things were at one point, which was that these massive floats would be rolling down some dusty Indian road. Mm-hmm, in Puri. In Puri, and people, cultists, you would say, people just completely caught up in the power of this particular manifestation of religion, would hurl themselves under the wheels and be crushed to death. So these floats would be going down these dusty streets, and there would be blood trails behind them from people who had committed suicide in this way. Yeah, it's pretty powerful to think about. Yeah, it's amazing. And I've seen people enraptured in front of deities before, maybe not to that point, maybe because culturally now we're further along and you're not supposed to commit suicide. I've seen people that absorbed in front of deities. I may have been that absorbed in front of deities myself at some time, but maybe not so much to throw myself under the wheels of a giant cart. But it's, yeah, it's powerful to think of. And you're also, like you said, you're thinking back at a different time. Can you talk a little bit about what that feels like to be standing in front of deities completely transfixed by what you're looking at? Yeah. The first time that it really happened to me was actually in Brooklyn at the Iskhan Temple here, the Radhagavinda Temple. And, you know, I was 17 years old. I was kind of a, you know, punky teenager. And I went before the deities for the first time and like they were looking at me. And I was not even a believer at this point. I was just kind of curious. But man, when I sat in front of those deities, it was something changed inside of me and I was transfixed and I'm still, I don't think haunted is the right word, but still inspired by that image. It still comes to me all the time, just how beautiful their faces were. And you know what it was? I think it wasn't so much like, oh, the statue is looking at me. It was the amount of energy that was put into this statue over, you know, many years and so much worship was done to it and the amount of intention that was put into that statue and it's cleaned and dressed and maintained every day. And it's like, it's the spirit of it that inspired me and moved me and, you know, still brings me to tears when I see it. So yeah, it's a powerful feeling. It's kind of hard to explain, you know, because it can happen to you as a complete layman, you know, when you have no experience with it. Happened to me? That's how I got, that's how I can, I mean, that's the, it was a conversion experience. I've never recovered from it. I've never come back from it because it was, and it certainly was like, yeah, I didn't, you know, I was, I was like, out there just having fun, I don't know, you end up in this temple, it's nice, you know, the chanting is cool. But then you look at this thing and then suddenly you realize like, this is a, I'm looking at a UFO here, man. This is like a, this is, that's how my brain translated it. Or extraterrestrial. Yeah. Yeah. You've had that feeling of extraterrestrial. 100%. Yeah. And that's how our brain translates it, is this is such an advanced intelligence and so, so, so far beyond my brain that the, as your, as the player piano that is the human mind desperately like struggles for the sound of what it's experiencing in the form of some linguistic translation, all it can grunt out is aliens. It's true. Yeah. Be aliens. Yeah. I mean, our worlds are so small and like, you know, like I'm coming from this place where, you know, like I was, I was cutting high school to go to the temple, you know, so like it just blew my fucking mind wide open and my heart too, you know, it actually hit the heart first and then the mind later, cause like, why am I experiencing this? Why am I feeling this? You know, like, why do I want to go back so bad? Why do I want to be in front of it? You know? Oh yeah. But yeah, our limited perception and vocabularies. We just tack the first thing onto it like UFO. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And to me, I love, you know, so many people are like, man, I'd really love to be on a spaceship. And what they mean is I would like to be on a human crafted device of travel, but what they don't really want to be on a spaceship. No, they want to be on a simulated experience of a spaceship. Yeah. They don't want to be on like a living, breathing spaceship that can like take them into the next dimension. That docks in temples, you know, and that's how this, because when we think about every single bit of our ability to conceptualize anything is inevitably based on our own experience with vehicles or with devices of like, you know, we think of, you know, like it's a UFO and the movies is just like a really cool looking airplane, right? It's just a version of an airplane, the Starship Enterprise. It's an airplane. It's like, it doesn't have, you know, it's just a crazy looking airplane. They all have these, you know, engines and they're like, and even when the UFO lands from another place, it's an airplane at all because that's how what we've got when we think about how something must go through space, it goes on a, it must go on something that looks like an airplane or an arrow or an arrow head or something that looks, I mean, that's how limited we are as we're like, well, it looks like the symbol that represents going forward. That's what it must look like. But these particular UFOs that land in the temples of the world, they look like deities and the deities look like humans, but when you are in the state of being transfixed, they don't, at least for me, it doesn't look like, it's not a humanoid anymore. It just seems to be more like you're looking at a flower growing out of time that is growing into the temple that's decided to like grow there and it does look at you. It looks right at you. It's looking at you and it's unbearable because it's too much. It's too much and your body will start shaking. Energy will, I don't know if you've ever felt that. Have you ever felt that? Yes, totally. There's one temple that is one of my favorite ones to go to, but it's very common that people go into some sort of possession or, you know, they just start kind of convulsing in front of this deity. It's just so much power there. These are like, these are power centers. These are energy points, you know, and like it's not something we've ever experienced before. And I think a flower is a really good analogy, what you said, because it is being watered and cared for every day and being nurtured and with so much love. And then when it does, when it does fruit, it fruits for the entire community. Yeah. Yeah. And it doesn't really give a shit about like, oh, I don't care what you owe. You're some punk atheist dude. Okay. No, no, I'll still look. I'll still show you this thing. Look. It's still here. This is, you're here. You came in. That means you thought you were ready. So behold, this is something real. This happens. This is real. This is something real. And you thought you knew everything. Totally. You get the smack down. Even when it's with love, you still get the smack down. It's like, you weren't ready for this. And you know, you thought you did know something and you're just going to, you're going to leave with their tail between your legs. Yeah. And for the rest of your life, you're going to think about it and your mind will always go back to it. Your mind will all, and this is like, I mean, I can remember one of the devotees saying to me something like, oh, oh, you've been, because I've been coming to the temple and he looked at me. I remember he's like, oh, it's too potent. You'll never be able to, you'll never get away from it now, you know, and he was right. I mean, cut to, cut to, I don't know, 22 years later, man, I'm still chanting. I still think about the deities. I still think about it, contemplate it. What do you think that, that attraction is, that draw that happens to a person, that feeling of being stuck in a tractor beam? Well, for you, being in front of Krishna, his name is the all attractive. So you just can't get him out of your mind. He's the personification of everything that we're attracted to, you know, and I think that that's how he's known. That's his personality. The ones you were in front of were probably very powerful and it's working, you know, there's not much else I can really explain about it, but there's other deities that I felt differently, you know, different kinds of attractions or different power in front of as well. You know, so like the mood that, that that one was conveying towards you and the feeling that you were feeling in that temple is the expression of all the devotees in that temple, all the rituals that were performed in that temple. Also the guru who founded the temple, you know, Prabhupada came to the United States with nothing and within a few years he had hundreds of temples and started a huge movement. So I mean, say what you will, you know, some people don't disagree with that, that arm of Hinduism or like have, have their differences with the way that, that Gaudiya Vaishnavism is, is taught, but it worked for him and it's continued to work beyond his leave in the body. Well, they think it's dangerous. Yeah. And I mean, it's a very strict version, you know, they think it's a dangerous cult. Yeah. That was my mom's horror is that my brother and I would become, you know, inextricably caught up in ISKCON. And the funny thing about it is she wasn't that far off because the more that you like hang out there and the more that you're around it and the more that you smell it and the more that you eat the food and the more that you realize that this is a way that you can live for your whole life. Like this is a thing you can do. You can shave your head, get a new name and lose yourself in a never ending state of intense theistic rapture over these particular symbols that represent the source of all beauty in the universe. And you could spend your whole life doing that. You could let go and you let go of everything, right? You do let go of your family. You do let go of your job. You do let go of your predilections. You do let go of everything. You let go of your own, what you think makes you so special or what you think makes you so incredibly wonderful. You let go of all of that because who gives a shit? Yeah, it's total ego annihilation, you know, and I think that's what's so threatening to outsiders about it because it's like, oh, they're getting brainwashed. Oh, they're losing themselves. But when the people that are getting involved in these kind of groups, the self that they were practicing as wasn't who they really were in the first place. Right. You know, it was this idea of what the self was. So when people's, you know, especially for like teenagers and young kids and like, of course, with your parents, but your peers as well, when people from the outside start seeing people become spiritual aspirants, it scares them because it threatens their whole way of thinking as well. Like, you know, you got to think like, why are they doing that? Maybe they're right. Oh, yeah. Yeah. What could this be? They're committing the greatest sacrilege of all. They're shaving their heads. What are they doing? They're shaving their personality off of their head. What are they doing? You know, and it's, it is quite horrifying if you're somebody who has put on, because you know, all of us have altars. You don't have to be some spiritual hippie to have an altar. You got an altar at your house, guaranteed. I don't know what it is. Got an Xbox? Yeah. Yeah. Anything, you know? DVD player, stereo, large screen TV, everyone's got an altar. That's right. That's right. Basketball net. Yes. Yeah. And you have an attraction. Mm-hmm. You know, you have a thing that you're into, you know, like something you're drawn to. You like, I don't know, the Grateful Dead maybe, or you're really into Bernie Sanders maybe, or you're completely caught up in the Trump, endless Trump, Trump drama or whatever, on either side of the spectrum. Sure. So you are a devotee. Yeah. It's just the thing that you're devoted to is, I guess you could say further down the river than maybe what some, what, what, it's, it's more of like, I don't want to say degraded because it implies judgment. I don't mean literally like, you're a degraded being. I mean, literally like when you hear a sound from very, very far away, it's degraded. The sound's degraded. And I, isn't this kind of the concept as this entire material universe is a sort of expression of the divine intelligence. And when you get caught up in the external trappings of it, you're hearing a kind of wavery, sort of broken up, static-y version of what you could be purely taking in. Yeah. I've heard it described as you're looking at it through like a dusty window. You know, like you're seeing it, you're seeing the divine, but you're not seeing it as clear as it could be. So you have to clean, clean away the dust. Through a scanner darkly. You know, that's where a scanner darkly came from. No. Through like the concept of Maya? No, it comes from, hold on, I'll read it right now. Hang on, let me grab it real quick. All right. So this concept of like the dusty window, the dusty lantern, okay, this is, this is from Corinthian 13. I'll just read the entire thing because it's, and this is from the King James version. So it's like, oh, like it's like sounds old, which I like. This is my favorite Bible to read when I'm on acid. King James. The more modern versions are like, they're annoying because you just feel like, God, you changed that, you changed it in the worst way possible. The King James version feels more like we are in the time of the black plague. Yes. Yes. Some flickering candles and like. That goes so well with that last day. It's the best. Absolutely. So this is Corinthian 13. Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity, I am becoming as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and have not charity, it profiteth me not. Charity suffereth long and is kind. Now. Okay. Now here's the thing. Charity in the King James version is love. It's love. So let me go back and read this again. I'm going to do mine. I'm just going to go against what I just said. Fuck you, King James. You cunts. It's love, not charity, bitch. Get that fucking rat out of your hair, you old bitty little piece of shit. So it really goes like this, and though I have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith so that I could remove mountains and I have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned and I have not love, it profiteth me nothing. Love suffereth long and is kind. Love envies not. Love vaunteth not itself is not puffed up. Love does not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, and thinketh of no evil. Rejoiceeth not in inequity, but rejoices in the truth. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails, but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail. Whether there be tongues, they shall cease. Whether they be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know only in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. When I was a child, I spoke as a child. I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now, we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known. It's amazing. Yeah. So cool! Yeah. So that's it, you know, we, wherever you're like turning your gaze, it's like looking at like a scrying mirror, I guess you could say. It's like looking at like a dark reflective surface. And you want to know it's really fucking crazy, man. Every time you look at your phone with a power turned off, you're looking into a mirror darkly. You're looking into like a dark mirror. And that's what that verse, that's what black mirror comes from that verse. Totally. And so when we look at technology, which is what a lot of us are fixated on right now, we are seeing a manifestation of Krishna. Only we're seeing it through this like cloudy, diffused, and ultimately faulty perception. And so we, but in yet still there's the experience of awe. Yeah, totally. Even through the dirt, you're still going to get the essence of love. And I think that earlier in that verse, it, it's that's Vedantic, you know, in its truest form, because first you start with the mantras and the deities and the symbols, but eventually even that passes off, you know, you discard that and then you just go full Brahma, you know, the full just effulgence of the universe, the light, you're just with the light, but you need to train yourself through the use of deity, puja, mantra, yoga, breathing, all these things that you bet you're, that's the work. That's the sudden to get to a point where you're able to realize your true self. And I think that it's kind of cool about the yoga because it, you can start with your phone. Totally. You don't have to go to the temple. You can just start by understanding like your phone is way, way, way downstream, right? Way downstream. Simultaneously, nothing's downstream, but the manifestation itself is way downstream. Your technology is way downstream. You're, you're, you're like joy for, for fucking, if you're like a fuck person, a lot of people find it through a fuck boy, a fuck boy, is what I'm saying now. So if you're like a fuck person, I say, I say person because I think, you know, anyone can be really into sex and like, that's one of the ways people worship God and they don't know that they're worshiping God, but you, you, or maybe they do, I don't know, but that's, you can keep going. So you can like end up being like, okay, okay, okay. When I'm coming, oh man, I did that feeling is just so perfect. And then it like dissipates. Actually, sometimes I do think that like, I mean, this is really esoteric and out there and people who aren't like hard Christians are going to be like, what are you talking about? Don't get, but Vrindavan is where Krishna comes from. And sometimes I think orgasm is what it feels like to breathe there or something. And it's like, we get this one little memory of it here and there, like an orgasm is a memory of God and it just dissipates or orgasm is the feeling of being in the presence of the divine and then it dissipates or something like that. Oh yeah, definitely. It's, you know, all the sense pleasures, I believe are aspects of the divine. It's just the temporary aspects of the divine where when you could have the full, you know, the full light, the full love, the full relationship with the divine and as opposed to like these just hints of it, you know, just these like little, little crumbs, why, why not have the whole cake instead? We're like picking crumbs, these orgasm here, nap over here, you know, like a television show over here, you know, new record over here, you know, like when you could have the whole thing all the time, full on full power, you know, because we don't, we don't want it. Right. Like that's kind of the story. Right. It's like, no, I can only right now. This is why I was thinking like if I had to pick between God being like being in the presence of God, like in the Bhagavad Gita and Krishna turns into the universal form when it looks in into his mouth or, you know, and it sucks. It's like, you know, it's so he begs them to stop, please, you know, don't do that. So it's like, okay, this is, this is a far out podcast, but okay, so an advanced super advanced benevolent intelligent, but a super super advanced benevolent intelligence makes the decision to begin to communicate with some species specifically you. Right. First of all, it's like we, the way we picture it, UFO lands, door opens up, guy in a silver fucking jumpsuit comes out and says, take me to your leader because we assume this advanced alien species is just going to like, and it's always on two legs with two arms, but it's like, no, in the mythology of Krishna, Krishna splits himself into 108 different versions of himself to connect with the gopis as the story goes. Yeah, the Rasulila. The Rasulila. So this advanced intelligence, when it comes to earth, the way it communicates is not by landing in a ship, but it literally is having a conversation with every single person on the planet right now. And so the way it's having the conversation is by coming to you in the form of the thing that you love the most, whatever it may be. Totally. And so if I had to like have this conversation, I would much like I was petting my dogs the other day and I was thinking, this is God being merciful to me and coming to me in this form of like, yeah, I'm completely dependent on you. I love you no matter what you do. And I met your mercy completely. And I was thinking, oh, that's probably how God comes to people. Not as some kind of, not like in a golden chariot with spinning wheels, but in like the way it feels when you're, when your dog like nuzzles your ear. 100%, like it doesn't have to be an intense experience. It doesn't have to be Ezekiel. You know, it can be, you know, like, what a, what a beautiful. Gift to be able to have something that loves you unconditionally and you're serving it like it can't exist without you. You have to feed it. You have to walk it. You have to care for it. What, I mean, what a beautiful way of, what a beautiful expression of love a dog could be for someone, you know. And, but this is also part of the, um, uh, vice-naiva mythology, right? Because Krishna, one of the ways Krishna will come to you as your baby, right? That's the idea. Or a peacock or whatever, you know, there's so many ways, not just Krishna, but any of the, any of the forms of the divine will come to you in so many beautiful, mysterious, magical ways. And we're experiencing it every day, but we're kind of shut off to it. You know, if, if you kind of start paying attention to it and like start maybe looking for it a little bit more, you'll find the magic is there, man. It's there. It's presenting itself to you all the time. Everyone has a guru. I don't care who it is. Everyone's got a guru in their life. They just don't haven't met them yet. Or maybe they haven't just didn't know. Well it's camouflaging. Yeah. You know, like the hunter wears the camouflage to look like the forest. The way God, God wears the camouflage of love. So when anything that you love, whatever it, whatever it may be, even if it's something that the world might see as depraved, the root essence of the thing is that, that, I mean, real love. I'm not talking like, you know, itchy fucking, like, you know, itching a fucking scab, a bloody like poison ivy scab or something. You know what I'm talking about? I'm talking about like, you know, that's just the station. Yeah. No, you're talking about love, like a true heart opening. Oh, that thing, you don't have to really look much further than that. That's it. And I think that's what one of my favorite things about Bakhti Yoga is that it really isn't, it's saying, no, no, no, this is, it's here with you now, right now. Every single person you're hanging out with a super advanced alien, for lack of better words, it's better than saying God. Maybe not though. Not for you and I, but a lot of people do have a hard time with the word God, you know, it's a loaded term for a lot of people. It never has been for me. I don't mind saying it. I don't mind saying it. I like saying it. I love saying it. Yeah. But more and more, I like, and people do oppose you on it and so weird because like, do you get mad if you say Michael Jordan or do you get mad if you say, you know, like anything, like, you hear people praising things all the time, you know, like praising music, praising presidents, praising, you know, they're praising their, their houses, their cars, everything, but you can't praise. Yeah, I can't praise God, you know. No, because like, no, because the thing is, like people think, well, there is no God. There's just all these little individual things that I love. There certainly isn't, you know, like there's just a little broken up little pieces of things that I love, but there's no God and they don't realize, like, oh yeah, because you you human, because humans are so funny, we want the thing to look like what we expect it to look like. Sure. That's one of the number one hilarious things humans do. It's like right in front of you all the time, right there, but because it doesn't look the way you thought it would look. It's not wearing a silver jumpsuit. It doesn't have a beard like Jesus. It's not walking on water. It's whatever your version of the way you think the thing might be. It's just you got your dogs and your family and your Xbox and your job that you like or the place you like to go walking. All sponsored by God. Yes. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For me, I just know that anything in my life couldn't have existed by not the grace of the divine. And that's all I have to say about it. It's not if I believe in God or if I don't believe in God. I trust in my heart that the divine has been with me my entire life and will continue to be with me. But I mean, you take it to a different level. I mean, you have a guru. You travel around, you've traveled around the planet looking or finding or being, what would you say? I would say they're like pilgrimages, I make pilgrimage to holy places around the world. And even doing that, I've had saints tell me, just call home. Whatever you're looking for is at home too. But I'm interested. My curiosity also brings me to those places, not only my heart. I'll hear about this amazing place and I want to go to it. So part of it's out of my own curiosity and my own kind of egoic things as well. But that being said, I do know that it's helped me to go to these pilgrimages to put things in perspective and I've had amazing experiences, you know, going to these places. When you go on these pilgrimages, do you feel like you've made the decision to go on these pilgrimages or do you feel like you're being drawn into something? 100% without sounding too foofy about it, I've been drawn every time. And like it's every single time it's been such an arrangement that it's not the same as the arrangements I have in my daily instantaneous interactions with people. It's like, oh, we were waiting for you here. Oh, we're here. Hi, you know, we've been expecting you and just like open door policy everywhere I've gone. A few times I've been shut out of some things where I thought I was going to be, but that's all part of it as well. That's part of learning, you know, and also the humbling and the breaking down of the ego and stuff like that. But yeah, I feel like I've been drawn to many of these places. Can you give an example? Okay, I'll tell you the story about how I received my spiritual name and that was kind of a very serendipitous experience. So there's a little bit of a backstory to it. Just the place where I was traveling to, I was with my teacher and we were traveling for about three weeks together and we were visiting many saints and places where saints were buried, their Samadhis, because they give off energy as well. And the final... This is in India. This is in India. Yeah. It's in the South Indian Tamil Nadu. So our final destination was our Guru, our Sadguru's tomb, you know, he wanted to bring me there. But on the way we stopped at a place called Palani and the story with Palani was there was a Siddhar, a Siddhar is someone who's perfected all his, he's mastered all the powers. They're these like kind of supernatural beings. Right. There was one who was named Bogar and Bogar was, he lived for thousands of years. Some people consider him to be Laosu in China. Some people consider him to be Ketikadal in Mexico. And he was Bogar in India, same force, different bodies, you know. So he was living on a mountain top and he created a deity of Moragon whose Shiva's other son Ganesha's one son, Moragon is another one. And he built... Never heard of Moragon. Kartikeya. That's another name for him. And the Gita Krishna says of the warriors, I'm Kartikeya because he's the god of war. But so Kartikeya, so there's a whole story about how Moragon went to the South and Ganesh went to the North. It's a whole other story. Did they get along? They did. So I'll start with this story. It will lead into the next story. Hopefully it won't be too long-winded. So Shiva and Parvati offered the two sons, Moragon and Ganesh a golden mango. And the riddle or the challenge was who could go around the universe three times. So Ganesh takes off one way on his rat, you know, like one mile an hour. And then Moragon, who rides a peacock, goes out in the other way and he's fighting demons. He takes off and Ganesh gets like a hundred feet and then turns around and just rides the mouse around. Shiva and Parvati three times and said, you are my universe. And they give him the golden mango. Moragon comes back, you know, a hundred years later and Ganesh has the golden mango and he's mad. You know, they tell him, you know, you know, Ganesh said, you know, you are my universe. You are my world. There's nothing else. You went out on your adventure. So he got angry. So he went to the south. He took off and started his own thing down in the south. It's can't enable. Yeah, totally. And that's how they say the Tamil language started through Moragon because he wouldn't even speak the language of his parents anymore. Wow. So this is just like the inevitable rift in brothers that gets spoken about in all mythologies. It's almost like it's weird. It's like it points to some weird bifurcation that happened and totally. Yeah. But it also it's showing the different essences of the loving child too, because he does eventually forgives his parents and establishes Dharma in the south, you know, through Shiva. So Moragon is like he's the he's worshiped by many in South India. He's kind of as people would worship Ganesh in the north. He's worshiped in the south. So Bogar made the statue of Moragon out of nine different poisons and was worshiping it on this mountain. And he had a student in his name, one student, one single student at the time, and his name was Pulupani. And Pulupani means he rides a tiger. So Pulupani would ride a tiger around. And Bogar had promised him liberation, you know, when he was ready to leave the planet, he would liberate Pulupani. And then when he was about ready to go, he said, no, it's important that you stay here and maintain this idol, you know, of Moragon, because many people are going to benefit from it. So he went into a cave and Pulupani sealed up the cave, put the statue on top of it, and then it built this temple around it. And ten generations of Pulupanis have now maintained this one statue. And the guru who gave me my name was the tenth one, the tenth Pulupani. And he knew my teacher. He had met him once before and we went to a small program that he had in his ashram. And he asked my, he's like asking my teacher what his name was again. He didn't remember. And he asked another friend that was with us and he asked me and I was like, oh, my name is Robert. You need a Tamil name, Shivanesh. And I was like, I wasn't expecting to get a name. I just met him. I wasn't expecting to get a name from him. But then my teacher was like, no, listen, you got this spiritual name from this lineage in front of the Samadhis of all the nine other Pulupanis. And the brother took us up to the idol the next morning and we were able to go in the temple alone and he did puja for us in front of the idol, you know. And in at the, what would be the cave mouth where he was, where Bogar was sealed up. And apparently about 500 years ago they opened it up and he's still in there in the lotus position. Nails have grown like three feet long as hair has grown, but he's still in there. He's not dead. He's still in there. That is one of the, that belief is wild, right? That certain enlightened beings go into caves. They've transcended death. You know? That's what a Siddharth does. He's perfected everything. So he's, you know, he can't even die. So this, when did this happen to you? This happened last year. I've been traveling to India for about nine years prior to that, but this was my last trip. So I, again, I wasn't like, huh, I wonder, did I just get initiated or what's going on in my teacher who would be the one who would normally be initiating me was like, no, this is a very auspicious occasion. You should, you should take that name. And he started introducing me to everybody. Sheva Nesh. He was like, this is, uh, his name was Robert. He's from New Jersey. Now he's Sheva Nesh. You know? And he, you know, he had a huge smile on his, on his face when he would say that. So I knew it meant a lot to him that that had happened and he was there for it as well. Talk a little bit about this idea of like taking a new name because I think for some people they hear it and they're like, come on, really, like you're going to get a new name. But it seems like it's such a psychologically powerful thing that you can do because it gives you a chance to like so much of your personalities attached to your name. Yeah. Your name. And, uh, it's kind of giving you a clean slate and it's also again, like I use that, the name Sheva Nesh in my spiritual circles and, you know, in my sangha and, you know, I'm starting to use it more and more with people if I'll introduce myself, but I have clients. I'm a tattoo artist. So, um, they know me as Robert and I don't mind being either one of those people, you know, but as well, it did change my life in a way where I got serious. I started to get more serious about my practice. I got, this is a name that I'm going to have to honor and to be given that name by such a powerful lineage, through a powerful lineage from a powerful person, you know, it's something I'm going to have to live up to now. So. When you feel like you are pulled to that place. 100%. Why, why else? Who else got a name that day? Maybe a hundred people did out, but I didn't see anybody else and, um, yeah, it was, it was definitely a meaningful experience. See, that's the other thing that I love about, uh, this particular way of thinking is that, you know, the story of the Rasulila is they hear Krishna's flute playing out in the, in the forest and they go running towards Krishna and it's a fun, you know, all of these things are just like tools because you could ask yourself, well, what have I heard? Have I heard that flute? Have I heard it? No matter who you are out there, you've heard it and you don't realize that you're being drawn into a thing. You're still tricking yourself into thinking that you're the one in control because this is what humans want to think, right? We want to believe we're in control. We're the doer. That's the, the famous, the doer and the, if, you know, those who believe that they are the doer, you know, how deluded they are, you know? Yeah. For me, the more, the closer I get to this path or the more this path opens up for me and I do feel that I'm very young on the path in this lifetime, um, none of it seems by my arrangement. You know, I had to work at things and manifest these things in my life, but it was all made available to me. It's a really fun way to give yourself a little bit of a break to stop giving yourself this idea that you're like the one who's like, uh, navigating. This is like what I said on the last podcast and I keep thinking about it as the hilarity of that ridiculous saying, God is my co-pilot, absolutely human a thing that is to say. Yeah, put him in the pilot seat. What are you doing? Why am I driving when God's next to me? It's a really funny, it's a really, I just like to imagine how that happened where you're like about to get in a car with God and you're like, I'll drive. Move over. You know, no offense. I know you created the universe where you're a shitty driver. I don't like the way you drive too fast. I get car sickness. Um, yeah, yeah, it's really funny and also imagine like Job, like imagine if he thought he was responsible for all that, you know, like, you know, like, yeah, that on the bad things too, sometimes the bad things that happen are maybe not, it's your karma, but maybe not because you didn't do something that you thought you might have done better or something like that, you know. And this brings us into the ideas like, well, what's true for the individual is true for the whole. And if we're all being drawn into something as individuals, then together as a species we're being pulled into something. And this is where you get into like, Théliard Deschardaux and the idea of the Omega point, right? Totally. Yeah, yeah. So it's like the concept of like, oh, in the same way you were drawn to the sacred place to be given a new name, collectively, our entire species is in the process of being drawn into a new place together to be given a new name, to become some new thing that is, that we can't even imagine what that might be. Yeah, we're all members of the academy, whether we like it or not, you know, and we're all getting our asses slapped and wiped and pushed into it. And then, yeah, it's really intense. And I was reading this morning, Ramana Maharshi, he was saying the best way to, you know, help the planet is by helping yourself and like, beaming that light out to people. That's the only way you can really help people. And this reminds me of something that we spoke about earlier where you said, if you make your way, if you're sitting in a place to do an ayahuasca ceremony, then you're ready to be there. Yeah. Nothing that shouldn't happen, nothing that isn't predestined to happen doesn't happen or vice versa. You know, like, if it's not supposed to happen, it's not going to happen. If it's supposed to happen, it's going to happen whether you like it or not. And this is one of the lenses, I think, where people, if you're starting, if you feel disempowered, useless, worthless, horrible, like meaningless, if you apply that same thing you're saying to the ayahuasca ceremony, to the great ayahuasca ceremony, which is human incarnation, just the fact that you're here means you're incredible, that you've come into this body and that you're in this dimension in the human form. Wow. You're fucking amazing. You're amazing that you're here. That's the other side of it, right? Yeah. Thank you so much for saying that because I was thinking about this earlier. Like, yeah, it's what a gift to be able to take a human incarnation. And to take a human incarnation and start to wonder or quest after the divine is even a bigger blessing, you know? And like, the blessings start expanding further and further, deeper and deeper you go, but it starts with that thing being born as a human. What a great chance to do whatever you, you know, like, you can do anything, anything is possible, you know? You're on the tractor beam. Yeah. And as a human, you're being pulled into this thing that we're all getting pulled into. We're all floating into a UFO together. It's just this particular alien that we've all been drawn into is so incredibly powerful that whenever it looks on something, the thing comes to life and not only does it come to life, but it actually begins to evolve and it moves closer and closer towards perfection. That's the idea. We're not getting pulled into a UFO. We're getting drawn into perfection. That's the concept, right? We're being drawn into a perfect state of unification with the most incredibly neverending beauty that has, well, you can't say has ever existed. It's always been, but it's evolving too. Yeah, humanhood. Yeah. So cool. So cool. Yeah. Yeah. See, it got that. Yeah. So fucking hands and arms and legs or some combo or maybe none of them, but you got a torso or a head or whatever the hell you are, even if you're a head on a gelatinous membrane, you're doing great, man. You're in. You're in. Don't worry. You're in. Yeah. I noticed people also project their sorrows onto other humans when maybe those people are fine. When you see someone maybe eating food out of a garbage can or like you said, with no legs or no arms, they might be having the most beautiful, genuine experience ever. They could be connecting on a way and you see that a lot in India. You see people that are suffering so hard, born into lower cast, but still having ecstatic spiritual experiences and transcending the body, transcending the cast, transcending the condition. Dude, I remember when I was in New Delhi, there's a shop that I've been walking by and really like sweet guys worked at the shop, but there was the sunset, it's nighttime. And I realized where they slept, they had a thing they pulled down with their beds on it with a little shelter on it right in front of their shop outside. That's where they slept. Outside of their living room is the muddy streets of New Delhi in front of their shop. And I remember walking by and they were sitting there with each other, laughing and talking and they were so happy, so happy. And like a happiness where you look at it and you're like, I'll never be that happy. I'll never be as happy as these two guys who sleep in front of their shop in New Delhi. So yeah, for sure, man, it's like, you're in, you did it, you won the lot, you're in. Yeah, totally. I think a lot of what freaks people out is they think they're not in. Yeah. You know, they think they haven't, they're not in yet. It's like you're in, you made it, you're in the Illuminati, you did it, you're in the Bohemian Grove, you're in the Inner Sanctum, you're in the Inner Circle, all of you, every single one of us, congrats, you did it. You're being inhaled, you're being snorted by the divine. Totally, yeah, yeah, and you're under heaven's heel, every one of us, you know, we're, you know, we're in the mouth of Kali, you know, as we're in time where we are, you know, as we're living, we're degrading, as we're, as we're moving, we're decaying, but we're still, we're all part of it. And the possibilities, man, you've seen the human potential is amazing, amazing. It's better to be burned as a little bit of soul calorie and the digestive system of a never-ending, ever-accelerating super-intelligence, even if the process might seem a little grim. As you look down, as you look down, when you're looking at yourself in the mirror, just think to yourself, don't worry, you're being digested by a God, and you're going to become the energetic part of a God, you are already, or all Gods or all things. You know, I think we've got to wrap it up for two reasons. One, I think we've said it, and two, they're doing serious work. It sounds like there's a chainsaw down there or something, so it's distracting. You've got to come back on the show, man. I'd love to, anytime. It would be my honor, I really enjoyed it. Thank you. How can people find you? I think the best way is Instagram, because it's the easiest one to update. I haven't updated my website in years, so it's Robert Ryan 323 on Instagram, and you can just get ahold of me there. If you need to reach out to me, you can maybe send me a message there. It's got my email right on the thing, that's the easy way to find me. Can you come to the next show on the 15th of August? Yeah, I'm planning on it, yeah, definitely. And you'll be oming, so you can come say hi to Emmett on August 15th too. Thank you so much. Let's om together. My friends, my apologies for the sound. It's not always like that.

Imagining yourself to be some wriggling skin-covered skeletal thing flopping about on the strange beach of existence. Looking around at all the other flopping little sentient fishies riding around in their flopping little sentient fishy cars. Listening to their sentient, style-floppy fish. Music, which many times is often the sound of a suffocating, sentient, confused fish dying slowly gasping for air. Trying to find any breath, anything that reminds them of the aquatic paradise that they emerge from. How terrible a thing to be a hyper-intelligent technology using sentient, primate, descendant fish with complete amnesia of the fact that you were once living in a beautiful ocean and now are flopping about on a very temporary, material, time-based shore. Just looking for anything. Trying to find some sip of that sweet nectar used to swim about in. You try to find it by getting famous. You try to find it by getting rich. You try to find it in glory holes and on tender and various fuck logs in the forest that you squirm into. Laying in that mulchy pulp and feeling yourself being pleasured again and again by legions of strangers. And yet still, it's as though there is an untouchable, onyx stone deep inside of you. A thing that the world just can't quite get to. Like some horrific charlie horse and the tentacle of a cthulhu that no masseuse could ever fix. And so, the life is spent flopping and flipping. Flops and the flips become precise, artistic, fancy. As we flop and flip, we flop and flip in fancy houses, fancy homes with fancy words that we use. Sometimes we say hyperbolic and we don't feel embarrassed. This, friends, is the reality of our human incarnation. But let me tell you something. The spiritual mumbo jumbo that I've been vomiting out for the last God knows how long. It's over. I'm not doing it anymore outside of this podcast. From this point forward, the DTFH is becoming a competitive podcast. I just found out this is happening. Podcasts have gotten competitive. I was chatting with a friend who informed me that it's just a culture out there now of competitive hierarchical struggle. That the podcast universe has descended into something reminiscent of Game of Thrones. Some of my fellow podcasters have apparently begun to treat this gentle art form. Formerly based on recording authentic human communication with the intent of harvesting the sweet interpersonal wisdom fields of the very temporary shared mind that forms between two truth seekers who've opened up their hearts and are listening to each other. As though it were a Wall Street style endeavor. They've taken a kind of Machiavellian approach to the situation and set their greedy sights not upon the noble goal of fishing for epiphanous moments on the sonic wind ships of technologically enhanced connectivity. But on the mundane goal of becoming massively wealthy by projecting warped, polished versions of themselves absorbed in conversation with stars of TV, film and music out on to the worldwide web. When I heard this news, I threw my chanting beads into my meditation fire and gritted my teeth in pure sanctimonious rage. I realized that to defeat my enemy, I would have to become like my enemy. I would have to become sleek, polished and competitive. From this point forward, the Duncan Trussell family hour is just going to be the Duncan Trussell power hour. And we're only going to do interviews with the most refined guests. Anyone coming on the show will be processed through a nano swarm. Their atoms will be polished. I don't know what podcast you all are listening to. I don't know what pig troughs my sweet listeners have been poisoning themselves on. But in this podcast, when you hear a guest, you will know that he has been processed through an Anokian Reconfiguration Cube. Whoever that guest was when they came in here, they are not the same person when they leave. No, no, no, no. Their atoms have been scrubbed. Their memories have been erased and replaced with better memories. Their politics, their conceptualization of the way things should be has been replaced with a better conceptualization, a more attuned conceptualization of the way reality actually is. And that attuned conceptualization is going to be completely based on what I think. From this point forward, if you're a listener, whether a new or longtime fan, it's no longer enough to just like and subscribe. Now you must unsubscribe from all the other podcasts that you listen to. Do it right now. Pause and go unsubscribe. If you're listening to this podcast and you're cheating on me basically, you're listening to whoever and this person and that person, you're on your way to work listening to some this or that murder show or this American life, then you might as well tie a millstone to your neck and throw yourself into the sea. A to Brutee or is it it to Brutee? Regardless, Brutee, you got to stop it. No more listening to other podcasts. This will be your soul podcast. This will be your home. This will not be a place that welcomes polyamorous podcast listeners. This is a monogamous relationship, honey. You and me forever. So get on there and unsubscribe and like this podcast because we are going to the top. It's time for the DTFH to rise like a jealous, insecure, contemptuous, hypocritical phoenix from the pseudo spiritual ashes of its former life and crush all other podcasts until there is only one podcast. The Dunker Trussell fam, Power Hour, perched like a bloated, unspeakable primordial toddler god on the fucking festering corpses of all the other podcasts, scooping the yellowing, crusty, custard like ooze from their mortal wounds into its bloated, jagged-toothed, broken, purpley, swollen, herpified, agnified, chafed, and sliced mouth. Today, you will hear the last spiritual interview. From this point forward, we are only going to interview A-listers and models. That's it. You're not going to hear spiritual authors who wrote a book about how to be happy. You're not going to hear people in the great Buddhist lineages. You're not going to hear people with some message of hope for the world. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. And I apologize to you for wasting your time with that blither-blather. From this point going forward, you are going to hear interviews with folks who have made fucking great films. Folks who you've seen on the view. This is the new DTFH, the DTPH Power Hour. Welcome to it. And if you're a new listener, don't forget to like and subscribe. We have a great episode for you today. Or I guess in the old days, it would have been great. It's with someone who I used to consider a spiritual teacher. But now that I have realized that competition is the only way that we live in a world not of peace and interconnectivity, but a world of steel and fire. And thus I have abandoned all of my religion and spirituality. I'm wearing a suit of chain mail right now, oiled down and greased, a cod piece. I've got medals that I've given myself, dangling upon a beautiful triangular hat made of velvet. And do I have seven cats? Fuck yeah. And are they black? Fuck yeah. And did I start collecting baby skulls? Fuck yeah. Do I have a mummified corpse that I bought in Italy? Yeah, I do. Do I swim around in a Olympic sized swimming pool that I had placed in my backyard? No, not yet. But I will. Because once this fucking podcast hits the top of the charts, I don't mean the top of the spirituality charts. I don't mean the top of the comedy charts. I mean the top of every chart there is. I'm talking about complete overthrow of all the governments of the world by this podcast. I'm talking about the entire planet vowing down at the altar of this podcast, where I will be sitting in a throne made of the logos of all the other podcasts that I have crushed. Are you a friend? Are you listening and you're a friend and you think I'm going to book you on the show? No! No more friendly this and that. No more after this. I'm going to plug a few of my friends' things on this. But after this, no fucking more. I laugh. I laugh. As I think of the bloody baths I'm going to be taking, like Lady Bathory. Just cover myself in the blood of those who stood in my way when I didn't even know they were standing in my way. And I know I'll be happy someday. I know it. And I thought the way to be happy was to be happy with what you have and where you are. And just, you know, realize that actually there's no way to satiate the infinite, endless vortex of hunger inside of us by taking things from the material universe because anything in the material world is only that matter and we're things of spirit. That's just some shit you say at summer camp. From this point forward, it's fucking pirate ships, cannonballs. It's axes like the kind you see on heavy metal album covers. We're talking about decapitations, eviscerations, disembowelments. We're talking about fucking corporate takeovers of small airports by Gordon fucking podcasting gecko, baby. We're talking about heads rolling down a sonic hill as I gallop to the top, swinging my magical, vengeance sword like a fucking cosmic weed eater. I'm going to burrow down, baby. I'm going to go straight to fucking hell and find out if there's anybody doing podcasts there. And I'm going to cancel those motherfuckers. And when I'm done with that, I will take the podcasting crown from Lucifer himself and place it on my head and climb up that great cosmic dangling dick that attaches to God's balls and cut them off. And then at last, I will become the ubercaster as prophesied by all the world religions. But today we do have a spirituality podcast with one of my great teachers, Ragu Marcus. If you are somebody out there who is interested in this sort of thing, then I think you'll really enjoy this podcast. This is a person who has taught me a lot about being gentle and easy, easy on myself instead of always constantly hating myself and getting sucked into never ending self perpetuating cycles of deploring my identity and getting lost in my head. So just bear with me through this one because next week we're going to interview a fucking movie star. I will be right back. I was talking to a friend of mine the other day and she told me that she was going to start her own business and she was going to at some point create a website. I knew why she was thinking that she had to wait to make the website. She remembered a time when making a website could destroy your mind. Turn your guts into applesauce, make you vomit up your heart. But now we live in different days. You don't have to go crazy to make a website. You can use Squarespace. Don't have to lose your mind and claw out your eyes. You can use Squarespace. Squarespace has everything you need to create a beautiful website. You want to start a business smelling and selling your stinky socks smell and sell my stinky socks.com is probably available. I'm not going to look it up. You can do that yourself. They've got shopping cart functionality, any Squarespace website instantly sizes to any device. They have fantastic customer service and they are the number one website design site on this planet or anywhere in the multiverse for that matter. And you can try them out now by heading over to Squarespace.com and when you're ready to launch, go to Squarespace.com forward slash Duncan and use offer code Duncan to get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. You do not have to build a website to promote a business. Don't forget that you can make a website to glorify your friends. Think how excited your best friend will be when he sees that you made a website just for him that you can send to him and you could show him. Look at this. I put all those pictures we took that time. We were drunk in the Hamptons up here. Isn't it awesome? And then if he's like, you know, I'm not, I don't feel so good about that. You could say, oh, that's okay. Just, you know, since I made something beautiful for you, you could probably do something beautiful for me. Like, I don't know, tribute or something like that. And then this has worked for me so many times and has really strengthened many of my friendships. You don't have to build a website just to make some Brooklyn eatery selling otter tusks to a very small subsection of a pretty much unknown demographic living in New York City. You can actually make a website just for the sake of pure chaos. You can worship the goddess of chaos using Squarespace. All you have to do is head over to squarespace.com forward slash Duncan.

Then it's time to head over to patreon forward slash DTFH and subscribe. You're going to get commercial free episodes of the DTFH. You're going to get long, rambling things, embarrassing things of me rambling on and on, which I actually love to do. It's my favorite thing on the planet. In fact, if you want to hear me trying to work out not only my own coiled up neurotic knots and broken callous things that I have to rip open to find the pulpy painful shit I've been blocking out mixed in with more than likely completely incorrect interpretations of some of the great world religions. You can find it all over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH and for my subscribers there. I apologize. It's been a little sparse lately because of this unspeakable thing that I'm working on. I don't mean unspeakable and like a Mordor style unspeakable. I mean, I can't talk about it, but you'll see soon enough chaos. We're going to be talking about that July 17th at the Samarasah yoga studio. Head over there. It's basically a live podcast with David Nickturn, one of my friends who's also been teaching me a lot about meditation. And the subject of chaos is something that I'm quite fascinated by. And we're going to be talking about what is it and is it even bad? Maybe I could even work in some chaos magic stuff in there. Check it out. It's on the Samarasah website. It's Friday. It's next Friday, the 17th. So I will see you there now without further ado, please welcome today's guest. He's a returning guest. He is the, he runs the Love Server Member Foundation, which is Ram Das' foundation. And he and I have some of my favorite conversations ever. And this is definitely one of them. So also he's got a fantastic podcast called the Mind Rolling Podcast. All the links you need to get to that will be at dunkatrustle.com. Everyone, please welcome back to the DTFH, the lovely Raghu Marcus. Music playing Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake hands, join me to be blue Welcome to you It's the dunkatrustle, dunkatrustle, dunkatrustle, dunkatrustle Oh, hey listen, I want to say something. Sure. An ad. I want to do an ad. I'm going to India. All right. And I'm taking some people to India. I never do that. Okay. I'm going on middle of September. Do you want to come? When is it? Mid-September. I don't know, probably not. Right. Busy guy. Yeah. Your whole spiritual life though will be. Do I want to come? Yes. Can I come? No. Well, maybe somebody else out there might want to come. And if you do, go to nourishinglife.com slash yatra, Y-A-T-R-A. We still got some spots to follow Ramdas' footsteps in the Himalayas. Yeah, so that's my little thing. Anybody wants to go to India and be guided to some incredible places. That sounds awesome, Marco. I miss India. Yeah. But yeah, back to the valley of the shadow of death. So what I've found in this valley, been going through some tough stuff. How much of it can you talk about? You know, even if it was just you and me in private, I wouldn't be talking about it. It's just like rehashing slop, you know, just my own slop. So it's like with these kinds of things, it's like inevitably if you're in a community, there's certain things that you, you know, you don't want to like involve people. You want to be tabloid. There's that too, yeah. Tabloid news. No, but basically really what's important is a lot of good stuff has come from this. Because really you get, when you're confronted with all kinds of obstacles and feeling as, I moved so I'm feeling unmoored and all of that kind of thing. So you start to see way more transparently the psychological stuff, right? Well, yeah. So this is like, this is, I've heard it called liminality. Have you ever heard of this before? Yeah, but I'm not sure I know. The in between places are magical places. So in between dreams, in between jobs, in between, you name it. Any, when you're in the airplane, you know, when you're traveling places, the in between places are very special places and very magical places post losing someone close to you. Border areas are magical places, even if the border is one that's imposed upon just a chunk of land. The moment you create a border, that border becomes very special. So you're in a liminal place. In between dreams, so to speak. A bardo, the bardo. It's a bardo. A bardo, yeah. And I do recognize that. Interestingly enough, at the same time, so I did a podcast introducing a talk of Ram Dass from some time back. Again, an incredible talk was all around motives for spiritual practice. And he was basically saying, and I'm, he wouldn't quite characterize it the way I do. He's much more, not only eloquent, but also kind. I'm learning to be kinder through this process, by the way. Yeah. So he said most of us are doing spiritual practices that basically result in enhancing the ego story and the whole arc of how we think about ourselves, who we think we are, that instead of what's supposed to be doing, which is leveraging you from your head and thoughts and everything into the heart place, most of the time, it's supporting your ego identity, right? And he said, so until, and this is what got me. He said, until you get at dealing with the psychological shit that comes up day to day, the habitual patterns, the neurotic, until you start to really deal with that, you can't even think of practicing the higher forms of spiritual practice, whatever they may be for you. And I really saw myself actually doing what we've, you and I have talked about before, spiritual bypass, right? Yeah, sure. So that's very much what it is. But it's really looking at all of these motives and you start to see more clear, which is a good thing around mindfulness and awareness and witness and all that stuff that we've talked about before. But I think it's really important to get at the psychological stuff that we really push away, you know, and they're all around anger. You know, my reactivity has grown in the process of what I've been going through in the last number of months. I can see it. I can feel it. And it's pushed me into a place of, okay, this has to be dealt with now. This can't be shoved under with a lot of meditation and chanting and so on, you know, which is, which is, you know, very much a problem. What's the problem? The problem of instead of meeting head on these kinds of psychological things, you know, you're covering it with meditation. Okay, yeah, yeah. By the way, if you think you can cover it up with meditation or if your practice is covering it up, I wonder if that's even a practice that seems like more like self-hypnosis or something. Well, most of us are doing all of these things and we're not aware, right? We just are not aware of these motivations and we're running on a treadmill and we built our story so well that we're going to stick to that story. Right. Right. It's not, being honest is a difficult thing. Well, it's not the, it's the sort of, you know, the fantasies, I think, related to spiritual bypass or the idea of spiritual bypass itself. Doesn't it seem to have like an implicit sort of delusion wrapped up in it? In other words, if you think that you can spiritual bypass or you have hope, in other words, like the, okay, so the spiritual bypass concept is interesting. I love it because within it is a dream and the dream is that you can escape. So the idea is like spiritual bypass, even though it's looked down upon by many people, is it's a mess. Don't do it. What do you mean look down upon? Well, it's like that. I feel like it's generally, it's like a sign of you fucked up. You're using spiritual bypass to avoid, you're using some spirituality or religion, whatever, to avoid dealing with your real world situations. So, but also what's interesting about spiritual bypass is it's a myth because spiritual bypass assumes that there is a way out. The idea is like, well, you know, at least I can always do spiritual bypass and get away. It implies there's a way out. It implies that you could even do that anyway. There's no way out. But people don't, they don't say themselves, oh, shit, I can go do an end around here. People are just ignoring the states that are very, very unmindful, shall we say. They're ignoring the anger, the jealousy, the polarization, the separateness. They're making it whole by virtue of the story that they're telling. We are telling ourselves about should I be doing, I'm doing this wonderful meditation now and I'm getting better. I'm getting better. I'm getting more focused. I'm getting more one-pointed. I'm doing some chanting. And so in that space, I'm like, okay, you know, I'm okay. I'm not, I'm out of time and space for a moment and I'm okay. So it's a, it's a much more subtle story. No one's saying, hey, where's the end around? I don't want to deal with this shit. It is, but that's why I think it's so insidious is because even within the term and within the terminology, spiritual bypass is another form of bypass in the sense that within it is there's like literally like if I've got a bypass. In other words, if there's something like, let's just say there's a, I don't know, a dragon in the path. And I imagine that there's a bypass. Then the bypass becomes a kind of hopeful situation like, yeah, sure, I didn't kill the dragon, but I've like taken a little break from the dragon. But really there, it's spiritual bypass is to me a corrupted term in the sense that it's the idea you can ignore the shit on your shoe and other people can smell it. And it's like, if I chant the shit will not, I'm not going to smell the shit. If I go to Machu Picchu, I'm not going to spell the shit on my shoe. And it's like the truth of the matter is everyone smells the shit. Everyone knows that you have shit on your shoe. This comic, very funny comic Henry Phillips put this YouTube video up. It is one of the funniest stories of all time. I'm sorry. Please watch the video. I don't mean to ruin it. But like basically he ended up in some like one of these tour houses. And, you know, like you like the fancy houses that you get a tour of. And halfway through the tour, everyone's complaining because they're like, I smell shit. And halfway through the tour, he realizes he's got shit on his shoe. And, and, you know, basically has to evade the house. And he's just left a streak of shit through this like fancy fucking house. So it's the funniest video. He's a very, I'm sorry. I hope I didn't fuck up your thing. Please watch the YouTube video. He's such a brilliant storyteller. I do know justice the way he articulates his story. But the point is, this is spiritual bypass to me, which is that the concept is that there is hope. And even if it's a dark kind of hope, even if it is like, well, I can always go back to sleep. Oh, I can always, to me, it's like, it doesn't matter. There is no, if you're chanting Hare Krishna, if you're drinking from the Grail Cup, if you're doing this or that, and you have shit on your shoe, you still have shit on your shoe. Yeah, and you cannot ignore it. You know, you know what it is? Frank Zappa had a great song. It can't happen here. You know, it's happening and you keep going, can't happen here. You have an accident. Oh my God, this can't be real. You know, even in the moment of impact, you know, I'm talking more obviously smaller things where you don't get really messed up. You go, oh my God, you know, you don't believe that it happened. You don't want to believe, right? You are so separated from the experience because you're so trying for it not to happen. It didn't happen. It did happen. So that's, that's a gigantic example of bypass, right? Right. And let me bring up something now related to this that I think is quite interesting. There's a wonderful, wonderful YouTube video of Krishna Murthy and Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche having a debate, essentially. It is one of the funniest things I've ever seen. I've seen this phenomena emerge now more than a few times where you get these two spiritual people together who are leaders. And there's a weird form of competitiveness there, which is really quite hilarious. And so Krishna Murthy is taking Chogyam Trumpa to task. He starts off with this, like, breakdown of why spiritual leadership, leaders in general, are bad news, catastrophic in fact. And also he's like, one of the brilliant things he said to Chogyam Trumpa was, why are you adding another problem in people's lives with this meditation? It's like life is already fucked up. Now you're going to have meditation to the problem of life. Like you're adding this other thing to it. For real? Is this what he said? Yes. Now, there's a lot going on there that was brilliant because Chogyam, he was like, Chogyam Trumpa was just being very quiet, very, very humble. He was really listening to him and like really like not fighting back against essentially what was Krishna Murthy's like, chastising someone basically it seemed like, but the energies were so different because one was like really wound up. And the other one was just there listening. And it was, to me, it was like, you will know a tree by its fruit. And in this place, you know, one tree was pissed off and the other one was just there. And it was a big difference, but Krishna Murthy did say a thing that has stuck with me. Well, asked a thing. He's asked Chogyam Trumpa, what happens when you see disorder? What happens when you're seeing disorder? And I would ask you the same question. When you're witnessing disorder in the world, Ragu, what is happening? Well, wait, that's too big a question. Disorder. Something's amiss. Something's awry. That's separate from my actual hands-on experience. Something I'm watching the news. What are we talking about? Anytime you're walking down the street and you see a thing that seems amiss. Okay, there's a homeless encampment. Oh, look, there's a garbage on the floor. Oh, look, there's those scooters that are all around town now. Oh, look, there's this or that. When you're witnessing disorder, what's happening? What's happening? So the first thing that happens is awareness. Awareness of a situation. The second thing that happens, depending in my case, depending on how relaxed here, present in the moment I am, I would go towards whatever that thing is to see what I could do. If I'm in a place of any kind of contraction, I might go, okay, I can't deal with this and make a left turn. So it depends on the moment. What that moment is, in my case, what's that moment when I encounter and I become aware of whatever disorder it might be there? Prior to the action of avoidance or dealing with it, what is happening? Just awareness in the moment of my surroundings being here with whatever is in front of me. But I think, and again, it's Christian Emeriti, so who knows what he's fucking saying. But I think what he was saying is, you're seeing your own shadow when you see disorder. When you see disorder, I walk into a room that is a mess and I think this is a mess. Another person walks into that very same room and thinks this is a very clean room. So in these situations, what is happening? But I guess you tripped me into seeing a homeless encampment. I had that in my mind. It's different because that involves suffering on other people's part. Walking into a bullshit room or walking into a room with people that are talking and you don't maybe know them and you're in a more clenched kind of place, then your shadow is just jumping the shit at you. Yes, of that. But in that situation, yes, absolutely most of the time, in those kinds of situations where you're walking into something you have no idea about, you immediately start projecting and defending. Do you think it's safe to say that it's not just in that moment, but fundamentally when you're seeing disorder in the world, really what you're seeing is yourself. That you're carrying the lens of disorder around with you based on your expectations. Yeah, I do. But in a situation where there's people involved that are suffering in one way or the other, if you're still in that place of projecting and defending, too bad. It's not a great thing. But even though I may walk into a room is what I'm saying. I may walk into a room and I see people I don't know whatever and I'm projecting in the shadows the whole nine yards that he's talking about. And the next moment, walk out of there and face an encampment where that shadow is gone. If I'm in an open place and I'm connecting with compassion in any way, you can't just walk into something like that and go, okay, I've got to ignore it. So it's not black and white. And by the way, just to change the subject a little bit, not really, this thing of Krishnamurti meeting up with Trangpa. So one time Krishnamurti went to Kenchi to see Nimkaroli Baba. And he stopped by there. He must have been up in the Himalayas. And one of our mentors was with Maharajji and they went to the river, they asked the two of them to talk. They were sitting on rocks. He was close enough to hear what they were saying. So Krishnamurti said, what's with you? You've got all these ashrams and building ashrams and you're a sadhu, you're a yogi. What do you need to have all these ashrams and buildings and brick and mortar? I don't know if he said brick and mortar, but Maharajji said, you're right. You're absolutely right. It's how I get my grub. That's what he said. And then he said, but you seem to go around lecturing around the world. Isn't that how you get your grub? Wow. What did Krishnamurti say? The conversation ended there. Krishnamurti was like, he's like, he's still got a weird spirituality cop. Seems like you're just flopping around yelling at everybody. But to me, your answer, to go back to this concept of spiritual bypass, to me, the first thing is the recognition that as long as there is an identity, you're going to be carrying the disorder around with you. There's no way out of it. There's no way out of it. Spiritual bypass is not really anything. It's just more nonsense. It's total nonsense. It's total, just self-indulgent bullshit. But it's not bullshit because we're human and that stuff happens all the time. Actually, here's something that addresses this that Krishnamurti said. I just happened to pick it up and I went, because I wanted to talk about this. I don't even like to term spiritual bypass because it's another one of those words, mindfulness. Ram Dass's thing about spiritual motives, really being able to witness your motives and see where you're just using this shit to feed your ego. He says, if we keep running away from stuff, how are we going to stop? We'll keep running. We have to learn to turn and face some of these things head-on. That's what I was saying. It's funny, he said that. It takes courage and that's that whole story we've told a number of times about Maharaji being in a room. Krishnadas was in the room with him and there was a close Indian devotee and Maharaji who was translating, he said, courage is a very big thing. The Indian devotee said, no, it's bhakti yoga, the guru, grace does everything. Maharaji turned to Krishnadas and did that thing with his finger, exclamation finger. Courage is a very big thing. That courage is what it takes to turn. It's to make the turn. It's that little turn. Courage is hard. Facing all these things inside of us, face all those miserable, selfish, self-centered, greedy, nasty crap that we think all the time about people, about ourselves. It's horrible. But you have to look at that. If you never look at that, it'll never go away. It'll stay in the background. You have to look at that stuff. And that's essentially, after all these years, Duncan, oh, by the way, yeah, we didn't say who you are. But if they don't know who you are by now, our listeners, they never will. We could just do an intro. You can redo it. Who cares? Even who cares who I am? It doesn't matter if I'm the king of freaking Persia. Bhutan, I was going to say. Bhutan, who gives a shit? I can be a talking badger. It doesn't matter. So, yeah, facing this shit head on. And I was saying after all of the work, the big work I've been doing all these years on myself, that's another view, another story, another shadow. It's like, who gives a shit? And I say that to myself, okay, that's okay. I'm having these habitual tendencies, neurotic tendencies, the psychological blah, blah, come up through that. What was that? Intermediate bardo you were talking about? Oh, luminality, the liminal place. Liminality, L-I? I think so. Okay, we'll have to check that out. Subliminal under the middle. Uh-huh, right. Okay, so liminal. Subliminal, yeah. So within that, this has all come up. So you're absolutely correct that this has been a real opportunity. I mean, I'm seeing it as a real opportunity. You know, pain is there, though. Pain is there when you see. Because I moved. Here's just a stupid example. I had to change addresses, change bank addresses for banks. So at one point I was doing this and it was getting tired. And the person on the other end kept, shall we say, making some small errors and it wasn't going through. And I was getting more and more reactive and frustrated and I just watched myself. I couldn't let go of it. I wanted to be there. And I couldn't believe that I wanted to be there going, what the fuck? I just told you. Here's the right address. One, two, four. I was, and I just looked at that and went, okay. I must make an appointment now with... With who? With Mark Epstein. Oh, yeah, right. A psychologist. Psychiatrists. Forget psychologists. You can prescribe. Yeah. Anyhow, yes. Which reminds me of the show that you don't watch, Ray Donovan. I told you about it. After he tries to kill himself at one point. So they had to get him a psychiatrist. Turned out Alan Alder played the role. Yeah. And I'll really help you. And Ray, here's my card if you want to call me. And he never calls me. And then by the end of the season, though, after he's killed 14,000 people and gotten the shit beat out of himself and beat everyone else up, right at the last minute of the last show, he takes his phone out, he gets the card of the psychiatrist, and calls him and, are you ready, Ray? Yep. Are you ready? That's how I feel after all this shit. I'm ready now. You're finally ready. I'm ready. For what? Just to face, as we just said, head on some of these psychological things that I am sure I've done the broom sweep on. Okay. Okay. So I think, and so for everyone, that's extraordinarily important. And again, back to this thing with Ram Dass that I introduced. It's true. You can't have the openness and spaciousness that Trungpa Rinpoche talks about in relation to, say, meditation. If you've got wrong motivation, it can't happen. You've got to dig back in to what those motivations are. I think I don't understand you there. I think I disagree with you there in the sense that- Well, that's two different things. Well, I mean, one or the other, both, I don't know. But like, I think that you sit down and you stay still for however, whatever length of time it is. And within that, you start getting a sense of the world you're creating, the way your mind is like processing and outputting and creating a world. Within that is the bad motivations. Is, within that space, the bad motivation, it all becomes clear. You have something to read. Yeah, I will, but I want just to address that. In fact, and we get a bad motivation, I don't like bad- All of it. You know, just motivation that is uneducated. I just saw a sticker. Uneducated action, karma. Say it again. Uneducated action. Oh, karma. Yeah, I thought it was great. Anyhow, so it's uneducated. Just say it's uneducated. It's intention. You're going into something and there's some subtle way down deep. It's not like, okay, I'm going to meditate, so I'm going to be enlightened now. It's way down deep where there's a, an effect is supposed to happen. There's something supposed to happen. Even if it's just, oh shit, I actually could watch my breath for two minutes. Unbelievable. You know, whatever it is. It's, Joseph Goldstein had a great thing about this expectation. We did a whole podcast about this expectation, this motivation, so it's not bad, but it's supporting the ego structure. Well, this I want to talk about. Wait, let me, let me just finish up. The, so it is, it is doing that, but at the same time, you are right. And what's happening is you're in the doing of it. These other states can come that actually undercut the bad motivation. Well, eventually you're doing it for the right reason. It's the difference between, I think we talked about this. It's the difference between a fish shitting in a bowl and a fish shitting in the ocean. People don't complain about fish shit in the ocean. Plastic and stuff, they complain about fish shit. No one, I mean, I can't even think of a time I've seen fish shit in the ocean. It's too much water. So to me, this thing that we're talking about is that, that we are dealing with the situation of hyper compression into something that we think is our identity, which is really just tuning into a very dense feeling state that if you start unraveling it has within it all the psychological stuff that we're talking about in past life stuff, probably at all that stuff. But the, this is what Trumpa says compares to, he says, you know, you walk around the, you walk around and suddenly it feels like everyone's like, everything's against you some days. The horns, you're a car horn and you think it's someone beeping at you. You see a thing and you think someone's glaring at you. He's, this is happening relative to a practice and he says, suddenly you begin to get the suspicion that you're haunted and what you're haunted with you begin to realize is yourself. You're haunting yourself and this is, as he puts it, quite natural and is normal because on the other side of that is this thing that he calls the remembering. It's a remembering state. So in other words, like that moment that happens when you're sitting, that, that moment, I think he calls it the fourth moment, the gap, the liminal state. That fourth moment that happens where suddenly just out of who knows why or what or when or why, it just happens where all of a sudden, just for that wonderful moment, suddenly the liberation moment happens. And in that moment, it isn't all that bad motivation. It's just, you're here, you're here, you're here. Yeah, you are, yeah. And, and so even let's say a motivation that has a cause behind it, hoping for an effect, it produces that state which, as I said, undercuts that kind of motivation. Then it just, it just dissipates. Here's the thing with the- Before you eat that, Roku, just to finish the Trumpa point because there's an ending point to it. These two states, as he puts it, the fourth, whatever you want to call it, the moment, the in-between moment, the gap, this place where you're like that, whatever that is, and all the bad motivations and good motivations, you can't have one without the other. In other words, for an identity to exist, for you to exist, for me to exist, for this to even be happening, we need the bundle of stuff, the bad motivations and all that stuff to meet this other thing, the awareness field, whatever you want to call it. What I'm saying is the two- Yeah, of course, it's why we're in a body, it's why we're in an incarnation that has all this stuff, which is perfect for us to use to transcend, you know- No, transcending. This is where I think, this is what I'm trying to get at, is there is, the reality of it is this thing that we are with all the bundled motivations and all the shit that's good and all the shit that's bad, my fucking anger problems, my latent alcoholism, my fucking, you know, evading reality to go into psychedelics or go into like, you know, trying to be a famous person or trying to be a fancy person, or all the stuff that is part of the Duncan Trussell package, unfortunately. All that stuff, right? This doesn't change. No. But the, what is, that stuff is so dense and loud that that other thing that he's talking about gets drowned out. That's all I'm saying. So these two things, what I'm saying, these two things or at least what I'm thinking these days is that if I give up the project completely, which was my original conceptualization of what is possible, in other words, I'm going to be loving awareness now or I'm going to be this or I'm going to be that. If I give it up, I think that's the courageous part. I was walking down the sidewalk today thinking, man, what if I just give up all this spiritual bullshit? Like literally just give it up, like forget it. It was a phase, whatever. It was just a thing that happened. Give it up. What would happen then? It was really an exciting moment because I'm like, whoa, that's crazy. Because all of us, the courage part, I'm sorry, I want to get to the courage part. The courage part is Jesus is in the blind man or the rich man. The rich man comes to Jesus and says, I want to follow you. And Jesus says, okay, give all your stuff away and we'll go hang out. And the rich man is like, I can't give all my stuff away. And Jesus says, well, it's easier for a rich man to get through the eye. It's either for a camel to get through the eye of a needle than a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven, right? Now everyone interprets that as if you have a lot of money, you're fucked. But really what it means is what is the thing you value? What is it for you? It's your new Crowley Baba stories. It's your satsang. It's the community. It's all the stuff that you really cling to and value that make you special. What happens if you give that up? Not in the sense of like, I'm finding a new, literally abandon it. Abandon all of it. Who are you minus all that stuff? What do you become when you drop the entire load? That is the purpose of all of this, isn't it? And you know what? Your Duncan trusselness is not going to change. You are right. This is it. You got it for the rest of your life, right? Yeah. Isn't that a relief to be that hopeless? It's not a relief. No, it's not a matter of hopelessness. It's a matter of like trungpa. I mean, I was in places with him more than once, and you could tell that his trungpaness, he was not stuck there. He was not glued to that thing. He was, and that's where we all aspire to get to. It's not like the raguness is not going to change, you know, whatever my personality or your personality, I mean, what's going to change and what has been changing, it just took a little bit of a, I don't know why, a left turn here. Not really because it's given me more, much more bullshit to work with, but the glue starts to loosen up and you're not attached to that thing, to that story, to anything. Yeah. Trungpa exemplified that, you know, because he was way out there in the world with his suits and all the shit that he was involved with, with Saki and the multiple partners and all of it. Yeah. I mean, he dug his way, and of course people judged him big time for it. Sure, of course. But the reality is I could see that he had no glue with that Trungpa-ness, and he was delighting in it. He was having a good time. That's the best. And he was, yeah. So he was, the gap between thoughts, this is from Mingjur Rinpoche, who is just phenomenal. We've talked about him. I did this podcast. Anybody out there hasn't seen, never mind listened, seen Mingjur Rinpoche with Krishnadasa and I, because we, you know, we video everything we do. So just to see this level of clarity, awareness and love is extraordinary. You get to see somebody's really living it. He said, the gap between thoughts, like the gap between breaths or moods, allows us to glimpse the naked mind. That's what Trungpa's talking about. That's what you were just talking about. The mind that is not obscured by preconceptions and patterns of memory, it's that fresh glimmer that startles us into a wakefulness and reminds us that clouds are temporary surface concerns and that the sun shines whether we see it or not. Exactly what you've been trying to say, right? Noticing the gap. It's trying in italics. The noticing the gap introduces us to the mind that does not reach out to grasp a story of loss or love. Or a label of fame or disgrace or a house or a person or a pet. It's the mind liberated from those misperceptions that keeps us stuck in repetitive cycles. It's the best. That's the best ever. And to me, it's like within that is so much, there's so much such an interesting series of sort of implications based on that. And I just love it so much. Because what I love is just this idea of like, okay, okay, okay. We all have our bobbles and bells and whistles and glittering fakes and stories and all that stuff. If you and me were billionaires, for example, let's say, and we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of the woods and our phones aren't working and we're lost. The money is nothing. And the whatever, similarly, if you and I are heroes of sorts, you saved a bunch of kids one day and I saved a bunch of kids another day or something. If we're in the middle of the woods and we're lost, the kids saving doesn't mean anything. And similarly, every single thing doesn't mean anything, literally, to the point where the only thing that really would matter is that moment and how we are there. That's it. That's it. It doesn't matter. That's what I love about it. That concept is so beautifully blasphemous. Right, because to get back to the spiritual bypass stuff, really what we're talking about is you're not doing anything. Just face it. You're chanting and all your nonsense. It's not much of anything. I really like that. It really isn't a thing. You're just roller skating around. You're doing backwards roller skating with your Mala beads or whatever. You're showing off your fancy tricks. You're pretending that there's a bank account where you store your japa that every single time you do a repetition of the Holy Name, it gets clinked in some imaginary metaphysical bank account that builds up to some point where at some moment suddenly you gain some transcendent knowledge. All of it is complete, absolute horseshit. There's no medium it's getting stored in. There's no storehouse of your good chantings, your good meditations. You're not getting abs and some metaphysical astral body. Once, if we were to present, if that was the presentation in the beginning, which I think is the honest presentation, then I think that people would be a lot less disappointed down the line. Because if you go to someone, you're like, you're not going to get better. This isn't going to change. You're not going to get some, you're not storing up this and that, all of that stuff, that idea that you have, it's all just not what it is. You're literally, you should go to the gym. Just start working out. You need to go work out. Start painting and become a really great painting. Okay, wait, wait. Run that back. I mean, really. I mean, the reality is people, you're too complex. People get in pain. They suffer. We suffer. Okay? Terrible suffering. Feeling of separateness, loneliness, all of it. So you look for community. You look for, you read a book because you're looking for something that's going to give you a perspective that you so far have not encountered. You did that. I did that. That's true. Right? And then you start, so then you do start to do these spiritual practices. And you are, yeah, you're told to meditate and get one pointed and you'll this and you'll that. Yeah. All of that goes on, but it doesn't matter. You know, it doesn't matter because you have a path, a Dharma, every one of us does. And every one of us has a guide, whether you want to call it a guru or anything, you know, something in intuition that you, you're open to that's not colored by your, your judgments and wants and repulsions and all of that. So this thing happens on its own that, yes, it does hopefully proceed to the point where you actually go, wow, I am not believing in my thoughts the way I used to. I am not reacting and judging the way I used to. I am now, I got, I did some psychedelics and I have the idea that, yeah, no, we are really connected. And what does that mean? And you do further investigation. Shit happens on its own and it has its own momentum. That is the, that is a, it is our true nature and it evolves in that way. You know, there's this great story. Again, something we've probably talked about before. Ram Dass says to Nincor Obama, isn't it true that karma and grace are the same? Okay. Action. Whatever actions are going on that you are doing, they are completely within the universal Dharma. Okay, sure. Okay. You know what he said? No. He said, I can't talk about that in public. What? Ram Dass went, what? And then he went back and he sat down for a while and he goes, I don't know. I'm sure that karma and grace are one and suddenly a messenger came, Dada, and said, Maharaj told me to tell you, oh no, Ram Dass had thought it can only be that karma and grace are one, action within grace, the universal Dharma. It can only be that. And then he was sent a message, tell Ram Dass he and I understand each other very well. So I asked this question to Siddhima, of course, decades later, maybe only within the last 10 years, probably 10, 12 years, I said, I told her the whole story and she said, there is no way that a human in duality can understand that concept. So you act like it is not true and then wait. So that's a big thing. That's the mystery. You got to respect that and go, okay, that's why I love his holiness, the Dalai Lama and his whole thing around secular ethics. You don't need to be a Buddhist. You need to be kinder, more compassionate. So we work on that. And my religion is kindness. All that stuff, I mean, again, let me just try to say it in a different way because I'm not saying the retreats are a waste of time or anything like that. I'm so lucky to have come into contact with the spiritual community and for a lot of different reasons, one of them primarily being that if finally someone was able to get across to me, something that got me to start sitting every day and that like that, just that was great. And I'm so glad that happened. But within that place of a really wonderful thing has happened, which is that it just does not seem special. What I'm saying is I'm not saying it doesn't seem special. It's not a big deal. And to me, that has been one of the greatest things is that really the like and hilarious to me is all of my God forsaken egoic spiritual bypass bullshit, which is to basically apply like a crunched gym or an equinox gym ethic to the spiritual path. You know what I mean? A sense of there being anything that's going to be different. I was talking to a friend of mine and he's like jokingly was like, I guess you don't get angry in traffic now that you meditate. And I loved it because I was able to say now you're I got bad news for you. It's not going away, man. I didn't say that. But what I what to me, it's like the bad news is the good news. The bad news is where the delight happens. The bad news is where finally you really make friends with yourself. Not make friends in a bullshit way. The way like a fucking phony ass spiritual piece of shit, crystal bullshit, sanctimony is fucking velvet glove on iron freak makes friends with you, which is the friendship of someone coming to you like they're a field medic and they found you blown apart on a battlefield and they're going to like sew your poor ass back together. That's not friendship. That's power and control and bullshit. But the friendship of someone who's like, I like you just the way you are to me. That's the best. That's real friendship and that's fun. Then you can start having fun because okay, wait, I like you just the way you are. Maybe we could have a different mantra. You're just fine. We're doing fine. You're just, you know, we're human and it's fine. You freaked out at the fucking driver who cut you off, whatever it is. That's okay to immediately put in a different tone. You see, it's all about how we talk to ourselves, right? It's just thinking about how you talk to yourself. God, I just, oh my God, I just freaked out. On the way here, okay, this is terrible. I had some business with somebody and I was, they had what I considered intensely wrong view. Okay, about a piece of art that we were using for promotion, right, a video. And he kept on a certain tack that I felt was very, very much part of self-cherishing. Because there was, what was involved was, you know, somebody that he would lose, that would lose faith with him and he was more concerned about that than anything else I felt. So at one point, I couldn't take it. I started, are you fucking, I started yelling at this guy, okay? And then I was like, oh my God. You know, in that moment, it was, you get into the self-departure. Oh Jesus, what's wrong with, you know, that kind of thing. Yeah. Whereas, okay, it's okay. Back into a nice little pool of warm water, perhaps, for a moment. And then, and then, yeah, it just happens. And you're right, it just happens and we all do these things all the time. But here's why I want to add something to this point, because this is something that just occurred to me. Because like years and years ago, years ago, years and years and years ago. Years and years ago, this was like, you know, an hour ago. And for you, like, yeah, I mean, I haven't been angry in years. I'm just kidding. I'm just making a dumb joke. I'm calling your wife. Some time ago, I was working, you know, I was helping somebody out. He was making this video and he was editing it. And we were like at a place that you had to pay for to do the edit. I got very frustrated because the machine that we were paying to work on wasn't quite working. And there were people there from this place, you know. And I felt bad for my friend, you know, he was stressed out about the thing and so I blew up. And I was like really like, you know, lost it and it was embarrassing. And then afterwards, I kept thinking about the way I acted and how number one, just like how it didn't help the situation at all. Number two, it mainly just made people feel bad. But then what you're talking about was happening, which is the echo of the thing in my own mind. So anyway, then I was thinking about this, me and Nick turn to do this thing at Samarasah Studio in Echo Park. Sometimes we just have a, we talk about, you know, practice or Buddhism or some shit. And like, I was telling him, he's like, well, what's your intention for stuff? And I'm like, I don't have intention, man. And in front of a whole big group of people that goes, that is bullshit. And it was true. It was deep, absolute horse shit. I was feeling all like lofty and fancy and I wanted to be fancy by having no intention. I have intention all the fucking time. It was just nonsense, really. I was just jabbering, trying to seem special or something, which I'm good at. And he are not good in this case. It was wonderful. It really burnt my ass though. For days, I was thinking about, I don't have intention. And then I started thinking like, you have fucking intention. And then I started thinking, well, wait, what is my intention? And then I began to realize how muddy my intention was that I was basically taking my absolute confused state of having a sort of rotating list of weird intentions that change from moment to moment based on not much of anything. I was pretending that was a high state of, I guess, some glorious, holy ambivalence or something. You know what I mean? I love that holy ambivalence. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a good place. And I realized like, oh, the problem is that the truth is that it's not that you don't have an intention. It's that you have so many various intentions that you couldn't name one in the moment so you just said, oh, there isn't an intention, right? So then, as I was reading about this gap that he writes about and also reading Trump talking about like how the way he makes decisions is by being in the moment and allowing something to arise. And then I realized, oh shit. Because this whole time I was like coming up with very dramatic ways of apologizing for this outburst. And I was coming up with lots of ways, just crazy ideas of how to apologize, insane ideas, plans. I was writing emails. I was like, you know, how do I express my remorse? Yeah, yeah. Really, like I was mapping out a whole drama around the thing. And then all of a sudden I realized, oh shit, what if I just have the intention that I'm going to try to express gratitude to the people who are working so hard in this place the next time I see them. That's my intent. My intent is gentleness and that, and then don't worry about it. Right. And see what happens in that moment. For me, this abandoning all that stuff and just grabbing a very simple intention. Right, that's what you're trying to get at, which is absolutely wonderful way. It's a great perspective instead of the rest of the stuff that we tend to. What a relief, right? Because then you don't have to do all this football level game planning. Yeah, exactly. It's really quite a joy to get to that point, or for me it was. Again, it's also about having a little bit of trust, faith, whatever you want to call it. I like trust better. It leads to real faith, which is a very difficult word for us to really understand. But to have that, we are being taken care of. We are okay. We've got our stuff and we came in with it and we've developed a lot more since we came into this body. And it's okay. We're so judgmental. I am so judgmental. Like yelling at that guy today. I mean, jeez. I had a moment where that gap was nowhere near to be found in that moment. And I know now that chasing it is just absolutely counterproductive and meaningless, empty. It's nothing and just being with it. And that's the courage to just make that turn. Okay. Here I am. This is what it is. That turn feels so fucking vulnerable sometimes. That turn is like, my God, when you really make that turn and you end up doing it, I love the turn that you're talking about because you don't just make it once. You have to keep making that damn turn, depending on how fucked up your steering mechanism is. You know what I mean? You might have to hold the wheel all the time. But that turn to me, I love it because when you're making the turn, people maybe will pop up in your head. You might literally have someone, I have people when I'm making vulnerable turns like that who influence me, who like usually like hyper masculine people pop into my head or like, what are you doing, you pussy? You can't do that. What are you just going to give up here? You're right. What the fuck? Let them know not to fuck with you. I don't know why, but Aubrey Marcus came into my mind when you said, what the? I could see him there because he's so, you know, in the gym, Aubrey is just fantastic. But he's very sweet. But I know he's the sweetest guy alive and not to be in the Aubrey Marcus club, but I It's a great club. It's a great club because he's fairly honest with himself and that's what I love about Aubrey. Yeah. So. But you know what I mean? I'm saying the turn is funny because as you're making the turn, it kind of knocks out like in the way when you're making a turn in a cart knocks up dirt. That turn knocks up all these mental things, which is like the first of all, the person who even gave you the impression that there was a turn to make or you know, the boundaries become clear. That's what I'm saying. Big as well. That you know, there's a turn to make that you know, you can always start over. That's Sharon Salisbury's big thing. Just know you can start over. It's okay. You got that. We got it. It's human. You can start over all the way down to the very last second. You can start over. I love that, which is why I love like particularly abandoning. This is why I love the Bhagavad Gita verse. Just abandon all varieties of religion and surrender unto me. God, Jesus, that's such a great, great thing to think about, which is like the invitation is forget it added to that as the, you know, he was attached to the flowery words of the scriptures as like someone who drinks water from a well and it flows everywhere. These are two reminders of like, if you have the guts, not just to give up the obvious shit. I mean, on one level, think how easy it is to give away your money, give away your car, give away all that stuff. You know what I mean? I'm not giving mine away, but in a weird way, just think how easy it is. Like if someone came to you with a gun and they were like, give me your fucking car, you can give that up. If someone's like, you can give up all your material stuff, but now think about the other stuff that's a little more difficult. For me, it's like, well, I don't want to give up. I'm a podcaster. Don't want to give that up. No. What I don't want, and this is why I like the name of this new Rom-Daz documentary. Becoming Nobody. Yes. Yeah. Because it's like, really, not become nobody in the sense that you happen to be a nobody that everybody knows is a nobody. You know what I mean? Don't become a famous nobody. Become a nobody. Yeah. Into the background. What about that? Can you do that? Can you sink back into the background? It's more than that. And the best example I have is my example with meeting Rom-Daz the first time. Because in that moment, physical encounter, there was nobody but me in that room. He wasn't in that room, the Rom-Daz-ness. He had the ability at that time to just, I mean, now, even, he would do it from time to time with people. He may not necessarily have been doing it all the time. It took him to where he is now, where he is all the time in that place of not being Rom-Daz-ness. There's no somebody. And in the embracing of me in that moment, I got full on trust, full on trust that set me up for the rest of my life. Can I be honest with you about something? That's one of the most frustrating things about Rom-Daz to me. I want him, like, when I'm around him, he is truly like what you're saying. And it's one of the most remarkable things ever to witness a person who has pulled this, I don't want to call pulling it off because it makes it seem trite or something. It's not like you did a jump rope trick. But simultaneously, my ego gets really squirmy around it and in the sense that when you're around someone, you know, else is like that. What's his friend? He wears the kanga hats. He lives in India. Who's friend? Rom-Daz's friend. Your friend. Oh, KK. KK. KK. Similar. Yeah. Similar no-bodiness. Yeah. And what's really fun when you get around that is if you're a somebody and like me, all fucking wanting to like blow trumpets all day and bubble machines and fog machines, laser lights, mugs. I want the whole fucking thing. And you get around that emptiness that isn't giving you what you want. It's like my baby. Yeah. Right, same thing. I want him to fucking smile, man. Give me one flash, please, just one pure, beautiful ray. I love what you said to your baby. You know what, Forrest? You better love me because if you don't love me, I'm not going to love you back now. You get that, Forrest? Yes. Yes. I love that. But again, I just want to say, I think that in our minds, we build up people like Rambaz to be walking human rainbows. We expect them to blow rainbow light out of them to be these kinds of like things that we picture it. And when you encounter that kind of emptiness, you can only see your own like the fish on the. I got that. Yeah. Yeah. And that can be a very, very like. I know. And that's all great. And you know, but the reality, the reality for us, I mean, Romdus is definitely in a very advanced state. There's no, no doubt about that. The reality for us, littler chickens here is that when you make that turn, the courageous turn to face whatever. And in my moment with this guy, I did by the end of the conversation, I made the turn and obviously I had calmed down. And I just, as I made that turn and was a bit kinder in my tone, in my speech and everything because I was an unkind, he got receptive as well. He got kinder. So what, when you stop, you stop you, that's the becoming nobody. You stop the you, you, you, you, you know, John Leuker, you, you, you, you know, that's God, you stop that and the whole world changes. And it's, it's, you know, that's right. By the way, that thing you're saying there, because the idea is that, that Krishna Murthy thing I really liked, which is that theoretically, if you're carrying the disorder around the moment you're not you anymore, you see a world where there's no disorder. Yeah. Right. And it's back to that. Yeah. And to me, that's a pretty wild thing. Because living in a world defined by order and in disorder, and maybe that's that world that you're not supposed to talk about where karma and grace are the same thing and maybe that's not supposed to it. Not understandable through rational mind. That's all. It's not that we can't talk about Maharaj said that because he, he's living that. He's living non-duality. I mean, that's why they call beings like him Siddhas because they're actually living in non-duality, but still maintain a body by the love of their, they have for their devotees. And they all have certain soul pods that Ram Dasa, you know, each one of these beings. And they do, you know, we're all little, look at us. We're all little puppies. They're puppets. Puppets or puppets, puppets. Puppy puppets. You know. That's a creepy situation. Yeah. I don't want to be a fleet of puppet puppets, puppets. They're the puppiest of puppets that I ever saw. You are right. I think I've merged with the Buddha Buddha and become one thing. Can you tell? Can you see how? Don't you see how I've become nothing? Don't scare me now. When you open those eyes and they're cold. Hey, so how about this? Glorify my nothingness. Glorify, bow down to my nothingness. Yeah. We'll do a video on that soon. I'm really the best at being nothing. No one's better than me at being nothing. I've won the most nothingness-based being award. I want to do a meditation now. Okay. Okay. Because we're at the end of our festivities here. And I have gotten a transcription of a guru meditation from Ram Dass, since we're talking about him, from my son Noah. And you ready? Yep. Okay. Now, oh, one of the things lately, by the way, we've been discussing with our brethren, teachers like Jack Hornfield and Sharon Salzberg and Joseph Goldstein. They've raised the idea of, don't worry so much about meditating a half hour, an hour, 40 minutes, whatever. Start doing mini-dose meditations, a couple of minutes here, just like step out, unhook from your mind for a moment. You mean like micro-dosing acids? Like micro-dosing acids. Same thing. Except you just purposefully, with intention, step out, unglued from the mind. So this is one of those kind of meditations. It's going to be very brief, okay? With your eyes closed. Because I only have two minutes. Two minutes. I'm just kidding. I know. You're busy. No, I'm not. I was a bad judge. I'm making bad jokes. All right. Yeah. Don't worry. We'll edit them out. With your eyes closed, okay? Start to experience this body of light, of compassion, of love, of consciousness, growing in size. Just feel yourself expanding into the center of your being. And just feel simple caring and kindness. Start to experience more and more of the universe as within you. Everything you can think of, say, I am that too, tat tvam asi, I am that too, everything you can think of, I am that too. And when you've moved out in space, in all directions, until there is no space, you can conceive of that you aren't. Now move in time, backwards. Everything you can think about in history, tat tvam asi, I am that too. Now, future, all possibilities you could imagine, bring them all within yourself, bathe all of the future and all of the past and all of the present and all of there and all of here with self illuminating radiance, with compassion. See within yourself all the polarities, all the goods, all the evils, all the beauties and all the uglinesses, all the yin and all the yang. And now, of course, you include me and I include you. So in this place there is only one of us and this voice and this air is part of what we are and within us all the laws of the universe are reflected in all of the forms. And if I am it all, then the word I has no more meaning because there is no not I and so there is no I. There and now there is only is-ness, just being, just being. That's kind of a nice overview. That meditation is everything we are talking about, where we want to get to just being. I like the part about the gentleness, that's cool, the kindness, the compact, I like plugging into that place. I am that. We are everything and it's okay. We have it all. You think it's weird? I don't like guided meditations. Is something wrong with me? Yeah. No, I don't know. What do you mean you don't like them? I thought, oh my God, I thought, I'm thinking while I'm reading this and I'm being in it and I'm feeling every note of it and I'm thinking, wow, Duncan seems so absorbed, isn't it wonderful? And now you're telling me it was a piece of shit. I didn't say that. But I do like it. I just like, I end up thinking I get stuck because in a guided meditation, they'll say a thing like expanding everything and somewhere in there, I'm like, what the fuck is that? How do I do that? And then it's like, well, am I? You need special instructions, okay? So expand it. It's like Braille. You're going to need some help, okay? Expand into, it's just like letting go. It's like letting go of this, of mind, you know, of you doing in this thing going, what the fuck are they talking about? It's too advanced. I'm telling you, and I don't mean that in a humble way. That's really advanced. That's what y'all do anyway. You all forget, like some of us are truly like preschool or like literally like I'm just enjoying just sitting still and like next time, we'll do a meditation where there's no guidance, but it's not very good on a podcast. It's unfortunate, but we'll have to figure it out. There's going to be a guided meditation in front of this one that I will do. You will? Okay. Yeah, it'll be a good one. You turn into a giant vegetative plant and like you turn into the sentient sap oozing out of it, but it's a different style than what you're doing. But I do love guided meditations. I mean, it's a big thing right now with that, those apps and stuff. Yeah, no, it can really help. Especially actually, I mean, these are, you know, what he said had so much in it that's more than a meditation. It's something to absorb. Right? This is my problem. I'm sorry, y'all. That was a great guided meditation. My mind is so messed up that as you're talking about expanding into everything, I'm like, I got to expand to my house and my wife's going to kill me. Yeah, right. Okay. I'm sorry. I can't expand there. I understand that. And since I'm going with you, I don't want that to happen. So kill both. Yeah, she'll kill us both. Okay. Thank you very much, Mr. Trussell, for joining me here and... Thank you for letting... I don't mean... Sometimes I think I come across as like, edge-lording, as it's called. In other words, I'm going to say something blasphemous and edgy to be fancy. I don't mean to be... I'm so lucky to be friends with you and all of this... No, I've really taken to heart this thing about the guided meditation. I'll never do it again. No, I just don't want the people listening to your podcast that they got being an ass. It's not that at all. I really am... When I am meditating and I do get lucky enough to get to the point afterwards where you know you're expressing gratitude to the universe or trying to like put any attention... Expanding into space. I think of you all the time. I think of how lucky I am to have you as one of my teachers in the world. Yeah, no, I'm lucky to have you as a friend and everybody out there listening and how much joshing we do and all of that. But the reality is what's developed between us, not just the work and the friendship and the love that is a current through it all is really wonderful. So... That's how I feel. All right. Cool.
