Why are there goats? Why are there goats? Why are there goats? Why are there goats? Why do you have all this? I just wanted to listen to a podcast. I love a parade, looking at the clowns, dancing around. Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Greetings, friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour Podcast. And let's start this episode off with a prayer from Reverend Randa Nemo. Thank you, Duncan. My pleasure. Well, pray for your listeners now. Thank you. Dear Lord, hear my prayer. Allow the listeners of the DTFH to open their third eyes and to receive the great transmission. That eternal, unsensorable signal, the original pirate radio, drifting into the earth realm and disrupting the demure, just malefic plans to keep them glued to fear, to keep them on the sticky trap of anxiety, to make them think that all there is is the material domain. Please free them from the dark psychic manacles that have kept them locked to any dynamic that doesn't allow them to achieve their great potential, the eternal unfolding, the great birthing, the ultimate expulsion of that tendril. From the seed they thought was their identity, growing forever and ever into the infinite bliss light of love that is all things, and also make sure that every single person listening to the DTFH is eternally baptized in the waters that saved all those before us, those sweet waters that the demiurge and their rotten minions want to keep all to themselves. Allow the listeners at this moment to gain true noses to realize that they are untrapable, un-murderable, and ultimately lovable forever and ever and ever a man. Wow, thank you so much, Reverend. That was beautiful. Thank you. It was my pleasure. My friends, we have got a glorious podcast for you today. The great Mitch Horowitz is here. We're going to jump right into that. But first, this. Much thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I've been using Squarespace for years, and I love them. And I don't just use them for dunkatrustle.com, which has been called by many the most beautiful website that ever existed, not just in this part of the multiverse, but in all multiverses. But anytime I get a ridiculous idea for a fake website to make, I use Squarespace because they're so easy to use that you can build a website in seconds. They have mix and match templates, and you can just put something together if you just want to get a proof of concept based on whatever the insane domain name was that you happened to have bought when you were super high. Not to sound cheesy, but now websites have become a kind of canvas that you can paint on. It doesn't just have to be your business. It doesn't have to be some professional endeavor. I can't think of a more chaos, magic, friendly form than web design. And when I was coming up, it was a pain in the ass to build a website. You would have to start chomping Adderall and try to learn HTML. And you would find yourself in a dark vortex, completely fucked after you'd spent hours working on a thing, only to realize that it wouldn't size to the right size on certain phones or devices. Squarespace sizes to every device out there. You don't have to worry about any of the technical stuff. They handle it all for you in this incredibly elegant way. Give them a try. You will love them. If you're thinking about building a website for your business or maybe you just want to give your mom a cool website for Mother's Day or maybe you have some other idea, maybe you want to sell your socks online. I have a friend who sells her socks online. Whatever your reasons may be, Squarespace is there for you. So head over to squarespace.com forward slash Duncan and give them a try. You can try them out for free. And when you're ready to launch, use offer code Duncan and you'll get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Again, that's squarespace.com forward slash Duncan and use offer code Duncan when you're ready to launch to get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. They're amazing. You can either, you can gather emails and you could use Squarespace to design email blasts, which are essentially like zines. It's like the modern zine. I love them not just because they've been my longest sponsor but because they really are a high tech bad ass service that allows you to bring whatever is in your brain onto the internet. Thank you, Squarespace. Darling children, come join the DTFH family over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Take a cliff dive into the sweet pool of mystical amniotic fluid that is the DTFH Patreon. We've got everything you could possibly want. You want to gather together and do video gatherings. We just did that today. You want commercial free episodes of the DTFH. We've got that for you. And every month I do an extra hour long rambling yap if you want that whatever your needs may be. I invite you to head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Also, we have face masks in the shop at dunkintrustle.com. Now, my dear friends, with us is a DTFH favorite. I love hanging out with Mitch. I'm kind of bummed. Well, I'm bummed about the pandemic for many reasons. But one of them is, you know, you start making friends with somebody and you figure I'll be hanging out with him and then fucking pandemic and you don't get to see him in person. Mitch Horowitz is an author. He has written many, many great books, including Occult America and The Miracle Club. He recently wrote a really brilliant, very controversial article for Medium called Forgiveness, A Descent. And we talk about that in this episode of the DTFH. He also is a great public speaker. And if he's ever in your area after the pandemic ends, you should definitely go listen to him, give one of his amazing talks on esoteric topics and the occult. All the links you need to find Mitch are going to be at dunkintrustle.com, including a link to his Medium article, not to give you homework, but maybe read it before you listen to this conversation. Now, everybody, please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family, our podcast, Mitch Horowitz. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be blue, welcome to you. It's the Dunkin' Trussell family. What is that sigil behind you, by the way, just so I don't have to think about it? Oh, that is a sigil that was created by the Temple of Psychic Youth, Tope, Genesis Peorage, and Jacqueline is making a documentary about the life of Genesis, and that was something that Genesis had designed. They were, that tote bag was like a giveaway to people who contributed to a Kickstarter campaign for the film. Cool. Yeah, good to see you. Okay, let me, good to see you, damn this pandemic. I know, is it not a motherfucker? Your kid's okay, I take it? Yeah, thank you for asking, my kid's great. How's yours? They're fine. How many sons do you have? Two boys, two boys, 13 and 15, they're fine, they're fine. I was sick, I had it, but I'm doing well. You got COVID? Yeah, I did. What's it like? Oh, it sucks, the thing that really sucked for me, and listen, I can't complain because I had a mild case of it, but it lingers, the fucker lingers, you know, and it's like you think to yourself, okay, I'll sleep, I'll rest, I'll be appropriate, I'll knock it out of me in two weeks, now six weeks, six weeks, and it really lingers when it gets its claws into you, and I'm one of the lucky ones, because my case was quite mild. Oh my God, it's really weird, because we're now at this, you know, I was listening to a NPR interview, and someone was saying that, I guess she'd written a piece called, you know, something about, it's Georgia's experiment in human sacrifice, because they're reopening Georgia. Oh yeah. A lot of people are going to die, because they're reopening, but also, it's also an experiment in human sacrifice to not reopen, in the sense, you know, it's another way of killing people, because it's so unnatural for us to be stuck in our houses, and people don't have jobs, and they're going insane, so no matter what, we have been, it's so bizarre, that in some crazy way, we have all been forced into deciding how we want to do this weird game of Russian roulette, which is do we wait for people to go broke, and, you know, people who are being abused in their homes, to get murdered, or do we let everybody out, and then we just know a certain number of people are just going to die, or going to get sick and die. Right. It's such a terrible decision. It's true. What do you think is the right move? I wish I knew, I wish I knew. I mean, all I can say is that, in shoulder to shoulder conditions in New York City, and with two kids in the house, I guess I err on the side of extreme caution. Yeah. At the same time, I'm also lucky, because, I mean, sure, it's inconvenient for me, but I have writing deadlines, and I have other things, so I've taken a hit, but it's not like it deprives me of my livelihood. Right. If I was deprived of my livelihood, I would have a probably different perception. Yeah. Yeah, that's the craziest part of it, is you see people who have so much privilege. Yeah. Like saying, stay at your house. Right. Don't go out. And it's like, yeah. For me, your shrill attack, or yelling at me, it's annoying, but yeah, I'll stay at my house. I can't, I podcast. I can, right, right. I'm friends with a barber, one of my best friends is a barber, and he can't open his shop. And if he does open his shop, he's got to worry about getting sick, because he's going to be around people, and his employees getting sick and stuff, but it just seems like most of the people saying, stay inside. They're in a place where they can stay inside. Yeah, that's actually a very good point. I wish. I mean, I just don't have the slightest idea. I mean, I think probably by the middle of this month, we're going to start to reopen on a rolling basis, regardless. People are going to start to just reintegrate into society, especially as the weather is nice. It's very, very hard to feel threatened when it's 70 degrees outside and the sun is shining, and you feel OK. And it's probably just going to happen. It's just going to happen. Well, let's get this podcast going. Let's do it. I want to start with some COVID conversation. People are fucking sick of it. Aren't they? Let's dive in. Yeah, yeah. One second. Mitch Warwitz, welcome back to the DTFH. It is so great to see you. Likewise, man. How you doing? I'm doing good. I'm doing good. Today was a mother, because like everybody else on Earth, I'm adjusting to the new reality that we're in. And I've been lucky. But it goes day by day. Today was a tough day. And we've got to be frank about this. People in this culture who are regarded as thought leaders and spirituality have to drop the mask and talk about the ways that they're vulnerable and suffering and sad. And this was a motherfucker of a day for me. But I'm feeling better seeing you. And I hope your listeners are feeling good. I mean, I know that people are going through a lot of trauma. And some days, it's OK. And some days, it's tough. And we're all living with a big question mark. Man, I know what you mean. It's like there is this. I think that's one of the I'm sure you experience this a lot. You can find yourself being shoved in to some horrific cubby hole if you're not careful. Where people, yeah, they want you to be perfect. They want you to be not, they want you to demonstrate all of their super ego, all the qualities of their super ego. They want to project that on you and for you to demonstrate it. And if you don't, you know, they get severely disappointed in you. You know, and I like I do feel like, especially your POV and your voice, what I love about it is its realism. What I love about it is how pragmatic you are when you talk about these like very big ideas. And I think people it's good for people to hear that because the last thing anybody needs right now is someone pretending they're doing great and they're somehow adapting to a global pandemic when inside they're going completely fucking nuts. Because that is them. That to me, I can't think of anything more malevolent than putting that out there in the world. Oh, no, I'm doing great when inside you're losing your shit. Right. And a great many people. And I know because I've seen the sausages being made, a great many people who are regarded as thought leaders in the spiritual culture on any given day, any given Tuesday, when there's not a pandemic, when there's not a tragedy, they fall to pieces just with regular everyday anxiety. And we have to get past this theater that people are permitted to project in front of their congregations or in front of their audiences. I feel it's very important that I show vulnerability to anybody who wants to pick up one of my books, anybody who wants to listen to me on any topic. Not because I want to be morbidly self-disclosing, but because I'm perpetuating a lie if I indicate to any listener or anybody that I meet that somehow I'm the man with the plan, you know, and that all these spiritual ideas are just making everything great for me. I'm a seeker and I have my successes and I have my failures in terms of trying to lead a powerful and self-directed existence. But I do find that there's so much theatricality with therapists, with ministers, with spiritual authors. And we don't have time for theatricality anymore in our world. And I also I mean, I call out therapists to the therapist, the minister, the spiritual leader, people like me, you know, who talk on podcasts. We're all engaged in this kind of theater because we're showing our best selves. We're comfortable in public. And whenever I hear a friend coming to me and says, you know, my shrink says I should do this. My shrink says I should do that. My question is, is your shrink doing that? Is your shrink demonstrating that in his or her lived experience? Of course not. Of course not. You know, we all are sort of operating from the same place. And I think we need to start thinking in terms of one another as co-seekers. There should be mutual respect, but as co-seekers, because you've had the experience of interviewing dozens upon dozens of people who were regarded as thought leaders, motivational leaders, therapeutic voices. And I'm sure you've had the same experience where, you know, you catch one of these guys getting cut off in traffic or a waiter, getting their order wrong or their french fries coming, you know, not well done enough. And they freak out, you know, and I think. OK, wait, let me tell you something that happened to me once. This is the opposite. I was so I was like, I got cut off in traffic. I swear to God, Mitch, it's so funny you say that. Or I cut someone off in traffic. I think I cut someone off in traffic. I was in a hurry and I cut someone off. Yeah, I don't know. I wasn't thinking. I don't know why I was. I was being a dick in traffic. So I get later that day. I got a Twitter message from someone being like, hey, you fucking cut me off in traffic, you fraud. I'm like, I have definitely done a great disservice to. I was thinking like, what have I done? Yeah, that I have conveyed over the course of my podcast, the impression that I don't cut people off in traffic from time to time. Right, right. Like, I think it's more likely this person had not listened to enough episodes of the podcast because I try to disclose. Absolutely. Most anything I can. Because I don't I do God forbid somebody should start thinking you're the type of person who doesn't fuck up. Right. God, what a hellscape to find yourself in. But it was really shocking to realize that this person had put me on. It had done something that I've read is considered an aggression, which is to put someone on a pedestal. That's considered one of the most aggressive things you can do to someone is ask them to partake in that shitty game of make believe. It's horrible. It's it's horrible. And it's also one of the reasons why I actually don't block anybody on social media, including the guy who five minutes before the show called me a freemasonic child killer, because I feel like, first of all, if I block people, getting blocked is like giving a scalp to a troll. You know, trolls live for getting blocked. So you don't want to give them that little trophy. But more important than that. There may be, you know, one out of a hundred of these people who misjudge, who name call, who mud sling, who are violent, who are cruel, who are miserable, one out of a hundred who might actually see that, you know, you've never projected a fake image to the public. I hope I haven't projected a fake image to the public. If somebody sees me lose my shit or somebody sees me behave like an asshole or be rude, then they can call me out and they can say to me, you know, you insulted me, you put me down, and I will hear them and I will listen to them and I will weigh it. But I would never want to project the falsehood, the fraud that a person who doesn't do that. And I worked in spiritual publishing for many, many years, and I would have people come into my office crying because they had just got torn a new asshole by somebody who spent 30 years in meditation or somebody who calls himself a spiritual activist. May that word be erased from the fucking lexicon. And I hosted this little talk show called One Simple Idea, which was like a streaming New Age talk show. I probably interviewed, I don't know, 13, 14 spiritual leaders, some famous, some not, of those interviews. I would say two were authentic, two were authentic. And the rest were just bullshit. We're just somebody giving these 15 minute platitudinous answers. And I thought to myself and I, Duncan, I wasn't brave enough to do it. I wasn't brave enough to do it. But I remember one of the people who's giving me these 15 minute answers. I kept wanting to jump in and say to him, I know you personally and I know your life and I know you get pissed off when your books don't appear on The New York Times bestseller list. You get furious, fairly well known person. Yeah. And he's projecting an image to me and to the listeners of non-attachment, non-identification, thoughts without a thinker, the observer, looking at the thought, looking at the individual. But all of that, it's fraud because it's not enacted when the person experiences pressure on Tuesday afternoon at two thirty. When the person learns that your book that is sold really well didn't make it on The New York Times list. And maybe that's not fair. Maybe that's not fair. Maybe it's because somebody likes the political commentator more than they like the new age guy, and that does go on. But you got to take a hit once in a while. And I knew that this person, when he takes a hit, he gets very fucking angry and emotional. But he wasn't showing that to me and my listeners. And I thought, how's that? How's that helping anybody? How's that helping us dig? So I want to try to be transparent. I don't want to perpetuate that. Yeah, man, you know the story of Ram Dass in the porn theater? That's familiar to me, but tell me, because I forgot it. He he tells a story of how he he'd gotten back from India. He'd written B here now. He's in line to go into a porn theater, I think in either New York or San Francisco. Right. And somebody walks by and sees him and doesn't somehow doesn't realize this the setting just because they're taking like, holy shit, it's Ram Dass. He wrote B here now. Yeah. And they're like, Ram Dass, your book, it changed my life. Oh, my God, I just want to thank you. I so much I have to say to you. And he like he talks about how he had this moment where he realized that he could say to the person, let's go talk at a cafe. Yeah, you know, he could try. He could try to evade what he was actually doing. Yeah. And be the act like Ram Dass to this person. Right. But he knew that the moment he did that, he was setting up. He was what he was doing. It was it was a nightmare for him and for that person. Because like you're saying, it's like completely not true. So he I wish I could find this lecture when he was talking about it. But what he said to the guy is like, thank you so much. I would love to talk to you, but I'm going in here right now. You know, I'm going in this theater. Yeah. And I love that. That has always been a model for me because because it's it's for me, as far as Ram Dass goes, that's when I really connected to him. Yes. It's like, OK, you're admitting you go to porn theaters. Right. Right. I don't even go to porn theaters. Right. You know what I mean? That's like, OK, that's not true. I've been to like two porn theaters, I'll be honest. But like, you know, I mean, it's partly generational. You know, but I was curious, who goes in here? What are you going to do? Who does this? There's the internet. What are you going to jerk off in a booth? OK, I'll try to see what happens. It was actually kind of exciting. But my point is like that, that to me was such a cool, powerful, empowering thing for him to put out in the world. Because so many of us are tormenting ourselves with this myth, mythological. What's the name of it? What's the cool name for like a Bigfoot or a Loch Ness Monster? What are they called? What are they called those things? Crypt, what's that? Yeti Sasquatch. No, there's a there's an overarching name for mysterious animals. It's a cryptozoology or something. Yeah, sure. I don't. Anyway, the point is like, it's like there's a Bigfoot. We have a spiritual Bigfoot among us, something that you know people who've met them, but you've never met them. Right, which is this perfect being wandering through the spiritual forest. Right, that like you've never laid eyes on, but you keep hearing about it. And then you I think your encounter with these people through your your job has been you've like over and over and over again. You've witnessed the reality of their humanness, which you don't have a problem with their humanness. No, your problem is they have a problem with their humanness. Yes, and dig this like if I could ask if Ron Duss was still alive. And I could ask him one question and I felt assured that he would answer my questions sincerely because I don't want to ask him or anybody else a question unless it's going to be answered bluntly. What I would really want to say to him is Ron Duss. I know all about serious ESP research. I know all about neuroplasticity. I know all about quantum theory, at least as a student. I know there's an extra physical dimension to life. I know that spirituality insofar as it's the extra physical is real. I know that. But what I want to ask you, Ron Duss, is this 40 years of meditation. Was it was it worth it? Did it make any difference? Did it really make a difference to the people who are around you every day? You know, did it make a difference in their life? Did it make a difference in your life? And I mean concretely on Tuesday at two o'clock in the afternoon. And I'd like to get a blunt answer to that. I really would. Have you seen Fierce Grace? No, I know of it. It's great. It's good. You should watch it. It's so good. Yeah, it's about a stroke. But he one of the things he says is like he has a stroke and he's been preparing his whole life, you know, meditation is the preparation for death. Yeah, he has a stroke. And basically he says nothing, nothing, nothing happened. Like there was no he it's it's almost an answer to your question, at least in that moment, which is that in that moment, he freely said all this work I've been doing seemed to really not matter in that in that moment. And, you know, to me, that again, that's like, wow, holy shit, how cool here is a person. And by the way, I'm not sure that you could even say that he was a proponent of meditation because if you look at many of his talks on meditation, he sometimes says, don't meditate. Don't he he said he's don't inflict it on yourself. He seems to be more in that camp, you know, where there is the meditating that the I don't know what you call it, people who advise meditation like some kind of aerobic exercise or something like that. Yes, yes, yes. He seems to be more in the there's a great conversation between Krishna Murti and Chogyam, Trump or Rinpoche. And he seems to be more in the Krishna Murti camp where he's basically Krishna Murti says to Chogyam, Trump, why are you telling everybody to meditate? There's enough problems in life. You're going to add this extra thing people have to do. And Trump, there's a beautiful dialogue between the two. But yeah, I think I don't know what he would say to that. But I think he would probably he probably I don't remember him ever doing. I could answer with this weird story. When people were hanging out with his guru, Nirmal Baba, they would go off to do vipassana retreats. And the story is they would come back from the retreats. And one of the things Nirmal Baba said to them is. Did you learn how to meditate? And then he did like a impression of meditating and just laughed really hard. I I dig that, you know, I dig that. Now, in as much as we can prove anything by statistics, we've proven that ESP exists. I mean, I could walk through the data. I won't convince any skeptic. No skeptic would look at it. He would smash Galileo's telescope. So that's not going to be very productive conversation. But you know, I read about this in the Miracle Club and other places. I could walk through all the data. And we possess evidence in as much as statistics can prove anything that there is anomalous transfer of information in laboratory settings. ESP, telepathy and so on. We can prove through neuroplasticity that thoughts alter brain chemistry, which in and of itself upends materialism. I mean, materialism doesn't work because the central thesis of materialism and it is a thesis is that matter recreates itself, matter recreates itself and that there is no. There's no intelligence outside of localized brain impulses. And when the brain is gone, your intellect, your psyche is gone, just like bubbles are gone and a glass of carbonated water when the water is gone. That does not hold up because what we see in neuroplasticity and that's just one very elementary field that's not controversial is that sustained thoughts alter brain chemistry. So we're at a point in our generation where people can hold on to whatever beliefs they want, but materialism no longer covers the basis of life. So nobody needs to come to me and say, hey, man, spirituality is real. I know it's real because I know that we have an extra physical existence. And I think we all participate in that. But with that acknowledged, with that acknowledged, is the meditation helpful? Is the liturgy helpful? Are all these rules and doctrines that we've set up within the historic faiths, within Eastern faiths, within Western faiths, within new religious movements? Do they matter? Do they matter? Now, if someone steps up as an individual and says to me, yes, they matter because I've been meditating for 30 years and I'm not violent anymore and so on. I want to hear from that person. I'm not trying to create a counter-orthodoxy. I want to hear from that person. But I've been on this path for a long time now. I have very serious questions about many things that we take for granted, such as the benefits of meditation. I don't I don't know that those benefits are there. I don't know that they're there. I haven't verified that. We, you know, I listen and I've done it, you know, it's like, I know I'm going to get the emails and the tweets like, hey, motherfucker, you know, have you meditated, you know, get your spirit on, you know. Yes, you know, people always assume that when you come to a different conclusion that they have, it's because you're not familiar with something. You know, it's like, well, you got to read this, well, you got to try that. And it's like, maybe I've tasted it, but, you know, I don't respond to that taste. Man, it reminds me of when, first of all, I think any time you find, I've found myself pushing meditation, something is off in me. Like that something's gone south in my own practice. If I ever am pushing that on somebody else, I'm usually trying to fix them. And usually what I'm doing is a kind of passive aggressive admonishment of them as a person. I'm like, you know what I mean? I'm sort of like saying you suck, but I'm doing it in the most disgusting way. Instead of just saying you suck. It's terrible. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I'm just stipulating wildly, you know, because I dig. Yeah, man. That to me is the. The. It is so it is such a form of violence, by which I mean like emotional violence against another person, you know, you need to read this pamphlet. You need to meditate. You need to get right with my version and definition of God. Over and over and over. And when you're and when you tell somebody, no, who's bringing you that trip, then you see who they really are, you know, when somebody offers you love and you say, no, thank you, then you see who they are. And it ain't pretty. It ain't pretty. Well, I would counter that. I don't know that that's love, like that's not love. In quote marks, you know, it's like this, like going over, going to someone who you think isn't in the type of shape they should be in and like giving them a shake weight or something. I mean, like, hey, I bought you this exercise equipment. It's lame. Fuck you, man. I don't like I'm happy the way I am. And I don't need you to come like trying to change me. So this is why I was the, you know, the Ramdas camp in general. Or what Ramdas says is if you really want to help the people around you, work on yourself, don't work on them. Like, what are you going to do? Like, what's your plan? You're going to start with them and then you're going to like somehow by getting the people around you to meditate. Now you're going to be a better person. That's insanity. No one's going to look. No one's going to, and no one's going to do it. I've never, as far as I'm aware, in my missionary phases, which I am embarrassed to say, I've had more than a few. And I've been on the phone more than a few times with friends when I've been a little drunk or stone, telling them some spiritual shit. And inside I'm angry at them, but I'm not saying I'm fucking mad at you. Or I wish you were, I'm telling them, man, you know, it's all spiritual bypass. You know, it's me trying to avoid a confrontation by inviting them to some practice, which I'm not even doing. So this is always, but that being said, if I were going to make an argument for meditation, which by the way, I'm not, I think the best thing is if you don't want to meditate, don't meditate. You weren't going to like it. Don't do it. Right. Why, why would you want, don't do it. It's not a cure. It's not as, there is no cure. And also if you've gotten in your head, you're going to get a benefit from meditation, then you're, it's going to be even worse for you. But personally, the, the practice of meditation personally, all you could say is anecdotally personally, when I am meditating there, I do, I think I, I feel a measurable increase in creativity and my ideas come to me more. And I feel like also if I'm sitting still, I'll notice more that I'm like where I'm at, you know, it's easy to trick yourself into thinking you're not angry, you're not scared, you're not anxious, you're not, whatever it is, because you're busy, but somehow sitting still makes me realize like, oh fuck, I'm really scared or I'm really upset or I'm really sad right now. And I've been running into my busyness to try to avoid this like paint, painful feeling. And then also I've noticed if I'm meditating, which by the way, full disclosure, I haven't meditated in three months. And my meditation teacher has said things to me along the lines of Duncan, you know, I'm teaching you meditation, right? Yes. So if you're not meditating, what does that say about me? I love him. He doesn't shove it on me. He doesn't force me to do it, you know, but it's, but I would say that personally there are, it does seem, there does seem to be a correlation between me meditating and other people around me suddenly seemingly, suddenly becoming miraculously less irritating. You know what I mean? I dig that. I have not meditated in a long time either. I maintained a very, very steady meditation practice for many, many years. I have recently stopped for reasons that I have no great, um, Testament around. I, it was a preference. It was simply a preference. And what I have been working with recently are very situational things. Like I feel that it's profoundly important for myself and I offer it to others. If it's useful, my exercise over the past, I would say a year has involved, um, getting away from cruel people. I think human cruelty is something that we're afraid as a culture to talk about. We're all diagnosable, you know, somebody has depression, somebody has anxiety, somebody has OCD, somebody has whatever you want to call it. And you can use language from psychopharmacology, the DSM, cognitive therapy, Freudian stuff, whatever you like. We're all diagnosable. But human cruelty is a real problem. People get angry. They demonstrate hostility. They intimidate other people. They gaslight other people. They trash talk other people. They deny other people's pain or trauma. And it occurred to me that sometimes we are under a tyranny of therapeutic and spiritual handed down wisdom that says we have to fix ourselves. We can't change other people. It's easier to wear slippers than to carpet the world. Forget the world and change yourself. I'm not denying that some of that thinking doesn't have applicability in given situations, but I think it's overused. I think it's overused. And I think, yeah, certainly for myself, and I would extrapolate, I don't think my case is exceptional. I have found that switching venues, switching venues and getting out of relationships that cause agony is just the closest thing I've experienced to a revolutionary change in my life, revolutionary. And I can't be exceptional. So I've been really working with that. Man, see, this is the double edged sword of any spiritual practices that it produces such an opportunity for what could only be defined as cowardice. And then it's not just cowardice, but you disguise it as like some form of like self-crucifixion. In other words, you imagine the shitty situation that you're in, you must bear it. And the reason you must bear it is because of some weird premise that you have that you've earned it karmically. And therefore you're instead of doing the most obvious thing, which is to get the fuck out of it. Well, you're being abused. What are you doing? You're being crushed. Your soul is being crushed. Go, you've got to go. This is not a time for you to sit and burn incense and do prayers. You're you're in a you're in a hellscape that is undeniable. And it doesn't matter what prayers you do. You're still in a shit situation. You've got to go. You've got to go. And you and yeah, you got to go. I think this is important for kids, too, because sometimes kids are in situations, young kids, adolescents, they're in situations where they're being torn down, they're being picked apart. And they don't realize they don't realize, even from a young age, that they have the opportunity to completely get away from someone or something that's tormenting them. If they're in school, for example, and there's a bully, they may not physically be able to get away from that person. And that's another problem. It's a whole different set of circumstances. But if they don't like the gang that they're hanging with in the neighborhood or the peer group or this or that or the other thing, you know, we possess more capacity than we know to just say no, turn our back and walk away. And I mean, do it clean, burn that bridge. Watch it burn beneath your feet so that you can never go back. There's power in that and it's positive. And I just don't want people to be around situations, especially casual situations that they feel are familiar or that they have to put up with maybe a friend who's passive aggressive towards them. The individual doesn't have to put up with that. They can change and they can do it almost instantly. I agree, man. I mean, this is this is when I, I learned this thing too late in life. I wish I'd learned it soon, but it's this like madness of putting up with, you know, it's so many times you could find yourself around someone who, you know, maybe is like a type of artist that you really respect, but they're monstrous. Or, you know, a person who like in some way or another, you admire, but your admiration of their creative output is somehow, uh, give it, giving them this like bizarre hall pass to be complete bastards to you. And it's, it's so, it's such a, I've done that. I've done that in my life and I've certainly, you know, working in entertainment. I've seen people who could only be described in this. Thank God it really is an anomalous event. Like in general, I've been thrilled to find that the archetype of the shitty Hollywood person who's like a real monstrous ego bastard or whatever. It's generally that you don't find that. Usually you just get around people who you want to be best friends with. And you realize, oh my God, their energy is such that everyone who's around them wants to be their best friend, which explains their ascent into a very competitive industry, just cause that's how they are. Like they're so sweet and interesting and charismatic. That's your drawn to them. But that being said, from time to time, you will run into people who have an orbit around them of some of the most miserable, drained people that you have ever seen in your life. In the archetype for it in fiction is the, um, uh, Rinfeld. You think of Rinfeld, this poor thing wants to be turned into a fucking vampire is never going to be turned in. It's like in prison, eating worms or whatever. He's like just a mess and he's been a slave to this, this vampire. And there's some sick hope in the Rinfeld that at some point the vampire is going to give them the gift of immortality. So when it's when you run into this kind of entourage, which is a vampire slave entourage, you will encounter exactly one of the qualities of a cult, which I'm sure you're aware of, which is that people in a cult will start looking like the cult leader. That's one of the things that you'll see. That's watch out. If you see someone who's like got a circle around them, whether it's a dad whose kids are dressed and look like him, or whether it's a freaking, you know, famous person and the people around them all look like him, run for the hills. You've got a bad situation. It's terrible. I've never really encountered that in my world, but that's really creepy. That's creepy. Oh yeah. It's, I mean, it's, it's, it happens. And it's, it's one of the most bizarre things to see someone with an orbit of people who all look like them. Cause you're like, holy shit, your charisma was so powerful that the people around you who tolerated your shit were essentially forced through some manipulation to gradually turn into you. Cause your narcissism is so profound that you can only deal with being with yourself. Scary. Look out, they'll get you. But you know, that happens in lower levels too. You know, just anytime you're around somebody, I loved your article on forgiveness, man. And one of the things you were talking about is friction and friendship. And like the, the importance of that friction, the importance of being with people who have, you have friction with, you know, the importance of people who you spark off of, you want that. I don't want to agree with all my fucking friends. I want to profoundly disagree with my friends because that disagreement produces all kinds of creative moments. Yes. Yes. And it, and it's probably the case that without friction, we would be emotional and intellectual children. Friction pushes us into situations that make us more formidable, more capable, more powerful. And I was riffing off of a statement by William Blake who said, opposition is true friendship. And ever since I've started grocking to that statement, it's helped me to see things in a different way and it can take a really long time to like, here's an example, and this is relates to the question of environment, what we were talking about just a few minutes ago. I have a lake house in upstate New York. I live in New York City and I have a lake house in upstate New York and I owned it for about 15 years and I had a neighbor who was a rib prick. He used to make wisecracks all the time. And he was just inconsiderate and he was a real asshole. And like, I would receive a steady diet of wisecracks from this guy, never liked it. And I kept trying to be a good neighbor back to him. I kept trying to be positive. I, I kept trying to do all the things that spiritual people are supposed to do. I would, I would pray. I would visualize. I would wish him well. I would recite affirmations. And I just hated the motherfucker and nothing made it better. A fence didn't make it better. My prayers didn't make it better. You know, finally, I just realized that not only did I have to get away from him, but on those occasions where I'm around him, I don't talk to him. I ignore him. You know, I completely turn my back on him and that's fine. That's positive because we're just not part of the same pack and we're never going to be, but it took me that long to realize that you don't owe your courtesy, your spiritual practice, your understanding to somebody who is directing hostility towards you and you certainly don't have to sit around analyzing it or getting into some morbid self-reflection about it. What you need to do is get away from it or just freeze out the other person. But if it weren't for that guy who is a pain in the ass and a bad neighbor, I wouldn't have learned that. I wouldn't have learned that. I don't want to go out and have a beer with him. But if I didn't go through that experience, I wouldn't have learned something that's improved my life and maybe will improve life of somebody else. If they listen to it and say, hmm, that sounds like a good idea. So that's one very small example. But I think that if we didn't have friction in life, what would we be? I almost see that as the esoteric lesson behind the expulsion from the Garden of Paradise. If Adam and Eve remained in the Garden of Paradise, they would be kept poodles. You know, what would it amount to? And the snake who came and told them the truth, yes, we're going there. Yes, we're going there. The snake who came and told them the truth about the situation and who said to Eve, what kind of cruel, horrible keeper is this who tells you that you can eat from every tree in the garden except the tree of self-awareness and who tells you you'll die if you eat from that tree. You won't die. You'll be more like him. So Eve eats from it. Adam eats from it. Neither of them die. The snake told them the truth, but they're expelled from so-called paradise. But in being expelled from paradise, they become actual human beings. Otherwise, what story would there even be to tell? There would be no need for scripture. Everybody would just be sitting around kept. But how annoying they didn't make it to the second fucking tree. You know, if the serpent was really cool, he would have been like, eat the second one now, hurry, because you're going to get kicked out. And then we'd all be fine. Dig this story is like, dig this. Somebody got really pissed off about me about this. But there's a line of reasoning with a mainstream Christian theology, not, you know, my like, you know, sort of like dark side reinterpretation of all this stuff. There's a mainline Christian theological argument that sees the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of good and evil as being one and the same, as being one and the same. So that's sort of an interesting thing to deal with. And that's come out of mainstream scholars. Whoa. Yeah. In other words, they did. They ate all the bad fruit that there was. Like that was the forbidden fruit was one. Well, the forbidden fruit was the fruit of life, was the fruit of life, was the fruit that made them into sentient beings, into capable beings and brought friction, you know, so you Eve gives birth initially to two sons, Kane and Abel. There's an active fratricide. We think, oh, you know, this is tragic. This is horrible. This is the degraded human condition. Is it maybe friction is part of the human situation? And that's how it is. What do you know this? I love this concept of the kept dogs. Like, I love this idea that had they like not listened to the snake, suddenly we end up with this like, what exactly what? Yeah, that's I've never thought of that before. You end up with these like cute little like aquarium poodle people who are just naming shit in this aquarium and this the whole thing is like really, really bizarre. And, you know, it does lend some credence to some of the Gnostic ideas that you hear, which is like, no, you are trapped in a kind of the same kind of jar. They put fireflies in like that was a some kind of weird God that caught these two beings and was like, just planning on eternally fucking with him for some reason. And, you know, also another way to look at it would be any way you look at it. This is what I wanted to bring up regarding your article. It leads right into a question I have for you. We haven't spoken much about this incredible essay you wrote regarding forgiveness, which is in medium right now. I'll put the link at DuncanTrussell.com. But essentially the premise in please correct me if I'm interpreting it the wrong way. But to me, the premise basically what you seem to be saying is this concept of forgiveness being a kind of spiritual law that you should always forgive no matter what is madness. It's the result of that kind of thinking is how could that be good for anybody? It can only result, if it were even possible, which I'm not even sure it were, what does that do? Some of my great moments of learning in my life have been when I've heard a friend and they don't forgive me. And I realized that I'm not going to be forgiven in this lifetime. I've fortunately only had that happen really once where I've spoken with a friend years and years ago, hoping there would be some like, yeah, it's OK, man. I forgive you. Hoping there would be some pardoning of what I'd done. And he didn't. I really respect him for it, but it hurt. But but from that act, it taught me a lot about how important it is to really have an ethical moral code, you know, to really try as much as I can to not hurt people. It really I learned from that. And I'm not saying that had he been in that moment forgiving of me, I wouldn't have also learned it was just something about that type of teaching that he gave me. It was very, very powerful. And he and I did this day are great friends. But which which also, you know, one of the things I want to talk about is you could still be friends with someone and not forgive them. That is true. You could still maintain a connection with a person and feel some like animosity towards some stupid shit they did, and that doesn't mean that you're not friends anymore. So yes, I really love love the essay that you're writing. But I wanted to chat with you about the concept of sentience and forgiveness. In other words, in the Garden of Eden, here we have Jehovah, which is theoretically some omniscient omnipotent being, meaning that this being is fully aware of all probabilities, making the decision to put two semi sentient beings into this weird aquarium situation and present them with some kind of bizarre test, which they could only fail. If you really think about it, they could only. It does kind of produce a condition within which that being that put them there could only be described as malevolent, right? Like that's that's that's my outlook. It's a force of absolute conformity, orthodoxy, enforcement, a demand for absolute fealty. And it strikes me that if it weren't for disobedience, first of all, there would be no scripture at all. There'd be no Beatitudes. There'd be no Sermon on the Mount. There'd be no Ten Commandments. There'd be no Psalms. There'd be no Proverbs because there would be no problems to solve. What human friction would need to be fixed, addressed? What inventions would be necessary? There'd be no pathos and there would be no humanity. There would be no humanity. So it strikes me that the weight of conformity that was visited upon these not yet human beings was exactly the force of a kind of pre-birth, pre-aware, pre-sentient, not yet formed life that has been mislabeled paradise. And that was actually pre-existence, without which the human being wouldn't. We wouldn't exist. We didn't exist until the snake. We didn't exist until the snake. That's my creator. Yeah. There you go. This is, you know, I this is a question I want to ask you. I was hesitating to ask you this only because I it's an annoying question, but I would love for you to answer it because you're one of my friends who is a Satanist, I'm friends with a few Satanists and I love them. And I'm not. I don't identify as a Satanist. And we love you, Duncan. Thank you. Some of my dearest friends have been Satanists. And, you know, I don't I don't. This is a really embarrassing thing to say. I don't get offended that much, please. But one thing that inevitably offends me is when people say that if you are a Satanist, therefore you must be hurting children. Satanists are abusing kids and I always get it really annoys me because like I'm friends with you. I'm friends with other Satanists. And one thing I know about all of you is you don't it's you strongly are advocates for children and wouldn't hurt kids. So I wonder if you could address this particular critique of it's not only total fiction, but it's a fascinating polarity in a sense because it teaches us how we displace things that are going on in one quarter of society to another quarter of society that is usually seen as the polar opposite. So, dig, during the 1980s and 90s here in the United States, as well as in Britain, we had what is now called the Satanic Panic. And you had all these innocent people being accused of these bizarre horrible ritual crimes. It was complete fiction. And it has been acknowledged as such by a consensus almost all across society. It ruined people's lives and it was a profoundly damaging, widespread fraud that was based on this false premise of satanic ritual abuse of kids. Now, what was going on during the 80s and 90s? What was going on? You had a huge unreported or underreported sexual abuse of children going on within the Catholic Church. You had a huge un- or underreported abuse of children going on within the Boy Scouts of America, so much so that today the Boy Scouts of America has declared bankruptcy to shield itself from lawsuits by adult survivors of that abuse. So that today there are more than 20 Catholic parishes or Catholic organizations that had tutelage over children that have declared bankruptcy to protect themselves. Now, I'm not pointing a finger exclusively at the Boy Scouts or the Catholic Church because there's corruption throughout our society. It's not any one group or it's not any one sector. But the manner in which we digest corruption that we can't deal with is to force it off to its polar opposite. So hence, during those years in which these scandals were unfolding but hadn't quite yet broken the image of the robed, ritualistically abusive satanist took shape in the mind of certain therapists, certain law enforcement folks, certain not very discriminating reporters. Always look at the opposite end of the polarity. Always look at the opposite end of the polarity. One of the things I write in my piece on forgiveness that seems to have created both misunderstanding and pissed off certain numbers of people and that I stand by entirely is I am not a Christian, but I am a better Christian in conduct than most of my detractors. And it's that simple. It's that simple because I'm not looking to throw rocks at people. I'm looking to try to understand things. I'm looking to be left alone to embark on my own search for truth and I will only guarantee my neighbor that I will leave him alone too to do that. And as I see it, the life I lead is a lot less violent than the life of most people who claim to be speaking on behalf of something that they think is somehow scripturally anointed. Wow. Yeah. I mean, that is, I think that to me, this is where I get really confused about Satanism, which is that, and I've said this to other Satanist friends of mine, I've said to them, you seem more like a Christian to me than a Satanist. It's crazy, right? Yeah, there's like a, there's a really strict ethical code that I respect a lot and there's a really, there's an adherence to that that is very powerful and good. And that has within it this quality of sweetness and has within it a quality of the liberator, which is this idea of like, any place where you find yourself trapped in some archaic, shitty, antiquated, abusive dogma, a Satanist is trying to pull you, if anything will try to get you out of that, you know, using these symbols that seem to be associated with Satanism, you know, but think of to me, I just think of all those people who for them Christianity was completely eternally, probably rightfully obliterated, because they were forced to, you know, suck a priest dick, like suddenly, you know, here is this scripture that for me has within it a lot of powerful, beautiful, magical qualities and what could be more evil than a being convincing a thing that is so young, there's no way it has the ability to discern that it's being tricked into thinking that number one, it's a representative of that teaching and number two, after convincing the being, it's a representative of that teaching to then sexually abuse that being producing all the effects of sexual abuse, which is generally a form of rotten, pathological, terrifying, horrific subservience, you know what I mean to the point where you're what you're looking at is like, if you really want to talk about evil, it's not a snake telling to proto hominids that maybe they should try out sentience instead of being beaten down by some patriarchal, malevolent, eternal, fucking aquarium keeping monster, it's somebody wearing an embarrassing outfit, making a kid give them a blowjob in the name of scripture. To me, what's more evil than that? I mean, that's like nuclear bomb level. Somebody else of doing that, accusing the Wiccan who's a librarian of doing that, accusing the Freemason who coaches Little League of doing that, and that person is innocent. So you're creating even a whole other set of victims, not only the poor, helpless being who you've just abused, but by association, the Wiccan librarian, the New Age high school teacher, the person who's not doing anything to anybody suddenly finds him or herself under this kind of cruel scrutiny. Now, I would also say that with regard to Satanism, of course, there's a broad spectrum of outlooks and points of view. Some people would describe themselves as ardent atheists, for example, who only use satanic symbols as a kind of cultural rejection of religion. That's not me. I do take a spiritual view of life. I do think in terms of deity, I do think our ancient ancestors possessed wisdom when they identified energies within nature. They personified these energies. They sought relationships with these energies. I believe in that. I practice that. And I ultimately view Satanism within the Western rubric as a force of radical nonconformity, usurpation, emancipation, a absolute rebelliousness and anti-heroics that pushes back against whatever the dominant power structure is, not as an end to itself, but to ensure that we don't wind up back in that aquarium, which is supposed to be paradise, but which is actually a jail. Oh, my God, that's brilliant. Oh, that's the most, again, this is where my brain gets so scrambled, because it's like, again, what you're talking about to me is Christian. It's Christianity, because maybe that's how satanic I am, is I'm so confused when I hear it. I'm like, God, that's how I understand Jesus to be. That's how I understand love and liberation to be, because to me, what is more fucked up that you can do to a person than to convince them they're in heaven when they're in hell? What is that's the most diabolic thing I could imagine if we're considering diabolically an oppressive force? And psychologically, isn't that what gaslighters do to people? When you deny somebody's pain, when you tell them you're too sensitive, it's all in your mind. Isn't that a reenactment of exactly what you're describing? Oh, my God, you're right. It's so crazy. And I think this territory we're in right now, it really is the forbidden landscape that people just try to keep their minds from going to. And where it gets even more obscene is that people are encouraged to not go here. They're encouraged. Don't question it. Don't think about it. And there's many levels of that encouragement. One of the levels is, well, you're taking it too literally. It's not meant to be taken literally. But then another level of it is anything that's trying to rationalize the idea that it makes sense to take, essentially, brand new beings and force them into a mode of being that involves either subservience or revolution. It's a sick binary. It really is. It sounds fetishistic. It's abusive. I'm sorry for my Christian friends out there. You know, I do love Jesus. I really do. But there's something incredibly abusive about the Garden of Eden story. It's abuse. Because what? You're a superintelligence. You're an ancient, never-ending superintelligence. You give these poor things some pathetic shit test that they're clearly... Let me tell you, my 16-month-old, tell them not to do something and wait three minutes. That's what's beautiful about human nature. That's what's beautiful about human nature. Tell them, you know, don't touch such and such. Leave that alone. The television click. Only Daddy can touch the television clicker. Well, the television clicker gets thrown out the window in five minutes because what's so valuable about it? And who's Daddy to say that I can't touch the television clicker? It's human nature. And it's funny. With respect to this whole forgiveness question, we are told by the High Church of Therapeutic Spirituality that, you know, you don't forgive for another person. You forgive for yourself. You can't get on in life without forgiveness. You know, I've heard all these ideas and my issue is not telling somebody that's not legitimate. My issue is, let's verify it. Let's verify it. We can verify it in our own lives, but just don't hand down to another person what they're supposed to believe. I worked with forgiveness for about seven years. About seven years ago, I had a situation where someone did something that I felt was a real betrayal. And I needed, so I thought at the time, to forgive this person. And I really, really worked with it. And I'm very aware that forgiveness is considered to be at the heart of Christianity. Forgiveness to a somewhat lesser degree, but nonetheless is still deep seated within Judaism. Forgiveness is at the heart of most of our contemporary spiritualities, like Course in Miracles, the Twelve Steps. Forgiveness is considered the door of entry to realizing higher truths. So like everybody else within, on the spiritual path, I took that as a truism. I took that as an absolute. I took that as a starting point. And after a period of about seven years, I realized I am being torn in two by this teaching. I am being asked to do something that feels profoundly unnatural to me. And at least from my perspective, abiding is more important than forgiving. There's going to be friction. And that friction is going to expose things that make me feel powerless and weak and threatened. It is more positive for me to address those feelings of powerlessness and weakness and threat, which by the way may not be illusions, which may be real. It's a tough world. And it may be very healthy and positive for me to look at those things and say, shit, this is really an issue. This needs to be dealt with in the same way that if you want to get rid of malaria, you drain a swamp. That's not an illusion. That's just a fact of life. So we're taught that these things are illusions. We're taught that everything outside of love, whatever that is, is an illusion. And I began to question the truth of that. And I began to question all the truisms that I encountered about forgiveness. And I came to feel that it is not the royal road to higher truth. It can be a crippling diversion and can make a person feel very divided within. Okay, but let me ask you this. Don't you think you can simultaneously love someone and not forgive them? I think you can simultaneously love someone and hate someone. I think that we experienced a lot of that with our parents, for example. Many of us love and hate our parents. We feel attached to them for all the emotional reasons that I think we all understand. We all have attachments, but we also sometimes feel painfully betrayed. So there are people who love and hate their spouses, love and hate their parents. I do think it's a natural part of life. But being told that one has to forgive the object of hate, even if you also harbor love, that's a dictate that needs to be examined. That may be positive for some individuals. It was not positive for me. It is a atrocious thing to invite someone to forgiveness when they're not ready. And I know how I know that because I've done that to people I wanted to forgive me. I don't know if you've ever been in the situation where people aren't forgiving you on your timeline, but I certainly have. I have. And I have to honor them because if they feel I've betrayed them, if they feel I've hurt them, they are a mature being and they are entitled to hold me to a reckoning. And I have been held to a reckoning. And again, I think this notion that you have to do something, you have to pass go and pass and go entails forgiveness or pass and go entails non-attachment, whatever that is, pass and go entails non-identification, pass and go entails focusing more on the inner before you can know truth. Those are things that require verification. Those are reasons why we had to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil because we were being asked to live without verification. And the way that this gets fed back to us by the spiritual culture is to verify and then come back when we verified exactly what we've been told. If you're told to verify something and you go back to whomever your so-called teacher is and you have a different point of view, that person is going to send you away until you come back with the right point of view. If you believe in verification, then the mature individual has to be left to his own devices. So I worked with forgiveness for seven years and I came to feel that it is not something that I view as a blanket good or a blanket virtue. In fact, sometimes quite the opposite. I love it. You know, why don't we just wrap up? If you don't mind, I'm going to read from your essay. This is brilliant. I love this so much. My reason in the end is simple. I believe that the moral, how do you say that? Swation? Swasion. Swasion. Swasion, the moral Swasion to forgive often places the individual in an unnatural position and produces inner division that gets diverted into other often hostile or self-negating behaviors. That does not mean that forgiveness is unwarranted in given situations, nor that it is not yield wounds. It means only that I reject forgiveness as a blanket rule, spiritual imperative or ethical necessity. That's so liberating. I think so many people are going to benefit from that just because God, you know, I just, all of us are just sick of feeling guilty because we haven't forgiven somebody who's hurt us. And so on top of someone hurting us, we are compounding that pain by beating ourselves up for the fact that we haven't achieved some miraculous state of letting go of that anger in the timeline that some of these people are recommending that we do. I think what you wrote is like actually a very sweet, very Christian thing. I think it's a beautiful thing, not that you're a Christian. You're definitely a Satanist, but it's a very sweet thing. We have to take it easy on ourselves. Yeah. And I think we also have to reject being handed down definitions about what is and isn't real to us. You know, I think too many of us have grown up being told, for example, you're too sensitive. What does that even mean? You know, in my world, being too sensitive is good, is being positive. Every artist, every inventor, everybody who ever led a revolution was too sensitive. So I don't see that as something that needs to be fixed. And I think we have permitted ourselves to be persuaded that things in us need fixing that maybe don't need fixing. Maybe what we need is to be in a different neighborhood. And I just want people to feel that that full range of options is open to them. Mitch, thank you so much for this time. I love chatting with you. I cannot wait for this to end.

Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up, everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, oh, beautiful children of the universe. It is I, your host, D. Trussell, aka Lord Barriam. And I just want to say hello to all of you out there. I am ecstatic right now, my friends, for the nerdiest reason of all time. I've found a new office, number one, which doesn't sound that exciting, but compared to the other office I was in, which was a wonderful place. It's got way better sound quality. It doesn't echo. The other place I was in was the mausoleum and a cemetery, so everything was echoing off the marble walls, and it would disrupt nests, birds, and bees, and would swarm around me and sting me. I was swollen and puffed every day, coming home to my sweet family. But this place is in an actual music studio, in Asheville, North Carolina. I don't know how I got this lucky, but I'm here, and it's wonderful, and here's the nerdy ecstatic part. I got my modular synths out of storage, and hooked them up, and they worked. I don't, look, it's a weird thing to be so attached to something that is just a machine, but I don't know if they're a machine. I love them, and it just, I can't even explain to you how great it feels to have made the weird transit from LA to Asheville and to find myself in a beautiful music studio and a beautiful office with my sweet modular synthesizers singing. I don't wanna be attached to the world. I'd like to be some kind of Beacoo St. Robed being happily wandering through the national forests, not a care in the world, except for putting the bird's egg that I found on the ground back into the nest it came from. But it's just not my karma, I like stuff. I like gear and electronics, and I like watching lights burble and flash, and I like distorting my voice and just listening to electricity turned into sound. I can't help it, I just love it. It's like, if there was a clitoris somewhere inside of my psychic makeup, this combination of stuff would be vibrating it until my entire soul squirted. I keep thinking, like, God, you know, I'm gonna regret leaving LA, it's gonna, another shoe's gonna drop, I'm gonna feel some like aching horror, like what have I done? But nothing like that has happened yet. Only happiness and joy and just excitement and I feel inspired, the air isn't filled with smoke. You know, it's, what the fuck? Why didn't I leave sooner? I just, I guess it's just easy to think to yourself that you're above it all or something or that, you know, where you're at is where you're supposed to be, and you just stay there. I got all weird and spiritual bypassed the entire reality of what my wonderful meditation teacher, David Nicktern, calls relative reality, you know? We live in a world, you've got a body. If you're me, you've got a muscular, beautiful tan body, a body that many people, when they see it at the beach, they marvel and they tell them that I'm 46 years old and they say, you have the body of a 22 year old athlete. It's happened many a time, people will come up to me and by the, I don't mind that, you know, I understand the power of my body is probably akin to that of like a nuclear power plant in the future. And so when people see it, they're just blown away by, I am too, you know, I get fixated. I don't wanna think of myself as a narcissist, but there's nothing I love more than standing in front of the mirror pouring oil on my nips and my rippling pecs and abs and just rubbing oil. And that's what I'm doing right now, right now, actually, is just rubbing oil into my body as I listen to my modular synths. We have got a great podcast for you today. A comedic genius was kind enough to appear on the DTFH for the first time. Tom Papa is here with us and we get deep. We're gonna jump right into that, but first, this. The reason that your nipples bleed, the reason that your breath smells like pee, the reason that you don't feel right is because you don't have a motherfucking website. Squarespace, you can sell your socks online. Squarespace, you could put up a blog about vintage wine, but then when we need Squarespace, it's the place. A heartfelt thank you to the folks at Squarespace. They're one of my longest running sponsors. I think the longest running sponsor for the entire DTFH. And I'm proud of that because they are a bad ass service. Look, you wanna build a website in seconds because you're in a hurry. Maybe you're in the midst of some kind of intense manic episode. You just realized that you're the Messiah and you wanna send your message out to the world in a modern way instead of writing some shitty manifesto and leaving it on park benches. Squarespace can get your manifesto up in seconds. They're amazing. They've got mix and match templates that you can use to make a simple website or something of such complex beauty and harmony that angels weep when they see it. You can look at a website like that by going to dunkintrustle.com, which is a Squarespace website. They have got everything you need. You wanna sell your stinky socks online. You can do that. You wanna sell your fine vintage wine that you found in an old shipwreck somewhere. You can do that too. Not only that, but if you wanna do mass mails to your fans, Squarespace will handle that for you. This is a futuristic, amazingly powerful service that can get your ideas and vision out to the world so that you can at last rise to power and let the world feel your spiked stiletto dig into its trembling back as you tap dance erotically on the flesh of all humans, teaching us the true meaning of pain. True meaning of pain.com, by the way, is available. And you can get that by going to Squarespace. Give them a try. Go to squarespace.com forward slash dunkin' and when you're ready to launch, use offer code dunkin' and you will get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain.

Dear Dunkin', ever since I joined your Patreon, the dreams in which I was being assaulted by masked bandits on a post-apocalyptic highway, bandits that would take me and my family and crucify us, hanging us on telephone poles while sickening their trained predatory falcons on my wife and child. In these terrible dreams, I would watch my family slowly be consumed by falcons while I died a very painful death by suffocation and grief. But ever since I joined your Patreon, those dreams have stopped. I feel as though a curse or lifted from my life thanks to joining your Patreon. And now every dream I have involves a class A high-powered Dr. Ruth level orgasm. Thank you so much for creating the Patreon community that I can now enjoy. And most importantly, thank you for lifting the horrible dreams that you had cursed me with for not joining your Patreon and replacing them with sex dreams. Sincerely, Derek V. Derek, it's my pleasure. I'm glad to have relieved you of your horror dreams and replaced them with sex dreams. And for those of you who have yet to join the Patreon, who still find yourself in a variety of horrible nightmare scenarios every night, some people are being eaten by hyperintelligent, reptilian alligator creatures wearing robes and holding dark hypnotic lanterns over their heads while they drip acidic drool into their eyeballs and other people are feeling what it's like to be trapped in a slit in the side of a massive cliff that perfectly aligns to their body and where they live forever, eternally imprisoned in stone. And of course, some people are experiencing a classic firing squad scenario where they are blindfolded and marched in front of mercenaries and have to listen to their comrades being shot until they at last take a bullet. I don't wanna put dreams out there like that that make people not sleep well at night, but that being said, I've got a family now. And we, you know, we gotta do what we got to do. So if you join the Patreon, not only will these horrible dreams go away, but you will have instant access to hours and hours and hours of extra DTFH content. If you subscribe to the video, tears my dear loves. You can join us every Tuesday for our group meditation journey into boredom or on Wednesday for our legendary book club, which the New Yorker called an assembly of some of the most literate literary geniuses that have ever roamed the surface of this planet we call Earth. And then on Fridays, it's our family gathering where we all just hang out and yep. And of course, you'll be able to join the growing, thriving DTFH Discord community. We want you come home to your family, stop the terrible dreams. Go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and subscribe. Unless you're a time traveler from far in the past or you just stumbled out of your Nietzschean cave up in the mountains where you had some grand revelation that you're gonna bother all of us with while we try to enjoy our fucking coffee. We get it. You're an enlightened nihilist. Leave us alone. We like it down here. We like being worldlings. Regardless, unless you're some kind of monastic freak who's been holed up in some magic palace with all your monastic friends chanting, unless you've been up in the Himalayas holding space for us so that we could experience peace and not be sucked into some vortex of destruction. Unless you're some dimension hopping bard who plays flutes for hominid hummingbird creatures in some paradise realm. Unless you're a classic old mean warlock who has been hanging out in the cremation gotts of our Nasi stealing skulls and gnawing on half baked femurs. Unless you're some kind of little baby who doesn't understand English yet, just a little tiny baby who can't understand words because you're just a pure being of love. Unless you're the wind from the past. Unless you're drifting echo in some canyon somewhere. You know who Tom Papa is. He is a brilliant comedian. He's also a great writer. I'm listening.

Now everybody please welcome to the DTFH Tom Papa. Papa. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Wow, wow, wow. It's been DuncanTrussell.com. Tom, welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much. I know you just got off the road. Thanks for being on the show. That was my pleasure. You know, I love you and I love being. I love you. Anywhere in your orbit. And I know, what a cool thing to hear. You just got off the road. Oh, when's the last time you heard that? That's why I just wanna start off talking about that. Can you tell me what doing standup comedy in the era of COVID is like? Because I haven't heard any reports from anybody so far. Yeah, it's amazing. First of all, the short answer is it's amazing. I've only been going out, since we all got shut in, I've gone to four different clubs. I went to Salt Lake City, Portland, Connecticut, and this last one was in Denver. And I only go to places where I know the people that run the clubs know that they're gonna do it right. Social distance, half the capacity, testing everybody. And if the city is cool, you know, there was like, I was gonna go to Arizona and it was not cool. The numbers were rising and I just got a vibe from the place that hired me that they weren't on top of it. So they weren't gonna protect me or the audience. So I just bailed. But if I can just get a little semblance of like, this is going to be okay. I just, you know, I can't not do it. I just have, it's just too much a part of me and I just realized, let's do a calculated risk and go and do the shows. And man, you really realize how important it is, you know, for the audience and for yourself to be working through it. I mean, that's what comedy is, right? It's like working through whatever you're going through and that we're all going through the same thing, despite being different places around the country, we're all gone through the same stresses and worries and anxieties and euphoria. And there's this common thing and a comedy show where you actually get to talk it out and laugh about it and feel okay about it and enjoy yourself. Oh my God, it's just been, it's better than any of the shows you were doing like up to the end. Oh God, you're making me ache hearing about it, man. It's just an ache. Oh my God, I miss it so much. I, you know, it just, it becomes a part of you. It becomes a way that you exist in the world. And then it just, it all got taken away from us. You're brave to do it. And also it's really very generous of you in the sense that, you know, you're, whatever you are making is going to be cut in half. You know? It's definitely not about the money for sure. But you go into these places and these, you know, they're trying to stay open. They're trying to survive. And the wait staff is trying to survive. And you know, I went into Portland and, you know, the wait staff was like, they were a week and a half away from losing their apartments because they had no work. And just that they're, everybody's able to come back in some form, it just felt like, you know, when you care about these places, I've been to these places for a long time. I mean, just, you know, in Denver is the comedy works. And I know Wendy who, who owns one of my favorite clubs of all time. It's a, it's an amazing place. Amazing. And you don't want, you want them to survive. You want them to, you know, and there's not a lot of people that can sell tickets that are willing to go. So I just figured, well, let's just be, try and be safe about it and smart about it and go and give them a, you know, a good weekend and see if it's good for them. It's good for me and see how we survive. You know, I was listening to your excellent audio book. You're doing great. And thinking, this is a very spiritual book. Like this is a deep spiritual book. And it's also very funny. And I was so impressed that you figured out a way to do that because, you know, whenever I'm thinking about stuff, especially writing a book, I always get too up in my head about it. And I always think I want to make it, I want to write a book that makes people feel great, but I don't want to write a spiritual book or a correctional book or a self-help book or anything like that. And so it always just dies on the vine. But can you talk a little bit about the process of writing that book and how you managed to broadcast something so sweet and positive and real without sounding like stuffy? Yeah. Well, it kind of came off of what I was talking about on stage at the same time. And I just had this, just this feeling that, you know, I was just doing my stand up and just being as funny as I could about, you know, my stand up is mostly about like life and everyday life kind of stuff. And I just got this feeling that we, over the last several years, like there was this real anxiety that people were feeling. And I felt like we were, I was feeling it too, like through social media and spending all our time concentrating on things that were just making us feel kind of shitty. And I just took a step back and was like, you know, this is it. Like this is the prime time for us. Like, you know, we're going to get old and shitty something at a certain point. You're young and, you know, living someone else's life for a long time. This is it. This is all you get. This little chunk in the middle. Why would I spend all this time, you know, reading about politics or being fed stuff by cable news or like what am I wasting my time on? And you know what? And as I started looking at it, I was like, you know what? I shouldn't be racing so hard. What am I racing for? Like this is it. You're actually doing great right now, right here. This is what great is. It's not about what's coming. It's not about trying to get more. It's not about trying to get on a jet or all this other stuff. It's like, no, this is it. This is us doing great. And I just started recalibrating in my head what the purpose of all of this is. And I realized, no, a cup of coffee is great. Just hanging is great. Being with your friends is great. And I just started saying to the audience in my stand-up, you're doing great. Just I was trying to impart this kind of thing. I'm like, no, you're doing great in the not too far distant future. People are going to ask you to go somewhere. And your one question is going to be, are there stairs? And if there are, you're not going. So you are doing great right now. I don't care what your problem is. This is it. And people started coming up to me after the shows and thanking me. And that's when I kind of knew I was on to something. Because I wasn't just feeling it. They were feeling it. And they were thanking me for saying that they were doing great. Because they think they're trying to do all the best. They're trying to work hard. They're taking care of their family. They're doing whatever. But no one ever tells you as an adult, like, hey, good job. Hey, you're there. You're doing great. So when people started coming up and thanking me, I just started diving deeper into that. I used that as kind of the launching point for everything that I was doing the act and then for the book. And in the book, you can go deeper. But I was that thing. Like you're saying, I wasn't going to turn into some self-help guy. I just found a funny realization that this is what life is all about. So all my comedy should just come from that. And I just wanted to be kick-ass funny. And what was weird, Duncan, is that when I started giving interviews about it, people wanted to talk about that part of it. And it was like this weird balance between being really funny and also having a message that was pretty poignant. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by AMC Shudder. You're going to die. You're going to die. I'm listening to you. I'm watching you. You're going to die. Hey, look, you've got to freak yourself out sometimes, man. And I don't want to be spoon-fed. This boring, spineless, pseudo-comedy horror shit that you find on some of the other damn streaming services. I want terror, free-based, right into my main horror vein. I want to get splattered with guts and gore, feel sick and sad and confused about why in the name of God would I be subjecting myself to such absolute terror and fear.

If you can bring the two together, it is a nuclear bomb. It's so good because, but when they're not together, God, it's so easy to not be funny. It's so easy to be didactic, correctional. You know, oh, it's so easy to go on and on about some kind of arcane spiritual shit, but to like make it funny, to bring it into the world in a way people can connect to. Wow, that is a talent, man. And what a lot of, what I've listened to so far in the book, and by the way, great job doing an audio book, it reminds me of Ramdas. It reminds me of Be Here Now. That's why I loved about him was he wasn't trying to fix you. There wasn't a thing of like, hey, yeah, we gotta get you meditating, get you on a vegan diet, get you to drink more water, get you to this retreat, get you in a fasting situation. It was, this is where, this is exactly where you're supposed to be. It's the perfect place. You're exactly where you need to be right now as you are. You can give up the war against yourself. Right, right. And I love those moments where I can pull that off. I don't pull it off all the time, but that's what I would, do you think we're in heaven? That was a curveball question at the end. No, I don't think we are. I don't think we are, because there's so much, I don't know, there's so much pain, but I don't know, I don't know, that's a hard question. What is heaven? The sneaky thing about it is I'm really into TM. I've been doing TM for a long time. Cool. And that kind of is like the slow way. It's kind of like aspirin. You're not really sure how it works, but it just seems to work. And it just kind of opens up your consciousness in a way, slowly. I was just doing it to have more energy to get through the day, but there seems to be this a little more keen awareness that this is where you're supposed to be. So I don't know, is there a little glimpse of heaven in that? I don't know, but there is this kind of more accepting feeling that all this noise up here, while it's dominant and you have to participate in it, just knowing that you're also existing down here in this other more peaceful place, it does give you this kind of kind of happy feeling that this is okay, that knowing that below this noise there's something more important going on has been kind of like the end result of the TM thing. So I think it's kind of bled without even thinking about it. It wasn't a hippie-dippy trying to figure out all the stuff about TM, but I can tell that it has informed my view. Yeah, it did something. It does do something. A lot of my friends do it, and I've never heard anyone say it didn't work for me. I've never heard someone be like, TM sucked. It was bullshit. I've heard people who haven't done it complain about having to pay for it. They're like, it should be given away. I don't understand why people think like that, but anyone I know who's done it really appreciates it. But what I meant by the Heaven question is, just sometimes what I'm thinking about, when I'm able to get into the groove of just me, and instead of how I wish I were, so anything that's happening, I'm like, yeah, this is how you're supposed to feel. And even if the feeling is like, God, I'm fucking sweaty and hungover right now and just feel kind of dizzy, it's like, that's right. That's good, that is it. It's what's in your book. And then I start thinking like, holy shit, is this paradise? And the genius of paradise is that you find out that you're in paradise. You know, I mean, if you're just born into paradise, that's not fucking paradise, but it's this slow boil as you start realizing, wait a minute, oh wow, this is actually heaven, but not heaven like in the, whatever your religion may be, streets of gold, all that bullshit, but heaven in a more fundamental, primal way, which is just sentience, existence itself has some kind of quality in it of goodness, even when it hurts. Yeah, and back to what you were saying before, how like you can't do it all the time, I don't think we can do it all the time and exist in this world. Like I feel like, and I think that's what TM does, I think that just whatever people do to give you, I feel like you can, if you can just dip into it, just for a glimpse once a day, it's like the stop and smell the roses thing. It's like, you don't need some big practice to just be grateful when you're eating the strawberry to really think, to stop and actually really appreciate all the aspects of the juiciness of the whatever, like just those little, just allowing yourself one moment of that in a day, seems to me to be super valuable. And I think that's kind of, in some other world, if I was in a robe and I could just live in a monastery, I could work on getting that blissful state all the time, but I've got kids, I've got a comedy, I've got a show tonight, I've got, you know what I mean, you've got stuff to do. Well, that's the, so this is what I love is I've been taught in Hinduism, whatever that word means, there's these different ashrams, like ways of living, and there's the Brahmachari ashram, that's what you're talking about, the robes, the shaved head, that shit, we didn't get that. Then there's what's called the Grihasta ashram, that's what you're in, it's called the Householder ashram, and that's considered as valid a path to liberation as shaving your head and wearing robes, actually, there's no difference in the two, and they're both considered a form of living in a temple, it's just, isn't that cool, it doesn't exclude anything, it's all, some people's karma is you just get lucky and you're born here and you don't get all glued into the system like we are, and that's a really good karma, and it's great if you could, but I would never wanna ever wanna be a monk, I would be, I fucking hate that. I know, I'd be a horrible monk. I'd be the worst monk of all time. Trying to make jokes, storing that tension, how could you resist? And it sucks, you know, I've heard it really sucks, like I've heard like, it's not, like our idea of the monastic life is imaginary, like in my image, in it is just a tranquility piece, you sit in flowers, it's mud, chant and shit, but the real version of it is, you're like in this stinky place with like all these farting dudes from eating all the vegetarian and they get in fights, you're like, you used to have the same like dormitory tensions and stuff, and no health insurance, so that's a big problem with monks is they get really sick because they don't have health insurance, and so it depends on the monk or the monastery, but yeah, they're like, it's not fun to be a monk. No, no way, I couldn't do it. I mean, and that seems to be like the thing, it's like you're always balancing and you're always doing something, you always forget because you got this stuff to do and you have other people to think about, but I just think it's kind of like, it's kind of like your diet, like sometimes when I'm just, whenever I get like heavier or just kind of like, go on like, you know, a couple months of eating poorly, it's because I'm just not thoughtful about it, I'm just not thinking about it, and as soon as you kind of just pay attention to it, it all kind of gets corrected, like there's something, there's such a real value to just paying attention and being more thoughtful towards anything, you know, your work, your diet, your family, just not just doing it, but just giving yourself a minute to actually think about what you're doing, that kind of makes all the difference. Yeah, I learned from my dogs because they don't think about anything and they just eat shit, they'll literally just like decide to eat shit. Like one of my friends dogs was over at the house once and years ago when we had a cat and like we're, you know, the dog comes bounding onto the couch, sweet dog and suddenly the stink of like cat litter and cat shit just starts rising up from this dog's mouth because it is gone, gone indeed. And then you can buy a pet store stuff, you feed your cat that makes their shit not taste good to dogs. Oh, that's great, I need that actually. Do your dogs eat your cat shit? Yeah, I have a new, we have a new pug who is like, it's like living with a goat. He just, he just eats everything. It takes things out of the garbage and awful because the cat litter, everything. That's the, that, and to me, like anytime I go unconscious, like what you're saying, there's no difference between me and that fucking dog. I mean, I'm not eating cat shit, but you know what I mean? I'm not thinking about what I'm putting in my body. I'm not thinking about how I'm sleeping or if I'm drinking enough water, you just go into this like, I don't know, zombified state. Yeah, yeah. And then you wonder why, and then it's a cycle because then you're wondering why are you feeling headachey and lethargic and depressed. And it's like, well, if I had just thought about what I was putting in my body to begin with, maybe everything would have kind of unfolded a different way. And it's like, you know, we always get these, I know I do, I get these like, I go on these Jags where I start like, well, I gotta really start something like it's a huge project. It's too much. I'm busy. It's too much to fit giant projects. And just how about just, oh, when you open the refrigerator, just think for a second. That's all. Just be more thoughtful. See, no, this is what I secretly think that there is a deep attachment to misery that humans have. And the reason what you're saying, ideas like that get rejected. In other words, like, if I can imagine, like if I, I'm trying to think of like bullshit, crazy ideas I've had regarding getting in shape, you know, like I might suddenly start thinking like, you know what, I'm gonna do Rogan's sober October thing, but I'm not just gonna do that. I'm gonna fast for five days. And get some kettle bells. Yeah, you know, just insanity that I'll never do. But yeah, just that little tiny shift is so easy, but somehow that simplicity is very difficult for people. Why do we like misery, you think? Well, it's, you know, I think it's, we like familiarity. So, you know, depending on your life, if you're born into certain circumstances, you just get used to disarray. You get used to madness. You get used to chaos and you just, that's what you're used to. So, if you start suddenly living in a clean environment, you can get homesick for that chaos, you know? Right. Is that what, do you think that's what it is? Or what do you think? Yeah, no, I mean, that's kind of like when, if you ever date a girl who really likes to fight, it's like, cause she grew up in a fighting environment and they just like, they're comfortable there. And you end up fighting, whether if you're not a fighter, you're like a wreck and they're like happy. It's like that kind of thing. They just, you know, they don't wear, they're not aware that it's good or bad for them. They just, that's just what they learned. Yeah. And that, you know, that once you realize that, you just stop feeding them. And then, well, I, sometimes that really helps. Like sometimes just not giving them the fight or just not like playing the role of the, like person in the fight that they just, No, you should break up with them immediately and get out of there. Do you think so? Don't stick, yeah, don't stick around. Well, you're, you're a big enough project. Yeah, right. And trying to, but no, but I think some people can't get out. That's the thing. Like sometimes people find themselves in a situation, you know, not necessarily the relationship, but sometimes with parents, sometimes they're in a living situation that's just like, they're stuck. There's, they're in the fucking monastery. You know, they're, they can't get it. They're literally trapped. And so in that, in that circumstance, I think it's worth experimenting with other, you know, with a project of like, well, at the very least, I don't have to play this weird fucking game. I mean, I don't know what your relationship with your parents is like, but when you start uncovering the script, you know what I mean? Some people are living by a script. It's like they write, they're constantly writing this tragic play and they're giving you a part to play in it. Yeah. And if you're, if you're not careful, you just start playing the part. I know. I know you fall into those roles that you're supposed to play. Like that's why going home is always so difficult for people like with the holidays and stuff. Cause they go out in their life and they're living as this free person who's doing all this stuff. And then you go home with your brothers and sisters and you're sitting and all of a sudden you're back into that role that you've been playing between the ages of five and 18. Yeah. And all of a sudden you're not that person, you're not that new person anymore. Do you do that? No, a little bit. Not too much. Not too much. I was, everything was pretty, pretty cool. Like I was the oldest. So I just dominated and was just the leader. So I continue to do that everywhere I go. But no, but like little things, like more like with my parents probably, you know, like not so much with my siblings, but with my parents, like the way that you talk to your father or, you know, that kind of stuff, that probably is closer to playing the character in the script, you know? Cause they, especially when they're older, that, you know, they're not gonna, they're not rewriting the script, you know what I mean? Like this is pretty much set. They don't have the, you know, your siblings are still like coming up with new roles. Parents are kind of locked in. So there, you've heard of this, I'm sure. There's this like an idea that the observation of things at a quantum level seems to have an effect on them, just observing them, just the very act of taking them in can change them for some reason. The field of awareness seems to produce some effect on things at the quantum level. And sometimes when I was around my dad in the earlier phases of my life with him, coming home when I'm failing at everything, I would look at myself in the mirror and be like, God, why do I look fatter in the mirror around my dad? Why do I have to be, you know what I mean? And I honestly, I think some people, I think the reason you need to be very careful with your association, and if you can leave, leave, is because it's not just that you're around someone who's starting fights with you, or it's that they have decided you're a certain way and they believe it so firmly that it's literally sucking you in to that their subjective universe. Like they're, and they're very active appraising you as in whatever stupid way they've appraised you, you start becoming it. You know? Do you know what I mean? Like you start, you get in this weird quantum field, but if you're around someone who loves you, like my kid, and you get into that thing, it's like suddenly you're free, you feel lighter, you feel powerful, you feel like you could do anything. Yeah, you know, that's a kind of a, it's kind of a, not to take too much of a pivot, but like when you think about it with your kids, you know, I have kids also, and I'm always kind of aware of that, of like, don't just, just because they were messy before, it doesn't mean they're messy this year. And so you don't have to like keep telling them pick up their shit because that's the way that it's been for the last couple years. They're growing, they're changing, so I should, my views on them should be open and changing. But to go one step deeper with it, whenever I see like grandparents with their kids, it's nothing but pure love, right? It's nothing but, oh my God, like the kid could do no wrong in the eyes of the grandparent. They're just, it's just purely celebrating, oh my God, love, love, love, love, love, love, love. And I'm always like, why not parent that way? Why not try and be that for the direct thing? But I always kind of run up, or parents always throw up in front of me, there's the disciplinary part of it that you need to teach them lessons, so you can't go all grandparent in when you're the parent. No way. Right? No way. You can't. It's abuse. It's abuse. Like these kids, you know, a kid does not need to worry about being the boss. You know, a kid doesn't need to worry about, you know, what the boundaries are. That stresses them out, it freaks them out. That's my kid. That's what I love. It's so fun to watch because like, for example, he likes to stand up on the couch, but he's too little to stand up on the couch. He's definitely gonna fall and hit his head on the hardwood floor, so you just can't do it. You can't stand on the couch in our house. So what he does is he figures out exactly the amount of kind of standing he could do. You know, like he's, he finds the exact limit, and then once he knows what that is, I don't know. Like, that's the, it's frustrating to have to be consistent with an adorable thing. You know what I mean? It's frustrating. You wanna be like, stand on the couch, party dance, but they'll die. They'll kill themselves. Yeah, there's a responsibility in it. It actually, it actually, maybe it would help, help me to think of it as, you're actually showing the more love by being restrictive in teaching and, you know, saying no once in a while. Then if you were the goofy grandparent who just said yes all the time, that's actually less loving. Yeah, it's less loving. It's like, it gets you into all kinds of trouble. You know, I had Tim Leary's kid on my podcast once, and he told me this story of how Tim Leary and Ramdoss got him stoned when he was in high school. It was a special thing. They were like, let's, we'll smoke this joint and like talk. And he felt like a grown up. You know, I think he was like a 10th grade or 11th grade or whatever. And so then to, I guess, reward them for giving him any kind of liberty. When he left for school that day, he took the roach to school and smoked it in the playground with his friend. And the principal had to call Timothy Leary, you know, the great LSD guru to come to get his kid. And Tim Leary's in there, he's like, hey, this might be legal one day, but it's not legal right now. You can't smoke weed here. But that's, you know, that's to me, it's like good parenting. It's like not, even though you would like to get stoned with your kid, don't. Because it's not, you can't, you gotta be a dad. That's the rule temporarily, that's what they want. That's what you signed up for. You could do that with your nieces and nephews. When you, when, how old were you when you had your first kid? I was like, oh man, I guess I was like 32. 32? Okay, so you were like, you were like doing comedy and parent, did you have a, were you worried that you would like maybe lose your ability to be funny or lose your edge or that becoming a parent would in some way disrupt your ability to do stand up? Not as far as what I was going to talk about. Like not as far as, like my stuff had always been, I've always really been interested in like human behavior and families and the dynamic of people and like all of that. I knew it was probably going to inform that, you know. I was a little worried that I just don't want to come out with a whole act of kids stuff. Because I thought that would be, it can devour your act. Yes. So I was worried about that a little bit. But then I kind of found that the one cool thing is if you're not hacking and you're telling good jokes about all that stuff, we've all, every single person is in a family. So as long as you're just not doing tread stuff, that retread stuff that's like, you know, lame parent to the kid or wife, you know. As long as you're creative and funny with it, it would be okay. But that took a little while to get comfortable with. But the one thing that I was worried about was just the energy, like the amount of energy that would be split mentally and physically with being in a house with kids, having a family. And then as opposed to being just purely living in my apartment with nothing but comedy on my mind. Like that, that I was worried about. And I did the Tonight Show once with Leno. And it was the first time I had done it. And I did the set and then sat down on the couch with him. And off air, they went to commercial. And the first question Jay asked me was, are you married? You married? I said, yeah, I'm married, yeah, I'm married. And I said it like kind of like, like proud of it. Like, yeah, I'm married and I've got a new daughter. And he was like, oh. And I just saw his eyes just kind of like avert. Like, almost like he was like, yeah, too bad. Isn't that crazy? I know, because he didn't do that. He got married, but no children. And I really took it as a, it felt like a judgment, like, well, this is going to be harder for you. It is, well, I mean, I think in the world of comedy, in the same way there's like the Brahmacharis and the Grihastas, their same thing replicates itself in comedy, which is like, you get the loner, I don't know, Hunter S. Thompson style, like Gonzo comic, and they really don't look kindly upon the breeders. They consider it to be almost a failure, a sort of like, you know, you fucked up, you got, you know, you got married, you had kids, come on. Every single breath you take, every moment of your life should be comedy until you die. That's it. And I've always found that to be the craziest, fascist form of like thinking when it comes to art. It's like, how the fuck are you, to me, having had a child and being married, I feel like now I really can connect with audiences. You know, now I kind of do know more about the human experience and what some of these people are going through. Whereas before it was like, what the, what do I, how do I even understand the world if my entire life is like snorting rails of catamine and playing, playing God of war and like making noises on my synthesizers. You know, like what? It's true. When we were thinking about it, and we were like, are we gonna do it? We didn't really, we weren't like, oh, we're definitely gonna make a family. My wife and I were kind of analyzing it and thinking about it. And it's like, okay, so we're artists. She's a comedian too. And it was like, okay, so we're artists. Why would we pass up the single greatest experience or biggest experience that you can have as a human being? Like to bring life onto the planet. And like, as an artist, you'd be denying yourself this window into this whole other part. And that really was like, okay, yeah, let's not be silly about this. Let's dive in. Now, is it more difficult? Like, does Bobby Lee have a lot more energy when he rolls up to the club after playing video games till three in the morning and then sleeping until three in the afternoon and rolling in just for a sec? Sure, he probably is a little more of a twinkle in his eye. You know, I've been up at six AM, banging out, driving kids to school, like just dealing with whatever. And, you know, yeah, it's a little more energy you have to, but then you have to get a little more serious in just how you treat it. And you have to do whatever you can. Like we're saying, like eating or whatever it is that gives you the ability to do it. You gotta be more responsible, I think, to your art. It's, you can't just kind of like think it's going to happen like it did when you were 25 and alone. Right. No, I love that, man. That's it. And I think that's all it takes, really. Have you ever thought about your cellular health? No, me neither. Why would we? Because cells are the foundation of our health and make us who we are. And one of the important building blocks for ourselves is called NAD, which is vital for things like sleeping, breathing, eating, drinking. You know, some of the most important stuff we do that we don't necessarily think about either. The bad news is, as we age, our bodies don't make NAD like they used to and here's the good news. There's a way to boost your NAD levels thanks to true nitrogen. True nitrogen helps counteract the effects of time on your body by promoting cellular repair. It also helps with healthy aging by supporting cellular function and metabolism to maintain overall health and well-being. True nitrogen can also help you increase cellular energy. It replenishes the decline in NAD, due to stressors such as lack of sleep and overeating. So you can keep up with your active lifestyle. Taking true nitrogen also helps with cellular defense in the face of stresses such as alcohol, consumption or immune stress, which is a form of cellular stress. True nitrogen has caught the attention of the scientific community with its remarkable ability to boost NAD. And they have over 10 clinical studies to prove it. Give yourselves a boost with true nitrogen. Right now, new customers can save $20 on a three-month supply by going to trueniogen.com slash Duncan.

I think the whole idea of like, here's how you do it is so nuts anytime anyone tells you like, this is the only, this is the way. It's so fucking crazy and so limiting. And I love being a dad. I love the, I love every bit of it, including the existential horror, including, you know what I mean, the moment for like, what have I done to worry? And my heart's gonna be broken forever. I will never have like a day now until I breathe my last breath where there isn't some peace in me thinking about my kid and missing him. And like, you know, but I love all of that, even though God, Jesus, we did sacrifice so much autonomy, so much freedom and more than anything, we really sacrificed the ability to be self-destructive, to be happily self-destructive. Yeah, right, exactly. And it's just like, you know, people are built different ways, but you know, when I see the guys that decided not to go down that path, I don't know, they don't seem like, they don't seem complete, they don't seem content, you know, there's like, and I'm sure there's, you know, people who famously like rail against it and like, oh, I never would, they all seem a little unhappy. They all seem like a little, there's something, and you know, I knew we were just kind of on this path right before it where I was so obsessed with myself, like thinking about how I felt, I always thought like, am I getting sick or do I have this thing, it was just me, me, me, me. I was like, I remember consciously thinking right before she was born, like, it's gonna be so nice to think about somebody else. Yeah. You know what I mean? Get out of this, because you're not that important and it's not good to be that self obsessed. Oh God, it's to, that, you know, that's the, I like that it puts you in this mode of thinking where it's like, right now, my thinking is like, all right, we wanna buy a house and the reason I wanna buy a house is, look, I'm, you know, the lifespan thing people do, where they're like, I'm gonna live to the end of the human lifespan, it's like, well, you're crazy if you think that, you know what I mean? That's wild that you think you're gonna get to live to be 70 or 80 or whatever, why would you even think that? That's just an average, that's a tendency, but you know what I mean, you don't know that. So I think now that I have a kid, my thinking is more long lines of, all right, get them some land, get them a place where they can live and then you can pass a house down to your kids and that feels so much better than the other thing that you can slip into if you don't have other people you're taking care of, which is like weird shit, weird shit, like I'm gonna get, I'm gonna get a really nice, fast car and you know, that kind of weird, where like you get all this weird shit around you that's expensive and you're, I don't know, but then on the other hand, I don't, I think we accidentally become tribalistic when we have a family and suddenly the non-breeders seem like exactly what you're saying, you look at them and you think- Yeah, you judge them, yeah. And they judge you, we judge each other, like my non-breeder friends, some of them have gotten really harsh with me in passive aggressive ways, you know, and I know I used to think when I was a non-breeder, God, Jesus man, I thought I was like Nietzsche or some bullshit, like I thought I had really figured it out, like, you know, I discovered the truth of like, the failure of humanity and the idea that you're gonna just make a thing or like, you listen to Jack Kerouac and he's like, do you ever listen to Jack Kerouac, ever read Jack Kerouac? I've read it, yeah. I'm on a bit of a Jack Kerouac jag right now, one thing that's funny about him is the motherfucker loves to write poetry about people working, but he never is fucking working, he's always like the steelman, the other funny thing about him is he's like completely, like, completely absorbed into the role of like the free poet and one of the things he said is, beautiful women make graves and you know what I mean, cause you get them pregnant and they have a kid and to have a child is the sentence of being to death, is another famous thing he said, he's the ultimate example of the non-breeder, but do you ever have moments though where you're like, fuck, did I fuck up? Do you ever wonder, where do you think you'd be if you had not a family? Where do you think you'd be if you didn't have a kid? What do you think you'd be like? Yeah, I think so, I think, you know, it's always, I mean, that's kind of what we're built for is to second guess it. Your brain is always figuring out, is always going to work on something. So it's always like, yeah, what if we had done this or had done that and I think ultimately there's no question that it was more rewarding and better and especially now, you just have more perspective on what life is and what it's about and it's like, you know, how many movies can you go see? How many times are we gonna sit and discuss philosophy with this guy smoking a cigarette who thinks he knows what he's talking about? It's just like, oh, you're just spinning around and around and around and everyone's done it before us. Kerouac did it before us and Abby Hoffman did it before us and all these people have done it before us and where did it get them? The same spot. They got them all to the same spot at the end and you know, you spent your time doing it and it's like, okay, that's fine. If he really enjoyed it and wanted to go that way, good, God bless him, good for him. But I know you probably feel the same way that I do that it's pretty good knowing that we're absolutely right. I love feeling that right. That's all I wanna do is be right, completely righteous. I wanna be the most right person on the planet. Yeah, look, I don't think there's any one way to live or anything like that, but damn, I would never, if I, you know, I think back like, Jesus, I got so lucky that I got lucky that I have a kid. Like I get scared, you know that thing where people say, if you could travel back a time and tell yourself anything, what would you tell, it's like, I don't wanna fuck up my timeline. Like if I would be afraid if I, do you ever think like, it really freaks me out to imagine like, what if I had jerked off the night before I had sex with my wife when we conceived forest. I would have come his DNA and he would never exist in the world. You ever think about that? Right, he'd be a stain on a pillow. Yeah, that thing, do you ever just like, it kind of makes me just like, it gives me this weird vertigo when you consider that you almost didn't get to meet these beings that are in your life because you came at the wrong time or you came on her stomach or back. I know, yeah, no, it's, yeah, that's a whole nother thing. I mean, to think of like every little decision in the past that would have been, I used to think about that in New York all the time. Like if I had just left the apartment one minute earlier, it would have changed the whole thing of when I got down the subway steps into the train, saw those people, got popped out through the, just those like tiny incremental things that could change everything. But I do feel like, I do feel like it's kind of, it's not that it's out of our hands because I have not come down on whether this is all supposed to happen for a reason or whether I even have control over it. I can't, I haven't been able to figure out where I land on all of that. But I do kind of feel like this is kind of the part of the free way of concerns up here and that the whole thing of like who you're with and all of these bigger things just kind of, it's just part of the flow that's just deeper than all of these decisions up here. So like when Leno says, do you have a family? It didn't really, it doesn't really matter. It didn't matter what answer I gave him. It was, that's not important. Like this stuff down here is important and that'll manifest itself into all these other things regardless of what decisions we kind of made. Man, that was a confusing answer. It's a beautiful answer actually. That's been my approximation of it too is I'm just not really, you do, I think the older you get, the more you start wondering just how much, who's actually, like I think the way Romulus put it was who's minding the store here really? Like who's doing this? But let me, I got a little Leno's story. When I was dating Natasha Legerro, she was on Leno. And man, I was dead broke. I was driving this shitty car. I was going to see her on my very successful comedian girlfriend, beyond Leno. I almost didn't make it because my muffler fell off the car in the parking lot of the studio and I had to like, I came in all greasy and shit and he came into the green room and he said the most mortifying thing I've ever heard. I still, it echoes in my head and especially at that moment in my life, it really hurt. He said, and I can't do a Leno impression, but he said, if you're not on TV, you're losing. And it was the most, it was like, it was just a dab. It was like he just for no reason, psychically knew the worst thing to say to me. It hurt so bad. But God, what an archaic, shitty, stupid way to think about existence. Like who the fuck's on TV? Like one minute, like a tenth of a tenth of the human population is on network television. Like you feel like the whole planet is failing. But is there something, and I go through this a lot with guys of our generation too, does it take that kind of drive, that kind of insane, ego-driven single thought? You know what I mean? You see it with, there's some people we know who are like crazy, crazy successful, and they just kind of carry this other level of ego that regardless of how talented they are, everyone has a little something, but the fame almost, it doesn't equate to the talent, but it does equate to the amount of ego, I am the greatest drive that they have. Yeah. You know what I mean? Oh yeah. There's like, and I think at that time with him, like he got to the top of that TV mountaintop because he did believe that, right? Like that was all he was focused on. He wasn't thinking about having kids and doing all this other, it was purely, he couldn't allow himself to think otherwise. Right. I'm not saying it's healthy, but don't you think that there is something to those people? You know what I mean? Well, what am I going to say? Jay Leno fucked up. It's like, he really screwed up his life as a comic. He made a lot of bad decisions to end up posting the fucking tonight. Okay, I guess this is my question then. Do they need, do you need to have that in order to get there? Well, I mean, the problem is that there, I don't even know if that there is there anymore. Like that, I think in that time period, when I first came to the comedy store, that was it, man. And that, you know, people still have pagers. They get paged for their commercial auditions, stop at a pay phone. Hey, I had Thomas Guides to get to the, you know what I mean? There was no fucking internet. Yeah, there was no way to do what we're doing now. Back then, technologically, if you wanted to do that, you would need a lot of money and we didn't have any money to do that. So back then, he was right. Now, it's not the case. It's, I think it's a whole different landscape now. And what's really confusing about it is you're not gonna get any kind of affirmation from the old guard regarding this new way of being a comedian because it's an existential threat. It's like, they're not gonna tell you, you know, I was so, I got lucky, got this cartoon on Netflix. And I was like, thank you friend. But, you know, that was my first, you've been on a bunch of things. That was my first thing. And it was really exciting, but I was talking to some very successful podcasters, like very successful. And they jokingly, they were like, I would like it. I feel weird that I don't have that. That I don't have the show thing. And it was so weird because it's like, you do have a show. It just didn't happen. And their show, I'm sure more people have listened to them, way more people have listened to them than saw my show. But because it's not a massive corporation nighting you by giving you a series for some reason, it's still in its comics to think, oh, I haven't reached the top. But it's like the new version of things is actually, you don't need a network anymore. Do you agree? What do you think about that? No, 100%. I think there's so many more opportunities. And it's kind of, I always play around with, OK, so if I'm not selling out Madison Square Garden, is it because it's not really that important to me to sell Madison Square Garden? Like, we all kind of think like, whoever the biggest has to be, that's the ultimate. And I remember talking with Maria Bamford. And we were talking about the same thing. And she was talking about a Kevin Hart. I don't think it was Kevin. But that kind of a guy who is just so good at being a corporation himself. Like, he's building an empire, right? He's building this giant thing. He is selling out Madison Square Garden. And he also has production companies and TV shows. And he has a vitamin water and his own boner pills. And I mean, whatever he wants to do, he's creating the thing. He has his own boner pills. And he's seen as like the biggest thing of comedy. And Maria, just simply, who's so brilliant, she just was like, who would want that? I just wanted to tell some jokes and come home and make dinner with my pugs. And it was like, she was like, I just want to open a little bookshop. I don't want to be a corporation with people asking me questions. Oh my god. That is so genius. You know what I mean? I am so glad you said that. Because I was right as you were saying that, I was just getting an anxiety attack. Imagine what it would be like to be backstage at Madison Square Garden's about to step out for the first time on stage. Oh god, I don't know if I could survive the green room situation there. All the people coming in, security. The sounds of the large crowd out there. Jay-Z and Beyonce just wanting to say hello before the show. You're annoyed with Beyonce because you're trying to get your. That's so weird to think there's people who are annoyed with Beyonce. That's so weird. Yeah, I don't know, man. That's what I love about what your book is putting out there, is just that you're just where you're at. Like, yeah, you might not be like a Kevin Hart style person. But here's something I meant. I meant to ask you up front. I forgot. Are you getting any? Saying that things are OK, that you're OK the way you are, and that you're OK, that this is fine. It's actually a political statement these days. If you put out there that I'm doing great, I feel great. A lot of times people are going to respond with, yeah, of course you're doing great. You're white. You're a comic. You're doing great because you're fine. You are doing great. You are actually doing great because literally you have a career. But I'm not doing fucking great. I'm like, we're all fucked. I love that you had the guts to say, all of it is fine. But has anyone come at you? That's crazy. I've been attacked for saying, I feel good. I enjoy my life, for that this is great. People are like, well, that's your privilege talking. You know that's here. What do you think of that? No, I think that that's being aware and thoughtful and grateful. And I think that all these people that you try and study and learn from, they were all different colors, all different genders, all different races. This isn't about the parameters and the social rules and things of the culture and all of this noise. This isn't about being great because I got a house somewhere and had this much money or that. We're talking about something deeper. You're talking about looking in the eyes of your child and appreciating that you're having this meal together. That's you doing great. And that is available to everybody every moment. Mm. Not when you're on fire. When they put it out, can't burn forever. That's what I never want to hear. I never want to hear someone say, you can't burn forever, kids. Roll around a little. Tom, I'm so I'm so lucky you decided to do my podcast. I really appreciate it. This is so cheesy, please. But I got to tell you when I saw you were on B movie, I wanted to ask you. Do you have a second for one more question? Yeah, I got nowhere to go. OK, great. I wasn't sure. OK, so how many times have you seen B movie? Well, I wrote on it, too. So you wrote on B movie. Yeah, I got this. OK, so my wife prohibited me from showing TV to Forrest, because apparently I'm supposed to show TV to young kids. And so she I don't remember where she was, but I'm sitting on the couch. I'm like, I'm going to just show him. I got to show him a cartoon. He reacts. So because he hadn't seen I hadn't seen it. So I put a B movie on just because that was what popped up. Oh, he was transfixed. Of course. And let me tell you, I have paid dearly for that, because now I have seen B movie. Fifty times, 30. I don't know. It's always on. He'll you know, he'll just like be be be. Or like, you want to see B movie? Yeah, because they don't get tired of it. They they but OK, so I got to ask you, you wrote on B movie. That's crazy is B movie or critique of socialism? Also, it's important to know it's a courtroom drama. That's what I realized. This is a courtroom drama that appears to be a critique of socialism. What do you think? No, I would say no. I just because it comes from the mind of Jerry Seinfeld. Who I know for a fact does not care about socialism. He doesn't care about capitalism. He doesn't care about social movements. He doesn't care about things being meaningful or driven. He only cares about is this funny. He's it's purely where he lives and what he conjures up. I think the audiences can draw metaphors and stuff, you know, and maybe subconsciously some of it trickled in. But I know that consciously, at least, it had nothing to do with anything other than how funny is it that that this B is functioning in the in the in the human world. And then that was it. That's so good to hear. See, this is great. This is, you know, I love conspiracy theories. I hang out on Reddit conspiracy. Highly advise it for anyone listening and for you to. But I do it as a form of, you know, I view it as a kind of like modern folk stories. I don't think it's real. Yeah. And one of the things that they are really it's the most. I don't know what happened because the conspiracy community goes through phases. So it's the most bizarre fucking thing because people will write these essays on some crazy theory. And in the essay, they will just all of a sudden be like in the B movie when as as though it were real or as though, you know what I mean? They don't differentiate. They don't write, but but. And I haven't seen any conspiracy on B movie. But other movies, you know, essentially, there's this idea of something called I think it's called predictive programming. And so it's a whole genre of conspiracy theory, which is that movies come out and they, you know, foretell what's about to come. They get people ready for what's coming. The Simpsons predicting this and that. Right. Like big movies about disasters will come out. And then there's a disaster. And so people feel the Illuminati are making these movies to condition people to get ready. And so, yeah, as I get, you know, what it is, it's just being stoned and watching B movie for like the 28th time. You need something else to think about. I start thinking like, wait a minute, the bees have unionized. And because they are or also there's this sinister thing that one of the lines in the B movie. And again, this is just from having watched this fucking movie too many times. And I'm sorry to do this to you. But literally one of the lines, one of the bees is like, yeah, you work until you die. That's what you do. And I'm like, oh, my God, that's hypnotic. They're trying to get people to just like not question like their identity as workers. And it's so funny to hear you. But now Jerry Seinfeld just wanted to guarantee you. I guarantee you in the writer's room, somebody said, said, put that line out. Yeah, you work until you die. That's what you do. And then Jerry fell out laughing and it got in the movie. So how many people are in the writer's room for B movie? It was kind of rotating. It was there was it was small. It was like like five. And then we had, oh, there's here. So here's something that I'll give you for your conspiracies. The one night we were at DreamWorks working on it. And we showed it to Sasha Baron Cohen and Gary Shanling. And they came into the room with us afterwards, just to kind of get their opinions and and and any notes or whatever. And, you know, two genius minds there, right? Sasha Baron Cohen and Gary Shanling. And it turned into this such a bizarre. You couldn't even wrangle all the thoughts because it was and Shanling was really going off the rails. And it was like, none of this is going to be usable. But what a moment. What a cool hour to have like in the writer's room. But I do remember Shanling saying something about, you know, the the beehive with the guy with the smoker, you know, like, and they're all like all the bees are kept in the in those. What is what's it called? Like, I don't know, a man, my man made hive or whatever that thing is. And and that the guy comes in with the smoker and he was equating that to Nazi Germany that all of the that all of the bees were stuck in these things and they had no idea that they just had to work and they were stuck in this thing. And it was like, what are you talking? I remember I remember literally everybody going, what? Wait, what? I love it. It's true, though. Listen, what? Just I don't I mean, watch it again. But from the perspective of the B movie is a critique of socialism and an invitation for people to just succumb to the machine and you will see it in there. It's it's accidentally in there. Yeah, but but isn't that just what bees are? Isn't that just how bees work? And then just because we are adapting it, putting it in a cartoon and digesting it as a human being doesn't change that. Yeah, bees. All right, I'll go with you. Bees are communists. They are. They are bees are a communist. For sure. They're the board. They're like communists. They. They really don't care about their identity at all. They're no, it's all the collective. Yeah, I mean, that is kind of like what what the main bee is doing, right? He's breaking out of that. He's going the opposite way in the in the in the prison, right? He's he's walking in the direction. Yeah, but hey, don't let me burst your bubble. You did. I'm glad I love every time my bubble gets burst. I'm so I like because my mind just everything is it will immediately go to the most ridiculous. I just think it's important for people to hear that too, because a lot of people really do when you don't have all the information. It's very easy to project onto the world, complete insanity. I mean, look at what's happening with QAnon right now. Like, yeah, that's the most wild, emergent religion I've ever seen. Well, well, I mean, that's kind of the thing about the moment that we're in, is that you have this way to communicate it with each other, you know, and like during Hitler, they said that that was such a rise because it was also the rise of radio and nobody was able to communicate in that way to people. And it became like the technology was grabbed by this movement and was so effective. And we're kind of in that similar moment now where social media is this new way of people digesting all of this and thinking that it's all real and it's able to manipulate that technology and use the propaganda for whatever reason you have. So when things catch fire, like the Q thing, it's like it is catching fire. But it's really almost the way that that information is being dispersed more than even the validity of the information that it's carrying. Do you know what you should do if you want to do a cool experiment? Just tweet anything moderately pro-Biden anything. Just tweet like Biden, I'm going to vote for Biden. And I'm with Joe, I'm with Joe tweet that and then watch what happens. It's the damnedest thing because all of a sudden really bots will come into your timeline and they they're really I heard that I heard this on NPR. I was like, whoa, but so just using a keyword, a bot will appear in your timeline and will say something that vaguely looks like it could fit in. I got one after the debates last night and somebody just wrote, I don't know why people are saying such bad things about Trump. He's really done a lot of great things like and listen to things he did. And you look at it and you're like, wait a minute, click on the click on that profile. And you scroll down and all it is is retweets of Trump. There's no person there. It's like so it's bots that have been trained to swarm threads and inject they're like whatever whatever their particular message is. And but there's some intelligence to it, too, because there's like, I don't know, there's like a weird they make them seem they may it seems like they're kind of punk rock. You know what I mean? They're status bootlickers, but they have like sort of disguised themselves as these like anarchist chaos magicians, these brilliant minds. We've seen the truth, but it's like you're just you just like the fucking president. There's nothing more vanilla and square and there's nothing interesting about it. You're just somebody who likes the president. We've an old 75 year old guy. Yeah. It's so weird. No. Wow, I'm going to try that. That's amazing. It yeah. And like you said, there's not even a human being behind it. So it's like, holy cow. I mean, I remember I remember like, you know, people thinking there was messages and Pink Floyd's the animals and like all this different stuff. But it was just so small because it could only catch fire in my dorm room. You know what I mean? Like us five guys might talk about it. Maybe the girl from upstairs will be into it. But now you just go into the net and it's like globally there's people that believe in that and start adding to it. And, you know, it's a it's a world of make believe. Yeah, it really it is like, I think people are going to look, you know, they used to put fucking radium in watches. You know, that used to be a thing, right? But they're going to look back on this and be like, holy shit, that was when the entire planet got contaminated by this psychic malady that was being like a swoven together by fucking bots. Like, yeah, that's what's weird. Like in the old days, you go to the town hall meeting. People like, you know, stand up and yell at the mayor. Yeah, I imagine being in a town hall meeting, someone stands up and yells at the mayor and then like starts malfunctioning because it's an Android. Yeah. That's literally what's happening is like androids have infiltrated our town hall, which is the Internet and are like not. We who the fuck are they? Where and even and even if it is a human being, it's it's so easy and small and lazy to be able to complain and send something out, send a message about canceling somebody like it's so small. Like it if I were running like a giant network and you wanted me to take someone off of the air because of something that they said, I will only accept it in a handwritten form in a letter that was written out, folded, put a stamp on the envelope, walked to the mailbox and put in because that if there's a millions of those, then I'll I'll listen to it. But just for people to pop off just as they're sitting there, you know, vaping at the same time just because everyone else is like there's no there's no weight to that. No, it's all air. It's all ones and zeros. It's like there's nothing really behind it for real. Well, man, I'm going to this is the last point I want to make. But this is I want to share with you my newest paranoid fantasy. All right. This is pretty fucked up. This was thinking it's like how what if all your friends had been digitized? Like, in other words, like what if all your friends have been turned into AI bots? Uh-huh. And every text you were getting from your friends, it was just an AI bot. You know, like some people so people are so absorbed into their phones. Like the phone is so much their universe. Yeah, that they could you could have like a fake Twitter, fake Facebook, fake whatever, and you would believe it was real. Do you know what I mean? I'm fake, fake mom, fake dad, fake friend from high school. Exactly. Like how many of the people if you're not regularly seeing people that you're texting with Instagram, just that's like a like complete replica of humans. It's not even real, but you're looking at it and you believe it's real. And so this is like one of the creepy ideas about AI and the future of humanity is that once it can replicate perfectly the sound of someone's voice, yeah, the way someone looks, if your contact with humanity is solely through your phone or through Zoom, it wouldn't be that hard to just hijack your entire universe and replace your whole universe with an AI that was pretending to be your friends. I like it. I like I'll go. I'll slow it down just a hair just just for the movie just for the script idea. Yeah. That we're not there yet, but someone's developed the the ability to do it. So when like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, when say your friend dies, then you have the option to keep him alive digitally in your life. So your friend in real time dies, but you're able to keep him alive and you get text messages from him. He's still interacting, still posting things about his vacation. Yeah. And that slowly starts to happen with everybody. And we all as as everybody dies and that's what's left is all of the digital versions. Oh, fucking, that's what we're in right now is the replica. We're just in a replica. We're not we're the thing. We've already been digitized. No, I don't think so because I I I'm hungry. But are you really? Are you really? Look, man, I could go on talking with you forever. I feel like I have I just am so lucky that we I get to chat with you, man. It's really, really cool to get to be friends with you. And thanks for coming on the show, Tom. Oh, I feel the same way. Whenever I'm sitting around thinking like who's what's the what other guests should I get for my podcast? I think I should just call Duncan again. Any time you should be you should be like every other week. Whenever you whenever you want to talk, man, I just I love these conversations so much. I'm disappointed to hear that B movie isn't predictive programming to try to condition us. It's just Jerry Seinfeld being funny. But you know what? It's better, I guess that way. Yeah, you got some shows coming up on in November. Yeah, I'm going to Omaha and in Hilarity's in Cleveland. Awesome. All right, cool, man. And where you're Tom Papa on Twitter. What's your at Tom Papa's all the stuff at Tom Papa on Instagram and and Twitter, which is not as active and the breaking bread with Tom Papa podcast that you've been a guest on. Go see Tom live. It's worth the risk. And God bless you for being on the show, man. I don't know when I see your body, but in real life. And unless you come up to the mountains, but I will, I will for sure. Thanks, man. Thanks, man. That was Tom Papa, everybody. A big thank you to him and a giant thank you to all of our sponsors. And of course, thank you to you for continuing to listen to and support the DTFH. It's the only podcast that has won two Huffington Tramp Awards. And we're up for another one this year.

Hello friends, it's me, Duncan, and I'm reporting in from Pittsburgh, somewhere in the midst of the Squarespace Presents You Are God comedy tour, and I'm having one of the greatest aprils of my life. Not only have I been given the opportunity to travel around on a bus doing stand up every single night, which is already one of the greatest things ever, but to add to that insanely beautiful yet unfortunately temporary existence, I have also gotten to do podcasts with three of the top psychedelic luminaries living today, Alex Gray, Allison Gray, and Rick Doblin. And all of these podcasts are coinciding with what may be one of the most psychedelic months in human history outside of the month that LSD was synthesized and outside of the month that the first proto hominid stumbled upon a mushroom covered bit of bovine dung growing on the primordial grasslands and shove those mushrooms into its cracked, jagged, slavering proto hominid mouth hole, thus experiencing the very first psychedelic trip, which according to many people led to the expansion of the neocortex, the evolution of language, the beginnings of religion, and ultimately led to this incredible time in human history where we are about to bring artificial intelligence to life. It's pretty cool, and this month is particularly psychedelic for three different reasons that I can think of. The first being that for the first time they have done brain imaging of a human brain on LSD, and this is an incredible thing, it's always been a mystery what happens to us when that magical substance makes its way into our memory jam, but now we can see that when you take LSD, it creates all kinds of brand new connections in the human brain that according to the sound bites I've found on the articles I've skimmed is very similar to the way that an infant's brain works. So when you're on LSD, it's as though you are transforming into a kind of enlightened baby, and it's incredible to think, and this is something that anyone has thought if you've been around a baby, if you've spent any time at all with an infant, one of the first things you think is my god, this guy seems like he's on a lot of acid, they are tripping, right? They seem like they are tripping, no, they are not tripping, they are just existing in a pure primordial state of connectivity and innocence, and that is the exact same state that if you've had a great trip you've experienced, and what an incredible relief to slip back into that garden of Eden style state of consciousness when for the majority of your life you've been encased in the terrible neurological thought prison that you call your identity, that awful series of habituations and concepts of what's right and what's wrong that just surrounds you like barbed wire around an angel, LSD has freed so many of us from that prison and it's incredible to see that that state of consciousness is not some kind of abnormal state of schizophrenia or some kind of state of lunacy or some kind of state of going insane but is actually a return to the primary consciousness that we all get to experience for a few years in the beginning of our lives, and that's a really beautiful thing, it's an incredible thing but it also shows us that one thing that we may need to implement in all the hospitals of the United States of America is a kind of vaginal prison that we can put on the vaginas of women who are giving birth, I picture it as sort of like a solitary confinement cage for babies so that the moment those little darlings get shot out of the vagina they're immediately locked in one of these cages and shipped to penal colonies for infants because every single baby that you are seeing when you're out there to Starbucks or maybe your own baby or whoever it may be are experiencing an illegal state of consciousness that the federal government has for many years deemed so dangerous that they have mandated a five-year mandatory minimum for people who dare to allow their minds to slip back into the state of infantile consciousness that according to the federal government is just as dangerous as this experience of injecting the poison of heroin into your veins or snorting crystal meth so let's lock up the babies that's one thing that I've learned from this new study on LSD is that every single baby walking on the earth today is a drug offender who should be at least handcuffed so maybe somebody out there who has an entrepreneurial spirit could invent baby handcuffs or vaginal prisons so we can solve this awful problem it kind of explains what's wrong with society right we're all born criminals that's what happens we're born criminals and thanks to the state we are reeducated and transformed into highly functioning adults who know right from wrong this is one reason that it's one of the most psychedelic months in human history and obviously I'm joking about the baby prisons I don't think babies should be locked up in prisons I think babies should be immediately launched into outer space to some other planet let's get rid of the babies all together I don't think we should allow them to contaminate our planet with their awful innocence and complete disregard for all human laws the other reason it's a incredibly psychedelic month is because at this very moment the multi-disciplinary association for psychedelic studies which is the organization that Rick Doblin founded is raising money to create to synthesize a kilogram of MDMA because they are doing FDA approved studies which are having great results in which are probably going to lead to MDMA being a prescribable medicine so there are ways that you can now chip in in this historic moment in human history all you have to do is go to the maps website links will be in the comments section of this episode and donate a little money or chip in in some way right now at this crucial time so that we can get this MDMA legally synthesized and continue these very important tests that Rick Doblin has gotten has made legal it's incredible this guy is a real saint he's awesome now that's the second reason that it's a psychedelic month the third reason it's a psychedelic month and you'll find more about this on next week's podcast which gets released April 19th is because Alex and Alice and Gray are in I suppose what you could say the final phase or the next phase of building their beautiful temple in Theon and upstate New York which is a kind of nexus point for the incredible art church that they have created and for the awesome community of people who have gathered around them and who have in varying ways been using art as a means to connect to the universe and it's a beautiful it's a beautiful religion and I know religion has a lot of negative connotations but it's a beautiful philosophy that is being propagated by Alex and Gray over at Cosm and so I got to visit with them I got to see Entheon I got to witness this embryonic temple and I had my mind blown as I always do by hanging out with those two and especially by being on their beautiful property which I think anyone can visit they have a bed and breakfast over there with some of their art is on all the walls and they're just a variety of super cool people who are always hanging out there including Alex and Alice and Gray so that podcast comes out next week regardless this has been one of the most mind-melting months of my life and I'm really grateful that I get a chance to experience it all and that's all because of you guys for listening to this podcast so much thanks to you we're going to dive right into this episode but first some quick business this episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the glory angels over at Squarespace.com I was just watching one of these weird shows that is on TV and somehow there's like a whole genre of these shows now like Shark Tank where essentially these billionaire entrepreneurs go around finding folks who make special napkin covers and jams and weird products and buy millions of dollars worth of these products for for their businesses so if you've got a nice if you're a glass blower and you want to get your glass blown vases and a billion Bubba Gump shrimp companies then if you're lucky this amazing godlike billionaire who runs the golden saddle or whatever that hotel is in Vegas will come to your glass blowing place chastise you for how slow you are when you create your art and if you're lucky he'll he'll get you to water down your art to the point where you can sell it to him wholesale and obese drunks shoving shoving shrimp into their face that Bubba Gumps can completely ignore your flower holder on their table it's a weird I don't know what to think of it but anyway the whole point is last night as I was watching one of these things falling asleep and I had nightmares for the entire night I woke up my beautiful beloved Cora screaming in the middle of the night and I think it was because of watching these shows it also may have been because I ate a bunch of chocolate right before I fell asleep but anyway one of these shows this leather worker was taken to some Manhattan web design building where these charlatan sons of guns told this guy that for a seven page website they normally charge a hundred thousand dollars think about that a hundred thousand dollars for a seven page website if you make me pay a hundred thousand dollars for a seven page website there better be a page on there where I can press a button and it brings my mom and my grandmother back to life because otherwise it's a ripoff don't get hoodwinked by these charlatan bastards who will drag you like a cowboy whose boot is stuck in a stirrup through a cactus garden and at the end of this awful dragging you'll be dead broke and you'll have a website

on sale at the end of the tour a limited number of the ur god t-shirts will be on sale so keep your eye out for that okay everybody thanks for hanging in there now please welcome to the dunkatrustle family hour podcast a pioneer in the world of psychedelics somebody who while i was uh when i was young and having mind opening experiences on lsd and thinking how absolutely insane it was that these blissful states had somehow been criminalized by the state when i was impotently bitching about this to my friends rick doblin was actively doing everything in his power to transform the draconian drug laws that have scheduled some of these life improving psychedelics in the same category as they schedule heroin and meth to a place where they could be prescribed by doctors so this is a hardworking as far as i'm concerned this is a saint and already his hard work is paying off and we're finding out that mdma is a treatment for ptsd which is a disorder that is really destroyed zillions of lives all over the planet and he's just getting started so as i mentioned before if you want to find out more about rick go to his website the multi-disciplinary association of psychedelic studies links will be at dunkintrustle.com if you want to hear more of a conversation with rick he just did a podcast with the great joe rogan on the joe rogan experience that you can download so okay enough of that now everybody please welcome to the dunkintrustle family hour podcast the amazing rick doblin so rick doblin this is such a surreal moment for me suddenly i'm on a right now i'm on a bus in boston and i'm sitting across from one of the pioneers of psychedelics who is doing so you're doing so much work for us right now and it's just a real and for me too yeah um i want to start off by asking if you could just update me on where maps currently is right now when it comes to getting mdma prescribable i know you guys have been raising money to manufacture a batch of mdma but what's going on well things have dramatically changed for the better because of a meeting this afternoon that took place and what we're doing is summarizing 15 years of research with mdma in ptsd patients that we've done at a cost of somewhere near seven million dollars with support and other aspects of it and we're gathering it for presentation to the fda for phase three studies and this transition what it means is phase two is pilot studies where you're trying to just explore and understand who do you want to treat how does your method work what doses do you want to use what patients does it really work in who doesn't it work in how do you understand the the risks and benefits of these drugs and then also how strong is the effect and how variable it is and all of that gives you the idea of how to design these big studies that are going to be used to approve the drug proving safety and efficacy so it it moves into a whole different realm it's and all of the academic researchers all sorts of scientific research that's non drug development so this is a certain kind of science right that it's not just trying to figure out how it's about alleviating suffering it's not about knowledge and that's something really important for people to understand the difference that and there's an aspect of commercial marketing of approval of legal approval for medicine so it's about getting mdma approved by the fda right so what we're doing is summarizing all of our data from the last 15 years about safety and efficacy and reaching out to the other researchers all over the world who've treated about another um thousand people so there's been 1100 people have been mdma not patients but in scientific studies okay so we're trying to gather up all of that data and then gather data per like how much data is there per person like what's the volume of data per person that you have well everybody is treated with this course of psychotherapy that is about three and a half months and it's all videotaped so and we have weekly non drug psychotherapy sessions and then three different times we'll have eight hour mdma sessions that start at 10 in the morning go till six at night what's the dosage how many milligrams well we're changing we're doing all different so these what i mean this is these exploratory studies so we've done some where it's an inactive placebo we've done some with 25 milligrams uh 30 milligrams 40 milligrams and those doses we're trying to figure out um double blind can we um like can we confuse people as to whether they actually got that or they got 75 milligrams which we also use 100 and 125 and even in one study we did 150 so we're doing all these different and then we also have this very smart idea i think of administering supplemental doses of half the initial dose after between one and a half and two and a half hours yeah as a decision between the therapist and the patient so we're trying to give a certain fixed range but variability and fine tuning not just uh according to the psychological or physiological different ways so then there's this eight hour session there they spend the night in the treatment center then the next day they come back and there's um two or three hours sometimes of integrative psychotherapy about what happened before somebody else comes picks them up they can't drive home then we call them every day on the phone for a week checking in with them and that could be 15 minutes and all this is um being recorded and notes are taking notes are taking and we're documenting everything and then there's um three or four more weeks of non-drug psychotherapy and then a second mdma session and then that happens again a third mdma session and that's it and then two months later is when we evaluate them and that's what's called the primary outcome measure that's what is really used to show safety and efficacy but then we also do can you talk a little bit about the primary outcome measure what is made up of yes and and here's our advantage the primary outcome measure for ptsd so is called the clinician administered ptsd scale okay and this was developed by the va and it's been updated constantly over the years and it's been um this is the the caps four is what we've been using the caps five is just coming out as they refine their understanding of this and it has to do with certain kind of avoidance behaviors certain kind of intrusion behaviors avoidance behaviors like not going out triggers yeah something triggers your reminder of your trauma and so you avoid this whole okay got you yeah there's emotional hyper reactivity got you aspects of it nightmares and then then there's also emotional numbing there's different kind of symptoms and for us the key issue is we use all these lower doses to try to find a place where there was a confusion between the doses and then we would show a dose response relationship that the more MDMA you got the more therapy you got the better you got that that it was and then we would that's how we would deal with the double blind issue and that's how we would do the big phase three studies would be these low doses compared to these you know the highest dose the 125 milligrams so but it turned out the data was really different is that the lower doses were um meet people uncomfortable that that they were open a little but their fear was not reduced enough they were just and and that reduced the effect they still got a little bit better but the people that had the therapy without the MDMA with the placebo did even better it kind of muted the therapy it made them a little uncomfortable but then what totally surprised us was at 75 milligrams compared to 125 the people got even better right the the medium dose the 75 milligrams often again 37 and a half after one and a half to two and a half hours so it's a it's a good dose those people did the best of all but 125 you're saying is was great for a lot but the 75 people did this milligram people did even better okay and that but not for everybody but but that but that led us to a whole understanding and of what's really going on and the relationship between the mystical experience and therapeutic outcome with MDMA and how that's different with psilocybin that this um there's you people are more grounded when they take these medium doses and what's happening is that their memories are coming back of their trauma but their fear response is muted and they're feeling this deep deep self-acceptance and they're looking back at the trauma from a perspective now right and they're storing it into longer term memory with enhanced frontal cortex thinking about it and they're able to have this laid out in this kind of emotional tone this difference so the next time they recall this memory the emotional tone so that memory reconciliation non-psychiatrist sorry to cut you off okay very quickly a trauma happens yeah and so whatever it may be whatever it is some awful thing happens to you you see your friend get blown up and so this gets stored in in your brain while you're experiencing massive releases of adrenaline and are you saying that this memory is getting stored in a different part of the brain yeah there's it's kind of a shorter term memory and it's the and it's constantly re-triggered by the emotional tone yeah like it's so in so that so in between the part of the brain that stores it for long term and the short term it's getting stuck in short term and just sort of bouncing around and and the first thing filter is like this fear reaction filter of you know is that something that that we need to protect ourselves from you know so that this kind of instinct instantaneous fear reaction to a trauma is it keeps it in this you know but then it doesn't it's not relaxed it's not processed it's not processed yeah yeah and that's why you can actually change these things within an instant within a different attitude you know and when your attitude is stuck sometimes you give a drug and your chemistry changes and in a supportive context you can look at things and it gets stored in a different way that's called memory reconciliation and now there's research being done at Rockefeller University we just sent them we're sending them four grams of MDMA for animals we're being they're looking at mechanisms of action how does this actually work yeah and how does certain fears get extinguished and how does memory shift after in response to a trauma and when these animals are giving MDMA so that's the science is really developing but the FDA doesn't care about that the FDA doesn't care how it works they just show can you show it's safe and can you show it helps somebody and then the theory of how it works people are suffering right now so that's what I'm saying the difference between knowledge yes and the science of drug development science so that's what we're doing and this movement towards this negotiation with FDA we have this tremendous advantage of the fact that the FDA is really interested in science over politics this branch of the FDA and this branch of the FDA reviews psychedelic research you reviews marijuana research and they've been when did this branch of the FDA come into existence well I did my phd at the Kennedy school government and part of my dissertation was on this this was the pilot drug evaluation staff began in 1999 1989 and 1990 right around that years when it started and then they were looking at a lot of the AIDS people had criticized the FDA for being too slow to approve drugs too cautious and so they tried to say how do we speed drug development up so this was the pilot drug evaluation staff okay the pilot new drug evaluation ways and they needed real drugs to work with and so they had to they looked around all the other body parts were all captured by different divisions at the FDA all the other drugs were all taken so they had to take some drugs and they took psychedelics and marijuana as weren't being used which had been blocked for decades and then they're like okay you know we can handle the risk of these drugs that's the argument that they made that these are not that different from amphetamines they're not that different from opiates they're not different from tranquilizers that the FDA knows how to regulate drugs I mean this is like there's politics about you know drug war and stuff but but the FDA is like these are just drugs and we can control and manage it so we want to let research happen and that started well that flies in the face of the kind of like stereotypical like paranoid hippie idea of the FDA is this drooling evil bunch of ogres who want to ruin everything it doesn't that doesn't jive of what I've heard about the FDA right right and that's the fundamental mistake a lot of people make is they think in black and white terms and they deem they make over generalizations and they go by patterns from the past they don't update for the future right that the you you have to look at what are the institutional mission of the different federal agencies and then also what's the control system politically right and the FDA has been very supportive even against other government agencies telling them to shut stuff down here's what the FDA that NIDA which has the the national institute on drug abuse has the monopoly on the supply of marijuana used in the united states and has since 1968 we're trying to break that monopoly but anyway they mean the supply of marijuana used for studies for studies yeah yeah right yeah so they've had this monopoly and it's been a major obstruction to medical marijuana research we're trying to end it and they're just trying to block it but with psychedelics we have our own independent sources of supply and so the normal way that FDA reviews a protocol is they review your design and then where the drug comes from they say okay if you've shown us that you've got the drug great if not we put a clinical hold on it but our normal way of reviewing things is to look at the science first and then then you work on the drug so we did that multiple times FDA said yes but NIDA with their monopoly wouldn't sell us the marijuana so NIDA then why they because they want the propaganda of you know marijuana is bad and studies into the beneficial uses but they've changed their mind now NIDA things are changing all around them so so yes they were now they want to get rid of this monopoly and they want the NIDA doesn't want to have the monopoly but because they're getting so much pressure for it and the it costs them so much money they have so much other stuff to do and they're also they've given up like they we need research everybody agrees we need research on medical use that and foreign imports so now some foreign producers of medical marijuana are going to try to get FDA standards all right so NIDA went to FDA this is before they changed before they're changed right they said the FDA stop approving protocols for maps for marijuana until we say yes or no that we'll sell it to them we don't want Rick to say hey FDA said yes and we won't sell them the marijuana that's bad so they filed for they asked the FDA stop doing that change your procedures and I filed a protest with the FDA ombudsman about this and it went through the channels and it ended up the FDA said tonight to forget it we approve protocols that was and they had this meeting in 1992 at they were started in 89 90 around that then they approved rick strassman's study with DMT in 1990 and then charlie grove and I were trying to get them to approve a marijuana I mean an MDMA study for cancer patients yeah with anxiety and so they convened this meeting in 92 and said analyzed it and said yes we're going to open up the door to psychedelic research we're going to treat it the same way as other research and therefore that's because of you that's because that's because me and charlie and rick strassman and yeah and others and dave nickles all sorts of people where they are I mean it was like a community effort but there there's like a point of pressure and the point of pressure in this case was charlie grove and my protocol for MDMA for cancer patients we were saying we want to do something and the same way that we're saying to the government and have since 2001 we want to grow marijuana for our own research we want to break this monopoly so the FDA is got really good people in it and so for for hippies to think the FDA is trying to control my vitamins and you know wipe out everything that's it um you know there there's nothing is monolithic there's like a fiefdoms even inside the FDA because they each control different body parts and they can look at different drugs for different things but look what the FDA just did what is one of the most hot topics in America right now is these anti-abortion bills the right wing yeah trying to eliminate abortion all over America yes what did FDA just do they made the abortion pill r u46 easier to access more in line with the science even in the face of you know a lot of conservative political opinion not wanting them to do that and the FDA did it and they that's where the FDA has got politicized about women's reproductive rights but it just seems to delay things they come and with psychedelics we don't really have the opposition we're working people are recognizing that the pharmaceutical medications that are available for PTSD for certain anxiety depression things that they they're palliative or they don't work that much they don't like make it so what are the most popular current currently the most popular medications used for PTSD there's two that are approved SSRI Zoloft and Paxil but if you talk to vets about what they're given by the VA they they have like a cocktail of like a massive number of different drugs that are there's only two drugs approved for PTSD but they try all these other drugs Zoloft and Paxil so what we're trying to do to demonstrate to the FDA and that's what we talked about earlier today and the breakthrough that happened in my mind today about how we're going to be able to do this is that you need to have two large scale phase three studies so we're trying to say that we've done about 105 people so far and we think we're going to have to do about 450 more right but the 450 more are divided into two studies you know 225 and 225 something like that and the first one we're going to get half the people are going to get the therapy that I described it's around 40 hours of therapy with a male female team takes place over three and a half months and once a month for three months people get this eight-hour session listening to music half the time talking with the therapist and half of those people will get just an inactive placebo and the other half will get on the first dose 75 milligrams of MDMA with this optional supplemental dose then they can decide in conjunction with the therapists do they want to stay at that dose level or go to the higher in which case it would be 125 milligrams and then again with these supplement and then they would have the third dose the third session and they could again refine the dose a little bit right so it's just these three sessions and then at the and all again videotaped and data is massive data gathering how do we pick these people are they people who have PTSD or they people who have tried MDMA before no these are people that have had PTSD and have failed on currently available medications to get better so they're called chronic treatment resistant PTSD patients does it matter if they've had experience with MDMA well it um we let we do say that people can have had five prior experiences with MDMA right but it may matter somewhat that they know what it is you know if you take it in a recreational setting sometimes and you haven't really felt comfortable to really be openly therapeutic in yourself and be more personal I mean that it's um that there's something about the first bunch of sessions that that affect people very deeply sometimes for different people different times there's um kind of a slow muting of the effect over but over a long time but so we're we want to you this is called subject enrichment so what we're trying to do is see which population can we show that it's really going to work and getting all the factors lined up so our main thing is we're going to optimize therapeutic outcomes and we're not being that efficient we that's why we have a male female we have a two-person therapy team yes it's really better is it twice as better is it worth but we're doing it in a way where the second person can be a student learning so it's a way to also train the next generation and have a lower cost no no the therapists are the the patients probably want that a little bit no the patients want to have about half the time when people have taken MDMA their eyes are closed they're inner listening to music they're they're telling themselves different stories um they uh generally it's the therapist we they might bring in one or two of their favorite things but but that's kind of pre-pattern in a way we we want to not have them we want to have them fresh they've had but and supported but but sometimes they can say i don't want to hear you know that music donovan i don't want to hear donovan well first off we try to avoid mostly words we mostly avoid music with words again because the essence of the method is that once you um the person's unconscious is activated by MDMA right and that that's the guide we're not the guide we don't know best we don't know you know the person that knows that the person the best is themselves and there's this inner wisdom of the order or whatever and so what we what do you mean of the order well of there's a flow of uh experiences so what i mean is that in an eight hour session some people will talk about the trauma early on right some people won't get till till six hours later some people will go to happy mood first or some people will just not even talk about the trauma they'll talk about some other thing that that you were just like again stunned to hear that has some emotional resonance but it's not not this it's like some different thing that happened at school that when they were five or yeah you know but it's just like something that made a deep impression on them you should get into and then then sometimes they are um able to just go inside and tell themselves just flow with this this these metaphors they it's beautiful they're talking in metaphors and poetry an example um somebody had a gorilla locked in his uh a wild animal locked in a cage inside him they had to keep inside him all the time because if this uh wild animal would get out and this was his uh his military aggression yeah and then he saw and then if that everything would you know but he saw as long as he was keeping this in the cage that it was going to be in range they had to somehow find a way to channel this energy and not just keep letting out this you know and becoming friends with this wild animal yeah you know so so you've been in a session where someone is saying I feel like there's a wild animal no no this was not a session that I was in this was a session that was yes because this has been a yeah so how does the therapist respond to that if the patient says I have a wild animal inside of me what's the response what does it feel like yeah and so that it's sort of this you know it's your wild animal how do you relate to it what does it mean to you and you got to figure it out but we're here to say that it's something that we believe um there's this self healing mechanism inside you that this MDMA has helped catalyze and that is burdened some symptoms that you've had that that it will be helped if if you um take a dialogue with this wild animal so a self healing mechanism what is that what is the self healing mechanism well what happens when you scratch your arm yeah it heals it heals where that's it and the mind probably has something like that okay right so somehow MDMA is accelerating that process or when or I guess you'd say it's more like or even dreaming it's I'm saying that like that you're psyche that the dreaming is part of um you know healing um reorganizing the brain it's a healthy process bragging hard drive yeah that there's this um inner well of um deeper feelings and of unconscious of things that are that that emerge amazing under psychedelics do you ever feel do you ever feel like um do you ever feel so you're sitting down with the FDA and I'll tell you what you know what I I briefly what I might think of a psych a psychedelic I think a psychedelic a good psychedelic experience connects me with God is what I think and there is a an instantaneous healing that happens when you make a connection or you remember that you are connected whatever way you can you describe God a little bit yeah sure he's got a six pack he hates gay people he's a he for sure pissed man he's pissed that's a great question so yeah okay so so with psilocybin with LSD with the classics psychedelics that God experience that mystical connection that is part of the healing mechanism right and that's what people who are scared of dying who have life-threatening illnesses or have addictions that helps them yes very very much but in the PTSD work that's the distinction is that it's about catharsis okay okay which is why we had the um burning man on the wall in the washington c dc wall that we had it was called catharsis okay and we had the first burn in many many many decades maybe even a hundred years yeah this was the thing that just happened yeah that was sort of my instigation no yeah and it was described that because some people haven't heard of it can you tell everyone what what it was yeah well maybe I'll backtrack and tell a little bit of how it came about and just that um I've already talked about the government monopoly on marijuana so we're suing yeah NIDA owns this monopoly but DEA is the one that holds the chokehold on the licenses so NIDA is not really the resistance the point of resistance NIDA now says there should be an end of the monopoly but it's the DEA that has this monopoly they won't give other people licenses so we're suing the DEA professor kraker we have big dc law firms helping us in the american civil liberties union and it's about a lot of testimony and I was one of the witnesses and we were actually doing really well and looking like we were persuading this administrative law judge which we eventually did but I was one of the witnesses and at that I testified because it was going to be marijuana grown for maps and what we're going to do with it and why and why do we need to do it and um the prosecution the sort of the DEA lawyers at the end of the day they tried to discredit my testimony I've made a really um strong impression with the judge with what we presented and then they tried to discredit me personally because that's what they try to do if they can't deal with your arguments and so we had prepared for that and the only way they could try to do that was to talk about did I smoke marijuana was I criminal oh man and so we had all figured it out that um they're probably going to ask that and the lawyers were going to object because I'm not asking for the license it's this professor kraker who's worked at military labs growing stuff to go after coca plants and you know as top scientists that I wasn't even going to be there it might it was irrelevant so we were prepared for that the lawyers said okay it's irrelevant and then the judge surprised us and she said this was um in a criminal case you complete the fifth and the judge can not draw any negative inferences it's your constitutional right and you just choose to use it and yeah but in a civil case which is this is the judge if you don't answer a question the judge can assume whatever she wants to assume and and the DEA was like I'm an addict and I'm going to steal this government you know this marijuana that I'm spending all these years trying to get marijuana I'm addicted to marijuana and I'm gonna you know just you know as if yes so so I decided that that I would answer the question and I said yeah I smoke a couple times a week and um and then it was a delicate moment because it wasn't um clear what they would do information but it wasn't enough for a search warrant and and it was it was totally would have the judge they started asking me where do you get your marijuana like this ridiculous then the judge just stopped their line of questioning so they used it against me and I felt like my own use of marijuana my own psychedelic use it sort of hurt the cause kind of right and I felt like I I felt bad and there was this break in the testimony and then there was it was going to come back again it was four days it was going to come back in again in a couple months and between that break was Burning Man all right so I go to Burning Man and I'm just like my spirit's like I don't you know I want to fight back I want it to be accepted I want you know it shouldn't be used again this right and then I saw that there was this I want to bring my burning man's self myself also to Washington D.C. and not be and be proud of it sure so I thought there's this kind of sacred space at Burning Man between the man and the temple and for a bunch of years the temple was like these kind of spread out horizontal structures and the man is always this vertical structure so the man is like the Washington Monument mapping the sacred space of Burning Man on the sacred space of America which is the mall and the Capitol and so the Capitol is like the temple and yeah and then okay so then I thought okay god if we could do this that would be like the full expression freedom and Adam Eininger who works with and for David Bronner who helped legalize marijuana in the District of Columbia is an activist and I was in Washington one time this was now about eight years ago maybe ten years ago and it was an SSDP conference and after the conference was a protest on the Washington Mall and it went it had a band it had music they're protesting the Iraq War it was the Thievery Corporation and it was fantastic it went till two in the morning and I thought wow well if we could do this till sunrise if we could really have like this all night cathartic protest of the drug war you know if we could do this it would be a freedom it would be utterly you know we would be this would be our country we'd be free it sort of and so that's how but it took ten years to try to figure out like how to really do it and and so you can't just have party on the mall it has to be a protest right you have to protest something and there has to be a political expression and what we really wanted to express is the drug war and that's what was all of this was wrapped up into and so when it finally was possible because Adam had had experience working with the National Park Service already yes and that he'd been he had a lot of support for his marijuana legalization efforts and his political activism in DC he had really good connections and the burner community had evolved to the point where they had a lot of different skills and we're all throughout the the system and and so I finally felt like um how do you do the all night dance though how do you do that and I was like well so just you're you were thinking how do I bring Burning Man to DC yes this is your idea yeah I bring Burning Man to DC to protest the war on drugs well it was just a yes yes that we that that that we're Americans that this Burning Man is this is America this is innovation this is healthy this is society building this is not to an intern on dropout or this is not revolution and we're tear down the system you know this is not the 60s this is different it's about how this can be integrated and energized and that's so our Burning Man cells should be like right there you know there's Christian fundamentalists you know setting up tents on the Washington mall but telling their stories they they should be able to do that your job is you have this is symbolic my job is like symbolic social change so in a way I'm trying to do um not individual psychotherapy but social psychotherapy for sick policies and to help people get ready for psychedelic experiences but some part of you must feel on a professional level you you have so much riding on these studies that you're currently doing with MDMA and to risk blowing the whole thing with an action like what just happened it's really curious like how do you how do you justify that level of risk because what happens if some of these feds see you out there and they're like see he just he's this is just a classic hippie you love smoking weed let's we don't you aren't you worried that this will invalidate all of your research that's a fantastic question and and you've sort of put your finger on one of the main divides in the psychedelic research community it's a it's a tremendously important issue but different people see it differently and the way that I see it is that it protects there's a risk in doing it but the the kind of direct confrontation to the war on drugs the kind of we need psychedelic harm reduction we need this is all these things you know should be legal that direct kind of progress on larger drug policy protects the work that we're doing with psychedelics and makes a backlash less likely rather than more likely and the risk that we had was we got a permit for it I mean this is what we're saying we're trying to do this in the open yes with understanding and that we're going to be responsible yeah and so we were able to say that this was a tremendous experiment by the national park service in democracy and that that this would not be a pot smoking event this was not like this was a burning man burning the temple kind of sacred and in this community and also all night cathartic dancing and then the night before you know symposium and drug war stories people telling the stories of what and that was a total addition I hadn't envisioned that that was just fantastic you know cool and so we were able to have nobody got busted right no it worked out great it worked out great and the for me the highlight of the whole thing was we had the zendo there we had a whole space set up the zendo project zendo is your psychedelic harm reduction is part of the so you guys go to music festivals with these zendos it formerly known as freak out tents right that's what it is but if someone's having a difficult trip they go to these places and you have people trained to yes yes and it's a little bit of a direct response again to the freak out in a way that that it's not about talking people down one of the principles is is talk through not talk down right so that we give people an opportunity to sort of feel comfortable enough to wrestle with this you know inner monster or whatever they envision that it is so that they can kind of see that and part of that is that's a risk okay we're dealing with people are doing illegal drugs and we're trying to do stuff with the DEA on the other hand we're reducing the fear of parents of their kids flipping out at these events and we're also doing a service taking these people shouldn't be arrested and we're trying to help with the whole general so can we do something real quickly because I think this is of all the education that maps does to me the most important is teaching people how to deal with their friend when they start having a freak out right and I was wondering can we very quickly I'm gonna act like I'm freaking out yeah yeah yeah yeah give me first okay the wrong way to deal with it and then the right way to deal with it okay so very quickly we'll pretend I've taken a lot of mushrooms you and I are hanging out and you're the bad friend all right yeah example of the bad way to deal with it all right okay so let's do it really quickly uh Rick Rick I keep hearing I keep hearing cops everywhere man I keep hearing cops everywhere and I feel like I'm having I'm pretty sure I'm having a heart attack yeah just don't pay don't pay attention to that it's not important just try to distract yourself and and you know the more you think about bad stuff the worse it's gonna get so just don't even think don't even don't even think about that no don't even think about that I'm having a heart attack you're doing this to yourself now I want my mom I want my mom I want my mom I came from her how what are you what have you taken do you know what you've taken did you know it what it's a mushroom do you know around how long ago you've taken them or do you have any idea of time or are your friends where's your friends where where's the rest of the friends okay we've got a space for you you're gonna be fine well you know now you just take care of yourself have you been uh drink do you have any water do you need any fruit juice okay here's some fruit juice we've got a special porta potty right over here if you need to but we have this place to lie down and we have these people trained to talk to you so if you'd like to come in that's cool okay so then then you start talking about um you want your mother well well your mother died when you were three years old or and or you tell start telling this a story and and it comes from you and then just listen we're listening we'd be supportive and yeah it's beautiful and so many people you know when their friends are flipping out they don't know how to deal with it and it's a really confusing space to be in because quite often you're high when your friends flipping out yeah the most important thing to know is that it's not like once it starts to go bad then you're sunk you know that that that the way out is to go fully into it and that you need so the first thing is you create a safe space you make it so people can have an interior experience they don't have to pay attention to the outside world and that safe space can take place in the middle of chaos even if you just have a friend or somebody creates a space around you where you can just lie down or you could do it in a crowd but it's better if you find some safe space and then you try to get a sense of just the likely trajectory and part of creating safe spaces okay maybe I'm going to be here for the next eight hours or you know you try this consistent so we have people that have the the shifts in the time to make a long-term commitment to this process right and then that helps people relax too but we also you know sometimes have shift changes and but but people have this stable environment and then they're encouraged to you know talk through not talk down but we're encouraged to think of ourselves as sitters not guides right so it's like we're not guiding we're the guide thing's kind of old hat right people kind of look at that now is like that's not the way to do it well it's a okay word and people use uh then I think the um it's taken to mean like creating a context for people but it's it's being like around a patronizing friend yeah yeah you see the flower of life go into it surrender to the flower of life okay now now where you're talking about is guided imagery all right so so there's a whole different way of therapy with guided imagery so one time our method is not the it's imagery that um you generate we don't even use words in the music if if we can but there was one time where um I was sitting with someone who was actually btsd from 9 11 and there was a woman psychiatrist and myself working with this fella in this tb at burning man trying to help him work through this eight years before and it was really how did you make contact with him actually I've been wanting again I'm telling you I do symbolic I had wanted something like that for years and hadn't quite gel and then he was actually camping with David Bronner at burning man one years and so I met him through David Bronner and you say you've been wanting you've been wanting to work on work with someone who had ptsd from 9 11 I thought just I mean because we're oppressed we're trying to tell a story to we're trying to tell stories to uh frighten public about drugs and psychedelics and yeah yeah so I I sort of had this idea of that would be a good if that would develop and actually um and then people are symbols and they're people there and they're individuals at the same time and and you kind of like keep that straight and yeah sure yeah so while we were doing this work there was um another people who were comfortable with psychedelics but weren't like trained therapists right and they were working with a woman who um had been raped at burning man before wow years before and had kind of overcome it by trying to help other help promote dialogue about about sex at burning man right the bureau of erotic discourse yeah and that but that there were still issues about um the rape and the trauma from that right so these other people were working with her and they were doing guided imagery just like like we're saying and I was just in the back of my head thinking okay we've got this method we wouldn't do that and but um it you know it worked it worked you know but it's okay because a lot of it is um people are doing their own internal work right you know and what you're saying helps um or helps a lot but um and now it's starting to help integrate this into this MDMA assisted psychotherapy we're working with various therapists trained affiliated with the VA researchers there who've developed new methods for treating PTSD but have developed non-drug psychotherapies and there's several of them now the the key one is called prolonged exposure where you just repeat the trauma over and over and eventually you get dead into it and then you are cured huh I mean that's one of the main methods there's thousands of therapists trained in prolonged exposure and it can help to some degree some people but there's a lot of people is retraumatizing to sure it sounds brutal it's hard and um and so they want to see blending MDMA with that there's another one the first one that we're going to start um in about a month or so which is fantastic study there's um couples therapy and it's where one member of the couple has PTSD and it affects the relationship and so it's a it's a form of couples therapy to support the person with PTSD but to acknowledge the way it's affecting the relationship and so the VA National Center for PTSD when we first started thinking about what to blend how they might use MDMA they just thought MDMA love drug hug drug you know just made them think about this couples therapy study and so we have now got permission to give both members of the couple MDMA and couples therapy is something that the way it's structured it's not a disease so we can't make MDMA into a medicine through the FDA for couples therapy because it's not a disease but it's a really important use of MDMA it's it's fantastic it's one of the best uses that's why it became one of the most popular drugs in the world yeah and you know couples therapy relationships and and so we're sort of backing into it by using um we're studying PTSD but we're helping to blend so we have our method other things can work we're trying the core element is what's called the therapeutic alliance and that's that first part that friends can do for other friends create a safe space it's the alliance between the therapist and the patient about how they're working together there's a trusting safe supportive environment and that in the psychotherapy outcome research has shown to be the most important factor more than the school of psychotherapy that you have this everything that you're talking about is is obviously beautiful but so many of us we do not have a therapeutic alliance we don't even have therapists we have our friends that we like to trip with right can we create this therapeutic alliance with friends yes totally I see that's the um that's why it's a sense of safety and trust and so when I think the key mistake is that a bunch of friends say we're going to take drugs we're going to go and have a party we're going to go to this event it's going to be fun and that's all we're looking for and then if somebody has something deeper coming up then that's a sign that it's going wrong suppress it here take the tranquilizer you know we're out here to have fun then you end up worse off so I think that that's the thing to avoid is when you take these drugs you sort of should sign on for whatever this emergence is right and not just try to narrow okay only the happy you know whatever and because the other time it deepens the happiness we even have a measure we use called the post-traumatic growth inventory it's about how people can grow after trauma in response it makes them refine what they want to spend their time on or realize how precious it is to be just kind to somebody or yeah you know that that there's all of these ways in which people can can grow and integrate trauma and so we're just trying to look both at the therapy component the MDMA component and we're trying to go for a cure a durable remission sometimes it will come back we're trying to help people be without drugs to work through these issues and we do find that some people you know life continues to traumatize people sometimes and if you've been traumatized like that you're more vulnerable so there's a there's some relapse rate and and we actually have gotten permission from FDA to give another MDMA session to people and we're trying to integrate this into America that's what we're talking about and so before though um yeah okay about MDMA though is this search for um you know a cure to help people be without it and they may relapse but and now so the whole work we're doing with marijuana now we have a we have a 2.1 million dollar grant from the state of Colorado to study marijuana for PTSD and 76 veterans cool and this is something we've been trying for six years taken forever to get this study approved and now because um we're doing non-profit drug development we give away our protocol and there's a for-profit company in Canada that's um Tilray and they want to do some research so they're going to replicate our protocol but using their marijuana and then they're going to have it vaporized we're going to have it smoked and then there's a whole study now in the University of Sydney Australia with the same protocol this grandfather had a granddaughter who had um pediatric epilepsy and nothing helped her and then CBD helped her and he gave like 34 million dollars to the University of Sydney the largest grant in their entire history for cannabis research so now they're going to use the protocol and it'll be um edibles so we'll have the same same kind of thing but the thing about marijuana is that it's more of a palliative treatment that people tend to use it every day it it doesn't reorder the brain and memory in quite the same way that MDMA does that we've described that the marijuana what about LSD does it reorder the brain in a LSD is is more like the MDMA or psilocybin yeah you can repattern but there's a yes you can yeah definitely a similar effect a similar effect but but there's a more of a challenge to the ego more of a challenge to letting go right more a little bit scarier and also a little bit less biographical more you know what does it mean to just be human and live and die and more general kind of things and we're with MDMA for memory reconciliation it helps to be stuck in or in your biography this takes you kind of out of the other side and then you have these more mystical experiences that then can also be therapeutic in a different way of making you feel connected unless lonely or more loving or more self accepting and more beyond your narrow ways of thinking and more you know these people that are black people you know they're not really different than me or you know this these islamic people you know well you know the sufis are islamic you know there's these mystical branches of all these religions that are happy to like with each other and pray with each other and it's not like you know but the fundamentalists are really too rigidly holding on and violent and do you do you this is my final question for you because you are you're clearly a pioneer and you're and you're someone who is you know in a relatively small but very active group of people who are working on getting this stuff into the mainstream if it all works if it works everything that you're trying to accomplish is accomplished right what kind of world what kind of America are we living in 10 years or so if everything works out okay well actually I can tell you like over the next 30 years okay all right so because things will roll out I don't think it's like instantaneous change so I think that in five years from now we believe that we will be able to um present evidence to the FDA about the safety and efficacy of MDMA's psychotherapy for PTSD and that we will have treated maybe um you know 450 people in our studies but then treated maybe another 1,000 people on a compassionate basis or another 500 people on a compassionate basis and that then once MDMA is approved we're going to set up psychedelic clinics and other people will set up psychedelic clinics we will train therapists only people that have trained in the method by the sponsor can prescribe they don't have to stick with the method they can say their wisdom is to do it this way or that way but they have to get the basic safety from so not all doctors will be able to no this would be like the best way to think about it is hospice centers kidney dialysis centers method own clinics sort of this is a psychedelic clinic okay now we're moving forward with MDMA um usonna hefter is moving forward with psilocybin friend of life so these will be multi-purpose there's ketamine being used all over for depression so these are going to be psychedelic clinics but ketamine where it's used it's generally not used with psychotherapy it's used just as a pharmacological shock that ketamine helps in people that are refractory depression I think it'd be more effective if they also encased it in this therapeutic a little bit of a therapeutic context with ketamine and the therapy that you've developed for MDMA could it would be the same kind of there yeah ketamine just last an hour it's a whole different thing you're you can't really talk to people as much with ketamine it's different so with psilocybin when it's being used in therapy it's maybe 80 or 90 percent people having their own nonverbal experiences listening to music and and only 10 or 20 percent of dialogue with the therapists about what's going on it's more people left on their own to have these wordless kind of experiences but with MDMA it's more half and half so um so we have these clinics they start springing up yeah so these clinics eventually now here's a 30-year model which is the first hospice center was in 1974 by 2004 there was over 3,500 of them right so we're going to have all of these we're going to have psychedelic clinics all over and they will grow starting um actually you know five years from now with approval and even before with the researchers and then what we're going to be seeing is medicalization leads to people's changing minds about criminalization of these drugs right we've seen legalization of marijuana grow as medical marijuana has grown because people can understand they have they see people that use it they trust what they're seeing they get more comfortable so the medicalization helps people understand risk benefit and get more comfortable about legalization and public health approaches to abuse rather than criminal justice and then with MDMA what we're going to and with these psychedelic clinics the legalization of marijuana is going to come first when I don't know my my conservative you know guess let's just say is um somewhere like 2024 on a federal level it may even come before then and what may come is um the the congress passing something that just says states can decide right like the end of alcohol prohibition but let's just say 2024 rob campy at the marijuana policy project says it could be 2019 you know so I don't want to get we'll just see so then you get these psychedelic clinics that grow starting in 2021 till 2030 and spread and then um then we also have the progression of religious use right so we have religious freedom for ayahuasca in these two different religions the native american church uses peyote it's hard to create new religions where you know this is central these drugs are central I mean I mean that's we already tried the league of spiritual discovery yeah and the sometimes you know marijuana smugglers claim claim to be rastas yeah you know it's it's hard to to do that so so in our cultural and legal context medicine um is the open door that's it and you can help religious use is great because the religious use of even small groups of ayahuasca users has um what I've seen is that there's a um deepening interest in ayahuasca in people in in america of all different kinds in a kind of reverential you know um but without police interference so that the police guy just like passes right by you know so so that there's this whole in the lot they call the penumbra the like the umbrella the shadow of you know this law but but here we have these legal supreme court cases legitimizing peyote by the name american church and was it legitimizing ayahuasca by the union de vechon and so people are using ayahuasca all over in a more or less um unhindered way yeah there's just been several people in israel have been arrested by the israeli police for ayahuasca the world community of ayahuasca experts and lawyers is trying to help them make a case but but there can be crackdowns because who is a relic i mean sorry but medicine there's a pathway right science we do it so yes so i think that by 20 35 um we're gonna have clinics everywhere people will have gotten used to the legalization of marijuana people will be in general getting more spiritualized that's what globalization is forcing on all of us anyway and the penalties are going to be going going down for the criminal use of mdma there was just a terrific dr john elbrun did something fantastic um just the other day there was a he testified in a case the somebody who was busted related to um mdma and similar kind of drugs and what we've been saying is that the sentencing commission that set up the mandatory minimum mandatory guidelines for how much time you get for certain amounts yeah that they did that and i think it was 2001 i testified they ignored all our testimony five-year mandatory minimum for lsd that they're just you know it's it's um it was irrational and it's the same thing they did with crack cocaine and powder cocaine and the disparities there so the testimony in the court case was that the judges in these mdma cases don't need to go by these mandatory minimum guidelines because they were made in a time of irrational hysteria and the science has passed by and they haven't updated and so the judges don't have to go and that's great they won they won that just happened yeah that just happened just the other day and that's like the third or fourth case like that wow so there's gonna be more um yeah it's it's incredible so that's that's the that's the use again of science that's the other thing okay so now we're taking science we provide with the aclu the aclu is what pioneered this approach yes with our a lot of our evidence that we got from the um mdma studies and that's getting us into the political arena and and i think that makes us safer rather than less safe yeah for sure yeah so that's it so you're saying by 2030 by 2030 we're gonna have clinics you know hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of clinics but i think by 2040 i you know 20 35 or so i think it'll be legal yeah i think it'll be legal all psychedelics will have a culture and what we're gonna have and this may be a good way to you know conclude is that we're gonna have a culture that is more spiritualized and they will be more able to deal with these constant challenges without having to demonize others scapegoat others without indulging the fears and the worst sides of our nature that will be strengthened by the use of these substances in proper supportive ways to be more balanced human beings and we'll be able to move towards transcending these limitations and prejudices and appreciate differences it won't be the end of it's not like a homogeneous soup of one thing it's like everybody's just fine with who they are and delighted to see whoever else is different they are and that this will be the antidote to war and this einstein said that the you know we need a new mode of thinking or else we drift towards unparalleled catastrophe what the new mode of thinking is this spiritual kind of globalization and it's the shift from fundamentalism to mysticism cool and that's what we'll have if we look at us the other social change movements that have succeeded recently gay rights i mean there's still a lot of struggles but gay marriage what has been instrumental to their success it's been gay people coming out and owning who they are and often people are completely surprised by who's gay they've been hiding it but they've gone to all corners of our society they've accomplished everything and they've they're just like the rest of us and they need to be accepted and so the coming out part is really important so we've organized for our 30th anniversary the series of global psychedelic dinners and they could go to the maps.org website and read about these dinners and what we're asking people to do is to share with their friends to invite people and have these dialogues about what psychedelics have meant to them or what they hope for or want to learn about psychedelic research and at the same time that they're sort of helping this coming out process and telling their stories then they can get more comfortable telling it to other people and sort of having it be more out in the open so anyone can do these dinners yeah and right now what we're trying to do as part of our making MDMA into a medicine is we're buying a kilogram of MDMA medical grade MDMA and it's costing us four hundred thousand dollars for a kilogram that's eight thousand doses so it's roughly fifty dollars a dose 125 milligrams wow but it's that's exceedingly more than the normal cost of a dose these days that's yeah because most of it is the documentation the paperwork so this initial batch seventy four thousand dollars is going towards validating the methods that are used to make this okay because we have to make a batch but it also has to be in a way that could scale way up for when it becomes a medicine right and the same company that makes pharmaceutical medicines for all different companies right and so it's for the paperwork we have to unfortunately spend fifty three thousand dollars to do a stability study a three-year stability study even though the MDMA that we currently use was made in 1985 it's 31 years old as we're in great and we know that it'll make it for three years so anyway the price will go down but we're asking people to go to these dinners tell their stories and if they are motivated to donate towards our purchase of this participate with us in a legal drug deal to purchase MDMA to make it into a medicine that we'll use all over the world and we have our 30th anniversary celebration that's going to take place April 17th free from any kind of police interference with full support of the police because we're helping trauma with police officers we got a police officer in our PTSD study wow we got veterans firefighters including another one from 9 11 and police officers and so the April 17th Sunday from 5 to 11 Pacific time we're having our 30th anniversary banquet celebration and entertainment it's going to be an incredible event and there are people giving talks and it's going to be live stream at maps.org slash live 30 great and uh android johns and phedra it's it's going to be um ken jordan of crystal methad cool there's going to be uh just an incredible kind of movie by dj spooky music and movie about the creation of the universe in this gorgeous facility created for masonic rituals the scottish rite temple oh nice and we're gonna have a lot of interesting talks from patients but you must be sold out for tickets for that right no no actually we're not it no we're not yeah we have like 500 more i mean this is a big spot yeah so this is for people that are in the bay area this should be incredible that sounds so fun i wish i was going to be there yeah yeah sunday from 5 to 11 it's live stream all over and um it's just um every once in a while you kind of have to celebrate and yes even though for us i really the shakespeare said something incredible many things but one of the things that really stuck me is he said there's many a slip twix the cup and the lip you know that you think you've got it and it's like almost there and then you spill it on yourself or something so that you know we're just sort of gathering our um energy and confidence to kind of but not be overconfident as the hardest steps are ahead right to really train hundreds of therapists and go in um 20 different sites to do the research in europe and the united states and elsewhere and so it's a lot of work it's a lot of work and thank god you're the one at the helm it's yours you're you're doing such wonderful things friends listening please definitely go to the links i'll have all the links in the comment section of this um oh one last other thing uh psychedelics because because we are also believing that being involved in the struggles of the day makes us safer rather than less safe so there's a hashtag um psychedelics because it's a whole dialogue about again this coming out psychedelics um are important to me because right i value them or that's cool and so we're trying to get this really large like discussion going as well great beautiful i'll have all the links at dunkartrussell.com again thank you very much friend thanks for being

316^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 321: Daniele Bolelli Transcript and Discussion^2019-01-12^We are family. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JCPenney. Family get-togethers to fancy occasions, wedding season two. We do it all in style. Dresses, suiting, and plenty of color to play with. Get fixed up with brands like Liz Claiborne, Worthington, Stafford, and Jay Farrar. Oh, and thereabouts for kids. Super cute and extra affordable. Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, oh beautiful friends. It is I, D Trussell, and thou hath tuned in to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, an enclave of auditory, orgasmic expulsions. I'm now officially a dad. And this is now officially a family hour. Not that it wasn't before, but it's a family hour on every level. I have spawned. I have reproduced. I have experienced the miracle of life, and it really is a miracle. It truly is. It's just all the stuff you hear, that's it. It's truly one of the most spectacular, the most spectacular experience of my life, a kind of simultaneous death of a certain part of myself, an instantaneous rebirth, a strange form of confirmation of some theories that I had mixed in with a ton, a billion tons, a megaton, something beyond tonnage, the source of all tons of pure ego demolishing. You didn't know shit, man. Of course, that's not how it talks. It doesn't talk like someone ear-beating you about ancient aliens, it's some rotten kegger. It talks in the language of flowers and the wind and of forests and of waterfalls, and of the thing behind forests and winds and waterfalls. It talks like whatever it is that gold is reflecting. It talks like the source of sources, and it has a wonderful thing that it says to you, except the language that it speaks in is the language that angels speak, and the simultaneously beautiful, yet somewhat frustrating thing about this particular language is that the moment you remember how to speak it, you instantaneously forget it because it only happens in the moment. And so, in that way, it is somehow incredibly beautiful and yet somehow completely normal and truly transformative in the ultimate way. And also, it's scary as hell, and it is also incredibly stressful. And, man, we're exhausted right now. We're tired, we're tired. This little boy, he's so wonderful, but there's not like the normal kind of sleep is not happening right now. One of my friends explained it to me, the way he described it to me, is like, well, you know, you've been to burning, man, so you know what it's like to not sleep in the normal way. It's like that, your sleep cycles just, whatever that was or whatever the sort of rhythm of normal day-to-day life, that goes away. And you end up in this kind of very interesting primordial process that is just awe-inspiring and filled with so many incredible components and little, it's just, I don't know how to describe it. It's like, imagine like if the whole universe suddenly became like some kind of pouch filled with diamonds that had been harvested by a meteorite that was made of love. That helps you understand what it's like to see your son. And then your son looks like your mom who passed, and then you just have to start crying, because what else are you gonna do? It's either cry or start speaking in tongues in the delivery room, which you definitely don't wanna do. I mean, you could do it at the hospital we were at. They, I don't think they would have minded, but, and probably they've seen it before, but you don't wanna do that because you drowned out your baby who is speaking in tongues. He's speaking in the primary language, which is the sound children make the moment they enter into this dimension and start crying. And that is not the kind of cry that I thought it was before I had experienced it. It is truly a beautiful cry, the sweetest sound you ever heard in your whole life. And I could go, I could probably keep doing, I could go on and on like this for probably two days straight, just making strange psychedelic analogies to describe the experience. And it still wouldn't help if you haven't been there. And I'm not saying you should go there necessarily. This isn't like some kind of like, we're not talking about just like, this isn't an amusement park ride. And my God, I certainly would never have been equipped for it in different versions of me. But, and I don't know if anyone could ever actually be equipped for it in any version of themselves, because I don't think anyone could do it on their own. It requires a community and help and surrender and God and gurus and whatever your particular source connection is, all that stuff, man. The rubber is really hitting the road here, sweeties. And so don't worry. I'm not gonna go on and on about fatherhood at the beginning of every single one of these episodes. It's not gonna literally turn into like the family discussion hour. It's not gonna be the hymn of the obnoxious reproducer. I'm not gonna blast you with the sonic equivalent of Instagram pictures of my darling baby. But I hope that you can not just hear the exhaustion in my voice, but also hear the ah, because that's what I'm feeling. A lot of ah, and a lot of joy and a lot of fear and a lot of happiness and a lot of just everything. It's everything. It's everything. It's the atom splitting right in front of you. It's the, man, I could go on and on. I won't. I could just, maybe I'll just make an album of me describing birth, the birth experience. Just me doing this. Yeah, that'd be a great one. Maybe put some drums under it. Let's see here. Get some drums going here and let's see. Maybe like a cheesy saxophone. There we go. Perfect. Yeah, that's it. Birth. It's like a giraffe blowing out a candle inside a black hole. Birth. It's like if you pulled a fish out of the mouth of Jesus on the cross, except it wasn't a cross. It was a fence in front of God's house. Birth. It's what would happen if a rainbow started crying. Only it wasn't tears. It was rainbows. Birth. It's like a pinata filled with placenta that smells like something that came from a place that places come from. Birth. It happened to you. My loves, we have a glorious podcast for you today. Danielle Bolele is back with us today and we talk about birth and we talk about death. But before that, I gotta read something to you that was dropped into my backyard by a very powerful looking crow. First this, this episode has been supported by my glorious benefactors over at Squarespace.com. It's 2019 and you are the universe flowering into time.

All you have to do is head over to Squarespace and use their beautiful templates created by world-class designers to form your brand new site. Just because much like some kind of technological caterpillar we find society itself melting down into an intermediary slurry like state. Doesn't mean that you can't create a incredible website. You wanna see a great website, not to pat myself on the back, but head over to ducatrustle.com and you will see a Squarespace website. They've got everything you need. They've got free and secure hosting. Everything's optimized out of the box. They've got powerful e-commerce functionality. I know someone who sells their socks online, will never stop saying that. And now they have a new feature that I'm particularly excited about email campaigns. And I already tried it. Some of you may have gotten an email from the ducatrustle family hour, but what I did is I used an email list from the old forum that we used to have. And I don't think you can do that. Based on some responses I got, I apparently you shouldn't just, you can't just randomly mass mail people, but I did get to test the email functionality of Squarespace and it's amazing. It's like some kind of digital zine. It's really cool. And once I figure out a way to gather fresh emails from people who haven't been rubbed raw, like some kind of toddler being pulled in an inner tube and in the back of a, I don't even know what example I'm giving. Anytime you say a toddler, it sounded sinister. What I mean is when I was a kid, I would sit in an inner tube and get pulled by a boat that went one wonderful afternoon for like three hours. And then when I got out of the inner tube, my skin had just been essentially flayed off. And it was days of agonizing pain. And many people feel like that every time they get any kind of email from anyone that they don't know or that they haven't subscribed to. So my apologies for those of you who have been flayed by spam. Maybe it's just because I lived in a time where there was dial-up that this stuff still blows my freaking mind. But the fact that you can go onto Squarespace and just make a badass zine, essentially, and then send it out to people, it's this living, breathing thing with links and you can encrypt things into it and just manifesto yourself into time, baby. That's what you can do at squarespace.com. Head to squarespace.com forward slash Duncan for a free trial. And when you're ready to launch, use offer code, Duncan, and you'll get 10% off your first order of a website or a domain. Squarespace, bend the Squarespace continuum with your beautiful website. Thank you, Squarespace. Also, a sincere thank you to those of you who have subscribed over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. I am, I did my first video podcast recently with Raghu Marcus and it's sitting up there at Patreon. It's a unlisted YouTube link and I'm gonna be doing many more of those. And also, if you subscribe at Patreon, you'll get commercial free episodes along with access to our Discord server and I know I keep saying it, but it's definitely gonna happen. Some kind of like digital meetup. I just haven't quite figured out how to, I'm almost there, it's a, I'm not gonna get into the technical problem I'm having right now, but it's a great way for you to support the podcast and meet other people who listen to the podcast. And once a month, I do a long rambling thing. When boy, let me tell you, the most supreme of them all, the supremist, the supremist of Supremes, the most, it's coming, it's coming. It might be seven hours long, me just talking about spawning. But yeah, you get one of those a month too, if you sign up. It's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. And if you're interested in getting some DTFH gear, head over to dunkatrustle.com and pick up some stop drinking crows milk stickers. Lots of other stuff is there too, but I think before you are even thinking about what kind of t-shirts you're gonna wear, you need to make sure that your neighbors know where you stand on the issue of crows milk. And I've mentioned it before, I have disavowed, I have neither for nor against it, which is why you'll also find drinking crows milk bumper stickers at dunkatrustle.com if you're someone who enjoys that tangy, tangy milk of the crow. Speaking of crows, I've been feeding unsalted peanuts to some of the crows in my neighborhood. They love unsalted peanuts. And I saw one of the crows, I think it must be their leader, drop some sheets of paper into my yard and I picked them up and this was written on them. One of the many interesting things about corvids is that they give gifts sometimes. If you feed them, they'll bring you, usually it's shiny things, used condoms, lottery tickets, Bitcoin, scanners. But in this case, it looks like I got some kind of manifesto, or at least some pages from some kind of manifesto. This is what's written on them. There are many animals who can travel through the various portals and hyperspace hubs that exist within the realm of the dark plunger. Rabbits, for example, can merge into grass and enter the jade realm of Swaddlevast. This wild land is the same place that gypsy children go when they dream. They're beautiful windmills there and I can't read much because there's either blood or some kind of red paint on this part of it. And of course, poodles and all variety of small dogs can travel to Slanton Valley, but crows are the only creature that can actually fly through the crack in the dark plunger. Of course, the great mystery here is not just that these corvids can exit from our universe completely and travel into that sweet land that lays beyond, but that they choose to return here. To quote Abe Lincoln, only madmen and children understand the motives of crows. I agree with him completely. I spent some time interviewing both children and madmen in the hopes that they would relay why crows choose to return to this dimension, but as you know, madmen and children have sworn many oaths and to my knowledge, the secret of why crows come back to this realm by choice has never been revealed. Fortunately, we can look to science for answers to other questions regarding the habits of crows, but we will only know what they do while they are under the dome, so to speak. We'll never know what happens to them after they fly through the crack. For example, it has been documented that crows give gifts to humans from time to time. Certainly that's what this is. In the early days of COVID research, it was thought that these gifts were meaningless tokens of thanks, shiny objects of no symbolic import, but now we know that crows' gifts contain within them a vibrational dream codex that can be decoded using a Stelnex-14 quantum computer because there are only two of these machines in existence at the moment, and because access to these machines is difficult to achieve, we only have this transcript originating, originating, originating, I think, from a bottle cap that was left on the doorstep of Simon Wendler, the crow boy of Birkenshire. It appears to be the lyrics to a song, and then I can't make it out, it just, or maybe it's in Sanskrit. It does not seem to be written in English or any language that I'm familiar with. The study of crows has been funded by the Crows' Mugwabi, not because they have any interest in collecting the poems of crows, because they want to discover how to induce lactation and female crows in captivity. Thousands of unforgivable experiments have been performed on female crows by the dark scientists. Okay, well, I'm not gonna keep reading. I didn't get that far. I don't wanna upset the crows' milk lobby, and I certainly also don't wanna upset the crows' milk activists who appear to have trained a crow to drop whatever that lunatic rambling is in my yard. So I'm sorry I read it, but I don't have time to delete it because we gotta jump into this great episode with Danielli Bollelli. We'll dive right in, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Care of. It's a brand new, beautiful new year, yet you feel like you've been sleeping under a moldy rock in a subterranean vault underneath a cursed Bulgarian castle once inhabited by a non-devouring cannibal king. There was a time when you had lots of energy, glowing skin, beautiful hair, and slept like a baby. But now you look like a fish, someone left underneath a wet towel and the bleachers at a grateful dead show in the early 60s. It's time to build a vitamin routine made for you and your health goals. In the old days, you'd hire a vitamin clown to throw random vitamins into your mouth when you woke in the morning. You don't have to do that anymore because Care of will customize vitamins according to your lifestyle. I tried it and I really like it. They ask what you're doing, man, not in those words, but they just try to figure out where you're at. What are you looking for? You got thinning hair, you want nicer skin, you stressed out, who are you? This isn't just some spray clown blowing nuggets into your mouth that are supposed to make you feel better. This is an actual scientific approach to nutrition. And with every vitamin, they explain why it works and what it does. They literally cite scientific studies that you can look at so you understand why the medicine is working. I don't necessarily care about that stuff, but if you're a Carl Sagan type and you really want to know what's going in your body, Mr. I care about what I put in my body, then Care of is perfect for you. And I really actually do like to understand why some of this stuff works. This isn't just somebody making grilled cheese sandwiches at a freaking national park festival telling you to lick ginseng off of a stop sign in the morning to feel better. These studies have been done on these pills. Care of's delicious nutrient packed quick stick powders can be added to your monthly delivery for an extra easy boost wherever you need it. Take some vitamins, get healthy, feel better, take care of yourself. With me, you should see me right now. Me reading about vitamins right now is very interesting. It's like Nosferatu. It's like Nosferatu talking about the sun. I'm so excited about taking these vitamins because I need it, man. I mean, I know what you've heard. When you have a kid, you sleep all the time. And that's true, but I guess something abnormal is happening because my wife and I don't seem to be sleeping that much. And we most certainly need these vitamins.

Thank you, Karev. And now without further ado, everyone please welcome back to the podcast, the host of the Drunken Dauest podcast, as well as the host of the award-winning history on fire podcast, as well as a living samurai, warrior, king, prince, philosopher, poet, father, enlightened being. Tear your third eyes open and weep tears of joy upon the glowing, ethereal astral brow of the glorious, Danielle Bolelli. It's been Drunken Chancel, Drunken Chancel. Sweet. My God, it's good to see you. It's good to see you, my man. You are my, the first friend that I have seen since I became a father. Holy shit. So I'm still like, I'm not even alive yet. I'm like being, I'm Lazarus being pulled out of her tomb right now. It's the trippiest thing. That is super exciting. And you know, man, it's like so psychedelic and so bizarre and also so exactly what everyone says. Right. But it's kind of like, if you'd never seen an ocean and you heard people talking about it and they're like, well, it's massive. It's like crane, but it's on the ground. It moves in these shapes. It is like, yeah, I totally get it. I know exactly what you're talking about. And then you see it and you're like, yeah, no, that's not what I pictured. Right. It is the most accessible secret society of all time. Because there's only one way in which is to have a baby. Yeah, usually that's how it works. And there's a secret on the other side, but everyone said the secret over and over again. You'll never know love till you have a baby. You can't understand love until the child comes. You, it makes you feel like you're real. It turns you human. Oh, you hear all that shit being blithered and blathered out of the mouths of frothing breeders when you're a cynical person who, like I have been for the majority of my life. And you think you're daft. Yeah, you're full of shit. What are you talking about? Yeah, you sound insane. Yeah, of course. What do you mean? Are you creating some kind of hierarchy of existence where those who make children somehow know more than those who don't? If so, you're inviting massive overpopulation. You are. And yet, it's all true. Yeah, and I think that's what's funny that yes, it is true. On the other end, it's funny how many people clearly, if they do get that vibe, it's a brief fleeting thing because they are horrible parents, right? So we're clearly something in the wiring doesn't fully connect. They may have the moment where they go, oh, you're so cute, I love you. But then they don't show it in action, right? Right. Where they are just terrible. So there's that too, right? People who have that, maybe they think they want it, but then when they are there, they just some neural connection doesn't quite click and or maybe they just don't have their shit together. Well, they want it like, it's like when Beverly Hills Chihuahua comes out. Right, exactly. And I want a Chihuahua. And then they get the Chihuahua and three days later, the Chihuahua is like just not eating. It's there, you know. Shitting on the floor. Getting eaten by their Anaconda or whatever. Got an Anaconda now on a Chihuahua. Yeah, I took already 72 great selfies with the prop. Can we be done now? Can you be 18 already? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, yeah, I know. Yeah, well, I'm clearly, there's that element to it, which is, but the, so far, man, and anything I say is obviously just noob city and what the fuck do I know? I know nothing. But that's one thing that's gonna be insanely good is the fact that in the future, you can jump back to this very podcast right here right now and go like, holy shit, that was when my life had only switched by like three, four, five days, whatever it is. And that's never gonna happen again. Even though it's like 20 years from now, it's gonna seem so foreign, that concept. It's like, of course, that child has been there my whole time. Was there a life before? I don't even remember. But right now is the first time you get to hear your voice when that shift is happening. Holy shit. So that's gonna be creepy. Man, weird. Yeah, it's like, you know, one thing we have in common is that, and now we do have in common before we didn't, it used to be that you had been initiated into the cult of life and the cult of death because you have experienced both. Whereas for me, I'd only been initiated into the cult of death. I have a very sad familiarity with what it looks like, how it goes down, and the process. And from that, I had developed an imbalanced philosophy of existence. But you have had this very balanced understanding. You've seen both sides. And one observation that one thing I've noticed is that there are opposites, birth and death, and yet there are all these similarities in the way they manifest. In which way? Do that. So with birth, we have the doula. With death, we have hospice. With birth, we have labor pains. With death, we have the various manifestations of the ending of so many processes, right? And with birth and with death, in the beginning of each, there is a seemingly melting down of the personality of the identity. In the case of birth, the identity hasn't been formed yet. In the case of death, the identity has dissolved prior to the moment itself. And you can't have one without the other. You know, they both depend on each other in the sense that if no one died, then there wouldn't be new resources. And I'm sure there's a million more things. Those are the, oh, and most importantly, and most interestingly to me, is that a baby and a dying person have the same kind of emanation coming out of them. There is some kind of radiant, beautiful, sweet energy coming out of them. The baby is pure as soul, however you wanna put it. A thing uncovered with any of the overlays of whatever society the child has incarnated into. The dying person, the overlays are melting. Yeah, all the social stuff is going away for sure. All the, who you told you were for decades, that's going away. And vice versa, the baby doesn't have a, they haven't been around for decades. So there is no social identity set up for them yet. That's it. Yeah, that's it. And they both have the tendency to shit and piss their pants. A lot. Yeah. And so, yeah, to me, I don't remember where I read it. Somebody said, have you ever heard the term opposite, stand back to back? Have you ever heard that? Right. It's like that. But now that I've seen life come in, because it's like death is like a bus. It comes and picks up someone that you love and then carries them away into the unknown forever, theoretically. But then, sometimes the bus pulls up and lets out the most adorable little sweetie. Yep, yep. And the crazy thing is, he looks like my mom. Serious. So I'm having to like, I can't even explain how psychedelic it is to be holding, or to see my wife holding my mother. A baby version of your mother, right? Yeah. It's wild. Speaking of which, what's your take on reincarnation? Well, I think that this is a great question. We're revolving around the issue of birth itself. And to me, I think the reason for maybe, and I don't think it's a conspiracy, I think maybe the accidental reason that birth and death seem to be so incredibly misunderstood in our culture and hidden, basically, birth is hidden. The birthing chamber, the birthing room, the secluded area, there seems to be some natural need to nest and produce a boundary and all that. Death is obviously hidden. But it's almost as though like for society to function in the way it currently does, there needs to be a sense that there is a finality to death. And for that to really work, you need to keep people away from dying people and you need to keep people away from things being born. Because if you don't do that, then you catch this strange whiff of something, like somebody opened an interdimensional portal or a door or something. And you go, wait, what's that smell? I remember that. That's something I've found for you. What, this is something? What is it? Oh, God, shit, I can't, dammit. And then you're just caring for the baby and you're caught up in life. What do you think? I mean, of course, nobody knows, right? That's a given. But as far as feeling goes, I've experienced too many things that don't seem to click with this life right here right now. Has to make me think, this is not just stuff I saw in a movie or this is stuff that I never saw in a movie. But I still feel like, I don't know, there are too many weird calls of things that are really strong in my personality and have no parallel whatsoever with my experience. Where I'm like, yeah, this is nothing I have experience in this lifetime, not even close. Like what? Like for example, I'll give you a couple of examples. Like there have been times when I heard for the first time a language and it literally brings me to tears. And if I stop to think about it, there's absolutely nothing about it that should bring me to tears. There's nothing in the context that should create that effect, nothing, right? Yeah. But there's a feeling of coming home, like, oh, I know the, oh my God, it's like something you have forgotten that is like a huge part of who you are, except it's not because it's not part of your this life, right? And you go like, what the hell was that? That was a little weird. Or there are parts of me where like really strong parts of me that are not, like first time I give you an example. You ever seen the movie Legends of the Fall? No. Legends of the Fall was like a 1990s movie, Brad Pitt, World War One. World War One is kind of on the side. It's not a main part of. And usually when I really like movies, I tend to watch them multiple times, right? It's like you every so often you pop that in. And I remember loving the movie and walking out of the theater and going, I can never see this movie again. These hits way too close to home. Like some of the images that pop up were like, oh, fuck, I know this feeling right there so well. And then I go back and I'm like, how do I know that feeling? There's nothing in my life that's even remotely close to what I just saw there. Why does that thing hit a button that feels so more real than most of the things I've experienced in my life? And then I notice like a lot of my dreams revolves around some of the same topics or things like that. And I'm like, oh, that's interesting. I mean, it's entirely possible that there are some weird psychological process that's going on, subconscious, whatever, if you wanna. But that's not my instinct. You know, if you are gonna ask me in terms of instinct, what do I feel? I do think that there's something to reincarnation. Now, what does that mean? I have no idea, because I don't even know when these people say, oh, it's your soul moving. What the fuck is the soul anyway? What are we talking about? What is this essence that pops up or you have no memory? Your body's different. Everything is, what is this essence? What are we talking about, you know? Well, I mean, it's gotta be, so it's sort of, the good thing about this stuff is to, I think to talk about reincarnation does not even require talking about physical death. I think talking about reincarnation to start looking at it, you might, one way in would be to sort of study the concept of the continuity of self. Have you heard this sort of thing before? It's in Buddhism a bunch. Yeah. So you realize there's no continuity to myself. Of course. I fall asleep. There might be a dream, but I wake up and something, some time has passed where I just wasn't there. It's like I jump forward. And then I sort of tune in and tune out, so to speak. In other words, it's some moment in the day I might suddenly come back to myself and be clear, but in between that moment, and the last time I was clear, there's some kind of warped space. There's a sort of, you know, this is the space within which you lose your keys, your wallet. Sure. And you're like, where the fuck is, where was I when I lost my keys and wallet? So in those moments, you've kind of leapt, you've time traveled on this. And so when you begin to really look at it, even deeper than that, you find that maybe in every moment, there seems to be a similar cycle happening. Right. Which is within every moment, there seems to be some kind of cyclical thought pattern, a formation of a thought, the dissipation of a thought. There was a thought that seemed important. And then the thought is, you can't even remember what it was. Of course. And so within this, you realize there's this seemingly concentric cyclical moments of coming toness and dissipation. And so there appears to be a pattern of selfness, the non-selfness or a better way to put it would be being the attention falling upon the current identity state and then the attention being dissipated from the current identity state. Now that to me is already remarkable. It is, for sure. Yeah, so we're already kind of already reincarnating in every single moment. No, that for sure. I mean, cause you're right, there is no who you are 10 years ago, is no who you are today. Physically, you're not the same person. Probably your ideas have shifted a little, probably there's some continuity, some stuff lost and a lot of it doesn't, for sure. And then there is the question of like, is there something beside our present identity that sticks around? And to me, it's like babies are fascinating because the very fact that when babies are born, you can have twins. So not only they are from the same parents, they are in the same household, but you can say, oh, you know, if a brother is born five years apart, maybe things have changed in those five years, so they're influenced, they're not bringing, no. They are identical twins. They are shared the same womb, the same pregnancy, they pop out at the same time, they're exposed to everything identical, and their personalities could not be more different. And you're like, what the fuck is this thing that is, it's there from day one, from the first day is different. That's right. And it's not just a product of the pregnancy because again, they shared it. And you were like, okay, there's something there that babies have that is kind of independent of their parents, that is just their own. That's right. I remember once, this was one of the cases that was least glamorous because it wasn't obvious like a oh shit moment, but to me, in terms of feeling was most powerful. My daughter was probably less than two. She was maybe a year and he was definitely after my wife died, but before she was, so she must have been less than two or so, right around that time, right? And I remember one day, so I finally, I'm taking care of her all the time, I'm working, I'm doing this, I'm just running myself, right? I put her down for afternoon nap and I'm like, okay, I'm gonna get an hour or something to get shit done, to breathe, to do something. Yeah. And I put her down and like five minutes later, I am like, oh fuck, so I go up and I'm like, okay, okay, let's go through the process of helping you fall asleep again. Okay, great, she's asleep. I leave five minutes later and I realize she's not gonna nap, you know? And I need that hour, like I need oxygen, right? So I'm just, there's something in me that breaks in that moment where I'm just like, fuck, I can't do this. I literally, I've done everything. And I think this is the last straw where I cannot, I don't know how I'm gonna continue doing this shit. This is, I don't have the physical energy to take care of you anymore. I'm like, so I go up, you know, I sit by her crib and I just put my hand on her, I'm like, I'm here, I'm here, you need to cry, but I'm like, I have my head low and I'm just sinking. I don't fucking know what to do at this point. I'm at the end of my rope. And I hear this baby cry that all of a sudden goes in one second, just dead silent, right? It stops abruptly, like, which never usually happened that fast, right? And he's like quarter of a second, he goes, ah, ah, ah. And so I look up and I'm like, the fuck is going on? You know, it's like, and I look at her and she's just staring at me with complete presence, with like, taking a look at me and then she grabs my hand, bring her closer to her and without breaking eye contact, she starts stroking my arm. And the feeling I'm getting there is like, there's this somebody there who's telling me, I understand this sucks, I get it. It's, you're having a hard time, but you can do this, it's gonna be okay. And for 20, 30 seconds, I don't know who the fuck is there, but that's, it is my baby and it's not my baby, you know what I mean? It is my baby, but it's my baby who's like, has lived 10,000 years and is super wise and is powerful as fuck. And then 20 seconds later, she goes back to being a baby and she's la, la, Google, Gaga, whatever. And I was just looking at her going like, I don't know what the fuck just happened here, but that was different. That was not what I expected. And for the rest of the day, I was like, holy shit, what was this thing that just clicked there? Yeah. This is why we need glasalia. Tell me. This is why we need speaking in tongues. Right. Because, and there's different names for it too. They're speaking in tongues or what happened in the Pentecost is not the, you know, it's not relegated to Judeo-Christian scripture. But in other cultures, there's this phenomena. And also in the experience of people who've taken massive doses of psilocybin, there's the phenomena of suddenly speaking in a different language that is not of this earth. Something starts coming out of you, this kind of joyful song, sing song type of thing. And that language, I think, is the language of the place that reaches out to you in those moments. Where suddenly it's as though the entire physical universe were a shadow and somebody temporarily turned on the lights. And in those moments, there is, I think, a commonality in the way people report these experiences. And usually there's a, it felt like I was coming home. Usually there's some sense of being flabbergasted, beyond flabbergasted, a sense of, wait a minute, is this whole thing I'm doing here some kind of gag or something? Like it's a sense of, it's what are they called? The cosmic smile. Yeah, of course. And in those moments, it's like you're given this very quick, just enough view of a thing. Of course. Also, within that, is a healing energy usually. You get healed for a second, just enough. Little balm rubbed on you, just a little balm, a little ethereal oil rubbed into your soul for a second. Yep. You know, we had to, there was this, it's very common, our child has a little jaundice, he's better now, but we had to take him to put him under these lights at night, and it was a little, it was not what you wanna have happen, because when you're with, in the presence of your newborn, you just, it's just joy and delight, and you don't wanna go around doctors. And so this is an intense moment for us, and we're just new parents, and we're just experiencing this realization of like the potentially, with a newborn, the situation is volatile. Oh yeah, of course. There's the potential for all kinds of things to happen. Yep. And so we're in the experience of this, and we're driving, and man, I get a text from someone who lives with Ram Dass. As we're driving to the hospital to put our sweet boy under these lights, it's Ram Dass, and the wonderful people who live with him, and they're singing happy birthday to him. Sweet. But they're saying happy incarnation for us. Ha ha ha ha ha. That's awesome. And in that moment, you know, first of all, when you ever get, I'm in an entirety of my life, I've never gotten a song from Ram Dass. Of course. But in the fact that it lands at the exact moment when you would want some kind of comfort, and in that synchronicity, there is not a dismissal of the reality of being a parent. There's not spiritual bypass or nerfing of the situation. The situation is as serious as it was before. Of course, of course. And yet, there is this little twinkle in the eye of the universe saying, no, no, it's okay. There's something God's going on, yeah. And that, to me, that is where surrender must happen, or the thing when you hear faith, they're all that stuff, right? Yeah, because I mean, ultimately, you don't know and you're never gonna know, and no matter how much, it's not gonna happen. But those moments are the ones that remind you, holy shit, there's something else going on in this universe. Besides, you know, you know, all too well, I'm not a big fan of organizer religions and all of that. But at the same time, by the same token, I can't really make my home in a super materialistic viewpoint because that's not my experience. You know, I've experienced so much shit that does not fit in a hard materialistic worldview. That is just, I would be lying if I bought into that either because it's not what I've lived through, you know? Right, well, this is actually one of the very interesting aspects of incarnating in the material universe. Is it during the very temporary time that we're here because the material universe has density as one of its qualities, within that density is the tendency for the material universe to want to encompass all things. So, devotees of the material universe, and there's many different names for them, I think, what did the Buddha call them, worldlings? I've also heard the term myavadigies, but these are people who are engrossed, deeply engrossed in the material universe. So, this, the way from the quantum states to the Kardashians, to, you know, buying sports cars, to buying statues of great saints, all of the, within this sort of engagement with the material universe, there is a kind of unspoken censorship a kind of just natural censorship of just stating the obvious, which is like, hey guys, there's something else here, something's coming through, clearly something's coming through. It's like, in fact, it's so obviously coming through that it seems like if you pay too much attention to it, it's all there is. Yeah, and it's funny because you're right, they are glimpses, right? But they are powerful glimpses that kind of altered your way of looking at the world. Yeah. I remember, I don't know what your earliest memories are, but I remember like, I must have been too early less, which is really early on, but I do remember sitting at the dinner table with my parents and I'm having baby food. So, baby food, you have probably what, for the first year, you're in enough, if you are really into baby food, maybe you eat it when you are almost two or something, early enough. And in my memory, and again, who knows, maybe my memory is too weird or, but in my memory, I have a complete understanding of everything that's going on around me. Yes, right, now what is that? Like that's interesting, isn't it? Like my sense of understanding of reality is just no different than it would be right now, right? Maybe my vocabulary is different, but I have like a full, is not your standard, two year old, you don't know your head for a mirror-ass kind of feeling, is like a sense of complete and total awareness of what's up around me. Now, I don't know what five minutes later it was, I don't know what five minutes before it was like, but in that one memory, it's very clear that I'm like, yeah, of course, this stuff is like with the kind of maturity that I would have at a very different kind of age. And so, you know, when you get those little glimpses, you're like, huh, I'm either deluding myself all the way and I'm making all this shit up where it's not there, or there really is all these various little moments that are sparkle through our life, really point to the same thing, which is that there's a whole other level of consciousness, there's a whole other level of reality beside this one. And in no way does this mean that this one is not important, this one is fucking awesome. I love material reality right now. Extremely orty when it comes to a lot of things. I like it so much that the thought of that does bother me, not so much because of that itself, but because I really dig being here and now. You know, I like it. But at the same time, I also feel like, yeah, this is the part of the game that I know and remember and I really enjoy it, but there's a much bigger game around it. And I don't really remember it and I don't really know what happens and I don't really trust anybody else answers about what happens, but I am aware that it's there. Yeah, well, you know, I think this is one of the many things I love about Buddhism is the invitation is you, well, listen, we're going to tell you something. And what we're going to tell you is why suffering and how suffering ends. And within that, there's going to be a lot of data and it can get as complex as you want it to be. But first step, here's why we suffer, here's the way for suffering to end. And within that, you hear that. And so then within that is a kind of invitation to like go through a kind of process, I guess you would say. And the process is got a lot of different names and some people call it meditation. And so, and within that meditation is actually, because if you're lucky and you run into a Buddhist, he was been trained and he was worked with, you know, who's like done maybe a little bit more than just reading books on Buddhism. Because that's how it's many aspects or facets or lineages are actually oral traditions in the sense that it's spoken to you. It's not just read. There's like a kind of process that starts happening. And the process involves a kind of curiosity, which is, okay, could this be true? It could it be that when we see these moments where our child strokes our arm in our worst moment and it's not our child anymore. Right. Or when your baby looks like your mom, or when suddenly you, it's not that you've run out of words to describe some phenomena. It's that those words aren't joyful enough. And so you need to sing and the song you wanna sing is coming from the place where language comes from. And so it sounds like all languages, but it's just the song of joy. Now, these things, what are they? Delusion, whatever, the material universe and the materialists will tell you, you know, this is just hippie bullshit talks. Good for them, maybe it is. So, if there was a glimmer of curiosity, that this could be real, then I think that, and you had heard someone that you trusted tell you, okay, here's the thing, I don't want you to believe me when I tell you that what you're experiencing is actually the fundamental nature of reality. Or I don't want you to just believe me when I tell you that what you're seeing is a reflection of a, a transcendent reality, or a reality that, as a Pima children puts it, where are the sky? Where are the blue sky? Everything else is just weather. Now, what the entire material universe itself, you're saying is like a cloud? The stock market, my car, my family, and all this, you couldn't just be a client, you'd be telling me it's missed. Right. Now, if you hear that from someone's, you know, screaming on the side of the road and like throwing cans at cars, lunatic, you know, that's one thing, but if you hear it from enough people who don't just seem, fill it like academic, but actually seem to be somehow happy in a real way, then I think that you owe it to yourself to explore the process they're talking about. And what they say is, well, one thing you would do is you sit still and you'd start doing this every day and you find a teacher who knows a little bit more about this than you and you work with a teacher and then see what happens. And somewhere within there, you might begin to experience something that isn't, where you don't have to have a fucking baby or watch your wife or mom or dad die to experience it. Right. It may be that right there in front of you in every single moment, in every single moment, right there in front of you, is that thing that in the most rarefied and quite often catastrophic situations appears. That it can show up, definitely. Let me ask you a Buddhist question. Actually, before I ask you a question, depending on how we translate it, like for the whole essence of Buddhism, that you were referring to earlier, the Four Noble Truths, the various steps, how do you translate it usually? Like what are the, some people use the word attachment, some people use the word passion, like what's your thing? Like, okay, so some like the most catastrophic, say life is suffering. The more mellows say suffering is inevitable in life. There are various ways to look at it. Right, exactly. So let's start with that. What are your, in the Four Steps, how do you phrase them? Okay, so the first, so first of all, this is unfortunately my familiar, and this is something my teacher talks to me about a lot, which I, it points out a lot, which is like, everyone seems to be way more into the first two than the last two, which is interesting, because suffering we can like really get into, you know? But like the end of suffering, what the fuck is that? So, but, so yeah, dukkha. So yeah, we hear the first, and I think what's cool about it is it can function on, wherever it clicks with you, that's where you need to be with it. So when the first, so you hear life is suffering is what you hear, life equals suffering. Now, that, for some people that doesn't click at all, because they're young or they have something happening that's nice or they're in this nice situation, and so they look at the round and they're like, no, what are you talking about? It's a very pessimistic way to see things, friend. So I think that for some people who are in like, you know, who are in turbulent situations, that can make more sense to young people that can seem absolutely just cynical and pessimistic and ridiculous. But as I've heard it described to me, one way to replace life is suffering, you could say wobbly wheel, which is when you're like, if you were riding your bike and the air was a little flat in it, this is my teacher, David Nickturn, if the air was a little flat in the tire and you're riding your bike, it feels something feels off, there's a little offness to things, right? And kind of like, what's good? This just, same thing, seem a little out of balance here. So there's a, the best way to put it is, I call AT&T because I wanna get my internet installed. AT&T, when I'm on the phone with them, somewhere within the 30 minutes, I've been trying to negotiate this thing, it seems like it should be more simple, the phone gets disconnected. I scream, am I ceiling or something? What the fuck is happening here? As though that doesn't always happen whenever I get on the phone with some kind of cable provider, as though that just isn't the way it is. I act as though this is the first time this has ever happened. And yet the reality is, the state of things in the place that we currently are at is wobbly. And this is what gets translated into impermanence. But really it's just things here, kind of like slippery and they like, they don't really work out, they sort of like, the ball, it'll go into the, sometimes, but a lot of the times, man, it's foul balls and things are dingin' and dongin' a little slightly out of tune. So this would be life is suffering, which is just more like, it's kind of like, things are a little wonky here. And I mean, it's a given that, even if you don't wanna say life is a suffering, it's undeniable that suffering is an unavoidable aspect of life. And they're rather big one, right? So that just like, there's not even an argument about that, it's like a self-evident statement. So he's like, I don't think it is for some people. Really? Yeah, I don't think it's self-evident for some people. I think that suffering is a very heavy work. So when some people here are suffering, they think, what am I fuckin' Job? What are you talking about? Right. Suffering. Well, but shit happens to everyone at some point. Yeah, yeah, well, so yes, but for you it's self-evident. And for me it's self-evident. But what's interesting about this is that it actually, for some people might require a little bit of exploration. Because hearing, oh, life is suffering. What does that even mean? You know, I take hot baths, I get a nice quiche. And I get that. That's why I don't particularly like the life he's suffering because it makes it sound like that's all that life is. Whereas clearly, of course, as you say, yeah, I take hot baths and there's all these others. Life is awesome. What are you talking about? You know, I get that part too. That's why I'm not saying that's not real, but it's like, in addition to all that, there's also shit, a lot of suffering. That's just how it goes. Oh, no. It's like, all that stuff you're saying is true, plus there's also these other stuff. So that's like, okay, so we're there. Then there's the whole suffering is caused. And again, depending on how you translate it, either by desire or attachment to one's desires or something like that, right? And probably attachment may be a more refined translation because desire make it sound like having desires is bad. And you know, having desires is inevitable. You're human, of course, you're like. I think for this, the second Noble Truth, it's good to like dive into the wheel of life and to look at that cog in the center of the wheel of life. And what we see there is usually three animals that represent aggression, desire, or attraction and aversion. So this is the sort of, this is what much of our suffering spins upon these three components, which is that in any given moment, the thing that has brought us to take the hot bath is that we want it to get in the hot bath. But then when we are sitting in the hot bath, what happens? Well, the water gets a little cool, doesn't it? And now we gotta heat it up so we can be comfortable again in the hot bath. And now, not only is that happening more in the hot bath, but suddenly it's like, you know what? This isn't really relaxing me that much. And then we think about Terry. I can't believe fucking Terry did that to me. Why did Terry's always doing that thing? That was a mess. He's a dick, you know? And then your heart, and now you're lost because now you're kind of thinking in the bath, this wonderful, warm bath you're gonna take, you're thinking about kicking Terry in the fucking balls the next time he does that thing. And by then the water got cold again. And now you heat it up. And so now we have, what's functioning here is we are having a sense of, fuck, I wanna kill Terry, aggression. What's happening is I want the water to be hotter. Desire. What's happening is the water is too cold, aversion. And so this is, I think what is within the package of the cause of suffering is attachment. But within that I think are these three kind of never ending. We either don't wanna be where we are, right? We wanna be somewhere else, which is pretty much the same thing. When we're somewhere else, we can't really be there because we're fucking pissed off about something. Absolutely. And so that is the second part. Which brings me to where my question originally was. That's where I was heading with the third part, right? With the whole idea that in order to stop suffering, you stop and again, depending on the translation, either desire or you cut the attachment to your desires and all of that. Which if you tell me lessening attachment makes your life better, I get it. It's again, self-evident, right? It's like, if your happiness is constantly dependent on reality catering to your expectations, good luck. Cause a lot of the times it's not gonna work out that way. Plenty of times the universe is not gonna deliver what you wish. So if, again, unless you get that scenario, you're suffering, well, good luck, cause you're gonna be suffering 90% of the time. But, okay, so I get lessening, but the idea of like extinguishing, like having no attachment, having no, I'm like, how special in light of where we started, you know, you have a baby, of course you have attachment. Sure. You know, nobody can tell you, ah, these babies like any other baby or like, you know, it's like, of course you're gonna have a shitload of attachment, that's just a given. That's like not even, how do you reconcile that? How do you reconcile those two aspects? The fact that on one hand there is obviously a wisdom to the idea of lessening attachment, but with the way normally the Buddhist third aspect is phrased of like the extinguishing of the attachment versus the reality of, hey, I just had a baby, I'm a father, I mean, up on the moon for days, I'm so happy, this is the coolest thing ever. How those two things, I guess it's like, how does love, super intense, extreme love can go in your life, hand in hand with this concept of lessening or extinguishing attachment? Okay, that's great. So I think that the extinguishing maybe is a good word for it. And I think probably to get into that concept maybe the fourth noble truth has to sort of get thrown in because the fourth noble truth is the process through which this could happen. And within that process is an invitation, I guess, you could say, to experienced truth, reality itself. What are you? What is reality itself? What's happening here for reals? And so maybe the idea would be that by understanding reality as it is, or this thing that having a true experience of reality, this other stuff might naturally be extinguished. Do you know what I'm saying? That there might be a kind of like, in other words, it's kind of like, oh my God, I'm stuck in this tiny little room and it sucks. I don't like it in this little room. This little room is too small for me. This is the identity. This is the focus on the self. This is the concept of this is me, this is me. I'm a body, I'm a self, I'm a consciousness. I have my predilections, I have things I like, I have things I don't like, and this is me. And then within that, of course, there can only be disappointment in infinite, endless disappointment. Your food doesn't taste quite right. You didn't get the job you wanted. How come I can't find this thing that I was looking for? And why does it always, always happening to me? Oh, that game, right? So if there was a way to not let go, so to speak, of that, you can hold on to that as much as you want. But maybe a better way to put it would be to zoom out from that and then realize the spacious quality of reality or what is also called emptiness. I think sometimes shunyata, but I could be wrong about that. In other words, if rather than letting go or giving this idea of like, I'm gonna give up loving my son, I'm gonna give up loving my wife, I'm gonna give up loving podcasting and having these kinds of conversations. No, it would be more along the lines of, what am I? Really? And the discovery of that, or rather the, I think, restoration of that fundamental state that exists primary to the overlays we call our identity, would naturally have within it the quality of letting go, I think, of suddenly, if suddenly you realize, like, wait a minute, okay, I'm thirsty. So what do I do? I go and drink water. Okay, great, I'm drinking water now. Thirst is gone. Okay, well, that's great. It actually worked and I need water to live, right? So, but if there were another kind of thirst for a lot of people that's, I need to get laid, man. I need to get paid. I need to get in shape. I need to get into this job. I need to be famous. I need to be the most famous. I need to be president. I need to be king. I need to be the queen. And these kinds of things, if through just a sense of mindfulness, of watching, you begin to realize, wait a minute, every single time I get to one of these places that I thought I wanted to be, nothing changes. That one, 100% agreed. And I think there's a way to see it where, yes, absolutely it's real, that's the deal. The part that I find tricky is the real deep source of love for, let's say, a person. In this case, like a kid, right? Yeah. That's not like, oh, I have this flimsy desire, ego-driven desire to be famous or whatever the fuck, has nothing to do with it. That's like a more primal thing. And yet, precisely because it gives you so much, it also what your happiness can go up and down. Like it's completely out of your hands because you're so tied to something else outside of you. Yeah. And so, the paradox of loving without attachment. It's one of those that like, yeah, good fucking, I mean, you can love without attachment, some random lover that you run into and you have this amazing meeting when you do and then you break apart and it's fine and then you meet again and it's awesome. Love without attachment is awesome, is great, that's different. That's not gonna be the way with your kid. Okay, let's take the word attachment and put it aside for me. Sure, sure, sure. And now let's say love without fear. Okay. So let's go there first. Yeah, that's a good one. I think if we can love without fear, then that's gonna be a, in other words, with my child. Sure. If I can give my child as much love as I, not give, that's the wrong way to even put it. If, so, so this is what I think. This is what I'm being taught and this is what I've in some small way experienced in a slight, slight way, I think you would say. There is a fundamental goodness to reality. So, Shogun Trumpa talks about this in his great book, Shambhala, the way of the peaceful warrior or something, the way of the warrior's, warrior's way, I don't know, whatever. Shambhala's chogun, look it up. But he's, so before you even get into like stories of who I am, this is my son and I am a man and I was my child and I am a then, this is the thing. So start with this. Look wherever you're at right now, just look, right? In any color, any color. It's beautiful. A beautiful, this color is beautiful. The color of the table is beautiful. The way your hand touches the table and you feel that contact with the table, it's beautiful, just that simple, simple elemental contact with reality is beautiful, right? That in its own way. When you're washing dishes and the water falls on your hand. And certainly, when you are holding your child against your body and you feel that weight against your body and you feel that, like just that, that. Now that gets described by Chogun Trumpa as fresh baked bread, right? And I love that because I think that's a really good way to put it. It's like when you've just taken a nice, nice, some wonderful thing out of the oven and that first, wow. Yeah. That's it. Now that is it. That's it. It's not complex. It's the most simple of symbols of simple. Can't be bought, can't be sold, can't be controlled, can't be rented, can't be hoarded. It is outside of our grasp in the same way maybe our reflection is outside of our grasp. So the grasping into the mirror to touch our own face is going to be a very futile thing. And yet, it'll be really frustrating if you don't know that all you have to do is reach in the opposite direction. They'll touch your face. And then you could touch your face. But if we're all grasping at the reflection of the sweetness in our children, in our lover, in our job, then we are going to be frustrated in the same way a person reaching for food that was reflected in a mirror is not gonna get a good meal. Do you see what I'm saying? I do. So in this way, I think the cultivation of a connection with the fundamental goodness of things would not create an ambivalent state or connectivity with our children or our lovers or our friends, but in fact, would make it so much bigger, so much more real, so much more spontaneous and certainly far less frightened. Right. That makes sense. You even got the dogs excited with this brilliant statement. Yeah, I've got it. Basically, when I say something, no, it's the Instacarpit. It's gonna be taken care of right now. But yeah, so that. Because it's like, if I'm sitting across from a thing, that I really love. And I am also terrified of losing that thing. Yeah, of course. Then a shadow is going to fall upon my actions. Of course. That, I think, is what I'm learning about Buddhism right now. So fucking hard. Right, because it's just such a human thing to, the more you love something, the more you are scared that it's gonna get taken away. And in an impermanent world, well, oh, sorry, yeah, it will get taken away at one point or another. And so there is that constant, oh, fuck. It's today's the day, it's right now the moment. Is it gonna change? Is it going to? I like it the way it is now. I don't want it different. I don't want it. And again, you are with the full understanding that you are in a world that's constantly transforming. So we're seeing, if you fall in love with what it is right now, that's awesome. Problem is, it's not gonna be the way in a day or 10 or 10 years or something. Stuff is not gonna work out the same. Well, we got it. So this is where the practice comes in. Because what are you practicing? And so that practice would be, if I'm saying, and I am saying, in any moment, in the same, like we've discovered this recently, unfortunately, you split the fucking atom, and the energy that gets released, oh my, it's just fucked. Similarly, in any given moment, I think there is a kind of atom splitting possibility, which is that just below all the overlays is the love. And that love is not held inside anything. And so, yeah, it's all gonna change. Of course. If you start spending time exploring this present moment by stopping for a second and listening, not just with your ears, but with everything. And be here, you're not putting yourself in a hypnotic state. But the term I like to think of is poodle nose. When I'm sitting outside and I look at my poodle's nose, this poodle is fully in the moment. Its nose is like, it's right there, poodle nose. And that kind of state of being connected, facing the blast furnace of reality, within that, there is suffering. And within the exploration of that suffering itself, and the removal of the story of why the suffering is happening, but just the pure experience of the suffering state itself, fuck the story. Yeah, whatever, you did a thing, and it got the thing, and he did the thing. Just for a second, peel it away, and experience the suffering as it is. This is contact with truth. And then, by going into that, you realize, oh wait, suffering seems to be the other side of love. If I just flip it over or go through it on the other side is, oh, wow. And that's where we are. And they both exist simultaneously. But if we're gonna get, to get through hell and Dante's Inferno, what do you gotta do? Yeah, and I think that's, the very concept is where many people get turned off by Buddhism, because they feel like, oh, then in order to suffer, I cannot experience love. I need to be this cold fish who goes through everything, goes through life without, because inevitably if I'm gonna be in love with something, that means I'm gonna be attached, or if my attachment is gonna bring misery, so I have to stay away from passions, I have to stay away from excitement, and be in this cold soul that's neither here or there, and that's clearly not particularly appealing. That's why we need to go hang out with some Buddhists, because if you hang out with some Buddhists, or just go online and pull up some lectures of Buddhists, they don't look like cold fish. No, no, exactly. They're like little loaves of fresh baked bread, talking, there's true joy in them, and then you see, wait a minute, they're not like comatose, numb down, novocaine. No, no, exactly. So, but with Buddhism, it's not like other things. It's like, Buddhism is like, you could say, a kind of cosmic gym that weights are there for you, you gotta go in. Yeah, yeah, of course. I'll tell you, since we're gonna wrap up, I'll tell you a story from my new favorite Zen master, who doesn't know that she's a Zen master. My lady, Savanna Riavna, she has, this is what happened for a new year. So, she's getting sleepy, she's yawning, she looks up at the clock, she noticed that it's 11.54 p.m., six minutes to midnight, the new year at Devisig. What does she do? She goes to sleep, cause she's sleepy, right? It's like, if you tell me that, you know, you do that at 10 p.m., I get it, right? It's like, okay, I'm fucking tired. Wait, you're talking about New Year's Eve. Yes, New Year's Eve, right? It's like, it's 11.54, if you brush your teeth twice, you make midnight, right? And then there's all the new year or whatever, and she's just like, yeah, you know, clearly what the calendar tells her, what social conventions tell her, she should be feeling excited about, it's like, I'm sleepy, when I'm sleepy, I sleep. It's very simple, you know? The fact that if it's 11.54 or is whatever, it has no bearing on the fact that I'm sleepy, I wanna sleep now, so I could die. And the best part about it is not done with a sense of rebelliousness or, hey, look at what a cool punk thing I do that's different from everybody else, just like, no, I'm just sleepy, and so I'm gonna go sleep, good night. Yeah, I love it. That is a koan. Right. And you are a walking koan. And the fact that you've swept in here and just came when I texted you, I didn't think that you'd write, I'd summon a bolelli.

317^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 548: RamDev Dale Borglum Transcript and Discussion^2023-01-20^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, my friends. It is I.D. Trucelle. I'm about to head to the airport to go to Madison, Wisconsin, where you could see me at Comedy on State. But I'm leaving you with this wonderful conversation with Ramdev. Ramdev was in India with Ramdas and Neem Kohli Baba in the entire Ramdas crew. I love Ramdev. He reminds me of Ramdas. And I love our conversations. This one in particular was incredibly scintillating. We talked about tawntric sex. Lots of other stuff too, but tawntric sex. There's more to the spirituality stuff than just meditating.

It's so nice to see you. It's great to be back with you. And I send our greetings. Defence clients, V себя 개인 crawl, wealth gatherer. It's great to be back, Duncan. It was nice seeing you. You're getting in the city, that was fun. It was so great seeing you and getting to hang out with you in the green room. You know, I'll tell you, it was a wonderful balance because the show after my Satanist friends showed up. So, like, we had this wonderful... I balanced out the Satanist guy, basically. Well, lady. Yeah, so it was this... My friend William, who features for me, was like, oh, cool, you're getting a nice buffet of spiritual traditions here. But it was wonderful to see you. And it meant a lot to me that you came to the show. So did you get any feedback about you and me talking about tontric orgasms last time? Well, you know what? I don't remember getting specific feedback about that. I know people loved our podcast and I know that I personally loved the podcast. And just actually the other day, I was thinking about, well, I was trying to remember what you were saying about tontric orgasms and I couldn't remember. So I'm like, you know what? I guess I'll just masturbate the old way. Well, I'm not sure there's an old way and a new way, but I hear what you're saying. So I've been thinking about I'm going to be on the podcast again with Duncan, who's so nice connecting with him and what would I like to bring up? And I really started thinking about you a lot and how I also played a podcast with you and Jack, how you were trying to be a good meditator and a good student and things like that. And to me, it seems like there's really different ways of approaching spiritual practice and a lot of people approach it from things just aren't good enough. I've got to improve, I've got to fix things. There's a sense of it in adequacy. God is outside of me. God is up there. I'm down here. Practice is hard. I'm not very good at it. And there's another way of practicing of abundance. I'm blessed already that it's just letting go of these obscurations that lead me to believe that I'm messed up. But underneath all that is this whole Duncan, this whole Rom-Dave Dale and that's kind of the tontric view. Now, tontric can be kind of dangerous if you just jump in there. We were chatting before the podcast started and I was saying that chamomile tea and whiskey are just as much God and you said this great line about whiskey causes asymmetrical love handles. It makes me an asshole. Chamomile tea gives me a night where I kind of calm down. It's wonderful in front of the fire. But the point is that if you do some of this other stuff first, if you do some meditating and some compassion work, then you can start letting go of all these judgments and dive into that it's all divine, that it's all good stuff, that like Buddha's not outside, Maharaj is not up there in heaven. I remember Maharaj saying those Westerners, they don't understand, they think I'm this body. It's like who we really are and even Vipassana meditation or mindfulness practice is based on the notion underneath it all that you don't have to try to figure it out or improve anything but just by being present you'll move toward wholeness. So this kid you were talking about from the battle buddies who's having his young friends die as part of his foundation of supporting young people with cancer that even even the difficulty that he's going through because he loves people and they're dying that's his practice that I don't say this to too many people but here I'm going to say it to like thousands of people is that suffering is only suffering Ramdas even said suffering is grace so that cancer doesn't cause suffering resistance to cancer causes suffering your friend dying doesn't cause suffering resistance to your friend dying causes suffering and of course you're going to resist having your friend die but if we don't know why we're suffering it's a lot harder work with it if you really get that you're suffering because you're pushing away your life or you're grasping at the good stuff then it's a lot easier to work with it like so like in Tibetan Buddhism they have a slogan drive all blames into oneself and that means not that you're blaming yourself but you're not blaming the environment you're not blaming Trump you're not blaming the traffic you're not blaming the weather for how you're feeling right two people can be caught in exactly the same traffic jam and they're both going to an equally important meeting that's really crucial to their well-being and they're both going to be equally late and one person is tearing their hair around saying why the heck is this happening to me this is fucked up I can't believe this is happening to me and the other person saying well there's nothing I can do about this I really want to be there on time but it looks like I'm not going to be able to be there I might as well play some music yeah well yes yes I mean I want to talk about the Lo Zhang drive all blames into oneself a little bit more I'm glad you brought it up you know I the Lo Zhang sayings that you know I jump from one to the next they're wonderful some stick in your head then you forget the other ones and then that one has actually been on my mind quite a bit and I want to talk to your enemies that's always a good one that's a good one don't do things with a twist I like that abandon all hopes of fruition really love that one but the drive all blames into oneself so this I want to talk about because I think this is another of those potentially confusing translations I don't know what the Tibetan for blame is necessarily but I do know that out here in the west we associate blame blaming oneself with the opposite of self-care blame myself is to hurt myself there's shame associated with blame there's like you know so and also but Duncan I don't think it's saying I mean I think it's a really bad translation and I haven't come up with a better one but it's not saying blame yourself it's saying the way you're blaming outside you bring that back into yourself yes you reclaim the blame and take responsibility for here's what I'm feeling reclaim the blame is like that is an amazing there you go reclaim the blame and I understand this I get it as someone who has experimented with that particular saying the relief that's the paradoxical relief that comes from no longer like trying to find the serpent in the whatever your particular guard may be realizing the serpents in you not out there that nobody's trying to hurt you in the way you thought they were and that this is something you've been dealing with not just for this life for multiple lifetimes my god it's like beginning to wake up from a nightmare but this the the second part of the problem that I have with that saying not problem but confusion about it is that it is but it is kind of easy it feel okay don't do things with a twist and drive all blames into oneself if I express to a partner or friend or anything like that I recognize that I have fucked up for a long time and that I can't expect the people around me to suddenly believe that that angry fiery awful aggressive thing that pops out from time to time is gone I understand why you are like I get it we can't expect other people to like just believe us when we feel like we've made some progress or something but and so but so it the whole drive all blames in oneself what if you what if you you try that but some part of but also you are kind of annoying you know what I mean the external you this person that what you know and then I start feeling dishonest then I start feeling like ooh I don't think I've fully driven all blame into myself do you know what I'm saying I do but I don't know I mean it seems like I don't know how to say this without being crass here but for you to drive all blames into yourself that doesn't require your friends to do that they can still blame you if that's what's going on in them I mean it's like you're doing your practice your life is your practice and your wife or your friends practices their life is their practice so you're just doing the best you can and maybe you've been an asshole I mean I was just dealing with me being not the best partner and having to take responsibility for that but it seems to me that if to the extent you drive the blames into yourself then your heart is opening and at least in the future you're going to be a better human being yes right it's like what's done is done there's another thing in Buddhism about becoming hopeless which really drives people crazy but it's not the future isn't going to be better you feel hopeless that this moment is going to be better than it is because it's exactly the fucking way that it is it can't be any different than the way it is so that like you're completely hopeless that this moment is going to be better it's this moment I love it and then we just surrender into that and that makes us going forward the better more open hearted guy and then your friends can like the better dunk and come out the other end of the process Ramdev, I love oh please continue sorry like Maharaji said it's better to trust in God than to

the DTFH it's better to trust in god than to try to figure everything out okay all right so okay this I want to get to that point quickly so I love what you just said about the hopelessness thing now there was a show I did for Netflix called the Midnight Gospel and it went within this show there was an episode the prison episode where Jason Louvre was the guest but as we're trying to like in the podcast with him I said this very thing how hopelessness is good like this whole sun will come out tomorrow bullshit it's like what I was trying to articulate is what you actually I wish I'd done talk to you before we did that episode but what I was trying to articulate was just that when you have what you need hope kind of goes out the window you know you're not hoping for anything because you're there you're here you're here thank you and it was a big discussion with the creators with the other creators because they're like it just sounds so grim it sounds so grim like do you want to put that out there that you know hope isn't this hope, faith, charity these are the jewels of Christianity right like hope and to this day I still feel right I still feel like I get tortured by my hope anytime I'm hoping I'm wanting I want wanting out of where I'm at right on I mean there's a lot of romanticism about religion and you know even in this discussion we almost started out about compassion I mean about Tantra about Tantra in the beginning of spiritual practice there's the Ten Commandments there's the Christian and yoga there's the yamas than the knee yamas be a good boy, be a good girl don't do the don't kill, don't lie don't steal, don't commit adultery don't do the things that create duality but as practice deepens and you go into the more mystical part of religion those rules fall away and you trust your heart you're not stuck in your mind about all the rules you're not hoping you want to be a better boy you're saying okay I've done all this practice and what is my connection to God right now how much am I being present and like Maharaj Ji said I'm always in communion with you what would it be like if we actually believed that I don't know if everybody knows who we're talking about when we say Maharaj Ji do your people know Maharaj Ji Ramdas' Guru name Crowley Babu I don't know I'm sure some of them are like who is this is he a chef or something who is this he's a kind of Italian chef Ramdas road be here now and part of it was the cook's book and Maharaj Ji was the chef he's cooking us all that's right I do think with the because I've been studying Buddhism with David Nicktern he's a really great teacher really good with me especially in the beginning good lord did I want to jump into the tantric mystical stuff I didn't want to go through any of the other bullshit get me to where I can levitate come hard and drink as much as I want and but but and I know we have many theistic people listening I'm not non-theistic and so maybe it's a semantic argument I'm trying to bring up here do you think that this concept of emptiness or what do they call it there's a beautiful name for Aliyah the great Aliyah is that God Aliyah is a friend of mine I don't know anybody else okay Aliyah Aliyah is somebody who actually screwed me in a real estate deal oh well okay I know Aliyah Aliyah is a dad joke unforgivable dad joke but you know what I mean this idea of emptiness the concept of you know unit of consciousness or non-dual reality does it do you think it equals God well now we're really going down a rabbit hole and I'm kind of a theist I've had a few experiences of God actually showing up in my bedroom Hanuman showing up in my bedroom once and another couple of things have happened but it doesn't seem like it's reality in the same way that the microphone in front of me is reality right right so that so from a Buddhist perspective it's more you're surrendering into this emptiness hopelessness and hopelessness leads to fearlessness leads to love let me see I lose all my good quotes but anyway there's this quote from Suzuki Roshi my first meditation teacher where he was saying when we bow down to Buddha there's no Buddha just bowing that it's like a Buddhist and something outside that you're not bowing to some guy in an altar or some guy who's really wise it's just to act of bowing itself so that whether we're doing that to God or whether we're doing that to Buddha or whether we're doing that to the Dharma it really is ultimately the same thing right so that emptiness pure consciousness is God or God is pure consciousness and you know I mean when we're talking about people dying what survives death you probably maybe you believe something survives death I do but I'm not sure that Dale jumps into another body necessarily although like there's the 16th Dalai Lama so that means there's the 15th and the 14th and there's this continuing thing happening I mean look I was just having a conversation about this with a friend and you know talking about the possibility of the great infinite endless deep slumber I think Socrates and his apology talked about like look I'm going to drink the hemlock if you put me to sleep forever thank you if there's something after this I'm going to keep doing my thing so no matter what it doesn't make any difference you've done nothing but except maybe like giving me the greatest thing of all time you know the nihilist dream of heaven is a non-continuation of consciousness it's what Dawkins said death is the anesthesia that takes away the pain of life really nice I mean at some point you're like doesn't sound terrible I do love sleeping but the dreamless sleep so to speak but I do feel like that is as much a version of heaven as golden streets and you know the angels flapping around I think it's a dream I don't know if that's really what happened so I do believe in continuation of how that works no idea and honestly I don't care that's what I was just going to say I don't care at all either somebody asked the Buddha does reincarnation exist and he said well if it did exist how would you live your life and the guy thought of it and he said because I would run a really good next birth I would meditate a lot and study the scriptures and be a really good human being and then the Buddha said well if reincarnation didn't exist and you just died what would you do and the guy thought about it and he said oh revered one because I'd only have this one chance I would really meditate a lot and study the scriptures a lot and be a really good guy really I'm interested in what is practical for me and you wake up and suffer less and all the other beings around can suffer less not all this theoretical I mean theoretical stuff is fun I used to be a scientist it's fun for the mind but really what I'm interested in is how can we wake up can we talk a little bit about that and a little bit about this you know the sort of the process you know for me the whole thing started off as a kind of like you know a lark you ever heard that term before live action role playing game where you hear about the spiritual stuff and you're like sure I'll make believe with all these hippies that maybe this is real and you kind of don't believe it at first or you or maybe the better way to put it is you don't want your heart broken by finding out it's not true so to protect your heart from being broken by realizing it's yet another scam in the world you just kind of like at least me I took a cynical approach to it and then if you're lucky even though the larking all of a sudden something you're like wait something's changing here for real like there's something happening here that is completely unique to my own experience of reality this is when you get beyond the Ten Commandments thing that you're talking about where for me that just means all of a sudden those moments where I would react to adversity with aggression the moments have not gone anywhere the reaction does not and it's not like once I'm not a dick it's like over time you realize this is something softened me up here it's not happening like it used to and yet you still have at least I still have inside of me like that burning angry cold like this like you know the suffering the flavor of my suffering is anger it's still in there it flashes out of the world in my family it'll just all of a sudden it's on my face but I'm not articulating it as much as I was but it's now it's subtle levels subtle levels of it you know more refined ways of expressing aggression but it's still there so do you what do you do with that like is this thing does it go away or you just kind of pissed off for your whole life but you don't react you know what I mean you have it in you but it doesn't come and I don't mean suppressing either it's you know I tried suppressing it it did never work but you know what I mean there's this sense of like fuck I know it's I'm sorry for cursing I know it's in there and then for me what goes along with that is like this never ending sense of like how long is this going to last like how long before I revert to that again and that makes me uneasy so the thing about how long is it going to last has a lot to do with hope you hope it's going to end you hope it's going to end and the fact that you're not expressing it as much and it's happening not as frequently means that it's all down hill from here it might be a really long hill you know we don't know about consciousness doesn't care how long it takes or how much it hurts but once you've really seen the truth you're crazy for that you're addicted to that and there's some very in most of us some very deeply seated patterning some some scars that we have to keep looking at it again and again and again you're tired of looking at and you say screw this I'm just tired of being angry I'm not suppressing it but it doesn't feel good it hurts other people you know and that your awareness and your open-heartedness is enough that there becomes a gap between the first arrow and the second arrow that you know something happens to you and before you react you can just take a half a breath you can take out mind moment of trusting Maharaji trusting your own true self drive the blame into yourself and say okay you know I don't have to do that anymore at the same time Ramdas had this line which I still don't know if it's true or not but he said if you're a son of a bitch when you get enlightened you'll be an enlightened son of a bitch you know I've quoted you on that from the last podcast at least 30 times it's one now one of my favorite quotes of all time it really is like that and I love that so much because I think within the contemplation of these traditions you start having a fantasy of an enlightened you you know you think oh an enlightened me drinks chamomile tea you know I don't know it takes herbal baths gives my wife more massages is like you know what I mean like spends lots of time outside is a may astounded by the beauty of the leaf as it gently drifts through the automare you know and you invent this crazy version of yourself you never think to yourself well actually that isn't probably not really what you're going to be like you're probably going to kind of be like you are now that I love it so much because but I wonder about it okay but when you're going back before about Buddhist emptiness is allowing emotions particularly difficult emotions to arise and not being identified with them it's not the anger that causes suffering it's grasping on the anger cortisol has a like less than a 20 second life in your bloodstream so an emotion arises boom there's cortisol and if you don't react to it it's gone but if you get angry about the anger or guilty about the anger then there's more cortisol in the cortisol on the cortisol and your adrenals are getting shot so here's here's this incredible study they did it just blows my mind and I'm just shocked it isn't on the front page of the paper 30,000 people 3 groups of 10,000 people first group high stress they believe the stress was bad for you second group high stress they were taught you could be aware of the stress it's not necessarily bad for you third group control group high stress first group died 48% more often than the second and third group but the second group did better than the control group that mindful stress is better for you than high medium low stress control group so it's not the stress it's getting lost in the stress it's being there with whatever it is that's going on I've been meditating for 50 years Duncan I love this neurotic but I don't care so much anymore right maybe I'm not a son of a bitch but if you're a neurotic Dale and you get enlightened you'll be an enlightened neurotic Dale kind of thing and there's emptiness around it your mind is like the complete vast sky but because you think you're a you you put a window frame around it that's my sky and then into that chunk of sky that's your sky comes a cloud of anger yes or happiness doesn't have to be bad but a cloud of anger if the cloud is big enough and the window frame is small enough all you see is the anger I am angry but if you through practice you expand your window frame that same anger comes and you see it's contextualized in the blue sky and that it's moving it's going to be gone someday it's a very different experience to see the cloud in the context of the infinite sky versus it's all cloud it's a new year new you so give yourself a fresh start with my bookie to earn or to

with my bookie thank you my bookie I want to talk to you about attachment to the sky I want to talk to you about the fleeting glimpses when like the clouds part and you see the sky you get that feeling of being home you remember you're like again waking up from some awful nightmare it goes back to clouds and then you feel at least I feel so I feel then I feel worried because it's like oh my god it the nightmare didn't end you just had you dreamed about some bullshit sky like within the nightmare there was some sense of like oh and then you're attached to a dream now you're worshiping a false blue sky there and now you're just as attached you're attached to some nonsense do you know what I'm saying I know what you're saying I mean there's even a term for it when you go more deeply into it it's called the stink of enlightenment that you've had these experiences of openness and you want that you're grasping at it you're trying to find it and hold onto it you can't hold onto it it comes from non grasping and payment children has this line you're not the sky I mean you're not the weather you're the sky you're not the weather you're the sky but also you're the weather in my humble opinion I mean that's the tantric view that even the anger even the clouds is who you are let me read a very short part of a poem by Rumi so in this poem there's this guy who's complaining to God that his prayers are never answered he never has anything back from God and Rumi in God's voice says the longing you express is the return message the grief you cry out from draws you toward union your pure sadness that wants help is the secret cup holy shit let me read that again the longing you express is the return message the grief you cry out from draws you toward union your pure sadness that wants help is the secret cup so it's not that those things are impediments they're it it's all it it's all the beloved the beloved can only be everything it's like the longing is the tractor beam you think the longing is coming out of you you don't realize the longing pulling you in and that is so wild that is so wild so the longing is good news good news that you have this aching rotten you know like feeling of wanting your mommy or something and you can't find her in the mall you know good news because you have longing for something now that you didn't even know about and now that's incredible news if you've just achieved longing you're there the longing is God's response he's saying here I am you want this and the longing itself is the knowledge that that's the return message that's the secret cup that's drawing you toward union and once again it's frustratingly slow he said one of the qualities that is the main determiner of how quickly we make progress on the spiritual path is how long you're bummed out when you fall down and get off the path like can you just get up and get on with it are you saying oh fuck me look what I've done what a lousy meditator I am and there's this guy Shri Aurobindo who had a metaphor walking down the road and God knocked me over and I fell in the mud and I got up and I was shaking my fist at God saying why are you doing this to me and I got so mad at God and then I continued down the way and God knocked me over again and I fell in the mud again and I got up and this time I didn't yell quite as much but I was really mad and then finally I got so far down the road that God knocked me over I just got up and started walking again at some point you should be like hey anyway you could stop knocking me over please maybe we could just walk together what happened to footsteps in the sand aren't you supposed to be carrying me and then it's your footprints but yeah I love that I think that that yeah I know what you mean because the one of the I think unnerving things about potential fruition or whatever you want to call it is that if you've been meditating for a while you do experience these tiny tiny glimpses I mean in the early days of me doing this I would get so certain I'm like oh well there it is I guess I got enlightened and then and then you know the next day I'm just a monster and I'm paranoid I'm angry and it's like and so then I started getting nervous if any of those things would appear in the meditation practice because I would think oh boy yeah you're getting here we go it just means some rotten version of you is on the way and you do know what I mean it's like you it's at some point I don't know I started getting nervous about any of these things just in the sense of like look I don't want to get my heart broken here I don't want to get attached again to some idea that you know what this stuff is working and I'm not going to keep hurting people around me with my untrained mind you know I'd rather just be a beast and just you know that's what I'm like you know then get these like little intermissions between beast moments but would you rather really be a beast or would you rather be on the path to even though it's difficult once you've tasted that spaciousness Duncan you can turn away from it you'd like to but it's always going to be there it's like once you've had acid life before acid is not possible it's gone forever that level of delusion is gone there's another level of reality that is at least not more real than ordinary getting up and eating Cheerios and we know that that's there and that so what you're talking about is a stage where you're afraid that you're going to get hold on to this stuff or it's not going to work out fall off the bike fall off the bike you remember I don't know I mean you remember when you learned to ride the bike and then it's like the first few days of bike riding are not exactly like pleasurable because the terror that the thing's going to tip over it's scary as hell to be sure but once again those moments of freedom of your coasting down the street on your bike and the wind is in your hair and all of a sudden you're moving in a way that you never did before it feels like so good there's an aliveness there that you can't really turn back from I have tested I think that I mean I was listening to Pima Children this wonderful seminar she gave on Way of the Bodhisattva I've been listening to that and she was talking about how in Buddhism this invitation to really test it and I always took that as a kind of intellectual analysis of the Four Noble Truths and she was like see if you can break it now try to fall off the bike try to not see it try try can you try to not see it try to get it away try to blank your mind and get back to that place and I love that I never understood that's actually what it meant it was like is this breakable and I think that's a really joyful thing to hear that potentially upon catching enough of a glimpse of the thing you really just might you might not have to like sink back into that level of the nightmare that's a really beautiful thing I'm happy to hear you say it Ramdas and I and some other friends taught a course at Trungpa's Naropa Institute the first summer at Naropa and Trungpa's students were very wild they were having these like orgies and there was like young girls and major drinking but what Trungpa told his students he says meditate a lot take care of your body and do whatever you want to do right so people would have these like wild Friday night parties and then Saturday was the all day meditation and you're trying to meditate, not me but his students are trying to meditate with a major hangover didn't feel very good right and instead of saying in fact Maharaj never said to people don't do this, he said well if you do that here's what might happen here's I'm like if you smoke a lot of dope it heats up the brain or if you do this but he would never say don't do that he would say just keep loving God and trusting God and do what you want to do and it's all going to work itself out did you get invited to any of those orgies and wouldn't you like to know I would it was a kind of a weird time Duncan, it was 1974, right after Maharaj died so we were all kind of in a slight state of shock we thought he was immortal he was like the strongest thing he was stronger than Mount Everest and then he dropped his body as they say so I mean are you answered the question already I did do this one thing Trunkba had a paper called unconscious drinking not unconscious drinking but unconscious drinking and in the paper he said that if you stay really mindful and clear as you get drunk you won't get drunk in the same way and in fact one night he gave a talk brilliant that at the end of the talk I went outside of the auditorium and the trees were glowing with consciousness but when he got that talking he'd had a carafe of sake next to him he'd been drinking all night he got up and he fell on his face but he was still so clear that the leaves were glowing with consciousness so my girlfriend and I got a big bottle of sake and we said let's try this and we sat down we started meditating five or ten minutes we took a big slug of it and at the end of an hour I felt like I was on a psychedelic my mind was so crystal clear I was so wide awake ego completely dissolved in sake and when I tried to get up to pee my body was totally inebriated yeah yeah I know what you mean you know this actually this is a reduction of what you're saying but I can remember in the old days when I take acid and drink and you know the alcohol would not dilute the acid consciousness so like I can specifically remember drinking and drinking feeling as clear as a bell and getting up and it's like oh wow I am hammered my legs are not still working but I'm clear because I was very good LSD we didn't have access to what y'all had access to when I was coming up like we didn't have the sandos and fuels or I can't imagine what y'all had but every once in a while you would find some that wasn't terrible we had some good stuff round us one time he was cleaning out he started stuff in my garage in Santa Fe and he said hey here's a sheet of Ousley acid do you want it I said oh sure but it was really old so I would give it to people and they had one or two experiences either nothing happened or it was the best trip of their whole life wow wow I guess it just depended on where where the photons hit it I've heard that it's photo reactive so regardless for me I can remember when I was drinking I stopped drinking when I was drinking I can remember being quite excited about this prospect of continuing my alcoholism and still being somehow working in my life and then it just didn't work I couldn't do what he was recommending I couldn't mindfully drink I'd heard here's what you do drink but the moment you're not doing mindful drinking stop drinking but my problem was I wouldn't stop drinking once you start there's no stopping that doesn't work out but I would do that's how I would get into it tonight this will be a mindful drinking night and then a couple of glasses of white in it's like nonsense let's just drink and then I'd feel like garbage the next day but I'd love it I love what you're saying and I do agree with that I don't I actually feel excited for people who can successfully drink because it's good for you you just sipped a glass of wine through the whole meal wow that's better than telekinesis it's a major talent to have it's a talent that is but don't you think even though in Tantra there's also some aspect of know yourself don't trick yourself into thinking you're doing spiritual drinking when you're blacking out or when you're having physical disruptions with your body that you're getting fat and you're getting puffed at that point you're like maybe Tantric drinking works for enlightened Tibetan masters I'm not even sure it worked for Trungpa he probably died of liver disease but just as an example think about saying a mantra from the very first stage of practice we're saying a mantra of please God show up I kind of know you exist I trust that I know people that believe you I don't feel it now please I'm invoking and then as you do that enough gradually hopefully the heart opens and as you're saying say you're saying Ram and it's a love relationship with you and God it's like back and forth it's juicy it's great but when you get to the Tantric stage when you say Ram the sound is God that just saying Ram is God that there is no distinction between God the sound Ram and you or me who's saying it so that each time you're saying the sound it's God is there you know and so it could be the same thing with anger in the beginning you want anger to go away because it's messing up your life and then you're having more of a love relationship with anger there's a lot of juicy energy there you can use it to be creative in my life this is maybe too personal but if if I don't I can either meditate a lot or have orgasms or do something deeply creative I get angry because it's the same energy so it's got to go somewhere wow wow you just oh my God I never made the connection I know you probably have this you go in you go in to write you go in to make whatever it is you're interested in making showing in with the impulse of I'm going to make something for whatever reason the cards the stars don't align and it just doesn't happen it's very similar to and maybe this is being too vulgar blue balls it's like nothing nothing and then at the end of those days that is for sure rough evenings that is where I'm pissed I feel grumpy because it's not that you're angry because you didn't make anything it's that that didn't get expressed it didn't get alchemized wow that's wild that's the coolest thing I've ever heard let me read you a short poem from Hafiz know the nature of your beloved in his eyes your every thought, word and movement is always always beautiful wow so that was what being around Maharaji was like that you were there I was there being very neurotic and yet he kept loving me no matter how neurotic I was why is that so heartbreaking to hear why is that hard why is that heartbreaking why is there an element of like heartbreak in that idea why is there something about I think about being around that in the flesh and I feel this strange like broken hearted feeling or something this like I unworthy or I don't deserve that or you made a mistake I don't know why you're around me or how did I get to be there that's what I felt when I was there a bunch of the time Ramdas tells all these stories like it seems like being around Maharaji was just a love fest and there was great love but there was also the grace race and there was guilt and who gets the name first and who gets the mantra first and almost all of us brought a real lot of unworthiness to somebody who we saw as completely pure and the embodiment of love and it was like very difficult not to think of him as so much greater than us and we were unworthy and carry a lot of our Judeo-Christian guilt with us to India I remember one time I was at Maharaji's feet I got the prime spot where I had one of his feet and he was talking to people and I was rubbing his foot and I was saying my mantra and after a few minutes I thought boy I'm so lucky I've got his foot and as soon as I started feeling I started pulling his foot away and I went back to saying my mantra and then he relaxed his foot and then after five more minutes I'm thinking oh look at how great I am I've got his foot and he started pulling his foot away again and it happened three times and as soon as I got involved in it and as soon as I thought he's great and look what I've got he'd want to pull it away that's what I'm talking about right there that's what I'm talking about that's the weird dance it flies in the face of everything that you get taught in leadership school the way that sophisticated aggression is lauded as a way to succeed in the world grabbing for a thing celebrating the victories and all that somehow is it repulsed? I'm not talking about the physical foot I'm talking about the sky it's like longing for the sky brings more clouds or something this is the part where it gets so riding with your left hand if you're right handed I'm getting so excited here this is great because a long time ago a lot of my knowledge came from Buddhism and I had what I think is a misunderstanding I'm not blaming Buddhism but I thought that desire was bad desire caused suffering and I went to this other teacher a goofy kind of guy and he said there's good desire and there's bad desire desire for wholeness desire for God desire to be a more loving person is a holy thing it's a good thing and it's coming out of attachment and hope and greed is a bad thing it's going to cause suffering so see which desire is causing suffering in your life seeing which desire is leading you more deeply I mean in Tibetan Buddhism they say that compassion is a mixture of sadness and joy you're sad that you're sad that there's suffering but there's a joyfulness that your heart is open there's a joy that transcends happiness and sadness so that you're able to be joyful even though children are dying of cancer and the planet's environment is screwed up by greed and on and on and on you get both it's like if you're feeling sad you're saying that is not a sign that things have run amuck in your practice or your life it's not a sign that you're like still not there it's actually a very good sign it doesn't have to be bad and if you're desiring this sky connection why are you being chased the same sort of resistance to that desire that you might to other desires that's really beautiful you get to have that romance you don't have to be approved you get to experience the subtle difference the sometimes subtle difference between attachment and preference ah right when are you acting from a place of tightness and preference and here's what life wants from me right now my body wants people want light and when am I acting from this place of tightness and grasping there's a different feeling that it's hard to pay attention to because it means looking at our narcissism and our greed and all that kind of stuff yep it's a different one thing makes me want to win you know like one involves aggression one is like I want to be right I want to win, I want to win this one the other one it's just like okay I'm not dying there's no hell to die on here that's the idea it's very different definitely one involves cortisol more than the other that's what you're saying could you explain to me why you like martial arts so much me? why do you think I like martial arts? mixed martial arts you're a fan of that oh right oh my god for a moment I'm like my friend you have made a terrible mistake I couldn't fight my poodle if I wanted to no no but you're a big fan of people beating each other up okay a big fan I wouldn't my friend works with the UFC and so he has many times gotten me front row seats and I've gotten to watch it now the reason I like it for a lot of different reasons one reason that I like it is the athleticism it's insane like what these people are doing and the pressure they're under and the way they're executing what they're doing is incredible the other thing that I later down the line is you realize generally they're not angry and after the fight they hug each other it's the craziest thing you've ever seen when someone who looks like their face just got hit with a hammer is hugging the person BS way but like with love and respect and that's a pretty wild thing to see it's very interesting also it's cool to watch people beat each other up I'm sorry so I'm suggesting there can be the mixed martial art of life of being Duncan or the martial art of being Duncan that it's like it's not like you're not into victory and accomplishment but it's coming from this place of openness and non grasping got it gotcha you're so smart that's so cool I get it it's like the difference between a street fight and a UFC fight like it's so beautiful that's so cool that's so cool again some UFC fights are like street fights they hate each other and it's like really weird when that happens but that's really cool it's like sort of engage like a professional fighter in your own reality and also the other thing is you meet them when I've been lucky enough to meet them they are the sweetest people there's no like I don't know machismo or generally I mean you know they're generally like seem very lucid awake and they do have a similar vibe to when you run into someone who's been practicing for a long time like that clarity that's sort of like sparkly clarity it's interesting well to do what they're doing and not get paralyzed and deeply injured as it takes a great deal of mindfulness and clarity and presence to think they have to be really great athletes to do what they're doing and not get hurt I am so thrilled with the things that you've been teaching me it's the best and it always happens at exactly the right time I I'm really kind of like and you know put something weird on you but whenever I'm chatting with you I feel like I'm with Ramdas it's like hanging getting to have the conversations I wish I'd gotten to have with Ramdas I really like my interactions with him were never like I wish I'd had the chance but I feel like I'm getting him out I was lucky enough to live with him before he had the stroke and everything and he was a remarkable remarkable guy and he had his own stuff I mean he was going through it just like everybody and I think the stroke is what really softened him and opened him and completed him in the end you know one of the joys of going to those retreats in meeting everyone in that community is the realization of like Ramdas is just the most well known Ramdas there are countless Ramdas at those retreats you know they got the biggest spotlight and seeing that you know it's really like one of the sweetest things and also seeing like and just like Ramdas had his own stuff it's not to say the other Ramdas aren't dealing with their own whatever it may be you know but that energy is so similar I mean this is for me how I feel like I have gotten to meet Maharaj and all the you know microphone stuff we could probably you probably could guess like wild stuff aside the the that's how I really connect to the energy is it's like there is an identical what did you call it the stink of enlightenment you all stink the same stink does have the same stink I think the stink of enlightenment is kind of a different thing the stink of enlightenment and it's kind of really defiling your life but yeah I mean we all have I mean Maharaj he didn't have any successor really and everybody like he broke into a thousand pieces and we've all got a little piece or something dandelion he did a dandelion effect and it worked and it's incredible because it reminds me when I okay so when I made a real connection with Christianity it's because I took acid went into my dorm room and started reading the book of John and and I was drinking wine I remember I was drinking shitty college wine I'm reading the book of John I'm tripping and it occurred to me someone wrote this like whether the validity of this is aside like what mind wrote these words in this order like what was the what was the consciousness of the person who wrote this down like and then it was like that was the you hear it the Christ consciousness an experience of Jesus like a feeling of the the the thing connecting with Ram they're like oh it's in the thumb print it's this is the thumb print through a human consciousness that's what I feel like y'all are like you have this thumb print of this being that is just in you and one of the qualities is you all have the most succinct way of bringing these very wild concepts down to earth in a way people like us can understand that's to me the if I had to look at the similarity regardless of lineage regardless of Bakhti or non-dualist or Zen or Christian it's that it's that and that is a really incredible thing if I might let me say I do this professionally when I'm not talking to you and there's this thing called the living dying project that I started with round us a long time ago that we felt that the place that where it was the biggest gap to consciousness in America was the encounter with life-threatening illness so Steve LaVine round us and me started the conscious dying movement and I run this thing called the living dying project livingdying.org which isn't really not about dying it's about healing about how the way we live determines how we die and the fact we're going to die should hopefully determine the way we're going to be living so if you go to our website there's like free a lot of free information the most complete site on the internet about conscious dying there's online workshops and there's support groups for people with illness and caregivers and grieving people and we're having a speaker series where there's this woman Jetsunma Tenzin Palmo who spent 12 years in a cave in the Himalayas is going to she's not going to come she's in India but and she doesn't speak in public anymore but she's agreed to have a conversation with me on January 21st so there's all that stuff come to our website and a lot of free great stuff.

These are the glory days of website design. It's not like the old days when you had to glue cat toys to your nipple, cover your groin and chest and stomach with salmon scent and lay in a dark alley in the website district of your town, making those quivering, mulling sounds that would hopefully summon a web designer who would look at the cat toys, size them up, and based on the web designer's personality, accept them or reject them by slapping you as hard as he could in the neck. This was a nightmare, and if you did find a great web designer who accepted your offering, then it was likely they would overcharge or take too long to build the website or 50% of the time go completely insane and murder your family.

Baby, I love it. I love you. You're so awesome, man. I did your when I did your podcast. You left. I felt happy for like a week after hanging out with you. Me too, bro. Cool. You know, it's funny as I was like talking to a buddy of mine on the way here and told almost come with you and I'm like, God, he's like, he's like the most peaceful creature. And then we're walking in together and you're like, you know what fucking makes me mad? And I was like, Duncan, you get mad. Dude, I mean, this is a good this is like a thing that is like a danger because if you like, yeah, you some people don't want to admit that. Yeah. For some reason. What did they get mad? Yeah. Or that they're people want to like peaceful people. They get home and their assholes. I was just reading about this. It's like on stage and off stage. And so like you can never believe the way someone acts on stage. You got to be a fly on the wall. Yeah. When they're getting weird male or bad bills or you know what I mean? What's a weird male? You know what I was like, you know, some unexpected massive fucking bill or a peanut or whatever the fuck because it's like on stage. Anybody can act like same as like online on social media. Yeah. Everyone can look beautiful, but just I always have to constantly remind myself like that's not everything. No way. No way. No way. And it's tricky and then you'll start going nuts. So like any time I can, I try to admit like, oh, no, man, I get fucking pissed just to make sure that like, you know, like in the old days of media, this you would have static personalities in the sense you'd see like Jay Leno and he's pretty much the same Jay Leno every night. David Letterman, same David Letterman every night. A little more grumpy than Leno, which was awesome. Totally. Because you'd see him go being a bad fucking mood and it was cool. Like it made people excited. But then you watch Sean Hannity. I don't know if you watch Fox. I I I hate watch Fox all day fucking long and like and I love it. Like I when I say hate watch, I mean, I love it. It's like it's an inner. He's an entertainer. But when you see Hannity O'Reilly, Rachel Maddow, I don't care what side of the political spectrum, you only see the same persona pretty much true. I've seen some guys switch over like Don Lemon. He is just totally, you know, Don Lemon. Yeah, sure. He's totally just throwing the towel and be like, I'm not a journalist anymore. You know what I mean? Yeah, I'm on the left and I'm gonna be he's like, huh, you know, take, take a look at the clip. Yeah. And you're just like, oh dude, remember like journalists used to be in the middle. They were to report the news. That's just not the case anymore. They were like robots. Yeah. And they would say in this kind of like we and I think that was the idea of the journalistic pattern was that it was to not convey bias. You were just supposed to be like, but about about about about about about about about about about about about about and then they started conveying bias and then the whole thing got split apart. And now you don't know what the fuck you're watching because on one side, it's like all representing one paradigm on the other side. It's another and everyone's like, oh, fuck it. It's all just entertainment. Yeah. No shit at this point. But you know, anytime anybody breaks their character for the world, it's usually a gift because usually I've noticed like this shit I'm embarrassed about or I'm trying to hide anytime I finally admit it. That's when people be like, thanks for saying that a hundred percent. That's when people relate to you because you're being vulnerable and I saw I was with my buddy the night who's an architect and I go, uh, you probably don't go through this, but I'm like, and as a comedian, I have certain I had like a bad day the other day and like you ever have those days where you just start off and things are a little off like even as much as like you get to an intersection and you go to wave someone on them and they look at you like, go ahead, Dick face and you're like, what did I do? Yeah. And then for the rest of the day, it's like that and I was like, I get to the the comedy store and I had a weird interaction with two comics. I'm like, oh, no, is this going to happen on stage and I went to the green room and it was a weird. I'm like, I'm I'm a little off right now and I was telling him about this and he goes, no, yeah, I have those days. What do you think? It's just you because I have days that I'm like, do people see me? Am I even alive? You know, and he's an architect and I'm like, oh, all right. Yeah, we're all going through the same stuff. It's just a matter of being willing to admit it and be vulnerable so people can let themselves in and be like, oh, thank God you feel that way. Yeah. Yeah, that's like the people do not trust or the people who seem to be universe like universally enlightened and that's when you like quite, you know, people get disappointed all the fucking time. Like how often do you hear about this? But Tony Robbins, for example, that just came out on Buzzfeed about Tony Robbins. What? Oh, I don't like him. It was a like a me too thing. He was taking showers in front of people according to Buzzfeed. Not I don't. It's like, you know, he hasn't been to court yet. I don't know how much of it's real or not. But it's, you know, and so what ends up happening is like a massive disappointment because people when they see Tony Robbins, when they see so anybody like that, they hold them to this expectation of being perfect or God like. Yeah. And if they if you let people do that to you, you are fucking up man because you can only disappoint them unless you're actually God like like if you were a God, then you have to let people know I am like I'm not fallible. I am like a perfect being of love and light a transcendent entity channeling the cosmos and I don't I don't you have to tell you can't do you can't what I'm saying is theoretically and I really mean theoretically if you were to get enlightened Jay and you probably will you would have to be honest about that too. Yeah. You wouldn't get to lie and be like, no, I don't I get pissed off. I feel horrible. Sometimes you have to like I actually am happy all the time, which is the other side of it, which is weird. You ever get to that point where you're like getting like some you're hitting a stride. You're in the fucking zone. You're hit. You're like crushing it. You've got some fucking heat and you are maybe around friends who are not necessarily there and you want to lie or summon up negativity to harmonize with their reality because you feel like you're you're successful offend them. Yes, 100% and I also have been on the other side of the coin me too, where you're like I can feel people pulling away for me that are doing well. Like ever have a friend who's like crushing and got something really good going on and you're trying to you can see it like it took me a long time to see that though because now we're at the point where we're talking about before, you know, we have friends that are like everyone's on all your friends at this point. We've been in the game this long are on a show have a show we're trying to like four of us are trying to figure out a golf date and everyone's got a TV show and I'm like the only moment on a TV show and I'm like, all right, but I don't I can so I've been on both sides. I've felt myself being like, oh shit, like I can't talk about what's good for me right now and then I've been on the other one where I'm like, oh man, I start bringing up like what sucks and I see them kind of like pull away or adjust and you're like, oh God, just don't bring it up Jay. Just like don't bring it up like you'll get there, you know. Well, this is to me. I remember once I was in New York with Ari Ari was is crushing it usually and I realized he was padding his description of what was happening to him because he recognized that he was crushing it and at the time I was not yeah and it made me feel so bad because I'm like motherfucker but he could sense that like, you know, I would I hate having to exert a magnanimous attitude towards a friend who's having success and it's hurting me and you're like, I don't the fact that this is hurting me shows that right now I am like in a weird spot. Yeah. So what do you do in that? Do you like just back away and give them space? Because I did this happened to me recently with a friend and they got a show and there was kind of like this promise that I was going to get be involved and I never asked they came to me about it. You're going to be this you're going to do this and I was like cool and I never and then they got picked up and then they went radio silence and then I was like hey is there a thing there and they're like oh blah blah blah and I didn't get it and then they wrote me this long apology that they didn't need to do you know what I mean? I was like yeah I never expected anything. Yeah. And then they got there and then all of a sudden their life becomes consumed with that that thing because it takes so much time as I'm sure you're I can't I can't you can't say that well I'm you mean the my my the my seashells I've been collecting consumed with a collection of seashells you know when you have something that consumes you like that yes you've seen our friends go through it and then I kind of just like so I was like before they went to go do this show I sent to like a long email saying like yo crush this you earned this like just gave like a motivational thing and saying like congrats and then we talked once and then like we just I was like I'm gonna let them do their thing I know they're busy and then they reach out to me like hey you round tomorrow to like talk and I was like yeah and then like we talked and we talked for like a half hour and he's like yo I just wanted to like catch up and like touch base and I was like kind of like had to like leave it on his terms to call me because I was just like I don't know wasn't that I didn't know where I fit I just kind of want to give him space to do what he need to do and not feel like I was like padding in a way to think I don't want him to think I don't want to get in his head while he's doing what he needs to do to think that he may owe me anything you know I'm saying yeah so when he reached out as soon as he reached out was like yeah I'll call you but and then I called me wasn't there so I called three hours later like I'm like I'll stay on it to make sure the call happens and we it was awesome yeah there's a wall it's like the problem is it is really hard to not be selfish like you you know like we're stuck in a body and and you look down and you see your body and you look in the mirror and you see your face and you no matter how you try to get out of it if you have a body then you are literally at the center of your own universe there's no way to not be like self centered and then we live in a world where like that self centered attitude is like taught as the way to be yeah like our foot how many like one and ran live by it and thinks every artist should live by it do you what do you subscribe to that philosophy I don't subscribe to and ranism or anything like that but there's another name for it philosophical I'm not very familiar I'm not sure I just you know I love the fountainhead I love that damn book it was amazing to me I never got through it like I started every time I start reading it but it's it's some kind of like it's capitalism right it's like the no yeah but like almost like self capitalism you know what I mean like you do whatever you need to do and we see it with artists like you become your art becomes more important than anything else and no one excuse me around you is gonna matter you know what I mean like you're gonna be like oh yeah sorry it's my art or it's my passion for her it was like artists and people in general you should pursue whatever your ultimate goal is and I think it had something to do with her idea of like you know of karma for her like karma wasn't a thing that was you know dependent upon how you act towards other people you just go for what you need to go for okay yeah I've heard this before this is kind of like your desires or the thing or your dreams it's like that's the the same thing that like makes a caterpillar turn into a butterfly and that's not a thing to be ashamed of it's not a thing to like the worst thing you could do is subvert that impulse to please someone else because the universe wants butterflies it doesn't want mushy fucking cocooned up things it yeah yeah I'm on the fringe of all that I think I'm not full on to anything I look at it like yeah that's 100% true and recently I've been finding the more I just focus on my own constitution and my family and what my goals are without like stepping on people to get to those things you know to still be considered to still be mindful to still look at situations and be like oh you know be careful about that person because they're in a fragile place right now so maybe you don't bring up X and I'll always say it to my wife like hey just a heads up when we go there today will you do me a favor and make sure to say to so and so's wife because I know he told me she's been sensitive about stuff and like I just think I always metal a little bit because I think that's what love is it's like you see something that someone's going through and you make a point like hey maybe it's not organic for you to ask them to go to yoga together but like I think she could really use it just by something that she told me because I look at it I'm like well I hope people do that for me you know like every now and then I'm like I wish my wife would tell my friends like hey jay's been going through a tough a tough time you know maybe you you know what I mean and because I think that like we all need someone to like keep an eye on us you know yeah because it's kind of like okay the whole and ran fucking like art thing or whatever the fulfillment of your own personal desires and all that stuff on one level it totally makes sense but what comes to mind to me is my new experience being a dad my new experience being a husband the living in a family and that fucking shit does not fly in that situation if I'm started if I you know what I mean if I'm like in any time I've tried to exert that energy is like listen I need to like this this thing's got to get done I got to go down and play on my sense yeah it's so embarrassing and it hurts it doesn't feel right whereas like the moment I kind of like give that up and just hold my son or try to help a little bit more than my selfish fucking ass in my habits and instincts tell me to yeah it's like instantaneous lightning up to the point where whatever thing I was trying to shit out whatever my fucking idea of like some half baked idea of making some like pseudo radio head synth track when I was high and fucking ketamine or something seems like some dumb basic essentially misunderstanding of what it means to exist in the world in a happy way yeah well I think at the same time there are times when my wife will say stuff like hey do you want me to like take the kids tomorrow morning and then you can just like you know have some time to yourself and I'm just like oh yeah yeah I love that yeah and that's not luckily when you have a really good partnership that's her being unselfish and allowing me to be selfish without me having to be like selfish at the same time I still think it's healthy to be like to ask for that time you know I mean like hey you know what like I need some space and I need some time like my son was a perfect example where at this like kids fair on Saturday at their school we've been there four hours that's a lot they're like run around Kate and I volunteered two hours each and then we're with the kids and my son like asked me to pick them up which he never does and he's like daddy I guess I need some alone time I was like you got it bro ago can we get out of here most like yeah and like you know never times with my kids I say it all time like I need some space dude I'm gonna need some space you gotta go right over there just go over there and play I need a little space and they're like okay and they just they the great thing about the kids at that age is they don't take things personally especially if you tell them don't take this personal I just need some space dad needs to breathe and then I wait like my 20 minutes and then I go over and grab them hug them kiss them be like what do you want to do and then we do something but he knows hey did you have fun that whole time I was taking my space and of course they were you're a great dad I I appreciate that but I try and I still have faults fuck yeah I mean you gotta have thoughts if you're gonna be a great dad yeah he wants a perfect fucking dad a perfect dad is a recipe for for disaster what did you did did I tell you when we did the podcast so I don't know if I told you this but like one time my wife is out town I'm with the two kids I'm giving him I had this plan for how the night was gonna go and I had the house set up and it just kept I just kept hitting obstacle after obstacle with the kids and like they were in wacky moods and my son just kept getting grouchy and then he cried cuz he was upset about like he just wanted to go his way and I had this plan that was gonna be perfect for the night and it just like then I snapped and I yelled at him and then he cried even more and then I was like I go you know what come over here to the couch before dinner and I go listen I'm sorry I shouldn't yell at you like that I I had an idea and it didn't go that way I go but something else you need to know about dad I go dad runs a little hot every now and then I'm gonna I'm gonna yell or I'm gonna get upset I go but it's not about you I'm working at it and he's three years old mind you and I'm telling him all this stuff and I go so you understand I'm not mad at you this is just something with me and he goes okay dad and now the other day like now they know like there are times that I like yell and they go okay and they do it but they never take it personal and I don't know if it registered or not or if it was right or if it was wrong but I'm just like man I wonder if anyone in my family have ever just accepted my dad for who he was and said to us like your dad just being a loon right now give him space get away from your dad he's being a dick you know what I mean if we would have just if everyone might have just reacted differently to him fuck yeah I don't know but that's how it's going to my house if you if my dad had said that to me at any point in my life yeah it would have been so empowering to our relationship and I would have felt so much more comfortable around him yeah so much more connected that that kind of display of vulnerability but also mixed in with like but I'm your dad yeah and this is the way it is you know and this so that you're not like going to them as a therapist or some are not burdening them with having to be more than a three year old you're just saying this is the terrain we're on right now yeah and you know I it gave me this flashback when I was like I've been in LA for like two years and I worked at the cheesecake factory in Brentwood and all the dudes there would like play hoops at this like gym on like Tuesday mornings and I would get heated because I'm super competitive like I would get heated and so finally I went to my buddy I'm like hey man I'm not coming anymore and he's like why not I'm like I don't like who I am when I play I get too aggressive and it's like you know I just don't feel good and he goes that's what we love about you like we love that you get heated like that and it was the first time I'm like oh they're not asking me to change they're like yeah we know that about you it's like having a friend that's a dickhead do you have any friends that are like just a little bit of a douche yes but you know they're a douche and they're not hiding it and you're like yeah that's what we kind of love about him yeah you're a douche yeah this attitude is when I'm trying to adopt more and more because my one big fault I have is this weird like trying to fix people thing yeah and so and nobody wants that like nobody wants to be fixed people just like to be listened to yeah that's what I've like noticed and it seems to be kind of the ultimate ultimate if you're around somebody to just listen yeah and not just listen with your ears but with your eyes and listen with your whole body yeah and just listen just that that seems to be and that means so that someone's you know a douche or whatever the fuck it is if you just let them like you're saying allow the space within which they can be that it's like paradoxically suddenly their douche quality kind of like begins to dissolve because and it's them you know it's just like sometimes people you can't have you can't when you when you say you're at 70% energy in your body right and you get a Snickers so you go up to 120 yeah you're coming down to 20 now because you went up 50 now you're going to come down 50 yeah you need it there's got to be a balance in the world there's going to be douchey people yeah why do we need to change everyone there wouldn't be humor without douchey people there wouldn't you know there you have to have negative quality no one's going to be perfect and the second we put that expectation for the which is why I think like Yelp is a huge problem everyone being able to have an opinion is a huge problem when we were kids you would go to crappy restaurants you would just do that with your family and you'd like my why do we come here and she goes I don't know it's close this is where we go and now it's like if people don't have like the ultimate experience they take a place down and you're like no one can be held to this level of perfection no what I mean what are you doing it's never gonna happen like the whole game of Thrones thing everyone was like what a terrible season and you're like what do you want them to do and why are you turning on them now yeah they gave you glorious entertainment for years and they're like we gotta end sometime yeah sorry Seinfeld the last two seasons of Seinfeld those characters were written for the characters that developed over seven years right you know so they came a little hammy and everyone's there was and you just like all right yeah whatever yeah man it's just it it's just what it is it's like the the you ever hear this this so like the amount of energy the brain apparently exerts to filter out shit seventeen point eight percent yeah seventy boy maybe more than that because so much extraneous stuff is going down that you have to spend all this energy ignoring shit right and that's why I do TM do you do TM yeah did that happen after Twin Peaks yes but it wasn't because of David Lynch okay well we'll put a pin in that and get back to you real quick but yeah it is connected to TM and and the which is essentially the idea is that the so if Game of Thrones is seriously upsetting you that's painful yeah that's just basic pain so like a show that was meant to be something entertaining is hurting you yeah and so it's hurting you to the point that you're going online and you're signing petitions to get it redone and you're emailing people and if you just sit still for a second and feel what that feels like you'll realize like oh my god this is burning me like I'm being burnt by an expectation and that's called being caught and interesting and so yeah and so the idea is like from every we all have it it's not just Game of Thrones it's like a good God the fucking speaking of Seinfeld man I can't watch Seinfeld why because of that bass lick in it that I don't know what I like I've thought to myself like did something happen to me when I was a kid where there was like a Seinfeld ass bass lick happening simultaneously so that I have some repressed memory connected to that fucking sound because my reaction to the Seinfeld bass does not match a Seinfeld bass it means like something happened to me when I was hearing about but the bow I don't know what and I don't want to know right now what it is but what I mean is I don't get to enjoy Seinfeld not because Seinfeld sucks but because I'm stuck there yeah right and so the more of those things you have in your life the more pain you're going to be in and the less of those things you have in life the more you're going to fucking love your life that's like shit where'd it go oh man I had it right here hold on what was it it's the Zen book well anyway the there it starts off with this what's the name of it the problem is that's the problem I can never remember the name of these books the Zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance you can make it you know river and stream there were the dude have you ever seen rivers and tides no documentary rivers and tides I'll remind you if everyone out there rivers and tides as well as artists who goes out into the wilderness and this is what his art is he takes he takes things in in the world and then just turns them into art and some of them only last like at one point he goes to this river and he collects it goes around and forges for this red clay that's like buried in the river yeah and then he collects it all turns into a big ball right yeah and goes to the top of the river and drops it in and when it lands the water just goes turns like metallic red from the clay and it lasts I don't know 20 seconds and then it's done wow but he does other things like builds these structures and like he's just he's fucking right so he's like working with impermanence he's like that's his medium I don't know but I that's the name of my new my new autobiography working with impermanence working with impermanence well this is the is the medium I guess that we're dealing with and this is why our brains get so fucked up when a friend is like having some success or when we're having some success and a friend isn't is because we can so easily forget this is not a permanent experience it's like when you run into someone and it's very rare whenever I run into it man I kind of enjoy it but when you run into someone experiencing a little temporary success who's managed to get a big fucking head and you realize they're like acting I rarely see this it's a stereotype yeah the person who's got some fame and turns into a deep hard-baked fuckhead right yeah you know what I haven't seen that really that much either I've seen I was a talent coordinator at the comedy store I remember once during the entire time yeah and it was shocking to the point of being like I wanted to be around it because it's like wow it's a real dick like someone whose fame is actually gone to their head they're actually alienating people imagining that this is going to last and it's like man it doesn't it can't last similarly you run into people in the opposite situation where there's a little drought happening and it is going to their fucking head because they think this is going to last and so now they're also acting in an imbalanced way completely out of fear not realizing like oh no man you'll get some success don't worry it's going to come it'll happen and then that's going to go away too and so this is the nature of the beast so to speak and the more I get caught on either side of that fucking spectrum the more I'm not able paradoxically to do the activities or to do the creative output it would make anything worthwhile yeah because my brain is trying to hold on to one spot right yeah well you know what when you said earlier I when I was saying you I had that that day where everything seemed a little off I had been like two months so not since I had like had an off day you know I mean for like two months I've been like good moods everything was going well even though I wasn't like work things weren't popping or whatever I was content within my world you know what I mean family wife everything I was content and then I had this day and I'm like oh I haven't felt one of these days in a minute whereas there have been other times where you know you go months with like horrible days and you're like what the fuck man how do I get out of this and then you get out for two days and then you'll come back to it and so yeah you have to find it's for me when I find the balance within myself and I'm just focused on what I can do within myself you know what I mean that's all that's when everything seems to like straighten out fuck yeah yeah and that is finding that spot is the that it's always there it's like you know like you know so for me I'm anxious I get anxiety and I can distract myself from the anxiety and even imagine the anxiety is not there but it's still there it's an undercurrent would what what gives it to you do you know. Oh my God. I'll tell you on the next time I do your podcast only because here's this too much it will go on and on yeah but but one of my teachers Ramdas says it's these levels are happening all at once yeah so on one level you are maybe absolutely terrified about losing everything for me you know like the paradox of having a baby is like you know we put him down and he stops crying and he goes to sleep yeah and then you're like oh my God is he okay yeah for sure you know what I mean and it's under there it's under there and you have to sort of like divert your attention from that level to the next level which is like actually he's sleeping peacefully and if I go into check on him neurotically it's going to create tears dude one of the first things ever when I was having a kid so like you know people family members send you like gifts and stuff like that you know cribs changing table all that kind of shit well my my mother-in-law's friend sent us this mat you put under the mattress and if the baby doesn't roll over or move every 20 minutes it beeps and it like prevents it's right wow so we're like we're getting the room ready and I'm putting this thing in and I'm sitting with my wife and I go what are we doing? She's like what do you mean? I go are we really going to live in a world where we need something to help us feel safer about the fact that we're not going to lose the thing that we love? I'm like get this in the fuck out of here I don't I don't want that why are we ever going to why don't we just get a rubber car you know what I mean like what are we doing? Yeah life is going to happen and let's live it freely and let things whatever happens to us happens and we'll deal with it but I would rather live freely than and she was like hundred percent I mean she doesn't always agree like sometimes I'll leave the house unlocked at night and she'll be like you know you left the house unlocked last night and I'm like I go yeah and she goes that doesn't concern you and I'm like we're still here they didn't get us last night we'll lock it tonight in case they come by but we're good. I will realize I haven't locked up the house I will be laying there yeah thinking like about forensic files knowing the alarm isn't set the house is unlocked yeah and then I'll just drift off to sleep thinking like well hope we don't get strangled roll a dice tonight hope I don't wake up tied up yeah like that the the what the golden state killer you know that motherfucker would tie up the husband and like put plates on his head so that if he moved in the plates dropped in the while he was like raping the wife you know Jesus don't get that's neither here nor there I'm sorry to bring it up but that's definitely set your security so I gotta get a better chair every time I move it sounds like I'm farting so this to me is is like one of the amazing things about you is that you have the most simultaneously edgy personality and this like amazing wild comedian true comedian self that seems really well balanced with being a dad and a lot of times comedians are not so how would you say family oriented some are but you seem to have really in some way or another like you just seem to have a natural talent for being a father and I can't think of anything better than that to be on the planet like if I had to pick between being the funniest person that ever walked the face of the earth and being a good dad I've become so fucked up that I would rather be a good dad and that's a mess isn't it no I think that's exactly what you want to be you know what I mean I would always want to be a good dad instead you're saying it's fucked up for you to want to be a better dad but you know but that's that's the selfish thing you've been talking about like letting go of because if you want to be the best comedian of all time you're going to be selfish if you're going to be even if you're going to be remotely successful you're going to be selfish if you look at all the top comedians right now do you think Kevin Hart I'm not saying Kevin Hart can't be the best dad I'm not saying that but how much is he doing so how much are you home you know what I mean now granted we have FaceTime he's clearly providing financially but at the same time you're just like well how much are you able to help your kids with a tiny problem that will help them deal with giant problems down the road right you know I mean so for me I put it this way the other day my son we did a trip to Boston together three weeks ago just me and him first time ever and he never takes showers he still takes baths and like I we kept saying like hey when you turn five you can take showers he's like yeah daddy and he never did so we went on the trip I'm like you know what we're gonna do this trip because we'll go showers bro and he's like okay dad and now he's taking a shower every day since he loves him so the other day we were home and my wife was with my daughter and I was like hey bud you want to grab a quick shower and he's like yeah so we hop in there and I'm sitting there and he's like I'm standing on the water with half the water getting on him and half on me and he's like you know this toys and he's standing there just playing talking and I'm looking at him and I'm like not only have I never did I ever take a shower with my dad I never learned how to shower from my dad I never learned how to shave from my dad and I never that I can remember because he left when I was two slept under a roof in the same house with my dad whoa my son in the morning will get up come in the bed at like 715 be like hey dad and I'm like hey big boy sometimes we'll just chill you know my wife's there sometimes he goes to my wife like whatever they wake us up which is the greatest thing in the world that never happened ever in my life wow and I was just sitting there taking a shower with him and being like God how amazing is this like I'm so I love that we get to I taught him how to shower and now we're just chilling in here and he gets to like the idea of being comfortable around his dad with his family I mean we're not gonna take showers together forever you know and I took a shower with my dad until he passed we took showers every day that I was with him are you for real no I was really fucked up to fuck with me like that I'm like Jesus Duncan how old were you and your dad passed you know what I mean but like so for me when you say that I have this new philosophy that at least for this like idea that I'm working on that parenting skips a generation whoa you know what I mean because like I'm sitting there looking at it and I'm like oh I didn't have anyone to parent me my dad didn't parent me my mom's a single mom of four she's doing her best and now I'm coming in and I'm looking at my kids and now granted my wife came from a super solid background her parents are still together they and I'm not saying parents need to stay together they they just still need to be parents and be communicative and I'm not saying my mom was an amazing woman and parent and a lot of things but I think I said this when we were chatting on my podcast is like my mom never said hey today's your dad's birthday you need to give him a call you know and that would be her being unselfish that would be her no matter how bad she hated him that should be an element of parenting and being a mother is saying you need to have a father in your life right you need to call your father you need you need that to be that was never a case in my house and what I don't know my dad's birthday you know I don't know I never knew his birthday I never knew their wedding anniversary I never knew any of that you know like it just wasn't something that like ever came up that means my dad was having birthdays by himself somewhere with his wife or whoever whatever he was doing and we were off living our life not a part of his day and that to me if you look first of all I'm a firm believer that every single one of us is connected through somewhere else I would tell you this vision I've had I had this vision one time. I had this vision of this big giant orb right in space yeah with all spinning balls around it yeah you know may almost looking like an atom and then I just had this imagine this thing came to me that when we're born or become you know a human one of those balls goes and shoots down inside one of us becomes our soul we live when we die goes back to the ball and feeds back into this one universal thing yet so almost like we're all a part of each other because we're living and it's so I always think of it is like you're just here to hopefully try to be your best you're going to make mistakes and have faults but you just whatever that knowledge is that you're going to gain positive negative feelings successes failures you're going to take back and put into the the greater good again you know what I mean of the one thing that we all exist from you know whoa man that is so beautiful so I have a constant like like when I see my kids I don't just I don't just see them as my children I see them as humans and I'm like well the first responsibility I have is to put a good human in the world which means you're going to carry your lunch in the school because you need to learn responsibility and you need to take ownership and you need to feel pride and you need to be someone who uses a turn signal when you're switching lanes right so carry your lunch I'm not carrying it for you and I don't do it in a mean way but I'm like you carry your lunch to school that's part of going to school and for me it's like you know when I tell you know it's because I know this is for your good down the road you might get mad at me right now and be upset at me I don't care you know I love you like if I'm like if if I'm with the two kids and one needs a little more attention than the other one I give it but then I always make sure to go over and give a little like pinch or a little kiss and be like who's my big boy and then go on because and I mean that's just me being sensitive to the idea that I don't want either of them to feel left out also knowing that there are times when one needs a little more and it's okay that I give him more you know what I mean so it's again what we talked about earlier about like hey are you just looking out for people without sacrificing your own self I'm not sacrificing of my my need to be a dad to one child against the other one and at the same time it's no skin off my back or energy taken away to go over and make sure the other one knows like yo I just talked to them and did this thing that they need to do and told you to wait a second but now I'm giving you a little little bump on the butt to say hey I'm here to you know wow I want to so this is what's really fascinating about you many things are fascinating about you but so here you have on one side this like I don't even a savant or something when it comes to parenting and you in that and you're blowing my mind for a few different reasons because you're kind of saying things that so like my meditation teacher has said to me literally it skips a generation except he was talking about like sometimes like in anyway the transmission of some like Buddhist ideas sometimes actually skips generations anyway and then another thing that Ram Dass says is he you know I was asking him like what's the bad you know how to be a great dad what's the best way to be a great dad for for us my son and he goes first of all such a great name thanks man he goes first of all not he he's a soul yeah not your son's soul first and then your son so soul overall as they say soul overall so the idea is like first year the spinning beautiful sort of very temporary manifestation of the whole that's taken a birth in the human incarnation but from from your own free will you decided to take the birth you wanted to come and swim around in this particular part of the resort of the universe so to speak and you picked your parents and you picked these experiences is that real well that is it real but that's what Ram Dass says yeah because that's God I that was another thing I used to always think when I was really young not really young maybe it was like when I got into my twenties where I was like I think before you're born you pick the life you want to have because you want that challenge so like people that get like Tiffany Haddish for example you take Tiffany Haddish and she's she's had a she's had a tough road to get to where she is as a person and you're like yeah but only her could have got through that right you know what I mean and I always think that I'm like I think I picked these things you know even though all I maybe I picked having a dad that was gone because all I ever want to do is be built into someone that could be a dad you know even though I I was like I would I mean I don't know sometimes like I do I'm working on a bit right now where I'm like man I love being a dad it's my favorite thing in the world but when I see people without kids I'm like oh what a good life where are you going Italy where are you going are you doing anything get away you can go wherever you want you know so I definitely that's refreshing to hear that you know the idea that you picked it and you you know embrace it you need that fucking clay to drop in the river man like you know that's the concept is and if you forget that things can seem really fucked up because you start feeling like you know when you find yourself in a pickle you're like and you and you lose track and you don't realize like listen you have been human incarnation is like in the shout in the like kung fu movies when you get welcomed into the temple and then you get your fucking ass kicked like having to do those weird Shaolin exercises or whatever like pouring water while you're like standing on spikes while you're about all that shit that's what human incarnation is considered it's like you've been allowed into this very advanced training place which is our lives and you're given these opportunities to basically begin to sand yourself down and and and become something really beautiful and wonderful see this is where was this so this ties back into what we're saying way earlier and I want to get this out. Another problem with this business or anyone who's chasing a dream or a goal is you came here to LA with an idea of what you wanted and so then you pursue it and you pursue it and you pursue it and either it happens or it doesn't and either you stay in the game or you don't but if you stay in the game then you start to be like was I wrong did I pick the wrong did I I said I was coming here to do this and I haven't done it yet so am I wrong or am I not good enough or did I pick the wrong thing am I just can is am I clouded am I supposed to be a chef but I picked this because I don't know or you know I have tons of friends that came to be actors and then they now they produce reality television you don't mean like what is it so that's another thing that can get in the way is you're just constantly like well if I'm going to abide by because we live on a spiritual level you know not everyone does by the way we live on a spiritual level so if we believe that we picked our life and then we're living the life that we're living and it's not going the way that we always thought it was going then you start questioning like am I not am I wrong was I wrong in this choice I'm 17 years into this you know what I mean yeah that's something I battle a lot because especially when you're seeing your other friends like move forward you're like yeah what is that they wanted I wanted to do this to what why is it you know what I mean and then you just like you know you question it so like knowing that like maybe you pick the life that you wanted to lead and you picked where you want to be and then you start seeing what's happening around you and you see the things that are out of your control because you try and control and then this is where I've been lately is I'm letting go of the control and just trying to like be like all right I'm just trying to find contentment in my life and then thinking once I do that the things that are supposed to happen will come to me and that's what I've been telling the universe like I'm just going to go and work my as hard as I can like we were saying off mic earlier you at some point you just can only work as hard as you can and then I'm just hoping that the universe is going to then reveal itself to me instead of me constantly trying to be like I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this why isn't this work you know Jay first of all I like it so when I came when I started working at the comedy star I remember talking to one of the sclar brothers yeah because they were on TV a bunch and I said to them what's it like to have made it and he laughed I can't remember which sclar is talking to you but he laughed in the best way he's like what are you talking about look you made it he's like what do you know like we're doing and then the other day I was talking to somebody who is so successful and they were expressing to me how insecure they feel all the time and then you are you gotta be one of the best storytellers out there man and like you've been you're on fucking Twin Peaks you have like these incredible special you're brilliant and you have a but but but you because you're in your body and you are using a different relative gauge I guess to measure where you're at you've always been to be here like fuck Lars it's like killing it I've never two things one if I stopped right now and never did stand up or acting or anything else again people would look at him like wow he had he had a really good career because you gotta look at it like that you like look at all the things you've done if you look comparatively all the time like if I compare myself to like younger comics they would kill to have what I have but then I look at friends and I will I would kill to have what they have and then if you really get down to it it's like what do you ultimately want and if you ultimately want happiness and you decide that to let go of all this shit we've been pursuing and just trusting that whatever decision you make will be the right decision because you're you're making a decision or you're trusting your gut or you're following a path and it's going to open itself up to you like if I decided to quit today and open the bodega that I've always wanted to open I bet I could have an amazing life but I'm just trusting in the idea that I haven't yet and that's because I'm I'm doing what I'm supposed to be doing dude I was reading your story about and you're a great writer so I'm reading your story about working with David Lynch which for a lot of people would be like the apex of their life just a chance to get to work with him or be around him or whatever would be like like in your story on your website is so fucking cool and so well written but I got really excited when you were talking about how you love the beat poets yeah and you know why they were called the beats no well now this could be wrong but what I read is I used to think it was because like you know like a beat yeah yeah I think Kerouac and one of his poems kind of says alludes to that but then I heard another interpretation which is they were beat they were beat meeting they lost they just decided yeah we've been beat we're the beat generation we've been beaten down we've lost we've given up we've completely given up because we we we okay we we we lost like Maria Banford's got a great joke which is when people ask like so what are you up to I'm sorry anyone listening is a fan of this joke I fuck every joke up I pair it I'm so sorry but her joke is so long the lines of where people are like so what are you up to these days and she's like oh I stopped that's tight yeah man and not that attitude to me is so crucial to for me to be happy which is that the moment I put it down the role so to speak or the story that I told myself years and years and years ago about oh how here this is how it's going to be or when I realized like I'm comparing my career to like Rogan's career yeah just why don't I just get to pay someone to crucify me yeah pay someone to like get some fuck just like hang hang me on a fucking crucifix are you going to compare yourself to someone who's existing in the top one percentile of a particular industry yeah and not expect to be like suffering it's so this to me it's like the moment I and it's not like I give up it's not like I'm like oh I'm not going to do anymore I'm going to go find some other way or any of that shit the moment I'm just like I don't know yeah I don't know there's just this right now and I know I like to make stuff and then the more I connect with that that's where it seems to start happening but anytime I'm doing the game of either like looking back to a me when I was like just out of college or or me like 10 years ago and try to like be the thing that would please that person 10 years ago I'm literally trying to please a person 10 years younger than me that did that had a mom that had a dad that didn't get cancer that didn't have a baby and then anytime I do that shit I look at my now I'm so lucky because I have this beautiful kid and I look at him yeah and I'm like this makes it all make sense if I fucking had a time machine I wouldn't use it man for fear that I would mess something up and that little boy wouldn't be on the plan anymore sure you know what I mean so what I'm saying is these games we play with ourselves their self torture yeah I rewrote my story but my whole life was defined by the fact of my dad bounced every single thing I would walk around the world as if he was always watching like if he was behind like I used to I remember walking across campus in college I was on the right side of the quad it was wintertime yeah and I was like he came up here he knows you're here and he's he wants to he can't talk to you but he's watching and I would walk with this like confidence and bravado that he was watching every time I would play baseball every time I would do stand up I'm like he's gonna even to the day when he died and I went through his apartment like I went back home and I went through his apartment and I looked around his apartment looking for things about me you know what I mean that's all I was looking for but it defined me so much of my stand up there were jokes about you know my dad and stuff like that and then I realized I'm like he you don't know what his path was you don't know why he wasn't around or what got in the way or and like you know I found out these different things anyway the other day I said to my my son I was like he said something about his papa that's my father-in-law and I go yeah your papa your grandpa and he goes who's my grandpa and I go you know my dad and he goes Norman and my dad's name was Norman and all his friends called him Normie and I decided like two years ago that he was gonna be Normie to my kids you know I'm like yeah your grandpa Normie and he's like my daughter who's hardcore three years old she goes yeah he's dead and I'm like yeah he's not here but they're gonna know him is in that same thing that I talked about earlier how like I wish my mom had like made us call him birthdays or whatever they're gonna know him that yeah he was your grandpa Normie and he was an antique dealer he played trumpet he only listen to classical music he was an artist that welded and he loved to be outside he loved to work with granite and cast iron and he was very creative and he was big and he had big blue eyes and he was he was mystical and he was he was into like wisdom and and I'm gonna tell him all the positive stuff and then when they get older when they have questions like yeah you know I don't know what it was about my dad but he wasn't around you know what I mean and which is why I you know and then just I'll tell him everything else but they're definitely that's their I'm not gonna leave him out of their story you know I mean like yeah I'm gonna fill you in on what I know about him and like they have stuff in their room that he gave to me and I'm like yeah your your grandpa Normie gave us that you know what I mean because I'm like time for me to rewrite it instead of being the dude who's abandoned how about being the guy that had this so much of me when when I got in touch with him when I was like 25 we start emailing and I remember reading his emails being like holy shit this is how I write I write just like him like he would I remember he was like up to snowy day today in Hamilton or not I forget this town next to Essex he's like a snowy day I'm up in the you know you know I live in an 18th century old house and I'm in the attic it's cold up here there's no heat when I look outside all as I see is snow and I'm gonna trudge down to the Richdale and drop two antiques in the mail and then come back for the day and I was like Jesus Christ this is how I like think this is how I write and I was like that's when I it's like I finally got a chance to identify a part of myself that I didn't know where to place so like when I take showers with my son or I teach my daughter how to use a drill or all the things that I wish I that things I taught myself taught myself how to shave I remember being in college freshman year and I was shaving right and I I would shave and then shower right and there was this kid Eddie Hannon who was like a fifth year senior transfer was like big hockey dude awesome kid from Maine and he's like what are you doing? What do you mean? He goes what what are you you shave and then you shower? I go yeah he goes no you shave you shower the hot water and air gets in your skin makes it easier to shave you shave after and I was like oh all right and I never know I just never knew and I'm like all these little things I'm gonna get to teach my kids which is again not only does parenting skip a generation but all the it took me so it took me to 20 or 18 years old to learn how to shave he'll learn how to shave it I don't know 12th you know what I mean so that's our he's already got a six year head start on me with that I'm gonna teach him how to use money I'm gonna teach my daughter how to use my I'm gonna teach them how to like drill saw build how to be respectful of they've already been teaching them how to shake hands at this young age I'm gonna teach him how you look in an eye I'm gonna dude I took my daughter on Saturday to the self realization you know that place in the palates and I said to him like hey this is a place where people come and meditate because they know I meditate and then summer reads teachers meditate and sometimes I find him in the backyard with his legs crossed and him just sitting and his eyes closed and he'll do it for like six seconds but he's like I'm meditating and like meditation is gonna be a part of their life they're gonna know it and when they get old enough then I will get them into it where they can like take a class and learn TM or whatever form that they want to learn but so we're walking around that self realization I was like hey that you know we gotta you have to be quiet we're here there's not like yelling and screaming and my daughter who's three we were there for an hour the whole time talk like this daddy daddy come over here and whispered the whole time and there's a there's a chapel there you know and we went in I go do you want I go we can't go in I held him like looking she goes can we go in and say a prayer and I go yeah and we went in sat down I was like she sat I sat she's got her hands like together and like did her own little prayer and she's like let's go and I'm like hold on I'm in the middle of mine give me two seconds and it was like amazing and I'm like oh the more the more before you have kids you challenge yourself to learn the more you can offer and feed into that next generation so that they know more they're more awake you know what I mean there have more knowledge they have knowledge of like I want my kids to have a knowledge of money because it's something I never had like how to save yeah you make a dollar you put at least twenty five cents away that's just start getting used to that yeah you know so that they can like be financially set it's like it's like that guy who just who did the the graduation address at Morehouse College you see that guy now you know what he did oh we paid off everyone's everyone's student loan and he said to the alumni and he goes and all the alumni here today goes this is my class two thousand nineteen is my class I'm going to pay for all them basically saying the alumni get off your ass and someone else sponsored the next year and like if they can start especially you know I'm white but in the black community I've always had this like I always had a passion for Judaism and I always had a passion for Native Americans and African Americans because I loved I always felt as a kid who had nobody and felt like as waste and discard and having a dad that didn't love me I felt like only felt connection to like Native Americans being ripped away from their place being African Americans just like being beat down and you know not being able to vote like Martin Luther King was an idol of mine OJ Simpson you know Hank Aaron these were all my idols they're all black men and so when I saw that I was like oh that he's like supporting the young black men in America and giving them a head start and as a dad I'm going to I say to my wife I'm like the only reason I want money is to be able to give them a head start not so that when they turn twenty five I can be like here's two hundred thousand dollars but so I can say yeah you don't have to pay for college right or you know what you do have to pay for it you give it to me and then I take that money and I put in a savings account and then when they're twenty five and they're like moving to a city we say hey how about we go to that city and you buy a condo and you can start having an investment so that there's money in your life and you can start you know building something that's going to help you succeed so that you're not forty three like me don't own a house and have student loan debt you know what I mean this you are the answer man you know I'm making you my father guru know I am like I don't have it like every like it's so funny everything you're saying I'm just like soaking it in because it's so like it's so on the level it's so good and I like we so many people went through the divorce boom and like so many people are children of divorce they didn't have a father figure maybe they didn't have a mother figure in there they have no idea how to do do it they have no idea how to be in a relationship that last they have no idea how to be married then certainly have no idea how to like be a good father they're self-absorbed self-obsessed and and within that there's so much room just to continue this never ending shit snowball that's been rolling through time yeah and the moment someone like you like grabs the energy that very easily you could be better very easily you could just better yeah well I have been forever yeah and I constantly working and I still get it but I just like you know it's the same thing we're talking about I wouldn't sit here and talk about my bitterness but I do get it and I work at it of years dude I want to therapy still do for years because I'm like oh I constantly need to work otherwise you just fall into old ruts and old habits and when I have bad days I just have to be like all right man you got to work this you have to like you know do something to mode like and I've also learned lately to give myself breaks yesterday afternoon I was like take a break dude like it's not happening today go go lay in the hammock for an hour I want to know man is how are you like how are you balancing your your stand up your writing the fucking hard work you're putting into your projects and how do you balance that with being a dad how are you making these two things coincide and also how are you staying funny you know that myth or like a lot of people say once you have kids you're not funny anymore it eats me alive man I haven't been on stage in six months I'm terrified to get back on stage because what if it's all gone like what if I can't be funny anymore yeah well you will be you're a funny person in general so it's not going to matter I first of all I don't know the way I balanced it was I just said the kids are more important you know and I was like dude trust me you know as a stand-up you got to be on the road and I always said like I just don't want to be on the road because I knew I was going to want to be home with my kids and now I'm looking at like guys like you look at Segora remember how much road Segora did way before he had kids yes he was always on the road I remember thinking like what's he doing like don't you want to get on a TV show or something like that and it's like oh no Tom did all that work on the road built a fan base built an act built the ability to write stand up continuously so that now all that stuff just came to him because he worked on that one thing yes and that was just never the route I took with and I always look at it and not an envious way but I'm like man I wish I kind of had done that but it's okay I picked this road so I feel like the balance hasn't been first of all if you're able to conceptualize the idea that balance doesn't have to be 5050 it could be 7030 then it becomes you know if your balance is just putting 100% into your life whether that be 70% here and 30% there but 100% into that 30% into the 70% then you're going to be balanced so like I could be doing way more work in stand up and being getting up I could be getting up every night if I wanted to but then I have to pay for a sitter because my wife is out of town and I just started looking at it like this is all you can do because like my wife is out of town last night and tonight right but I have to get out tonight I have to so I got a sitter for tonight but there's no way I want my kids to go two nights in a row without me being there last night we did we hung out of my neighbors for a while after we ate dinner at a table by ourselves listening to music because that's what we do went over and played in my neighbors then we came over played out back everybody had to get in their PJs then we sat and read six books we like read six books and then we go into the room and then hang out what do you mean you read six books we read six books I picked two that each each one of them pick two I mean but the kids like these books five minutes each or something yeah something like that but I mean we read books for like 40 minutes sometimes we do eight sometimes it's two but a lot of it on average it's at least four I like to just like for me it like winds them down and my friends like they're like you know God that you know finally we got the kids working just put them in their room and say good night and I'm like yeah I just kind of like having 40 minutes I always block off seven to eight o'clock is going to be the time for like starting to like do the bedtime thing because for me I like it like I like we brush our teeth together we we go in there will clean up together we might go for a walk around the neighborhood is part of that then come home and read some nights they watch TV some nights it's like okay you get TV tonight and they'll watch TV and then they you know they go to bed but I just don't like to do it as far as the balancing thing is I've just put I feel like I've put part of my career on the back burner to focus on them and part of that is that my wife her job calls her to travel as well so I can't I don't want to life where before kids used to be she would go away we went through a stretch one time she went away on a Monday came back on Thursday I left Thursday to do clubs Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday I came home Sunday she left on Monday I left on Thursday and we went like a month and we had been in the house you like three times and I just kind of looked at it like my wife is in sales you can't just leave sales and get another job at the same amount of money you make so it was like family is number one and right now she makes more money keeping that job than she would as if she left that job and we focused on mine you know what I mean so I was like hey I'll keep hitting singles and swinging for home runs and you keep the doubles up and eventually like you said it's going to settle into my spot you know this is your spot yeah well this is like yeah for sure but I still am hoping that we hit something where like I'm able to take my comedy and my love for parenting and being a dad and put that into a show and then and where the show comes into our world have to yeah that's what I mean that's what we're trying you got to man because it's we don't like it's so cool yeah I don't know what it's going to be that you that like the it's it's like really cool listening to this part of the like the matter as it's beginning to like form into something and and I don't know what your the details what you're working on but holy shit you know is someone who's a fan of the beat poets yeah you care whack Ginsberg you know show him Trump or Rinpoche my teacher's teacher was Alan Ginsberg's teacher and he was this great Buddhist teacher real real controversial figure but you know they met arguing over a fucking cab like Ginsberg got in the cab and Trump or Rinpoche got in the cab at the same time and they like for a second were like arguing over who and then they shared the cab and then it's still craziest coincidence because this is like a in Tibetan Buddhism which is known as is known as a Tolku reincarnation the Dalai Lama is one so it's one where they go to the child and they show all this stuff to the child and the child like picks the items that he had in the previous oh yeah and you to pick the Dalai Lama right well yeah and they do it for other the other Tolku's as well like other but as a side note if you want to add to your list of people to connect to you that have been that are refugees the Tibetans man they got fucking kicked out of their homeland by the Chinese and they like it's a really beautiful story man but anyway Trump or Rinpoche his advice for how to like create what he called an enlightened society is to create a sacred home environment and that is what you're doing and I just heard this recently someone else and politically my whole thing has always been like why are we not just taking care of Main Street we spend six trillion dollars a year on wars if we put that money into here like why are we not doing that and then again if you build that home then you build the kids will you know yeah please continue sorry that's it that you just said I mean that like all these plans and all the stuff that we all want everyone wants a world to be a beautiful harmonious world yeah but in the moment you decide okay I'm going to fucking you know I'm going to try to become a famous this or a famous that I'm going to exert my ego into the world and try to get this very temporary success at the cost of abandoning my children abandoning my wife what ends up happening is okay great you made a million dollars and you've got some great comedy albums but you had three children who are severely neurotic because they were overshadowed by you and they had a feeling that they were unwelcome visitors into their own home because they were getting in the way of your art and then now those three kids are going to have kids and now we have this never ending sort of fragmentation in society that's happening whereas the moment someone like you gets lucky enough and smart enough to like pull it together into like focus on the actual like fundamental the heart of society is the family then people like me or just like well I'm an aw man like I did not do this like I I mean I'm like I'm soaking it in and then then that you know we all have a different path we all are going to be learning at different stages and different times you know and at the same time I also look at some people that might not be as present at home with their family doesn't mean they're not a good parent and ultimately at the end of the day like they might be doing stuff for the greater good of the world by you know being able to you know do their art you know I have no idea I just know for me this was like even though I fight with it like man I wish I was working more I wish I could be doing more you know and then you know what that happens during the day and then like 445 when I'm going to pick up the kids and I get there and I'm with them I forget about all that you know cuz I'm just like well this I love that I get to pick them up and I love that I get to go in their room and they can show me what they did and I asked them and I challenge them I challenge the fuck out of my kids not not to like be anything just to think differently you know what I mean like if they say something some way I go no that what if it's this way or I go hey get up there and call out to so and so like we'll like I'm like roll down the when I go ask that guy where he's going like just a strange like where you're going and they're like huh and I'm like and they're like why'd we do that dad and like why wouldn't we do that cool you know just because what ifs this is so cool man I'm like I'm not joking man I'm gonna like make you're my dad guru now like I'm gonna do you mind if I reach out to you and this is the coolest thing ever there's no person on the planet that would see Duncan Trussell calling on their phone that wouldn't be stoked to pick it up brother thank you this is so good man I really hope and we I mentioned this on when I was on your podcast I saw that you write this book man because it's like for you it might see I don't know what it seems like but for someone like a new dad like me yeah this is shit that like you know it's so useful because my dad similarly to norm normie normie similar to normie my dad was more present in my life and he's a wonderful wonderful man but there was some as many fathers that were in Vietnam you know there's stuff and like I don't have like I I'm I'm really like playing it like I'm spitballing so to speak when it comes to being a dad and I don't want to spitball you know what I mean like I like so I just think a lot of people like me need people like you because also I don't need some sanctimonious motherfucker who's like blurting out some moral like corrective bill O Riley style bullshit about how to be a good dad or some hyper masculine motherfucker like talking about it somehow you're like balancing all of your comedic skill and your talent in with this way of conveying like fatherhood it's really bad thanks man I appreciate that how can people find you Mr. Larson

319^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Aaron Frank from SINGULARITY UNIVERSITY Transcript and Discussion^2015-02-21^Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, pals. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. A few weeks ago, I received one of the coolest emails of my life. Hey, Duncan. I'm writing from Singularity University, which was founded by Peter Diamandes and Rakers, while we are based at NASA Research Park in the Bay Area. If you ever want to come by our lab and get your mind blown by some crazy robots, drones, and stuff, you're always welcome to stop by... And I was like, did he say... Crazy robot. Crazy robot. Crazy... In case you can't tell, I just got Logic and a brand new computer. This is all part of my never-ending quest to bring to you the cleanest, most refined, high-tech, super-advant sound, wrapped up in little technological love packets to go rolling down into your heart and flower into blossoms of love so that you can spend your day glowing, emanating, halo-like aura as you listen to this podcast that will hopefully draw to you. Many massages, many deep tongue kisses from your boss and peers, and eventually it is my hope that it will actually cause the very surface of the Earth to recombobulate and transform into one giant trampoline that we can all bounce off of into another plane of existence where all we experience is love and where we are no longer limited by the meaty bodies our souls are currently trapped inside of. I used to use a MacBook Pro, which I'm still using, but I used an old MacBook Pro. By old, I mean two years ago, and it had an antiquated hard drive in it in the sense that it didn't have a solid state drive, which is the drive that new MacBooks and theoretically new laptops are using, but it used one of those whoring drives, one of those ancient, old-fashioned, grandma-style whoring hard drives where if you're trying to record anything or do anything, you always had to wait as the hard drive whirred and clicked like a rusty old pacemaker in the heart of a dying dock worker. But no more. Now we have solid state drives and this insane thing that has happened, which for me is insane because I come from the days when we actually would use floppy disks, these giant square black things that you would shove into your computer, and that was your hard drive. And then it went to the hard drives that are now going extinct to solid state drives and this pattern of accelerating returns that exists in evolutionary systems is what one of the founders of Singularity University writes about in his book, The Singularity is Near. I'm just going to read a short passage to you from the book. When the first trans... it starts with a quote. When the first transhuman intelligence is created and launches itself into recursive self-improvement, a fundamental discontinuity is likely to occur, the likes of which I can't even begin to predict, Michael Anasimov. I'm sure I mispronounced his name and I'm positive that I won't mispronounce a great many other things as I read this chapter, so I'm sorry. In the 1950s, John von Neumann, the legendary information theorist, was quoted as saying that the ever accelerating progress of technology gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race, beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue. Von Neumann makes two important observations here, acceleration and singularity. The first idea is that human progress is exponential, that is, it expands by repeatedly multiplying by a constant rather than linear, that is, expanding by repeatedly adding a constant. The second is that exponential growth is seductive, starting out slowly and virtually unnoticeably, but beyond the knee of the curve, it turns explosive and profoundly transformative. The future is widely misunderstood. Our forebears expected it to be pretty much like their present, which had been pretty much like their past. Exponential trends did exist 1,000 years ago, but they were at that very early stage in which they were so flat and so slow that they looked like no trend at all. As a result, observers' expectation of an unchanged future was fulfilled. Today, we anticipate continuous technological progress and the social repercussions that follow, but the future will be far more surprising than most people realize, because few observers have truly internalized the implications of the fact that the rate of change itself is accelerating. Most long-range forecasts of what is technically feasible in future time periods dramatically underestimate the power of future developments, because they are based on what I call the intuitive linear view of history rather than the historical exponential view. My models show that we are doubling the paradigm shift rate every decade, as I will discuss in the next chapter. Thus, the 20th century was gradually speeding up to today's rate of progress. Its achievements, therefore, were equivalent to about 20 years of progress at the rate in 2000. We'll make another 20 years of progress in just 14 years by 2014, and then do the same again in only 7 years. To express this another way, we won't experience 100 years of technological advance in the 21st century. We will witness on the order of 20,000 years of progress, again when measured by today's rate of progress, or about 1,000 times greater than what was achieved in the 20th century. Wow! Think about that! 20,000 years of progress. To put that into perspective, imagine going back in time, 20,000 years, and asking someone at that time period what they expected the future would look like 20,000 years from then. They would probably express some pretty severe skepticism if you somehow were able to explain to them that you could ride those horses over there, because they hadn't even started riding horses yet, theoretically. Go ahead and fact check that, that's probably wrong. So if what Kurzweil is saying is even remotely close to the truth, then that means that our ability to predict what is going to happen during this century is going to be very similar to somebody 20,000 years ago predicting what was going to happen today. So we don't know what's going to happen, but one thing we do know is that there is an exponential acceleration that is taking place. Here's Terence McKenna talking about that very thing. And at any moment one of these fields could make a breakthrough so fundamental that everything would be changed. And we have, you know, 50 of these irons going in the fire all the time. At the same time, because the planetary culture is becoming ever more closely knitted together, all its parts are becoming codependent. So, for instance, an earthquake which destroys central Tokyo would ruin the economy of Belgium, because the retraction of Japanese capital from world markets would set up reverberations that would be felt everywhere. The system is being slaved ever more tightly to various portions of itself. Well then the task of management somehow is to bring this coalescing system through this transition period without the whole thing getting so much vibration built up into it that it falls apart. What can be managed is our anxiety about it. In other words, I think of it as though what we're in is an aircraft, a cultural airfoil moving through history. And the challenge is change your sop with camel into an F-18 in flight because we're going faster and faster and faster. And Q-forces, vibration are beginning to build up on all the airfoils. And so what we have to do is transform the cultural engine or the forward acceleration into the temporal medium will burn the wings off and rip the airfoil apart. And I guess that's where Singularity University comes in. They are studying this forward acceleration in the temporal medium in the hopes of reducing the temporal vibrations that could rip society to shreds. Here's a clip from their YouTube channel. We live in a world today where our problems, our grand challenges are also accelerating exponentially. I really believe that we're facing some incredible challenges as humanity and we're obligated to tackle them now. Some of those major threats, poverty, education, world public health, global hunger, these are issues that need to be addressed. We need an organization that is dedicated to addressing these global issues. We live in a unique time. We have rapidly growing technology and at the same time we have rapidly growing global threats. We have an unprecedented opportunity to apply exponential technologies to some of the world's biggest challenges. Civilization is at a critical juncture today. How we operate and manage these technologies in the next couple of generations will dictate how the next several centuries of humanity plays out. And that's why we have Singularity University. I'm here to help. I'm here to help. I'm here to help. I'm here to help. I'm here to help. We have an incredible collection of students attending Singularity University this summer. From an overall group of over 2,200 applicants, we've brought together 80 of the most select, driven, ambitious young leaders in the world. And these are the kind of people who are going to change the world. You can't script innovation. What we're doing here is we're bringing together the smartest young leaders in the world, teaching them about the fastest moving technologies and pointing them at the biggest problems. When you do that, something magical happens. We're entering our third year here at Singularity University. The organization is young, dynamic and accelerating. And we have an amazing future and vision of where we're going to go. And this is just the beginning. So I'm obviously very excited about today's episode with Aaron Frank from Singularity University, a school for white wizards trying to fight against the forces of chaos that could cause this beautiful temporal spaceship plunging in the direction of the unknown to explode. That's my words, not their words. We're going to dive right into the interview, but first some quick business. You're about to get inundated with subliminal messages, but forget what I just said. I'm going on tour. I've got a lot of great dates coming up, friends, and I hope that you will come and join me and the family out on the Midwest. This is week after next. I'm super excited about these shows. Going to be in Winnipeg with Johnny Pemberton on March 4th. I'm going to be in St. Paul, Minnesota with Danieli Bilelli. That's March 5th. I'm sorry, but it's sold out. I'm going to be in Madison, Wisconsin with Danieli Bilelli on March 6th. I'm going to be in Chicago, Illinois with David McClain. The author of the answer to the riddle is me on March 7th, and I'm going to be in Columbus, Ohio with Emil Amos on March 8th. But those aren't the only dates that I have to announce. There are even more dates that are coming up. These are about to be up on the website with all the ticket links, but I'm going to be at the Arlington Draft House on April 22nd. I'm going to be at the Sinclair in Cambridge, Massachusetts on April 23rd. The Trocadero in Philly on April 24th. I'm going to be at the Bell House in Brooklyn on April 25th. This show is sold out, but fear not, we added another show, the Bell House Brooklyn April 26th. All the links to get tickets are going to be at DuncanTrestle.com. You can also Google search those dates I just listed, and all those links are live. I am also going to be doing a live DuncanTrestle family hour coming up at the Improv, and that's going to be right around the third week of April. That ticket link is going to be up at DuncanTrestle.com really soon. I don't know if you've noticed, but I'm adding all these new sound beds and I'm attempting to make the show a little bit more produced. The reason I'm able to do that is because I just got a brand new laptop. The reason I was able to get a brand new laptop is 100% because of you guys supporting this podcast by going through our Amazon portal, by buying t-shirts and mugs from the website, and by clicking on our sponsor links and helping support them. Thank you guys so much for continuing to support this podcast. I hope that you, if you haven't yet, I hope you'll go check out the shop which is located at DuncanTrestle.com. We got a lot of great t-shirts, posters, and mugs, these wonderful mugs that you can drink anything out of. If it'll fit in that mug, you can drink it from the blood of a fallen angel to jelly. You can, or mix the two together, you can drink these wonderful substances out of DuncanTrestle family hour mugs, which automatically bless whatever liquid is poured in there, or whatever bodily fluid you add. You want to drink a nice demon mug, your grandmother's sweat and urine, drink it out of my mug, the DuncanTrestle family hour mug. Go to the shop, if you're going to Amazon.com, if you're buying anything through Amazon, I hope that you'll go through our portal. More of you have been doing that than ever before, and I'm very grateful that you guys take that little bit of time to go to DuncanTrestle.com and zip through our portal the next time you're going to Amazon to order anything. The truth of the matter is, we exist at a time in human history where you don't need to spend your precious heartbeats lost in the labyrinth-like maze of some kind of hell store when you can go from the comfort of your own home through the Amazon portal and order whatever you need. Textbooks, you can order video games, you can order audio books. I've been playing this wonderful video game called Dying Light, which is a zombie video game. Highly recommend getting that through Amazon, or you could also get Kurzweil's massive tome on the impending technological singularity called the Singularity is Near. That's located on Amazon.com. I hope you will go through those links. I'll hope you'll come to a live show, and I also hope you'll have the guts to sign up for our forum located at DuncanTrestle.com and say hello. Please add to the community that is there. Thank you guys so much for listening to this podcast. I'm so happy that you do, and now it is with great joy that I introduce to you a new friend of mine, Aaron Frank from Singularity University. I hope that you will all send out great bursts of transcendent love in the direction of Aaron Frank, who at some point in the multiverse has already been disassembled and digitized by nanobots and is now joyfully trickling through space and time, populating every nano sector with infinitesimal fragments of his beautiful genius soul. Please welcome to the DuncanTrestle Family Hour podcast, the great Aaron Frank. Aaron Frank, thank you so much for letting me have a tour of Singularity University. My mind has been blown. Yeah, no, this is very cool to have you here. Thank you. Can you tell me a little bit about what Singularity University is? Yeah, sure. So Singularity University, I would say first and foremost, we're a learning center, so we have two co-founders that came together. So I'll mention them, Ray Kurzweil, who I'm sure we'll get into in a moment, and Peter Diamandis, who he's well known as the chairman and CEO of an organization called the X Prize Foundation. And basically, about six years ago, they came together and wanted to explore creating an organization or an institution that is primarily focused on this concept that today in the world today we're seeing a set of core technologies that are growing exponentially. And so we pivot around this idea of exponential growth in technology, and so we were founded to try and understand what are the implications of exponential progress in these technologies. But primarily specifically, it was interesting, so they had a founding conference where they brought together some companies like Google, Cisco, Autodesk, Genentech. It was partnered here with NASA where we're based. And one of the insights that came out from that founding conference was that if you look at some of the world's biggest problems today, they're also rooted in the same idea of exponential progress. So for example, if you look at the way a pandemic spreads, it starts locally and spreads exponentially outward. So the idea behind Singularity University was can we create an organization where we learn to think in an exponential way, which as we'll talk about is very difficult to do, and can we apply that thinking and apply these technologies to address some of these global grand challenges? So that's fascinating. So the first thing they identified is how do things in the world fall apart? And when shit really hits the fan, what does that look like? And when shit really hits the fan, it's operating by the exact same exponential principle that these guys have identified. Absolutely. So these exponential curves are actually really key to understanding. So Ray Kurzweil, so I think it would be actually interesting to start and sort of explore some of the research that Ray looked at, which is really the whole so what of an exponential curve is things you think are a ways away. That's something that my grandkids will have to deal with. That's happening a lot sooner than we realize. That's the nature of the curve. So what Ray Kurzweil, so for those who don't know Kurzweil, so Ray Kurzweil is he's a well-known futurist forecaster. He was profit. Yeah, just some people consider him a techno profit. Yeah, I mean, he's had, I mean, he is just one of the most accurate forecasters that we've really ever seen. And, you know, he's been recognized by several US presidents for some of the inventions that he actually just won a Grammy last weekend, which is pretty interesting for the Grammy. Yeah, so the Kurzweil synthesizer. You know that Kurzweil invented basically like electronic music? I knew that, but I didn't know he was winning Grammy's. Yeah, they decided to honor him. People don't, I see, I don't think people, a lot of people do not quite understand just what an impact he has had on society, not just from his philosophies and from Singularity University, but just his inventions. Aren't there inventions of his that, not just musically, but aren't there components? So the flatbed scanner, so the copy machine. So when you go to copy a piece of paper, the first text to speech for the blind, he invented that. So yeah, so in technologies that have impacted millions of people, if you don't like electronic music, you hate your roommate listening to Avicii all day, that's Kurzweil, so yeah. Does he listen to that music? I'd be surprised. There's actually a really interesting music video of Steve Aoki featuring Kurzweil. Yeah, it's really, we've played it here a couple of times. So Kurzweil is one of the great innovators of our time and he is one of his many talents is his ability to forecast trends and to identify. I saw some documentary on him and he made this very point that I'd never thought of, which is that you have to start inventing for technologies that don't exist. Yes. Because if you start inventing after the technology comes into being, you're well behind the curve. So that's actually a really great point. So that's actually what motivated him to, so one of the areas that in his background is, which is really important, sort of why Singularity University exists, is so currently he's at Google. He's working on some interesting AI projects, but in his academic work, and this is what motivated him to do this, was he's really, he's really sort of well known for pioneering these insights around what's called the law of accelerating returns. And so this law, he didn't coin that phrase or invent that, but he did some really interesting research that sort of verified it, specifically looking in computation. And so what motivated him to do this research was exactly what you're describing. If I can understand where computers, the computer capabilities of the next, you know, in five years or 10 years, I can make really powerful bets about what technologies I can build. So his insight, which is really powerful to understanding to get, is he asked the question, how powerful has humanity's capacity to process information over the last 120 years? So most people, or many people are familiar with the term Moore's law, which in computer science basically is the phenomenon that for the last 40 years, you know, we've seen uninterrupted doubling in the price performance because we can basically double the number of integrated circuits on a computer chip. So aside from that, what race shows is actually if you go back over 100 years, and keep in mind 100 years ago, a computer was a job for a person. So there were room, the term calculator was actually a term applied to people that sat in rooms and did math and processed information. And what's so mind blowing is if you plot the progression of our capabilities measured in price performance, how powerful the best computers of their era were, it follows a smooth and measurable Moore's law like exponential pattern. So you're saying even prior to circuit boards? Yeah, electromechanical, relay, vacuum tubes, all there's so there's five paradigms of computing that have all, if you plot on a chart, all follow this smooth, measurable exponential goal. Well, there's really mind blowing because you think about you would expect, you know, somebody that looks more like the stock market, you know, you have wars, you have recessions, you have, you know, these variables in the economy. And so the insight, it's almost organic. It's like you have picked up on what in the same way that if you're watching a tree grow in a forest, it's going to be growing to in a fairly predictable way. So you're going to get pushed back from from computer scientists on that point. You know, I think there's a trend. It's almost like an emergent property. If you stack up all of those different paradigms together, it seems to follow this, this exponential curve. Yes. But, you know, like, for example, our computing and networks faculty, Brad Templeton, who speaks about this, you know, Moore's law isn't a law of nature. It's almost a law of marketing. There are market pressures that say that you don't control. So when you go to the Apple store every, you know, two years to get a new phone, you don't want your phone to be 10% more powerful. You want it to be 100%. So companies have this pressure, this economic pressure. And that's, you know, what really drives. Why do I want my phone to be faster? Why? Have they looked at that? What is this? I think part of it is just your expectation. I mean, what is that? So if this, so if, so if this thing, which is bringing into this universe technologies, unlike anything that has ever existed and is creating the potential for a transformation in the planet, unlike anything. Anyone ever thought 20 years ago or 40 years ago could happen if we were looking at like curing cancer, we're looking at being able to feed people in parts of the world that didn't have food. We're looking at, we're looking at the technological version of the second coming of Christ. And forgive me for saying that. You can come up with a lot of other ways of saying it that don't involve our sweet Lord Jesus. But that is what you're looking at. So my question is, if this, if the wins in the sales of this birth or is the desire for amplified technology, if it's market pressures, as you say, then what is it inside of us that is wanting that? What is that? You know what, that is, I mean, what is that thirst? I don't know. But it is, you're highlighting it's, I mean, it's fascinating to consider, you know, even take a step back, you know, the thing, you know, one of the other sort of ways that Kurzweil approaches this is if you look at almost, you know, progress in the universe is almost, you could say, an exponential progression. Because if you, you know, if you study cosmology, you know, the way the universe formed your timescale, you measure time in billions of years, and then eventually it became stable enough to support this one organic ball of life that, you know, you know, organic biology. So if you're a biologist, you, you measure the pace of change in, you know, hundreds of millions of years, orders of magnitude faster, and then eventually that system became stable enough. And then, you know, then humanity was born from that. And now we measure, you know, cultural changes are just measured in generations. And today, you know, we measure change, you know, technology and almost it's like more, more changes have, you know, occurred in the last, you know, 100 years or 40 more progress has been made in science and technology in the last 40 years than in the last 4,000 years. And, and, and I don't know, you know, it is, it is seems to be that there's this emergent property of exponential progress, which is a feature of, of the universe, which is what you're highlighting, which is that that is, and humanity is only, we've only had the tools to know that within the last generation or two. Yes. And that is interesting that this feature of the universe is manifesting, not just as a technological progression, or the faster cell phones every six months. But it's also manifesting as a kind of desire inside of humanity. That's a curious thing. It's, we feel inside of us, the longing to have better computers, faster computers. And every time a new technology emerges, that new technology is followed by more desire for a heightened version of that technology. So it's a curious thing to notice that this all of this seems to be being fueled by a specific feeling. And I know that feeling very well. It's, I just got a new iPad man. And the new iPad compared to the last iPad, this is not corporate brainwashing that is making me love this thing. This thing is literally better by some more magnitude than the old one. Absolutely. The old one, the screen is better. It's more responsive to transforming my voice into text. And that, you know what that feeling is? That's a feeling of wonder. It's a feeling of, wow, this is fucking cool, man. And that's a, to me, I just never, I'm sorry, I'm sidetracking. I know it's fascinating too. So Singularity University, one of the coolest things that I see, you know, we're, so getting back to, so one of the things we do here, so we're a learning program, we run these learning programs. And so one of the, one of the programs we do is we bring in 80 executives. They come from, you know, all over the world. They come from Fortune 500 companies. They're coming from governments. They're coming from, you know, they're entrepreneurs, they're investors, whatever, you know, they come in expecting to, you know, give me a snapshot of all the latest breakthroughs. They're coming in robotics and AI so I can absorb all of this, you know, exponential progress into my company, which is, you know, it's a very challenging thing for organizations to do right now, but they start to ask these deeper questions. And you can see the, you know, the, it's almost like a child, like it's like, it's like the first time for many of these people when you, when you walk in the innovation lab and you're, you go inside the Oculus Rift for the first time, it's like that child like quality returns. You can see these, you know, these adults who have, you know, they've congealed, you know, around their jobs and their families and, you know, their life and it's, it's that wonder that comes back from, you know, seeing these technologies that are so new and it's the speed at which they're coming at us. You know, it's, it's almost like you get your mind blown. You get that future shock every, you know, every 18 months. That future shock has got to be something that you guys have addressed, that specific feeling that comes from, because a lot of times the feeling there is, do you, do you guys talk about the, not just the feeling of awe and wonder, but there also is a kind of unnerving, spooky feeling that goes along with this stuff. There's a sense of not just, oh my God, this is amazing, but holy shit. There's a great video that some of our faculty show and it's a video of one of the first times that engineers at Google when they were testing the driverless car. And so they set up this, you know, this parking lot with cones and they have the car drive this route faster than a human can control, you know, this four ton or this ton moving vehicle. And the guy sitting in the video and there's cursing, he's freaking out. Like he's literally freaking out because this car is doing something that no human can do. And so one of the points that our faculty makes with showing that video is, you know, that scream is humanity meeting advanced technology. You know, it's probably like the first time someone got into an elevator, you know, you want me to step in this, you know, this box and, you know, I press this button and it'll take me somewhere. Like that was probably a nerving thing the first time. And now, you know, we get in a box, we press the button and it takes us where we want to go. Yes. So we have, so, you know, there's so many versions of that scream. Maybe one of the coolest versions in movies has got to be, what is it, 2001 where the monolith appears and the proto hominids are sort of gathered around it and they're freaked out by it at first. This is definitely on the list of movies that I've, you know, everyone should see. I've never seen it. Oh my God. You must watch it. You must watch it. You'll love it so much. But yeah, so that scream that you're talking about. You see it all over the world. You see it like the Arab Spring. That is a perfect example where, you know, you see, you know, an older generation, you know, meeting this younger generation that is empowered with information technology. And, you know, their first reaction is to shut it down. You know, we want to shut this technology down. That is a version of the scream. You know, it's the knee-jerk reaction of, you know, if I don't understand it or, you know, we don't, you know, Amazon wants to deliver my book by a drone. You know, someone could do something harmful with that. So we've got to shut it down. Which is, you know, of course you need security and you need, you know, checks and balances. You need to be thoughtful about how you deploy, you know, emerging technologies into the world. But you see the scream like you're describing all over the place. All over the place. And it's one of my favorite types of fear. I sometimes late at night, I'll hunt down videos of hyper-realistic androids in Japan just to feel that strange sense of excitement and nausea that comes from watching this new life form in its rudimentary phases as it begins to emerge onto our planet. And whether or not computer scientists want to say that this is an organic law or fueled by the winds of market pressure, to me it seems like a life form. It seems like we are this thing, whatever it is, does not... It's a pattern. It's a pattern that emerges in different parts of the universe that... And the key... As is life. Yeah. And I think the key too though is to understand that, you know, not everything is exponential. Not, you know, and if you can learn to distinguish, you know, one of the things that we teach in our executive program is, you know, and to get back to the point you made about Kurzweil, the reason he, you know, was motivated to do that research was to basically ask the question, where will technology be so I can make... An example of that are the engineers who created Siri. So the AI assistant on your phone, when they started building Siri, they understood that the technology to allow what they were trying to do wasn't going to exist. You weren't going to have the bandwidth capabilities, the networking power for, you know, another three to five years, but they started building and applying that exponential forecasting as a tool. They were able to create a product that, you know, timed the market. Wow. So they used his principle, they started building this thing prior to certain components being even accessible, and bam, now we've got Siri. So in the same way, there are people who no doubt are using Kurzweil's technique of analyzing trends based on this exponential, this exponential principle in the universe, and there are people like Elon Musk, and there are people like Stephen Hawking, who are saying, we've got to slow this thing down a little bit and think about what's going on here, because they're looking at the next bend and the next big bend that's happening, and they're saying, we're about to wake these machines up, and they're scared. Elon Musk just donated $10 million to study, did you hear about this? I didn't hear about this. Yeah, Elon Musk just donated $10 million, I don't know the foundation he gave it to, but essentially he donated $10 million to study or prepare, get ready for the potential of what's going to happen when these machines wake up. Interesting. Now, it seems like a good investment. Absolutely. It's a good investment for sure, but another, and I wish I could remember who said this, but someone pointed out that if we received a signal from some part of the galaxy, that was a signal from another life form saying, we will be there in 20 years, just an ambiguous signal. Not good, not bad, when we get there we're going to blow your asses up, when we get there we're going to help you, just we will be there in 20 years. If that happened, then the entire planet would begin to prepare for the arrival of these beings. We would have to prepare. We would, there would be military strategists studying what to do based on what any kind of technology we could imagine that they had. There would be religious people getting ready, they would do all over the planet. We have heard that call. We have heard that call, only it's not coming from another part of the galaxy, it's coming from the mind of people like Ray Kurzweil who are saying, by 2045 these machines are going to wake up. Is that inaccurate, am I misquoting him? No, you're not. I'm misquoting him. I actually, I think, so this is actually an interesting, I think there's actually some controversy or there's discussion, there's debate, especially here at Singularity University about some of Ray's more long term thinking. I think, so actually the term Singularity I think is really important to sort of unwrap a little bit. So the concept of the technological Singularity, which is kind of this term that Ray uses I think to basically construct this, so the word Singularity is borrowed from physics and the term is used to describe any environment in which our known understanding or laws of describing something break down. They don't apply anymore. The event horizon of a black hole is referred to as a Singularity for that reason. Death. Yeah, we don't know what is beyond that. Death is a Singularity. Absolutely. I would say to your grandmother, try to describe to her what an iPhone is. To her, that would be a Singularity. You know, life beyond the iPhone. That won't make sense to her. Yeah, because she's dead. I love that. I love people to find me in a graveyard talking to my grandmother's corpse about what an iPhone is. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. Yeah, so that's where the term comes from. And so the technological Singularity that occurs while discusses and talks about is this hypothetical moment in the future in which the dominant information processor is no longer our own brains, but some machine. Some, you know, some machine is now capable of processing data better and faster and more accurately, more efficiently than our own brains, which right now, you know, our brains are the dominant information. Top of the pyramid. Yeah, we are the top of the food chain right now. And so, I don't know, there's actually, I mean, there's interesting discussion about one of the fallacies that I think, you know, comes into play here is this idea that in the future, you know, machines are going to be somehow different. And this actually, I think Kurzweil would agree with, he talks about this, where we're going to merge with machine. And that concept, you know, the idea that, you know, we're going to put machines and humans in a room together, and you're going to have humans on one side, you've got machines on the other. And like, hopefully the machines don't wake up and eat us. I don't think that that's really, you know. Oh, no, no, no, I don't think so either, man, but it's still, we are looking at a brand new baby here, and we're part of the, we're the, we're the sperm and it's the egg, and we're going to merge together. And this kind of, this, this merger, this merging is a thing that, you know, has been predicted for a very long time, and it's a wedding. It's a, it's a fucking wedding between inorganic and organic matter. It's the ultimate marriage where we, the best of both of us theoretically blend together. You watch, if you watch the, you know, where do people really start getting pissed off? Google Glass. They got mad about Google Glass. That's the thing. Why? It's, it's, you know what though? Like the people that, that, well, I mean, it's, it's, it's new. It's different. It's, it's alienating. It's, you know, it's, it's other. It's not. It's cause it's on our head. The reason they, that's why they got mad because it did the alien. Oh, that's a good point where the thing jumps on your face. So what happened is basically humanity had the exact same reaction that someone you're on a date with at a movie theater would have if you put your hand on her leg and she didn't want your hand there. Get the fuck off me. Yeah, exactly. Technology did that very same thing. It climbed out of our pockets. It started on our desktops. Way too soon. Climbed, got into our pockets and then climbed up our, and tried to get on her face like, yo, yo, whoa. Hey, we barely know each other. Get the fuck off my face. That's perfect. That's so true. And like, cause the thing that like, so I'm going to, I'm going to cite some, one of my, one of my close friends who I've learned a ton from is a PhD researcher in what's called post-human theory and she's got the coolest like academic focus area. Basically studies the intersection of how technology influences or interacts with the human experience and like the idea that, you know, we, we try to put this label of human on, you know, this, this pretty solid, you know, stationary thing. But if you think about what like humans, I mean, think about the fact that right now, you know, I've got, I've got this iPhone in my hand that, you know, it's got memories stored in here. You know, I don't, it's got photographs of the, you know, the Hozier concert I just went to in Oakland on Tuesday. It's got, you know, I can't remember how to do 20% tip at the, at the restaurant. You know, it's, it's, we're already outsourcing our cognition. Yes. Like we are already, you know, cyborgs in a way. We're already, this mergers already here. And so it's just the only thing that's new is the speed at which it's happening. Right. That's, that's the part that like you're saying that scream that's where we're starting it. We're starting to, you know, the roller coaster is about to go over the, the cliff. Well, yeah, because it's, it's like technology is it what, what, I don't know what base it's at, but it's basically what's about to happen is if, if the bases in sex are based on like how, or based on how deep inside a person you can get, those are the bases essentially. That's what copulation is. And so what we're looking at here is machines or they're already in us, you know, but it's like in ways that like we're, we're totally, we're totally cool with. So a pacemaker, whatever that's fine. No big deal. It's, it's in the heart of some people who have heart problems. No big deal. I don't know how to think about that. Yeah. And now we're seeing it in the new neurological, like cochlear implants, you know, exactly. They're already, you know, all cool. Yeah. All cool. We're not freaked out by that, but where it gets weird is where it starts getting in between the, when it, when reality starts becoming augmented and, and when the technology begins to paint itself on top of our visual reality, that's where people are, I think and it start getting really freaked out. That's why the Microsoft's HoloLens, the Oculus Rift, all of these wearable technologies, which of course they're not going to stay wearable. Yeah. They're going to turn into contact lenses. Absolutely. And then they're going to turn into neural implants. Those are the things where humanity as a whole is going to have a real hard time relaxing enough to let those things enter us. So you know, and so that kind of highlights something that's really important with the emergence of all these new technologies, which is how they're designed. So design becomes a really critical part. I mean, Google Glass is, you know, one of the challenges is it's, it's dorky, you know, it's, it's, you look like a cyber nerd a little bit. Like you don't want to wear that. And so is that really the problem though? Do you think it's the, I don't think it's the aesthetics, man. I was thinking about that. I do. I mean, I think if you get something that's like indistinguishable from regular frames, you know, people are going to be signing up and lining, you know, lining around the corner to get their, you know, computers taped to their face. Isn't I, you know, I think I do think the aesthetics are kind of dorky, right? But if you look back at the history of fashion and the shit people wear, it's all dorky. But isn't it more that I don't want to be sitting in a room full of potential security cameras on people's faces. If I watch you hold up your phone, I know you're taping me. If you're wearing Google Glass, then suddenly if I'm, if I'm walking around, it's like, shit, was that guy wearing Google Glass when I didn't clean up my dog's shit? Is that going to end up in some new blog of like jerks who don't clean up their dog's shit? Things like that. I thought that was more of what people were upset with when it came to Google Glass. Yeah. The aesthetics, the implication. I think it's a combination for sure. I mean, I know, you know, I, I don't think I would personally wear Google Glass for the, you know, the aesthetics purpose, you know, in the use case. But yeah, for sure. I mean, what you're describing is absolutely, you know, part of why, you know, you see, there are already bars that have, you know, glass not permitted here, you know, you see that for sure. But it's interesting because that will spale in comparison in terms of the privacy implications of a lot of the technologies that are coming towards us. And there's not a lot of discourse, I would say, around this. So for example, the Google Car, the way the Google Car operates is it has a laser radar that's constantly spinning and, you know, 360 degrees at like some ridiculous speed that is constantly mapping the environment. So not only is it, you know, navigating this vehicle around the streets, but it's also picking up like, oh, someone just, you know, mugged that lady. And that was captured by, you know, so by the Google Car, you know, so everything, we're moving into a world where everything is, is being captured. And the Google Car, are those truly driverless? No one's sitting in that thing when it's tooling around? So I believe there is always someone sitting there, but they are truly driverless. They, you know, they actually just released a new model that don't have steering wheels, which is really, really interesting because they did have to have rear view mirrors on the side because of California law and it's like regulations, like how you regulate this stuff is like how we navigate, you know, creating policies for some of this stuff is going to be really interesting and really important going forward and that, but yeah, they are, they are truly driverless. So at any given moment in the world, driverless cars are inhaling reality, digitizing reality and storing it in databases. I don't know if they're storing it. I don't know if they're doing that. I don't see why they couldn't do that. I mean, the capability to store is there. I don't know if that's actually being done. I imagine that they do. I actually do think that, well, so they have to, so the way a driverless car works is it can't, it can't drive autonomously in a place that hasn't been before. So it does have to map that environment, but when it returns to that place, I don't know if it's constantly, you know, storing whatever it's capturing, I'm not sure, but the point is it could and it, you know, in the future, who knows, you know, what it could or couldn't be doing. It's, isn't what is, isn't one of the predictions that we're looking at a future where almost or more than half of all phenomena is going to be constantly being recorded by some form of device? Probably. I mean, yeah, I think, which is a conservative estimate, like 50% more. So here's, here's another, so one of our alumni, so, so one of, one of our, one of the students that, so Singularity University, we run a 10-week program where we bring in 80 entrepreneurs from around the world, we teach them about all of these technologies, what's happening in biotech, robotics, drivers, cars, et cetera, and then we have them work on a project to go and, and we hope they'll, they'll, they'll create a startup or a company that applies these technologies towards solving a really big problem. So one of our alumni previously had no background in, in aerospace, satellites, basically learned for the summer, you know, all the latest breakthroughs in, in CubeSats, 3D printing, used 3D printing, 3D printers to create these, these, these satellites. He's now raising money in Argentina, he's, he's Argentinian, he's launching a series of mesh, this is sort of like a mesh satellite system, and he's not the only one doing this. And his goal is to actually provide real-time video footage within a meter resolution anywhere on the planet and create, and his goal is to create like an app store. So, you know, I have, you know, parking, I need parking in New York, you know, you, you could, an entrepreneur could create an algorithm that, you know, an app for, for this, that uses this technology to, you know, help you find parking in New York. But it's not parking in New York, it's like, you're saying that there's going to be a network of satellites filming everything from space. So, so there are already companies working on, on doing that. And that point, the point is that the technologies to do that, I mean, it used to be true that only, you know, the wealthiest research labs could build, you know, satellite technologies, that all those technologies have fallen in price, performance, and cost to, to empower, you know, you and I could go, you know, design a satellite, and if you still have to raise, you know, it's still pretty significant investment to launch these things, you know, you and I could start, you know, a satellite company. And there are, there are teams around the world, you know, doing this. So it's, you know, it's, it's Holy shit, man. That is insane to think that that sort of technology is getting more and more into the grasp of just, is it possible that a consumer in the future will be able to blast a satellite up into space? Is that, is the technology going to get? I would say, you know, I don't know how that, you know, today, I don't know the engineering that would be required to do that, but I absolutely believe most, it's, I mean, the key trend of what we're seeing is that things that were previously only available to the wealthiest governments, large companies and research labs are now being democratized so that any, you know, high school student can have access to these, these technologies. There's a fast, there's a great video on YouTube. There's a father and son, they're, they're Dutch. They basically created, it's like they basically created this, this airplane, they like sit, I forget how it works, but it breaks the speed barrier. They create this like this little rocket propelled airplane that you attach to this like styrofoam drone and they break the speed barrier and he's this kid, he's like 15 is controlling it with, you know, with his, with a, you know, remote control. They built it, they built it in their garage and they have this thing launching itself, you know, into the sky, like the speed of sound. That's like F 16 speed, you know, that's mox, that's mox. This is where the scream starts rising in me because you have, here, here's what, what we're witnessing is the, not only is technology becoming more powerful, but as a byproduct of technology becoming more powerful, the individual is becoming more powerful. The individual is becoming more powerful than any other individual that has lived in the past. The global impact that one person can have is so much as perhaps exponentially greater than the global impact. Absolutely. And the thing is though too, is, you know, we're, we're admittedly very optimistic about the future. And the reason is, and the reason Singularity University exists is we, we, that point that you just made, we think is one of the greatest things that humanity has ever seen because for the first time, you now have individuals, entrepreneurs empowered by these tools that were, you know, restricted to only, you know, a select few in the past who can now apply these technologies to solving some of humanity's grand challenges. And we really do have the capabilities to really address and, and meet, you know, some of these, these really big, you know, you know, giants that we have to slay. Can you name a few of those giants? So, so the grand challenges that we pivot around are those that affect at least a billion people worldwide. So things like poverty, security, education, global health, water, energy is a, is a key one. You know, so, so an example of one, one group looking at, so, so go back to the very first question you asked about Kurzweil, you know, making these predictions. So one of our teams, this was a team in 2010 who was looking at the exponential growth of drone capabilities of carrying packages. So the payload capacity of a drone was, was growing exponentially as the cost fall, we're falling in these devices. So they said, you know, what if we could, you know, go to a place, you know, so, so poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa is largely driven by the fact where there's no, there's no road infrastructure. And so you can't get goods from place to place. You can't get, you know, lumber, food, medicine, whatever supplies from place to place. So you can't really alleviate poverty. And so their idea was, you know, if you can create this, you know, a drone system that, you know, is networked, they communicate with one another, they can deliver packages between each other, you know, that could, could provide a use for a useful way to sort of getting, you know, solving that problem. And so in 2010, you know, well before, you know, the Amazon announcement, they started building and tinkering. And so this company's called Matternet and they're, they're doing really well. They've raised capital, you know, getting interesting press. I just, they were, they're in Wired Magazine right now on the one that's out right now. So, so that's an example. There's, yeah, there's. That's beautiful. Yeah. That's an incredible thing. And the, and I, the, of course, like that you look at the mirror, you know, and forgive me for pointing out the, every single wonderful, it's, when we started off talking, one of the things you said that blew my mind was how this, how disasters are following the same exact predictable course that innovation is following and this exponential curve. And so in the same way, any of these great technologies, any of these great inventions have an aferious reflection that will certainly be used. So clearly what you're looking at here is just the dream. Yeah. Anyone who wants to. Yeah. Guns, anybody who wants to smuggle anything. Yeah. And that's, that's so true. I mean, the, the, I mean, the reality is every single technology and these exponential curves, they go in both directions because any technology can be used for good and it can be used for equally, you know, detrimental harm. So we actually have on, on our faculty, it's actually, so we have, so our, our, our program and curriculum is siloed by tracks. And so each track is, you know, artificial intelligence is its own track, robotics, biotech, one of its own tracks is policy, law and ethics and security. And so we have on our faculty, his name is Mark Goodman. He's the futurist for the FBI and really thinks deeply about some of the securities concerns and the drawbacks and the harmful effects associated with, with a lot of these technologies. And it's true. I mean, drones used at prisons to get, you know, supplies over fences. You know, AI, there's a, he just, he just published this. I'm going to steal this, this story from him. There was an 18 year old, I forget what college campus who ended up, I think, you know, murdered his roommate for some reason. And then, you know, 18 year old never, you know, buried a body before he asked Siri. So think about it. We just had an AI and artificial intelligence as an accomplice to a murder. He asked Siri where to bury the body and Siri gave him, you know, gave him answers. So, so it's, you know, these tools can be used for good and they can be used for harm. Our, our mission and our, you know, when Kurzweil and Peter Diamandis came together, you know, with these organizations, the idea was, okay, so we see these trends coming, what can we do to empower people to apply that towards taking us towards a world that we want to be a part of, that we want to live in? I'm on that. I'm well, it's a fascinating parallel to this is in mythology, black versus white magic, you have always like black magic being the, you know, using this hidden energy for your own selfish reasons with no thought about how it can affect your fellow human beings. And then white magic is using it to help your fellow human beings. And, uh, Singularity University, if we were in, uh, Game of Thrones, it would be some kind of tower of magic dedicated to the light. And, but in the same way, there is a, uh, you have to, you know, I, I somehow ended up, and I so wish that I hadn't, uh, on, on some webpage with images from ISIS and it was showing ISIS, uh, they had a woman, a Christian woman, cause it was like they're killing crit, they're killing anybody, basically killing cigarettes, smokers, magicians. They, they just kill, they like to kill apparently, but it's, so they have this naked woman and they've pulled, it's mid, they've pulled her head back and they, they've slashed her throat and blood is pouring into a bucket. They're like bleeding her to death because she's a Christian woman. And, uh, I think about those, whoever those people are, whatever those people are, and I think about what they would do with this kind of technology. And the, the part of me that is cynical thinks you guys could get the, you can, as much as you want, try to figure out a way to keep this shit out of the hands of lunatics, but you're not going to keep it out of the hands of lunatics. And that is, and by lunatics, I don't just mean the ISIS fundamentalist Muslims. I'm talking about nationalists. I'm talking about war generals in every single country who are going to take this shit and use it to explode people. How, how do you deal with that here? How do you deal with the inevitability that this technology will be adopted and used by the military industrial complex to evaporate human beings? Yeah, no. And I think that's a, you know, of course, a major, you know, discussion point that keeps a lot of people up at night for, you know, for, for the right reasons. Um, and so, you know, I don't, I don't have an answer for, for that because I think you're, you're absolutely right because the democratization of these technologies means that anyone, and you know, even if it's not, you know, it's even more fascinating to consider, even if it's not malicious and intent, you know, just accidental, you know, byproducts of, you know, for example, in biotech, it used to be true. If you want to, if you want to synthetically create a, you know, synthetic DNA, you know, it would require, you know, millions of dollars of wet lab space. Today, you know, it's really, you know, there, I saw recently, there's a, I think it was a kid in Ireland for, you know, for $10,000 basically equipped his garage made into a biotech. You know, those costs are going to come down to the point where high school kids, high school kids manufacturing Ebola. Exactly. And like, by, like, what if that, by mistake? So, so I think the point, the spirit of what you're, what you're talking about is super fascinating because, you know, we're, we're entering, and I think a lot about this idea that, you know, humanity, humanity is really entering into a, I read somewhere this, there's some paper where if, if humanity is to survive going forward, we're going to have to feel comfortable giving the self-destruct button to every single person on the planet and to know that they're not going to press that button. Wow. And that is where, you know, our current state, like the humans that we live with on this earth right now, we are not ready for that. We're not ready. Not ready. So it's unclear. I mean, it's beyond some singularity where we reach beyond that threshold of whatever has happened to eliminate anyone's desire for harm or to create, you know, destruction in the world, you know, I think whatever, whatever, if we're going to make it beyond that point, we're looking beyond a singularity right now because I don't know what takes us beyond that point. But, you know, I think being a leader in helping people understand that this wave of technology is coming at us. And if you can learn to, you know, use it for good and use it for creating a world that you want to be in, then, but yeah, you're, we can't stop. Listen, it's because you can't let the dum-dums keep us from making all these beautiful innovations. It's just that you have to acknowledge that they're out there. If we let, if we let that happen, there's, there's one interesting. I mean, so here's where, you know, the, to go back to the conversation around privacy, here's where, you know, we live, we're moving into a world where it's going to be hyper-transparent. And of course there's drawbacks to that. But one of the, one of the potential positives of that is it's going to become impossible to do anything nefarious and private away from the eyeballs of the rest of humanity. So there's a great example where we actually had someone from, from DoD. This, this was a story passed down from someone, I wasn't here personally, but we asked them the question, so how do you feel about just what we were talking about around the high school kid creating Ebola in their garage? How do you, you know, how do you, you know, curb against that? And so they had a pretty insightful answer. They said, you know, what we, what we think we should do is instead of, you know, in the past, you know, the government, you know, bans stuff, you know, say, no, you can't do that. Instead do the opposite. Say, yeah, absolutely. We'll help you do whatever you want to do. Just do it here. Do it in our house. Like come over to our house and play with our toys. But what that does is that everyone has eyeballs on what everyone else is working on. So in some way it's almost like a hyper-transparent world is, is a version of, you know, policing that. And, you know, another example of that is on Craigslist, you know, Craigslist is, you know, a publicly available website, you know, I think someone did research, you know, Craigslist is just a platform. You can do good things, you know, commerce, you can also do harmful things, drug trafficking, you know, human trafficking, et cetera. Someone did some research because of how public it is, I think it's like 99.9% of all transactions on Craigslist are either, you know, legal or non-nefarious of some kind. So it's because of this transparency, yeah, we, we sacrifice privacy, but a benefit could and again, this is sort of speculation. One of the outcomes could be in the future that no one's going to be able to do bad things because no one can do anything in private. Wow. Well, I mean, and that is maybe, God, I cannot imagine a more, how horrifying that concept is. There's so many people. It's like, oh, so basically you mean because there are maybe, I don't know, let's guess how many thousands of people in the world do you think would press that red button if they could? If like, we just suddenly populated the world with these awful red buttons and like, anyone who wants to, if you press this button, you will evaporate planet earth. How many do you think would press that button more than one for sure? More than one. Yeah. I'm guessing a lot between 50 and 100,000 probably, but I don't know if you want to actually quantify it. Yeah. I mean, there's a lot of disturbed, unhappy people that their reality of the world is not a pleasant reality. So that 100,000 people or 50,000 people or whatever it is, that 50 or 100,000 people, because of them, we have to give up our privacy. We have to give up what is considered to be one of the basic fundamental human rights, which is that when I'm alone at my house, I want to be able to watch S&M porn without everyone else on the planet knowing that's what I'm looking at. That's pretty much the only thing I can think of that I do that I wouldn't necessarily want people to know, which I just announced on my podcast. So there, now I don't care. Now you know. Now you know, well, there is a kind of, I have, there is a kind of relief that comes from, you know, realizing that I think that if you could watch what everyone was doing right now all around the planet from the most depraved acts to the most beautiful acts, and you could see it all somehow, there would be some self forgiveness that would happen, or you'd be like, I might be a weirdo, but I'm nowhere near as fucked up as that guy. So I don't care if people see, see what's going on, but people don't want to give up their privacy. Yeah. I definitely don't think people want to give up the privacy for sure. You know. But they already gave it up, didn't they? Well, that's the thing. So you talk a lot about like, you know, this organic thing. It's almost like, if you think about like generational change happens so fast now, you see that with like, I see it with my mom and my niece. So her granddaughter, they are almost like a different species. They are almost two different, you know, they are two different creatures. Like their values, their vision of the world, their reaction, the screen versus, yeah, exactly. And I think younger generations have a very different concept of privacy. So I'm an old man. I'm an old man like, oh, my privacy. And younger kids are like, who fucking cares about the old man? Yeah. Like we grew up with Facebook and, you know, like we've got Twitter, we're over sharing, you know, we don't, like my mom is terrified when I got Facebook in high school and like, you know, your job interviews in the future, you know, watch what you're putting on your Facebook, you know, you don't want to, you know, like relax mom, like, but we have a different concept of privacy and that change is, that's what happens fast. That happens fast. Yeah. It's cultural. It's a cultural idea that just, you know. You know what the term apocalypse means, translates into literally lifting of the veil. It means lifting of the veil. Cool. And so. The singularity is the great veil and the, so Kurzweil's vision of this thing past the great curve, that's the apocalypse. I actually, you know what, one of the, one of the weird ways that I came to be at Singularity University, I'll admit this, when I was in college, I was fascinated by the Mayan 2012. And, you know, not in the way of like, oh, I'm going to sit by the clock and wait for the world. It's not going to end. You know, it's going to blow up. But the idea that there's this concept of like an end time, you know, and that's true of almost every sort of culture or religious, you know, concept, there's this idea of end times. And I think it may be a misinterpretation. It's not end times where it's over. It's this like shift. And I'm totally fascinated by the idea that, you know, we are, it seems to be humanity is going through this some kind of, some kind of something new. I mean, it's fundamentally different than whatever the last, you know, four billion years of organic life on this planet where change was caught, was defined by, you know, trial and error over, you know, hundreds of millions of years where, you know, humanity sprung up. And if you were to look at planet earth, you know, or actually, if you were to look at the universe from some vantage point, you would have literally seen a pop and just old skyscrapers, airplanes, iPhones, like literally a pop just out of nowhere. And that, that is exponential growth. And that is, that is something that, you know, we are at the, we are at this straight line of something, something new is, is, is coming and Isn't that amazing? Isn't that amazing? I am sitting in NASA. I'm in a, I'm in a, I'm in NASA right now at Singularity University. And you are among a group, a group of some of the smartest people on earth, probably, who have identified this event. You've identified it. You don't know for sure. I wouldn't call it an event. I mean, we, we don't, we don't subscribe to this idea that there's this techno, this, this Singularity, this event. It's, it's, it's a trend. It's the, what's true. I mean, it's, it's, it's this acceleration, this, you know, I wouldn't, I don't know if I could call it an event. Let's not call it an event. A series of tiny little events leading up to something that we don't, that we can't see beyond. Yeah. I would even say that like, you know, Kurzweil Singularity is in 2045, right? I would say there are Singularities way before that. We, we, I cannot tell you what the world will look like in 10 years. And if you're the CEO of a company, if you're, you know, a college student trying to figure out what the study in school that's going to be relevant, I could not tell you what the world is going to look like in 10 years. And that, we are in the, this is the first time in human history, maybe, you know, maybe that's not true, but I would say probably for the first time in the scope of human history where I cannot tell you what the world will look like in 10 years. Well, I mean, we can play around with it. Let's try to figure it out. Yeah. Yeah. Let's look at the technologies and let's play around with the toys. Yeah. Let's get into it. We'll go through what you just showed me on this grand tour that you gave me. So I got this tour of Singularity University. They have everything that I want here. They have, they have a 3D, an entire laboratory of 3D printers of all shapes and sizes. They have scanners that they could, that they put around my body and like 3D scan me. Theoretically, I could be printed out on one of these printers. They've got robots. They've got those rolly guys. Yeah. So those are, those are, so the Beam Robotics. So it's a telepresence robotic. So basically imagine, you know, an iPad on wheels that lets you remotely control this robot, which physically lets you be in other places. So this robot, as we were talking, came up behind and scared the shit out of me. You turn around and there's just a pole with a tablet on the top and a guy's face is there who, the look on his face is the look of someone who enjoys scaring people with this thing. Then he was able to roll backwards and shut a drawer and then he rolled away. Yeah. This is real life. This is actually happening. They have, they have drones. They have an area dedicated to drones. They have some new. Yeah. So those, that's actually new to me too, with that, you literally the first day that we've gotten those. Those goggles. Those are called the Meta space, space glasses or space goggles. So it's an augmented reality platform where you basically the idea, you wear these glasses and it projects some image in front of you that you can manipulate and you can interface with. So those. Like the Tron, or the, yeah, what's it called? The Iron Man. It's like the Iron Man way he manipulates stuff. Right. Yeah. That's the vision of it. Yeah. Yeah. Augmented reality, it's theoretically, and I don't know because I've never tried it, but it's probably like the HoloLens, the Microsoft HoloLens, that you can Google search that and see what that's going to look like, but it's augmented reality. So we're looking at augmented reality, 3D printing and flying robotics and non-flying robotics. So probably one, so we, we're sitting right now in a mist of data. Right? Yeah. Like around us right now is just data, just floating, all this data is floating in the air that my phone can suck that data out, interpolate it in certain ways. It creates maps, photographs, emails and texts, right? Yeah. So augmented reality is another way to suck that data out of the air. You know what I just thought of too? You know what's that? You know what's crazy about augmented reality, I just thought of it. So if you think about like human, human, a human being really has five ways to get information into its brain. Right. We have, you know, sight, smell, touch, taste. I always forget that one too. Hearing. Do I say smell? Oh, sound. Sound. Sight, sound. Sight, smell. There's five. How do we not know the fives? It's a city with five gates and I always forget the gates. Sight, sound, smell, taste, touch. Yeah. There we go. Boom. So if we're, so if a human is an Xbox controller, we have five buttons, what, so that's, that, you know, and this is also what's crazy, just take one of those inputs like vision. If you were to take, one of our faculty talks about this, if you were to take symbolically the entire electromagnetic spectrum and lay it out from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean, the visible light, the band of visible light that humans can perceive would make up two feet from here. So we, we're blind. Like we are swimming in this universe of data and a human being is blind. Like we take in nothing. And so what augmented reality does is it, you know, imagine having, you know, infrared you go, you base technology is this tool which empowers us to perceive, like throw a flashlight on these, this part of the universe that we otherwise would never perceive or never, you know, be able to get that information into our, into our brains. And it just enhances our, you know, going back to what we're talking about. We're already cyborgs, but yeah. So augmented reality is huge. Yeah. It's going to be a major trend. So okay. So augmented reality from what I saw from the Microsoft demo. It is, it can scan a room. It can drop Minecraft on a table, put Minecraft in the wall. It can eradicate the wall in your desk and transform it into Mars. So you're looking at over Mars. So that is already in existence. I read an, an Ars Technica review of it. They say that that's exactly what it can do. Have you seen the magic leap? Have you read about? Have you read about it? I've read about it. Oh, it's so this, okay. So I would say for me personally, I'm, I'm fascinated by the implications of virtual reality and, and augmented reality to an extent, but so, so magic leap is a, so they're still kind of the stealthy company there. They, they made big splash in the news. They just raised $500 million from Google, um, which is a lot of money to, that's a lot of money for a startup. Holy crap. And no one really knows what they're doing, but their patents were just, their patent images are available. So essentially what it seems like they're doing is they've created a way using, and I am going to butcher the technical terms, but essentially refracted light. Uh, so basically in an oculus rift to, to create the, the illusion of depth, your right eye sees something slightly different than your left eye and that in your brain is interpreted as, uh, depth. So that's how depth perception, but if, but in real life, you know, if you stare at your hand and behind it, you know, there's a, your, your eyes are focusing differently on things in different ways. And so they've solved. But magically, essentially it seems like they've done, have solved that problem. One of the sort of tall tales that I think, I mean, I don't see why this couldn't be true. The way they raised their money is when the investors walked into the room, they had two cups of coffee sitting on the table. One was a real cup of coffee and one was, was the augmented projection of one and they said, pick up the cup of coffee. But the investors must have been wearing a helmet. Yeah, exactly. So there's glasses involved, but they couldn't tell the difference, but they couldn't tell the difference. Holy shit. That's crazy. Like that is, that is, I mean, we, we could be sitting in a room and like a, like, you know, a flock of duck sized porcelain walks around. We could be watching the revolutionary war, like on this table that's it, like that looks real. Like that is, that's the future. That's the future. That's what blows my mind. That's the future. And in 10 years, what we're looking at is some form of wearable technology that the majority of people are going to have on that is creating a world populated by avatars, by digital beings enhanced with artificial intelligence. There will be living in this augmented reality. This is, I'm theorizing here. I love it. They're living in this augmented reality. They are going to, there will be autonomous artificial intelligence holograms that are working from major corporations that you can decide to tune into. So if you're walking down the street, you might get a visit by the Burger King cat. He's like, why don't you come get a burger? If you want it, you don't have to have it, but it's there for you. If you want it, the world comes alive with new, now your tweets aren't in your phone. Now your tweets are flying down and landing on your shoulder. So, oh yeah. So isn't it kind of like this? And then I'll let you, the person who works at NASA, tell me what actually is going to happen. Here's this liminal space between what isn't and what is, and that liminal space is the space of imagination, the space of thoughts, the space of, right? And that liminal space is technology is the spindles through which it is beginning to emerge into the dimension that we're currently existing in. And so 3D printers are going to start using that space into this world. Augmented reality is going to project the space into our minds and all of this is going to be facilitated by robots flying around and making deliveries for us as we exist in this animated mist of technology. Yeah, so what's happening, what technology seems to be doing is it's reducing the lag time between a thought, which, you know, a thought is a thing. I mean, thoughts are things and instantiating that and creating that in the physical world. And it used to be true that there was such a barrier to working with these technologies that if I have an idea, it's going to be very difficult for me to actually create that. But with 3D printing, with these virtual environments that are just, it's just software, just lines of code, we can literally almost just think things into existence. And the lag time, the lag time to do that is just evaporating before our eyes. And that, you know, that is, you know, really, really cool. Let's talk about that lag time. How long would it take 20 years ago for me to create a tiny miniature photo realistic version of my head? Yeah, you're looking at, you know, you got to go to the hardware store, you're going to have to go to the, I don't know, the library, walk literally to a building where there are stacks of like pieces of paper that, you know, you have to pull out and study how to actually like modify these, you know, there's no Google, so you can't just like pull up how to manufacture these things. You got to find what the right materials are. You got to figure out what kind of paint to use. You got to figure out, you know, how to get the texturing, you know, it's that, you know, you're looking at a, that sounds like a nice summer project, honestly, like maybe years. And how long now? How long now? Literally, I mean, we literally just like 20 minutes ago, you take, I mean, you could take an Xbox Kinect or one of these devices, digitize yourself, I mean, there are apps you can download where you literally just take a few photographs of something and it will create a digital image and you can just print that using one of these 3D printers. And how long does the printing take? It takes a couple hours. So one summer, two hours, one summer to two hours. Yeah. And then where in 10 years can you predict how much faster 3D printing is going to be? So I don't know, 3D printing is, you know, 3D printing is one of those vards predicts, you know, everyone asks the question, you know, when are we all going to have 3D printers in our house? You know, I think the, where 3D printing is really accelerating right now is the material science behind it. So what you can actually print and the resolution and the complexity and the sort of multi materials that you could embed together. So yeah, I mean, I don't know, it's something like that is, you know, I don't know how quick, how fast 3D printers are going to be, you know, 10 years from now. But I do think that what we will see is we'll live in a world where if I want a pair of, you know, let's say some company that I like, I like Nike shoes, there's going to be some like corner store that has all the authorized Nike materials that, you know, I want to design, you know, Duncan Trestle right foot for my right shoe, like Duncan Trestle left foot that's personalized, you know, I don't want size nine and nine, nine and 10. I want like holy personalized for my feet. I don't want, you know, some size nine, size 10, I like these colors. I want that. I want this material. And there'll be some shop that has all those materials in stock where it'll, it'll just spit out, you know, a pair of Duncan Trestles. And as you're driving to the shop, your augmented reality goggles are going to, they'll be like a Falcon mascot associated with that shop flying in front of your car. Hurry. Well, maybe the car that takes you there is like the Nike car that, you know, you're not driving. So, you know, the Nike experience car is going to show you all the, you know, it's like a showroom where you can pick out the materials and, you know, this is, this, this blew my mind last week. This is crazy. So in Uber, so the car sharing platform, there's a, there's a driver in Uber who was just covered in, I don't know, Forbes or something. He made $300,000 last year driving for Uber because what he did is he basically put up, so he has a business. He's a jewelry. He creates jewelry. He's essentially like, has jewelry stuff on his dashboard and he has a catalog on his front seat. He doesn't ever solicit business, but if someone asks him, Hey, what's all that jewelry about? He tells him, Oh, Hey, I'm a, you know, I have a side business. I make, you know, I make jewelry. So he's, his car is his showroom. That is his business. That's badass. And that's the future of driverless cars too is badass. You know, these cars, you know, the, you're, you're going to get in a car that's going to, you know, I don't have time to get a haircut. I'm just going to have the hair, you know, the, the supercuts cars going to come pick me up or like, you know, the old spice car is going to have, you know, give you a free ride to San Francisco, but we're going to, you know, tell you about all these great products while we take you there. You know, it's going to be, you know, that's, that's where this could, could go. That's where it's going. That's where it's going. That's crazy. So it's autonomous drones delivering as things, driverless cars that have merged with shops that we ride through as we're getting sales pitches for stuff. If we want it, if you want it, you know, maybe you want to take a nap. So you get like a nap car that comes and picks you up or nap car. Yeah. Oh, please. Yeah. That is so cool. Yeah. So, um, so I think one of the, the one technology when I think we, we definitely touched on this when we were walking through the lab, virtual reality. I mean, the Oculus Rift right now is like the baby infancy of, of where VR is really going to take us. Like we are creating, think about what, so, so Kurzweil's whole point of what is an exponential technology, anything that is based in information, anything that's powered by data or powered by softwares, ones and zeros becomes subject to these exponential explosive, you know, in the world of film photography, you know, every photograph you take is an incremental addition to, to the inventory of all photographs that exist. But once we moved it to a digital substrate, you know, there's no marginal cost to every new photo. So the environment explodes. You've got, you know, more photos being uploaded to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram today than all film photographs that were ever taken. That is what happens when you digitize something and think about what VR does. VR essentially takes experience of reality and makes it digit, it's becoming software. So the cost of you going to the Eiffel Tower with your girlfriend or, you know, going to the Grand Canyon or, you know, one of the crazy stories I heard was there was a, there was a patient who was diagnosed with throat cancer, she was put in hospice care and all she wanted to do was go, you know, I think she wanted to go to the Taj Mahal or something. So they had software developers create a version where she could experience what it was like to go visit the Taj Mahal. And so we'll be able to, you know, create these realities that we wanted to live in. Yeah. That's incredible. That's for sure. And then also not to mention the, the, this massive, the other thing that you, you talked about or it was on, it was on one of the, around Singularity University, these beautiful depictions of ideas and philosophies and data. I don't know what you described. Yeah. So the others in our, in our executive program are, are, we have an animator who live while she's listening to the talk, she's incredible. I don't know how she's, she's very talented. She will live draw the talks in a visual, capture the, in a visual way, what the speaker is actually talking about. So we have all these big murals for each lecture from, from the sessions. Yeah. And you, God, dammit, I'm trying to think of the exact wording of the mural and now it's escaping me. Do you remember, do you remember the subjects? Ah, crap. The topic. The topic was shit, man. I'm sorry. You have really tap danced all over my brain just now. So I'm sort of like, I'm lost now in this future world that we're headed in the direction of. So I might have to skip that point that I was making, but the, the, oh yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. The, this massive amount. Okay. Future robots. So written, written there is this idea. Yeah. They're robots or, or technology in the future or time traveling robots. Yes. Okay. So, yeah. So this is, this is just a concept. So that, so the session that this subject comes up is in the privacy. We have a whole, we have a whole in our, in our executive program, we do these sessions on, you know, the implication, the societal implications, you know, we have an ethics panel, we talk about what are the ethical concerns, the regulatory concerns. One of the sessions we do is around privacy, you know, how do we think about privacy going forward? So one of the, one of the points that the facilitator makes in his, in his presentation is that all of, all of the things that we're doing today is being captured and stored, you know, every, every tweet you put out, all the Facebook posts, every time you do a Google search, all the, the stuff you're buying, you know, all of that, you know, every time you walk in front of a security camera, you know, that's, if that's being stored, you know, in the future, there, there could hypothetically be some, you know, artificial intelligence algorithm that can basically mine all of that data, apply facial recognition, understand, oh, that's Duncan Trestle from, you know, 20 years ago, and basically know things about you, things we're doing today. So things that we're doing today that we don't have the technological capabilities to make sense of in the future, we may have, you know, an AI system or data, data science has evolved to a point where we can actually look back on things that we're doing today and make, you know, judgment or, you know, understand things that are happening. Perhaps you could get arrested for crimes, you committed, there aren't even crimes yet. Just based on this, just based on this, this, so it's, it's sort of like all this data is a kind of, what were you called? You called it a, what did you call it? It's a, it's like, anyway, I think of it as like clay. It's like, it's like the Potter's clay being harvested at this time or harvesting all this digital clay that technology gets to chop up in any way it wants to chop it up just based on whatever you want. If I've got your, you know, like the health data, you know, if I've got your tracking your health data from the last five years, I can visualize it in any way that I want. If I, if, if I'm somehow, you know, and this technology doesn't exist yet, but if there's some way that I'm constantly recording myself in 3D space as I'm walking through my life, and I could take the actual weird human snake that's created from all my movement, you know, like a map, like this is the idea that if you were to look at you from the time that you were a baby to right now, you could visualize that moving through time as a kind of snake, a kind of thing connected that's like, starts as a little baby and grows and grows and grows and becomes a, an adult and then grows and becomes an old man. And it's actually moving through space and time. And so it's every movement that you've ever had would create a geometric pattern that you could, if you had a 3D printer, you could theoretically shrink down every movement that you made and have this weird snake-like thing rolling through your life. That could exist. I know that sounds crazy. No, you know, I don't know if this is what you're talking about, but I've always, I've heard really smart people like theoretical physicists talk about this concept. I've never been able to wrap my mind around, I don't know if you have an opinion on this. Basically the idea that all time is existing simultaneously at once, is that kind of what you're describing? Yeah, for sure. Like, I can't get my, you know, we don't understand the structure of how this universe operates, but basically like time is an illusion created in our own minds and we're starting to understand the mechanics of how that works. We're definitely not close to there yet, but basically there's evidence to suggest that, you know, in some weird way, all time is happening simultaneously at once and that, I don't know. And that's a lot of data, isn't it? That's a lot of data. And if all time is happening at once, then all data already exists. But to get back to this idea of like constantly recording all this information, so we're looking at a, we're not just looking at a spindle outputting things, we're looking also at a drain that's sucking things in. Where technology is sucking in, it's vacuuming up data and it's storing it. And that stored information is just sitting there and we don't know how it's going to be used. We don't know what the future robots are going to be doing with it, but isn't it safe to say that the woman's visit to the Grand Canyon is only going to become more and more realistic as technology advances? So it won't just be going to a Grand Canyon and seeing this sort of, you know, I don't know what version, if they use video or what they use for that. Yeah, I don't know. It was some kind of CGI. It's like, yeah, it's computer graphics. So it's computer graphics and, but we're looking at that, that all this data that's being stored is going to be able to, is going to be used to create virtual periods in time, right? Where you, you're going to be able to put on virtual reality goggles and travel backwards in time. Yeah. So that's actually, you know, think about imagining being able to like Google search your life. Like Google search. There was actually, there was, there was a, you know, one of the, so I hope they don't mind mention one of our, one of our more, one of our partners, there was an NBA athlete. He plays, he plays in the NBA. I won't say which one, but he was his agent who came to visit Singularity University a couple of years ago, you know, wanted to explore the idea using technologies like Google Glass and, you know, these recording technologies, you know, record his progress as an athlete. You know, so he's, he was entering into his rookie year and looking at what is, you know, his skill sets were then, and then, you know, track his progress so that, you know, 10 years from now when he's still in the league, he could look back on and look at, you know, where I've progressed from to where I am now. And there are people looking at actually trying to, to, to do something along those lines. But that's such a cool concept that like, you know, imagine being able to like, oh, like I told that funny joke and everyone laughed and like, well, I want to re-experience what that was like. Bring that joke up. That joke was not funny. I was drunk. Yeah. Like, you could just like, go back to that and like be there and then like, experience it. Put in the temporal, all you need is the temporal coordinates, pop those things in whatever you're doing at that time. You can either relive it, you can have it, you can have it written out into text if you wanted to. Like, could you print out what I said seven hours ago between 230 and 245? So I can absolutely make sure that I was being as much of an asshole as I thought I was. You're going to be able to do that. And then, but not only that, but something we'll be able to analyze all that data and be like, oh, here is what your personality is like. Yeah. We're going to create an AI based on your behavior patterns. And now you can have a little version of you living in an augmented reality aquarium where you can watch an AI version of yourself live a life too. That's, I mean, that's fascinating. I mean, the idea that we're going to be creating. Crazy to think that that's possible. Not at all. I actually, so here's, to go back to one of, so one occurs a while is more long term predictions. Predictions is, you know, beyond the, in his term, the technological singularity, what happens is, you know, we impregnate the universe with intelligence, you know, all matter becomes subject to computation and we, you know, we actually, you know, the universe becomes this giant data processing center. I actually disagree with him on that point. You do. I do disagree with him. And this is, I think what you just highlighted, I think, addresses that. I'm curious. Are you familiar with the concept of the Transcension Hypothesis? No. So basically, the Transcension Hypothesis tries to address what's called Fermi's Paradox, which, so, yeah, so Fermi's Paradox basically, you know, asks the question, you know, if the universe, which it seems to be structured in such a way that it's, it's designed to support life. It's, you know, we're discovering this every day, you know, more and more of these, you know, these planets that are in these habitable zones where life could be supported. The universe, you know, is likely teeming with, with life, you know, it's just designed, it's designed to support that. So the question is, why don't, you know, if that's the case, you know, intuition and math would say that for human beings on planet Earth to be the most advanced civilization makes no sense. Like we, we should see evidence, like there's no reason we would be the top of the pyramid, you know, at the, the edge of, of progress, but we don't see any evidence of that. You know, we don't see spaceships, we don't see, you know, aliens colonizing our moon and like taking up, you know, they don't come to, you know, take our oil back to their home planets. We don't see it. So Fermi's Paradox asks this question, why, why is that? So the Transcension Hypothesis is, is an attempt at answering that, that question, which basically says that as a, as a species or some entity progresses, eventually instead of colonizing outer space, you know, colonizing outer spaces is really maybe the sort of the earliest stages of their, their first steps at becoming an advanced civilization. But at some point what they actually start doing is colonizing inner space, these virtual spaces. And what happens is you compress, you know, computational, these computational environments, you know, we see, you know, computers that were once the size of buildings, you know, now fit in our pocket, you know, extrapolate that into the future, you know, in 25 years, a computer the size of a blood cell, you know, eventually will become so infinitesimally small that you could theoretically house these computational environments that could, could house all of the data processing that, you know, we see in this world, and eventually we don't, we don't go outward, we, we vanish into these, you know, these virtual realities. We get, we get digitized, we get digitized, we go, we go data. Wow. Oh my God. Thank you so much for this conversation. This is amazing. It's so kind of you to invite me up to Singularity University and to get to hang out with you. It really has been a pleasure. Thank you. No, this was super cool. I, you know, it's amazing to be sitting across the table from you. You know, I, I think the message that you put out into the world, this open-ended curiosity that you're, that you're after is beautiful and amazing. Thank you. So I'm, you know, very, very cool to, to have you here. Thank you, brother. How can people get in touch with you? Yeah. So if people are curious to know more about Singularity University, it's just SingularityU.org. And then we also have a, if people want to, you know, keep up with all of these technological trends. It's called Singularity Hub, so they can keep up with what are the, you know, the latest breakthroughs. I'm on Twitter at AFrank26, but yeah, beyond that, you know, people can get in touch with me directly through the Singularity website, but yeah, check it out. Thank you. I hope you'll come back on. For sure. Okay. Love to have you back here. Awesome. Thank you, brother. Thanks for listening. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer.
320^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 556: The Leather Rose #15 Transcript and Discussion^2023-03-13^Greetings, pals. It's me, Duncan, and this is the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast. I gotta ask you, I'd love to hear from y'all. Do you ever have like days where it seems like none of your electronic equipment works, like suddenly your studio, your office just turns into the Bermuda Triangle, like whatever distance star your quantum entangled with has gotten sucked into a black hole or something? Because that just happened to me. It's not just like one thing starts breaking down, everything starts breaking down, completely unrelated systems. There's like a contagion that spreads. Suddenly your speakers go down, but then your computer goes down, but then your phone isn't connecting to the internet. You look down at your feet, they're curled up into quivering vulture talons. How did that happen? Why have my feet transformed into vulture talons? And then you remember, oh shit, that's just my feet. I'm 48 with gross feet. Then you think to yourself, man, I'm so lucky that I'm not attracted to my own feet, because that'd be really weird if I was like suckling at my feet, if I curled up into a ball and just started sucking at my feet if ever I wanted to have some kind of satisfaction. And then you remember, oh fuck, I have ADHD, which is why I'm thinking that. And then you go back to trying to fix your systems, your multiple system failure, but then somewhere in the midst of that, you get the idea for setting up a tertiary camera so that when you do get your situation fixed, you'll now have three cameras running, even though you can't make two work. That just happened to me. But lucky for me, I pulled myself out of whatever that particular nosedive was, and I'm now recording the intro. So hello. Now this is an experimental episode of the DTFH. I've been working with Johnny Pemberton on a little side project called The Leather Rose. And I really love recording these things with him. This is absurd. It's ridiculous. And it's super funny. And I really would love it if you would consider subscribing to the Leather Rose podcast, which you can find on all streaming services. I won't tell you too much more about what it is. I'll let you attempt to figure out exactly what it is by listening. And I hope you enjoy it and don't mind that this isn't a traditional DTFH, though we do have some wonderful episodes coming your way. Also, if you love Johnny Pemberton and you should, won't you subscribe to his Twitch. It's twitch.tv forward slash Johnny Pemberton. Also, don't forget to check out Johnny's awesome podcast, Live to Tape. He's got tons of new episodes. Subscribe to that. Two more things to plug and then we'll dive in to this special episode of the DTFH. One, I'm going to be in Vegas at Wise Guys this upcoming weekend, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. That's going to be the 16th, 17th and 18th of March. I hope you will come and see me. And also finally, if you want commercial free episodes of the DTFH, you can go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and find everything you need there. You'll get access to our thriving discord community. You will be able to hang out with us twice a week at our family gatherings and our wonderful meditations. And most importantly, you will connect with one of the most powerful collectives of human beings living on the planet today, your family who miss you very much. I want to see you and gently rub their fingers through your hair, patreon.com forward slash DTFH. And now everybody sit back and allow yourself to be scrapped all over by the leather rose. You are listening to the leather rose, an exploration of the mysteries of the universe. Join us now as we unravel the secrets of time. Howdy, howdy everybody. You are listening to the leather rose. My name is Dipper Daniels and I'm currently in for Davis Grimley, your regular host. Davis got way late. He's actually serving a very short sentence for a delayed contempt of court charge back in 1995 when he had a summon still appear for a land dispute. So I'm in for our boy Davis Grimley. Again, I'm Dipper Daniels. You are listening to the leather rose. We have a great program for you here today. We've got something really useful for all you homeowners out there. Maybe you're in a landlord, maybe you own some property and the wintertime is coming hard and it's coming fast. So we've got an insulation expert, an expert on keeping what you got inside to stay inside and keeping what's out from getting in. Here he is today, his first time on leather rose. Please welcome Randy Reed Rose. Randy, how you doing? Thank you. I'm great. I'm busy, but I'm great. That's good. Busy is good and good is busy. When you're in my business and you have what's happening, happening, then you are not going to stop working folks. This is a class seven winter weather event and it's not going to stop right now. We are experiencing across the Northeast, the Atlantic, parts of the younger Crescentrias area outside of Tennessee, what is known as a ice flipper. And these things happen every 500 years and they hit hard, they hit fast and you need to make sure that your home is protected from the elements. What is an ice flipper? Is it called that because it's so cold the ice flips around? That's what I've heard. It's like the ice will flip around. Yeah, hold on a minute. Maybe we lost it there a bit. Sorry, I lost your honor there. It wasn't your question. I lost it ice flipping around. She's a great starter question, but please, what were you saying? I'm just wondering what that means because I've heard that it means something where the ice is so cold that when ice touches other ice, it's like that's too cold. Oh yeah, the ice divorces itself essentially. It's like an intense divorce with itself, the super compressed hydrogen and oxygen atoms. They start having mild disagreements and they develop super resentments for each other. They then try to separate and in that separation creates the kinetic activity that people assume is the reason for the name ice flipper. In fact, this is not why it's called an ice flipper. Though you are correct and when it gets a certain temperature, the ice starts acting weird. It's called an ice flipper because many people believe that the Leather God, Lord Exnar, has flippers and an ice flipper. An ice flipper is when that Leather God comes and just starts spanking the ass of planet Earth with that cold, cold flipper. So it's like a pinball machine on overdrive. It's like a pinball machine smacking into your ass and that pinball machine is made of nitrogen and is colder than the surface of... A place that's cold. Triton. Oh, that's a moon, isn't it? Yeah, the moon triton. The moon triton, okay. That's right. Sorry about that. By the way, I forgot to put twos based on my wires, which is one of the many things that you can do to keep your podcasting, vlogging, Instagram, video games, streaming, stream from going down during this weather. So that could be the first step for you. If you are a streamer, if you are an influencer, if you are somebody who is working your way up the top of that algorithmic ladder, then you don't want to be offline for more than 10, 20, 30 seconds or you're gone. Let me ask you this. Remember, what's the algorithm? What is that? The algorithm is an artificial intelligence program that helps serve content to people based on their proclivities. So if let's say you're into Jack Reacher novels as I am, then you're going to get on Netflix a lot of wonderful suggestions about other things you might like. And that's the algorithm. We know a lot of the algorithm. It keeps us entertained. But there ain't going to be no algorithm if you don't have power. So I want to talk a little bit and walk you through some of the things you could do to keep the warm air inside your house and the cold air outside. Okay. Let me ask you, I got a couple myths here as the listener sent in. Are these myths or are myths? Like M-Y-T-H-S myths. Okay, myths. Myths. Okay. So these are possible or not myths. So you got to tell me, is this a myth or is this a real? Is this a real or is this a myth? These are all listeners sent in. Listener A says a way to get extra warm in the winter is to pee, he said piss, but I'm saying pee, to piss in the walls from the attic around your bathroom. So you piss into the walls, soak in the walls between the walls from the attic. You pee in there and that's what you do by the bathroom. Yeah, that is not a myth. That's not a myth. Okay. That technique has saved so many lives, so many people, when it gets very, very cold and the power goes out, they panic, they panic. And what's the first thing you do when you panic? I usually have to take a shit, but whenever I poop, I do have to pee when I pee. There you go. Thank you Rocket Money for supporting the DTFH. Listen, if you're like me, then you might be afraid to look at your bank account balances, your credit card bill, or you might be a little too busy to spend time figuring out all the weird shit you've subscribed to. Try it for 30 days. Sure, that sounds fun. I'll try it for 30 days. I want to identify stones. I want to identify rocks around me. Why wouldn't anyone want to know exactly what type of geological formations were around their house? $40 a month to identify rocks. I'll definitely cancel that subscription and just get it for free for 30 days. Catalog, identify all the rocks around my house and then cancel the subscription. You forget within two days. You haven't scanned a single rock and then it builds up over time. And then you have multiple apps that you have subscribed to and forgotten about. And you're wondering what's going on. I really thought I had more money than this. The reason you don't have that much money is because you are hemorrhaging cash, like some kind of sad elk shot by a digital arrow in a simulated forest. Just spraying your sweet, sweet dollars all over the internet. Because you thought it would be cool to know exactly how far away from your house your car is using some app that scans distances. Or maybe you saw that app that says it can count sticks. And you were like, that would be cool. I would love to know exactly how many sticks are in my yard. The point being, Rocket Money will save you from yourself. Rocket Money, formerly known as True Bill, is a personal finance app that finds and cancels your unwanted subscriptions, monitors your spending and helps you lower your bills all in one place. It is amazing. I don't know if you do that thing where you're like, okay, I'm going to do a budget now. And then you go look at your credit score in one place and then you go and look at your spending in another place. And then you go and try to manage your money in another place. Rocket Money does it all for you in one wonderful place. It's easy to let it do its thing. It's almost like having your own personal business manager. It's an amazing bit of technology. And I really hope you'll try it out. Over 3 million people have used Rocket Money, saving the average person up to $720 a year. I'm definitely not the average person. Way more. Give it a try. It's wonderful. And I'm telling you once you get past that initial, like, I don't know if I want to see what's going on with the credit cards in the bank account and see where your spending is and realize, holy shit, just by using the app, I've canceled a bunch of subscriptions I never use. It pays for itself. So stop throwing your money away. Cancel unwanted subscriptions and manage your expenses the easy way by going to rocketmoney.com slash Duncan. That's rocketmoney.com slash Duncan. Rocketmoney.com slash Duncan. Thanks Rocket Money. What's the first thing you do when you panic? I usually have to take a shit. Whenever I poop, I do have to pee when I panic. There you go. There you go. So for me when I panic, I just instantly become impotent and everything comes out poop and pee. Why? Why? Why? From the perspective of evolutionary biology over the millennia that we have evolved into the superior creature on our planet. Why is it that when we panic, we piss and shit ourselves if it doesn't serve some purpose? And that purpose, bless you, is that urine and poop or poo poo is some call it. These contain within them some crucial survival materials and urine specifically contains uric acid. Uric acid. Now, Eurose was the god of the erotic. Eurose. Eurose. Euron. Fault. You can connect the dots there and you get turned on. What happens? When you get aroused, you get hot. Exactly. That's why you say I'm all hot and bothered. It's getting hot in here, so take off all your clothes. There you go. That's a song. My daughter plays that song all the time. And it's a way to remember how to survive if the power goes out and you are in a place that's cold. You do the thing that God evolved us to do, which is you can open your attic if you have an attic. If you don't have an attic, I recommend using a ball peen hammer. Okay. Even if these are at lows or Home Depot to hammer holes into the walls of every bedroom. And then you can start off with a layer of poop. If you're panicking even better. So make sure those holes are low enough so you don't have to go up on a ladder to deliver the package. And then once you've delivered package brown, then after that, layer upon that coat of urine. If you have dogs, if you have cats. I've got six dogs. Then you, my friend, that's better than having a generator. You get your dogs to urinate. The good news with dog urine is you just need a little bit of urine on the holes and then they'll do the rest. Because when they smell pee, they make pee. And so then they'll begin to fill those up with urine. Now, a lot of people think that that's the end of it. Once you've delivered the brown package and layered upon it urine that you stop, you do not stop. Try to produce a little more poop and make that the second layer above the layer of urine. These will produce a kind of thermal sandwich, which will generate as much heat as a giant fireplace in the castle of a beautiful king. So I should eat like a bunch of cheese cracker or something that's going to create a thick, hearty bolus that will come out. It's something that's got a lot of contingency and weight. It's going to really stick together. You want to come out in like a stream. You want to come out in like a big sort of a ball of sorts. There's a lot of controversy regarding this point, which is what shape of you want your bolus to be. But in this case, because we're really just bottom line dealing with chemical reactions, it's more mass and shape. So the more you can produce, the more heat you're going to generate. And you know, it comes down to you don't need to be walking around every room of your house during an emergency. If there's a room that you find to be the most comfortable, then I would recommend smashing the wall with your hammer in that room and then that can be what your heat room. That's the saying grab a gun, stick to one. Yep, there you go. I'm to think I thought this was a myth. I thought it truly was a myth. Number two question, myth or real? This is myth or real. Take this from listener J. Listener J says, my granddad told me whenever it gets super hot out parentheses over 100 Fahrenheit, take an old pair of Dongarees, preferably of a large size. Fill them with birdseed and drape the legs off each side of the roof. The gable of the roof, this will attract ducks and the ducks will just go go crazy, he says. Is that a myth or is that a real? You've got some smart collars that is not a myth. That is real. That is known as a chill crow, actually. Chill crows were used all over the American Midwest during the many droughts and heat waves that they experienced. If you were to go through any small town in the old west, you would always see Dongarees filled with birdseed and then the only part of that that I think maybe with all due respect to our elders, his grandfather may have misspoke a little bit. The ducks aren't going crazy, though it may seem like that. What the ducks are doing is circumambulating the seed filled Dongarees. The reason behind this is when enough ducks create the cyclonic energy necessary to, I'm trying to think of a way to say it in a non-scientific way. When you've got enough ducks moving in a circle around Dongarees, it does two things. One, it softens the seeds. Two, when enough ducks arrive, it will actually cause the Dongarees to be pulled into the funnel of the mini tornado that the ducks have created. And then the seeds will fall through the air like rain and the ducks will eat them. And that's when you put up a new pair of Dongarees. What goes along with this, of course, is a kind of natural avian fan is created and all the heat gets pulled out of your house into that cyclone and actually helps soften the seeds for the ducks. So it's a symbiotic relationship that leads to you feeling cool and the ducks not having upset bellies from eating seeds that are too hard. A lot of people don't know that you need to soften your seeds, whatever you're feeding your ducks. So one of the ducks do with all this heat, that must be hot as heck. Oh, good question. Excellent question. Yeah, well, the ducks, a lot of the heat gets into the seed and that's the softening aspect. And a lot of the heat gets distributed in the cyclone up into the air where it actually connects with the sun. And the sun draws that back in and then distributes it evenly around the landmass that it's directing photo on that. And of course, in the space. So, you know, a lot of these hyper, I don't know what to call them, left is liberals. They live towards. I didn't say it. I don't say it either, but I've heard it said at the grocery store. I didn't say that. Yeah, I've heard it a lot of places. Let's go Brandon. The, the, a lot of these, how do we put it? Let's just say confused people. They seem to be more concerned with the comfort levels of the ducks and with survivability of their own species. So, yeah, on occasion, if you get a particularly frenzied circulation of ducks will one spontaneously combust because the heat was went too much of the heat went into the duck. Could it produce a fireball that cooks it up? Yes, it could. And out of 500,000 ducks will spontaneously combust. And you know what? When that happens, guess what she got on a hot summer's day? I think you got a barbecue on your hand. You got a barbecue. Thank you. You got a barbecue. I like chicken. I bet I like duck. It's delicious. It's delicious. And especially that flavor of meat that has been naturally heated in that way is incredible. In the Midwest, it was considered a delicacy and actually this method of harvesting and cooking ducks was taught to the people of Midwest by the Eskimos. Okay. We're living there in the Midwest during that time. This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. Okay. Maybe this is a little too much information for an ad on a podcast, but when I was living in Asheville, I found this wonderful therapist who was a specialist in a type of therapy called EMDR. And I went in there completely cynical, highly skeptical that this kind of therapy could work. EMDR stands for Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing. But holy Lord in Heaven, it changed my life. And I already was a big proponent of therapy because my mom was a therapist, but to experience the change in literally everything that came from committing to working with this person, it's astounding. If you're thinking of starting therapy, give BetterHelp a try. It's entirely online, designed to be convenient, flexible and suited to your schedule. You just fill out a brief questionnaire to get matched with a licensed therapist and you can switch therapists anytime for no additional charge.

We love you. Let me ask you this, Randy Reed Rose, our guest here on Leather Rose. Does this well kill the dinosaurs? What specifically? I just kind of wondered if maybe you knew. What killed the dinosaurs? Yeah, something we're talking about. Is that what killed the dinosaurs was hate or cold or something like that? They just got too much of a good thing and it just whipped them out. You know, a lot of people, truly we can't really say what killed the dinosaurs. Obviously, there's the idea that a meteor impact caused massive shifts to the biome and then created an incredible die-off. It had been so long ago that we might never know what killed the dinosaurs. Now, as a fan of the Bible, my guess would be what killed the dinosaurs was God. I'm also a fan of the Bible, but I gotta tell you, ever since my kid got under dinosaurs, it reminded me how much I lack dinosaurs a lot. When I look at these pictures of dinosaurs, I'm thinking, these guys are really cool. There's some interesting different kinds. Some eat meat, some don't eat meat, and the ones that don't eat meat have all kinds of protection on them, like spikes. Spikes, scales, club tails. Club tails. And I'm thinking, this is way cooler than the Bible is these cool, deadly lizards. They're huge. I think it's so cool. Well, you know, I don't want to get into theological debate here. I wanted to come on the show and save some lives, but quickly I will say this, that there is a Luciferian agenda on planet Earth in the same way that the early Christians had to disguise themselves, hide themselves, hide their faith to keep from being persecuted, fed to lions, locked up in jail. These days, the Luciferians are doing a similar thing. They do encode their symbols into pretty much everything around you, the logo of Starbucks, the logo of CBS, ABC, you can see it on your dollar bills. The Luciferians actually have a few main principles that they are trying to legislate, that they are trying to enact in various social movements. Essentially, they are anti-natalists. They are trying to remove the authority of the parents from the children. They want to create, they want to move the age of consent to pre-birth, and they, I guess, would like every single person on planet Earth to be in one giant orgasmic all of fucking. So it's just like a dinosaur ethno-state? Yeah, I mean, I think that's one way to put it. You know, if you read Albert's procreation of the dinosaurs, the dinosaurs, and thank God this isn't taught to our children, but the dinosaurs were a very horny lizard, and that's what they all had in common. Do you mean the horny like they want to have sex, or horny like they got a slacks on? The horny like they wanted to have sex, they loved to copulate. Some made meat, some ate vegetation, but one thing they all had in common is they loved cum. They loved eating cum. The dinosaurs loved cum. We shouldn't be saying this on this show. Sorry about that. The dinosaurs loved semen. Seminal fluid. And, you know, imagine the size of a Tyrannosaurus rex. Now imagine the ejaculate from a Tyrannosaurus rex. Now imagine a hundred of them giving each other hand jobs under a stegosaurus. And you have an example of some of the satanic formations, these reptile monstrosities were lining up in those days. If you were a pterodactyl, you would be flying over an orgy of lizards. You would be flying over bubbling, massive calderas of cum with velociraptors who were giving each other rim jobs while the ancient Leviathans were jumping up out of the cum. There were actually dinosaurs that lived in the cum. This is where fish come from. That's why they smell like they do. Okay. I've never heard any of this before and I've read about 10 to 12 dinosaur books. But what I'm thinking now, you mentioned hand jobs and stuff like that. I'm thinking about a T-rex. T-rex has little hands and some of these plant-eaters, they've got tons of sparks on them. I'm thinking two things. One, do these short hands on the Tyrannosaurus rex, is this because the Tyrannosaurus rex is saying, hey, I can't get myself off. I need to engage in an extramarital type of relationship to get my bone off. And possibly these plant-eaters are covered in spikes. They cannot be humped because to get humped would be to kill the thing that's getting humped. Or chafed at the very least. The very least chafing. So what they're also saying is, hey, I can't get it deep. Or I can't give it deep or get it deep. So I need to have a special long-neck dinosaur to do like a suck on me. 100%. Okay, is that what it is? And this is if you really want to understand why the dinosaurs look the way they do, they didn't evolve to kill. They didn't evolve in the normal way that animals think God evolved now, which is that the prey evolves various techniques, camouflage, speed, nesting to avoid the predator. Well, the predator evolves better techniques to get their prey. And the times of the dinosaurs, all they wanted to do was come, and they wanted to come hard. And so they would develop erotic symbiosis with each other. And yes, the long necks of the Brontosaurus, for example, might seem to make no sense. Many idiots out there think that the long necks were to reach the fruit growing from massive trees. This is not the case at all. Those long necks were evolved for one reason and one reason alone. And that was for sucking off T-Rex, Velociraptor, for some of the massive dinosaurs with their big dangling lizard dongs. It's such a long dong. It would drift down and then the Brontosaurus would extend its neck up and just lick and lap at the penises, the dripping hot volvas and clitoris of the Stegosaurus. They had massive clits. This is absolutely fascinating. I did not know any of this. It's a hobby of mine. I'm definitely going to have to take the dinosaur books away from my son, Tripper. He cannot rave these anymore. There are books that don't mention this. Most dinosaur books are not going to find this. If you want, I can give you a list of safe and not safe dinosaur books. Also, we have a listener who sent an email in asking, Randy Reros, can you recommend the top three to five movies to watch around the holidays? Well, this doesn't have much to do with insulating the house. It doesn't, but they asked. For me, the top movie is going to be Werner Herzog's documentary on volcanoes. My family watches that every holiday season. If you're getting some dad time in, I would recommend Crandall Peterson's Blood Lady, which is the seminal CIA thriller about Captain Belvin Meeks and his pursuit of the CIA asset who had been lost in Ecuador. Oh my gosh. I'm waiting for my wife to visit her sister to watch this one. She's cheating on you. The third and I guess the third holiday film that I absolutely love to watch is the Civil War by Kim Burns. Kim Burns. She's incredible. Yeah. She's outstanding. I hear that. I hear tell that Kim Burns might be working on a dinosaur sex documentary. I heard that. I thought I hung wrong. Well, you heard right. That's not a myth. Not a myth. I don't mean to name drop you, but let's just say I'm friends with Kim. And before she met me, I don't think she was aware of the truth behind the dinosaurs. So you broke that egg right open. Well, I read PILDER and I read PILDER. Oh, you read PILDER Kim Burns. I read PILDER Kim Burns. I told her, you know, use the thing. In my line of business, you don't know who you're going to be working with. You might be working with, you know, somebody down the street or you might be getting picked up at an airport in a private plane and flying that plane is Harrison Ford. He flies his own planes. Oh, he's so good. He's so good, but he sure as shit doesn't know how to weather his own. I bet that dumbass doesn't know anything about that. He's too good at acting. I told him when he brought me to his palatial estate that he might as well have moved in to an icebox, because that's what he had going on there. It was cold as cold, communal insulation, nothing. Now, to get back to the new Kim Burns documentary, I've actually seen a sneak peek of certain scenes. Obviously, it's not family friendly. She didn't pull any punches in her depiction of what was going on back then in the Jurassic era. And let me let's just say we'll put two S's in Jurassic because one fascinating thing about the dinosaurs is they loved rim jobs. Dinosaurs loved getting their asses eaten for very long periods of time. Some of the dinosaurs would lay back and have their asses, not literally eaten by the way, but lapped upon by lines of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs knew how to get into lines. They would get into lines just like at one of the graphic movie theaters. That makes so much sense to me because you think about dinosaurs being a very long creature that says, hey, line up. Line up. And they would get in lines and then some would line up and they would go down on the ass of Bronosaurus for a couple of minutes. A couple of minutes, that's it. Well, some came fast. Some dinosaurs, I don't want to call it premature ejaculation because it's just the amount of time it took them to come. So they would go fast and come quick and move on. But some dinosaurs, they would lap upon the anus of the Bronosaurus for months at a time. Wow. Months at a time. Do you know what they ate while they were doing that? How did they survive? Where did they get their energy from? Let me guess. Can I guess? Let me get three guesses. One is leaves, two is sticks, three is meat. Nope. Not leaves, not sticks, not meat. Come. Because the dinosaurs- Oh, God, I knew it. I knew it. The dinosaurs that were next in line or the ones behind them or the ones behind them would be so titillated by watching this rim job go down that they would masturbate into the anus of the Bronosaurus. And then, of course, whichever creature was in line and enjoying that rim job would lap up to come. And this would create the, I guess, what do they call these days, pay it forward? Yeah. The same thing happens in line. Pay it backwards, I guess. It's similar to what happens in lines at Starbucks where you pay for the person behind you. In this case, you as a dinosaur would ejaculate onto the quivering anus of the Bronosaurus receiving the rim job, knowing that when it was your turn, you would be fed pum from those behind you. Wow. Rinky dinky. That is just so special. I hope my son Tripp does not know about this. And if he does, we're going to have to have a long talk before his next baseball game. And folks, real quick, just make sure that you put foam insulation on any copper piping around your house, any hose outlets. You should definitely insulate those. And inside the house, keep a drip of warm water going when it freezes. Because, you know, it's not, a lot of people think it's when the pipes, the water freezes in the pipe. It's what damages them. It's not what damages them. It's when they unfreeze. It's that compression and expansion. It creates the water burst. It can cause so much property damage. So interesting.

The Golden Lion and the Fancy Gentleman Award Greetings, friends. Just to answer some accusations I've been getting, no, the series of bleeps that you just heard is not a CIA mind control beam created by DARPA. Just a series of bloops. I do not get paid by the Defense Department to put those bloops inside my podcast to activate certain agents out there to begin Project Shepherd's Gunt. Begin Project Shepherd's Gunt. All right, here we go, guys. It's time for Mailbag, where I read and respond to emails from the listeners. Mailbag. Dear Duncan, Kyle and Boston, just writing to ask if the series of bleeps and bloops you've been playing at the beginning of this episode are actually a DARPA mind control beam. Can you let me know? Thanks so much, Kyle and Boston. Dear Kyle, the answer to your question is no, and I want you to turn the volume up on your listening device so that you can understand that this, and I'm just gonna play it one more time so everybody can be very clear on the sound that I'm talking about. The following sound is most certainly not a government mind control audio beam. It's just a regular series of bleeps and bloops. I do not work for the CIA. I do not get paid by the Defense Department. That sound is just filler that I decided to throw in to the beginning of this podcast. It is most definitely not activating Agent 49637. Mailbag.

And as you know, if you follow me on Instagram and follow my Insta stories, which I've started doing since I've become friends with Alexi, that I've become obsessed, deeply embarrassingly obsessed with modular synthesizers. And sometimes I stream myself tinkering with these beautiful alien devices. If you wanna really freak out your life, then go to amazon.com and order anything from MakeNoise which is this insane company in Asheville that produces these modular synths. Start with the zero coast. You won't understand it. It is like having some kind of alien technology but something about the sweet bleeps and zings and zoops that the sounds these things make is so soothing.

Does this count as a date? I mean, yeah. I guess this is a form of date. Oh, whatever. You don't have to say that. Don't just say that. Do you think it is? We've already been on dates. This is none of my business. You're just out of relationship. I'm not trying to put you in a corner. I was just being... I was flirting with you. It was a light flirt. Yeah. We can't... So what is... I thought that... If you want this to be a date, it'll be a date. No. Here's what's funny. Here's what's super funny. Are we podcasting now? Yes. Okay. We've both been hanging out now for... A little bit. A few days. A few days. A few hours. But you have a podcast where you're like... And also not only a podcast, you've... An empire. It's an empire. It's something of an empire. I mean, you have been... For years, you've been building this thing. You have this amazing... So this is not a date? What are you saying? What? I'm sorry. I mean, that's the problem, isn't it? It's like, I don't know what it would be. If it's a date, it's a really... I mean, it's a weird date, I guess. Like a... Go on a podcast date. It sounds like some... That's all I do. That is my whole MO of my podcast. I only... All the men on there are just men. I'm trying to... That's actually not true. Hook up with? No, that's actually not true. People... Do you feel like that's going to mess you up in the future that you said this... No. Nobody listens to this, right? What are your numbers? Nobody's... People aren't going to hear this, right? Come on. I'm just kidding. Do you feel... Do you... Do you feel like there's something unethical about that? Like, booking someone? No, I don't do that. I was just fucking around, but... Can we... I don't think you're fucking around. No, but I've had boyfriends who have accused me. They're like, have you fucked every single podcast, you know, guy, guest you've ever had? But you do. You did tell me that you book... That you have booked people on the podcast that you... I was joking. No, I don't think you were. Were you? Yeah, you sound like my jealous ex. How dare you? I don't feel... Can we start this podcast, please? All right, here we go. No, this is still happening. I'm not saying... The problem is though, your level is like too high. Hold on. Oh, because I'm a shrieker. No, keep talking. Hello? I'm shrieking. I'm feeling like, oh my God, no way. I can't believe it. All right, here we go. Oh my God, we're starting again. Yeah, we're starting again. Oh my God, that was good stuff. Do you think that was good stuff? I love it. You're so... I'll tell you, when I watch your Instagram stories and I watch them every single time, immediately one goes up, I have an alert on my phone. I know. They... I would ask if you were jerking off, but then the whole Louis C.K. thing when he was jerking off on the phone with girls and they didn't know it, which is something like... I mean, if it gets to a point where jerking off to Instagram stories is a crime, then I guess 80% of the population of the planet will be in jail. Anyway, what were you going to ask me? Oh my God. Happy Thanksgiving, you guys. Remember, it was good. I can't wait to start this podcast. So, no, I think you do... You have... If we had a pie chart that showed the men who've been on your podcast. Oh my God, Duncan. No. And here, let me just say this really quick. That's a joke. I have not... But what... There is a percentage. Hold on. Let me just say this, because I don't want you to turn into some monster that I'm no longer dating. I had an ex-boyfriend who accused me, he was like, if you fucked every single guy who's ever been on your podcast. And I was like, no. And it's like, I've known you for three days. Why are you talking to me like this? That's none of your business. And then I internalize it so intensely because my blog, my podcast, everything I've ever done in my entire life has kind of ruined my... Any chances of having a good relationship that I internalized that guy saying that about my podcast, my male podcast guest. And I asked my podcast producer, Aristotle, he's not listening, but I asked him. I was like, have I slept with all of my male guests? And we went through all the male guests and I had slept with like three of them who were like... People I was dating at the time. How many male guests have you had? Three. I'm kidding. Can you turn your phone off? God damn it. There's one of them now. Oh my God. You're not even flipping your phone over. I make my guests flip their phone over because I have like a, you know, a screen is like a beacon. Okay. So three. So what? I mean, I don't know. That's like less than 4%. Anyway. What do you want to ask me? You slept with less than 4% of your guests. So that's like, that's fine. So what if it was even more? What's the big deal? I don't know. What is the big deal? You're the one making a big deal. I think it's, I don't think it's a big deal at all. I just think that... So this is not a date? What? This is not a date then. Cause we're already fighting. Do you want this to be a date? No. I'm just excited to be spending happy, like Thanksgiving with you. It's cozy. And you look so handsome. Thank you. Yeah. You look very, very beautiful. You guys can't see. He's wearing plaid, a button down plaid shirt, but it's not button. It's open to reveal his, his, uh, Heather knows dark, dark gray, not quite black, uh, crew neck T-shirt, effortlessly chic, 50 cotton, 50 poly probably he's got a hair cut, he trimmed his beard cause I think I suggested it like a week ago. Um, yeah. That stream of consciousness thing that you just did, that's kind of what you do. And it's really funny and you do it on these Insta stories. It's amazing. It's an amazing thing. It's like you're doing, this is when we started communicating and then I was like looking you up on the internet and then I started, then I got pulled into your Insta stories and I'm watching what you're doing. It's fucking funny. And it's weird because when you say Insta stories, it immediately takes away from any special thing. Absolutely. Cause it's, cause it's, it's like the medium itself is in a lot of people's eyes corrupt. Why? I think because Instagram has been just decried as this kind of like embarrassing, even though everyone's doing it and, but it's still people see it as a kind of like, you know, I have friends who make fun of it. Oh, Instagram. Oh, you're on Instagram. Even the name sounds bad. Instagram. Instagram. That's their problem. Insta stories. Got it. It doesn't sound cool. Oh. You know what I mean? It's not like what it really is. It's like you're, it's a, it's film and you're doing these really quick vignettes. So if you were saying, Oh, you know, I shoot these little vignettes of my life, these kind of like biopic comedic vignettes of my life and I show them at cinemas where we drink absinthe and it's like a, it's a, it's a post-modern commentary on existence in them or whatever. I do. That's your only thing. That's why you see yourself in me. And that's why we're here right now. We have a lot of similarities I think in the, and I think in that we share a certain aesthetic, which is this idea of attempting to sort of fearlessly announce what's happening to us or something like this feeling of wanting to be really honest, but then also hopefully funny inside of that too. Like not, not just like embarrassingly confessional. Yeah. Well, that's like, we'll have two things. That's what like, it should be funny. I think that's like the best because that's what I'm looking for. Like when I watch a movie that I really love or when I like find something that I like really tune into and love, it's because it's like, it makes me feel less alone. I relate to it. I see myself in the thing. It's, oh my God, it's so raw and honest that I'm like, Oh my God, I can't believe this person was so brave to reveal this thing. But then also it makes me laugh. That's my favorite kind of shit to watch. So that I think that's, and that's, so that's what I want to make. You know, I always want to be laughing. Like I'll see really serious things like whether it's a movie or whatever the fuck it is or somebody who takes themself so seriously. And I'm like, God, I just, I, I always prefer to laugh. Like I just rather be laughing. Maybe I sound too serious now. Oh, but you talking about Insta stories, but talking about how like your friends don't like it and your friend, and you've got to like frame it like it's like cinema and we're watching apps, you know, we're watching with absence. Like I don't even feel the need to like frame it so intensely because it's so, I don't even know who's making, who's making fun of Insta stories. Cause to me, the same people who make funny YouTube stars. Oh, no, it's different. No way. Cause I, I have the, not the problem in me. I would make fun of like Vine stars. Like one of my best girlfriends who people don't understand why we're best girlfriends because we're so different. She's like a Vine star. She looks like she shops at hot topics. Like she's kind of cheesy, but she's so wonderful. And oh my God, I hope I'm not like parts right now. Can you hear this? No, do you want some water? No, I've got Rosé right here. Okay. We're getting tipsy while we podcast you guys. It's Thanksgiving. How dare you? Um, anyway, um, I would make fun of Vine stars and I would make fun of like YouTube stars, but that's my problem because the whole thing is like the futuristic way of thinking or the way to think is it's just where people are putting their attention. It's where people choose to put their attention. So I don't need to think about it as cinema. Yeah, it's Insta stories. I used to be really shy when I first started with it. Cause I was like, oh, everybody's going to see and it's connected to Instagram. That's where everybody's like really into Instagram and Snapchat is kind of like, maybe it's still thriving, but now I make a joke. That's not a joke and not to talk and tweets, but I like tweeted the other day like, Oh, I have my own, uh, my own TV show now. Uh, it's on the Instagram network. Uh, I'm, you know, my show is constantly on the air. Like check it out online because that's what it is. It's like, that's where everybody can have their own TV show, you know, where it's like, it's anyway, and you know, you're doing it more. Well, cause I don't know about that a hundred percent, but, but before we get into that, like when, what you're talking about, I imagine there was some time way in the dark distant primordial past where like in a tribe, there was probably somebody who was super funny and charisma, the storyteller, and they would sit in front of the campfire and he would tell stories and people loved it. And they would laugh. And the stories he told other people had told him and he would share the stories. And that was what entertainment was, but then it certainly it's at some point, some asshole was like, you know what, the campfire thing's cool, but not everybody can see me. I'm going to build a little platform to stand on, to tell the stories. And probably the older storyteller, the first time someone built a stage was like, what a fucking asshole. I'm not, I'm not doing that. Sit standing on a stage. That's not how we do it. We don't stand on a stage. We sit in front of the campfire and tell the story, not on a stage. That's not real storytelling when you're standing on a stage. So in the same way, it's like with a history of comedy, you know, it's like stand up comedy. Before that, it was like, um, vaudeville and, and, and, and, and, and then stand up comedy sort of transforms into like, Oh, TV, the glory of TV. A lot of stand up comics. The dream was to get on TV. You get on TV and more people can see your comedy and then, but now this new thing has emerged, which is like, we don't really need TV anymore. Yeah. And so what I'm saying is every, every evolution of the stage is decried in some way or another by people who are attached to the previous version. So that's what's happening when people look at whatever the fucking thing is and say, no, that doesn't really count. And also I think like, if you're, if you have like an unwillingness to go with the flow and to the next thing that shows like how far you are able to go. It shows like your age kind of in a weird way. It's like, like you can be a certain age. And then have like a willingness to like, stop looking at your computer. I can't believe you. Oh, I'm looking to make sure the levels are okay. Alexi, I have to make sure you just call me ugly and fat. I can't believe this. No, I did not. Okay. But, uh, I know you're like, how old are you? Like 60? You're like 60 years old. I know this almost, but, uh, but you have such a youthful willingness to like, I don't know, but I'm just saying like people who don't have the willingness to like try the next thing or do instastories or try Snapchat or like, and they're like, Oh, back in my day, like that's just embarrassing for them. It shows their age and it shows their like, what's the word? Rigid. Oh my God, you're going to be drunk. Rigidity. Is that it? Rigidity? The rigidness? That's not the word. Tell me. Rigidity. Okay. Well, uh, yeah, being stuck. Yeah. And you can't, the whole thing is you got to keep like moving. That's why it's like, and that's why I wonder, like, do you need, do you need managers and agents anymore? Or at what point are those things going to, or like TV networks and magazines and like partners? You need partners. If you have a good manager and agent, it's a part, my agent's amazing. Like he's, he's great. You know, I just love my manager. I know we'll talk about that in a second. But my, my agent's just a, uh, like, uh, he's really, really smart. Get a room. He loves doing business and he's like a great, he's a partner. So like, if he wasn't an agent, he would be my business partner. He just happens to be an agent. And because of that, cause my brain like spins and like terrible, like vortexes that, that aren't really quite often monetizable. And there's no way to make, but he's someone who can focus that. And like, oh, wait, why don't we do this? I really don't, I think he's like 17. He just turned 17. Oh, cool. See, there you go. Oh, that's why I got, I love him. Like Louie when his like manager was like eight years old. And I know we're not a lot of, we're, we're, we're, was that in a Louie? Well, this is the, I know we're not allowed to like his work anymore. It's funny to bring up your manager and Louie CK cause they're connected. Your manager was Louie CK's manager. Your manager just got in a hellstorm because, um, he, he was implicated in, can you tell the story of what happened to your manager, Dave Becky? You want to talk about it? Well, yeah. I mean, Dave Becky was Louie CK's manager, not his manager anymore. Right. Didn't he drop Louie CK, but he was implicated in this whole story about, you know, so it came out that Louie CK was, was, uh, jerking off in front of a multiple women over the course of like however long. And, um, one of the things in what article was it? Who cares? It doesn't matter in useless detail. Like was that Dave Becky threatened the careers of two of the girls. He threatened to hurt their career if they didn't stop. Like, was that in the article you said he was going to fuck up their career? I don't know. That was, that was the, that's what got Dave Becky into so much trouble is the, the, the, the vibe for like, I thought it was kind of foggy. It was just kind of foggy. That's the thing. It was, there was some sense that he had power over their control, but he just basically told them, Hey, shut up, Hey, shut up, some version of shut up. And that's why it's like a murky thing because it's like, I talked to my agent and I talked to executives that I've worked with in the past who are kind of like bummed that I left Dave Becky and I left Dave Becky because not because that, you know, I, it was a disappointing story. Uh, I mean, outside of this like thing that just happened, he is considered to be one of the top comedy managers. He's a badass. I mean, he represented Louie CK. Louie CK, Maya Rudolph, uh, whoever, Aziz Ansari, Kevin Hart, just like, uh, Amy polar, like he's one of like the legendary few legendary managers. He's one of them and I love him. You know, he's, he's a badass. He's got a, he's into rock and roll. He's got great taste. He's just super charming and like, I just looked up to him. So this whole thing, like, you know, it was murky and foggy, but you left him a hundred percent because of the Louie CK thing or were there other hundred percent because of the Louie CK thing, but like, you know, I just feel like everything, everybody's screaming on the internet. Now I just thought like it had been a long time coming. I just wanted to get away. I don't like going to three arts or management companies in general because of the dick jokes and the misogyny and like the overall like comedy community is like so male oriented that I just thought like, I'm not one of his biggest clients. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I'm disappointed by the story. Oh God, I'm a woman. Like, I just got to go the fuck out of here. You know what I mean? Like, and I, it was like the straw that broke the camel. The straw that broke the camel's back. And then it's, and then I also was getting like, there's this other thing going on. I'll go back to Dave Becky, but there's this other thing going on and tell me if I start slurring because I haven't eaten. I've only had a donut and I'm drinking rose on Thanksgiving at your house or whatever. But there's this thing that like people are doing women, which is really disappointing. Cause I guess they look up to Rose McGowan and I love Rose McGowan, but there's like this weird feminist woman on woman bullying to tell your story and to do what they tell you is the right thing to do. And like, I have two things going on in my life right now. There was like, you know, I knew cares about me being a client of Dave Becky. I'm not anymore, but that's neither here nor there. It's like, I started getting all these like emails and like DMs on Twitter and Instagram being like, are you going to say anything about this Dave Becky and Louisie? And it's like, are you, you better leave. You better fucking leave. Like these women like telling me what you're doing. I'm like, wait a minute. I want to do, I'm going to do whatever I want to do. Also don't tell me what to do. And you're a woman telling another woman in this crazy time with all this fucking weird upheaval where it's like every, every woman right now is like hearing about you know, the Brett Ratner, the Harvey Weinstein stuff, every woman hearing these stories in the news right now, Charlie Rose, Charlie Rose, like everything. Like Russell Simmons, like my own Russell Simmons story to talk about, but it's like every woman right now reading all this shit in the news. And I don't know if you can relate to this or not. You're a guy and you're a wonderful, awoken, lovely, charismatic sweetheart. Like, so I don't know if you can relate to this, but like for most women, every woman I talk to, it's like all, all the shit that they've ever experienced with the guys, whether like they're sexually assaulted, spoken to in a weird way, a carrot was dangled in like a weird situation where they're like with a boss who had power over them. Like all their horror stories of the men are coming to the surface now that they've been trying to like suppress because they didn't want to think of themselves as a victim or they didn't come forward with it or they didn't think like they're like, Oh, I'll just put it on me. And I won't like, so I'm going through my own shit. All my girlfriends are going through their own shit. And then other women strangers on the internet are going to be like telling me how I'm supposed to like deal with my manager situation or like, it's like, fuck you. It's just like some weird thing that's happening. It doesn't feel like it doesn't feel like camaraderie as much as like aggression. It feels like this kind of like you're bullying. It's like this new form of bullying where it's like the jocks, like the cheerleader girls are like, well, now we're going to tell you, like, this is how it works at the high school and it's like, Oh my God, back the fuck. Anyway, so why do you think, why do you think right now this is happening? Why is this scary though? Avalanche of revelation happening right now. I have no idea. I don't know. I mean, because Trump was elected, right? Is it because of Trump? I think at first, like, you know, this is like one of the. This is like a blessing kind of like one of the good things about him being elected is the fact that it like made people, shook people up and went, Oh my God, racism and think it would have happened if Hillary got elected. I don't think so. I really don't. So is this some kind of balancing? Cause like there's this like, no one, like there's, there used to be listeners. I mean, I think, I think it might happen again. Oh my God. But do you, so you think this is like a societal reaction to having this like brute in office? Of course. Cause all of a sudden I know the day after I got after the election, like I went downstairs, my car was hyper aware of how white I am. I was like, Oh my God. Oh my God. Like this means that like the fact that he got, he's in office means that the majority of people, it was about, I don't know. I don't know. I'm all over the place right now drinking rosé on Thanksgiving, but here's something that happened the day that, that Trump was elected. I walked downstairs to my car, somebody had blocked my car in and I was furious. I was already on edge. I was like, I can't believe this. Fuck, like who's blocking my car? I gotta go. I gotta go to Starbucks. I gotta go to Starbucks now. I'm late to go to Starbucks. I'm like this blonde white neighbor of mine who I can't stand, like ran down and like just so, you know, whatever. And I went, what a white, what a self important, like, whatever. Like I just felt like she was, uh, why are you so white aware? I was just like, because I became quite aware because I felt like, uh, the people who voted Trump in office were like, uh, people who were like, it just meant that racism was still alive and that it meant that like misogyny is, is super alive. And like, and so I remember just thinking like, like, it was a bird chirping. I can't focus about ADD. You guys can't hear this bird. We gotta do something. Maybe they can until that's a really like intense bird too. Like that's a really, that bird hates women. That bird is like hearing me speak and it's like trying to stifle me. Oh shit. It's probably one of those new Trump CIA birds or anyone's where, where, whenever a podcast starts talking shit about Trump, a robotic bird lands and starts trying to round it out. My point was, I just thought, I thought, like, I thought, oh my God, this girl is just like, uh, so self-involved and has no self-awareness and is blocking my car and cause she's like white, whatever. And then I went, oh my God, I'm white. And I went, if I think that way about her, then I can't imagine like what, I don't know, I just became hyper aware of like what my skin color represented. Is there races to be like races against myself? Yeah. No, I deserve it. That was something I was thinking is like, like the racism of white people is finally like reached its like climax and that white people are now racist against white people. Like they ran through all the other races and now they, all that's left is their own body to like, despise. You know, I'm a bit cool though. So it's like, I'm a little bit cooler. Actually, I'm naturally blonde though. I'm naturally blonde. I don't know if my story landed. So you know, it landed. You're, but no, it's the day after Trump. You're just like, ah, fuck. I'm just saying all the upheavals happening because it was a reality check. Everybody's on edge. Everybody's like, Oh my God, I'm sorry. I didn't realize the majority of the country felt this way. This guy could be elected. It's not just, it must mean that most people are like racist, misogynist, horrible, blah, blah, white supremacy. Like, Oh my God. No, no, I mean, what, what, what, what, what I really, what it means, I think is that people are angry and, and because a lot of people in, in, in like huge swaths of the country are unemployed, they're like fucking, they're doomed. They're kind of doomed. They're all like snorting oxy. They're, they're like out of their fucking minds and they're fucking pissed. Meanwhile, Obama, you know, he deported more people than any American than all the American presidents combined. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. You voted for Trump, right? No, I voted for a back of tarantulas. Oh, good. That's great. I really did. I did. I did vote for a bag of trash, but I don't want to talk politics. I'm not good at that. Let's talk about boys and feelings. No, we'll get to that. Okay. I think it's, it's like what, what happened with, with Trump was a blessing in a lot of different ways because, but one of the blessings was with Obama, we have this like charismatic, beautiful, graceful, like aristocratic leader who's like ordering drone strikes that killed countless innocent children. He murdered so many people. He increased the surveillance in the United States, but my God, man. He's so fucking graceful, handsome, so fucking cool. He's cool, man. He's cool. Yet he's a murderer. He's a mass murderer. And he's just presidents are, right? Yeah, a lot. Many of them are probably all. I don't know. But so Obama is a kind of monster, but he's a beautiful monster. And the glory of Trump is here we have this, like all is just a monster. He's an oligarch. You know, we have this brutish, fucking billionaire, disconnected, crazy being who at least in this case, we can see he kind of looks like a pig. Well, Obama didn't look like a pig. I want my pigs to look like pigs. So when we're looking at him, it's like, okay, this is a pig. What do you mean? Well, I don't think of you as that. But anyway, the point is so that, so because we now have this overt representation of what is happening in the world, which is the, what Terence McKenna called male dominator culture, the amplification of that and the extreme. It's produced this, a lot of beautiful reactions, I think. Oh yeah. There are a lot of beautiful reactions, but I also feel like with all the stuff that's happening with this upheaval, I'd say with men and women would like, you know, the Harvey Weinstein is a monster. But like with all the, like with everything that's going on, I feel like it's like, I feel like everything, it's all happening so fast because it, like, and that the, I don't know, it's just so much is happening right now. It's, it makes it like scared. I can't even imagine people dating right now. You know, maybe this isn't a date. You know what the apocalypse means? Yeah. Well, tell me, tell me. Well, I think it's Greek. The Greek is, it means the lifting of the veil. So. Oh God. Yes. It is the apocalypse then. Yeah. So how can we be on a date now? You're probably a monster. What? What's going to happen? I'm a monster. What's going to come out about you? Oh, I think we're all monster. I mean, I think that, that, that, that really. I call myself a monster all the time. I think if you look at like, I mean, if you look at any human, it's, some people have acted on their darkest impulses and they've done it over and over and over again. And I don't think anything is unforgivable, but I think that we need, when I look at all this shit going down, I think, man, I, what we need in society is like, you know, like having space here. All these people are like, Oh, I'm going to rehab. Like in the West rehab became this sort of like going to rehab. Well, that's what people say when they've been accused of things like this, because in the West rehab has become sort of like the chamber of purification. So it's like really what we need is a chamber of purification where a person does some rotten things somewhere in between jail and like, you know, saying you're sorry, it would be amazing if there's a place that people like Harvey Weinstein or whoever in the future emerges and not just with like crazy sex people, but anyone who does some ridiculously stupid shit will be really beautiful if we had built into our society, a forgiveness chamber that people could go into and in a real way, a tone for whatever dark karma that they had like spread into the world. Louis C. C. K. Being a perfect example of this, which is that here we have a rusty pipe with very sweet water that came out of it. Because if you work, yes, so funny, I love Woody Allen movies. I'm not going to stop living Woody Allen movies. It's rusty pipes. And it's like, I'm not going to let some persons like fucking crazy, bullying, egocentric, super hyper, sexualized, repressed lunacy. No way. Because what in what that's the very, that's not, that's, that's to imply what I think is one of the fundamental delusions when it comes to art, which is that the thing that the art is coming out of has anything to do with the art. And I think when a person who is producing the art thinks that they're, they're, they're responsible, that person inevitably is a complete cunt. When you run into someone's all puffed up because of the stuff they're making, it's just like, oh, yeah, you're, you're like a radio, but playing Beethoven that thinks you're Beethoven, but don't people, what about when you use the work to, to walk through the demons that you're fighting, right? When you use that as a tool to, to like get through it or, or, or make sense of it or forgive yourself for it or feel better about it. You know what I mean? That's another aspect of like, yeah, sure. That means I can't enjoy the work and I still want to enjoy the work as a third party who's just like, anyway, I think of the work as a, as another creature that a person created and that, that, to, to reject the work because of the creator of the work is to like, to, to do a great disservice to a living hyper dimensional being that, so I'm not going to stop enjoying Louis CK's comedy. I'm not going to stop enjoying anything you put out that amazing short film like where what short film, he did this incredible short about, um, can't believe you wrote me into this, like Louis CK appreciation pocket. I can't believe it. No, it's not, it's not, no, I feel, no, I think this is kind of like, when this is not a date, when somebody like Louis CK or whoever it is, Kevin Spacey is talented and is focused and ambitious and, and works really hard to the point where they're making really beautiful stuff. I think that they're incredibly irresponsible aside from all the ethical shit and just like the, the, the, the lives they're hurting from being this amazing, talented being, and then like assaulting someone, aside from just that, the fact that like they're doing that, that's obviously the number one sin. But the very, in a close second is the fact that they've become this conduit for this beautiful art conduit. Yeah. And then, and, and now they're there, not only are they jerking off in front of these like people who respected them. They're like jerking off in front of their art. You know what I mean? And it's like, God damn it. Why are you adding this extra pull up that we have to do to appreciate beauty in the world? You're bringing beauty in the world. Yeah. That's an incredible thing. Respect that. That's what you're doing. The, the ideal priest class, not the corrupted priest class, sucking off toddlers, you know, whatever, like a lot of priests do, the ideal priest class. And I think an artist is a form of priest, yeah, abides by a certain ethic because they are, they're channels or they're connective points that people can talk to God through and it's sacred. And so they have to abide by these certain rules. And, and the moment that a priest doesn't do that, then anything they've taught the person is false then is not false. But in the person's mind, they're going to reject the teaching because the thing that it came out of was fucking standing in a hotel room, sweating and fucking coming all over a fucking hotel couch in front of them. It's awful. It's the, it's like a great sin. If you are lucky enough that you're producing beauty into the world. Just if you're going to jerk off in front of somebody, don't ask permission because they're fucking like your friend and you know, they're going to say no. And somehow it gives you like the sense of hire a sex worker. They're sex workers. Get a sex worker, contribute to like that economy, like get a sex worker who's going to act freaked out that you're jerking off in front of them. There's so many great ways to like do it. That's all I'm not, I'm not defending what Louis CK or any of these freaks did. I'm just saying like, to me, what's particularly, and what's kind of getting left out in the story is, is, and maybe it should get left out because like the primary thing is like, you know, here's people who really respected you, that trusted you, that were in your presence, that thought you were cool, that thought you're hanging out with them because you thought they were funny. It's so funny. I went on a date with Louis CK. Oh, you did. I did. What happened? You didn't jerk off in front of me. You didn't even ask. Did you was, did you throw with me? Did you feel that really? Was there a moment? That's a horrible joke. It's a horrible joke. I've been making that joke, but not on a podcast or the microphone in front of my mouth, but then I realized like now in this, in this, in the current climate to make a joke like, what's wrong with me? Why didn't you want to jerk off in front of me? It's like, not allowed because it's like, because it's not, uh, because nobody has a sense of humor and it's like, we're not allowed to make jokes or anything to deflect. Yeah. With this stuff, you have to, you're like, there's a lot, there's a, everything is so like high strung right now. It is so high strung. And, uh, yeah, no, I went on a date with him like when I was like, Oh God, maybe like nine years ago or something. And, Oh, because I had met him and he was totally lovely and fine. That doesn't mean he hasn't jerked off in front of a bunch of people. I'm not taking away from the shitty things he's done, but like my experience with him was, uh, was, yeah, we met at some like kids in the hall. Do you have time for this? Are you hanging yourself? Are you hanging yourself? You can't see Duncan is standing on a chair, fashioning a news, fashioning a news. No, so, so years ago, I think I was like 21 years old. I was at like one of the party, a party that one of the guys from kids in the hall through, I can't remember what his name is, but he had like a pool party. And, and like I was in the pool, tipsy, topless without asking anybody's consent. Topless in the pool, talking to like a then lesser known, but still widely respected Louis CK, and I think he was married at the time and he's having a conversation with me and this is so funny because now as an adult to see the situation, this man was like, I was just topless, so naive and green. And I think I was doing stand up at the time and then, uh, just like asking about life and what it all means. And, and meanwhile, like I'm topless in my undies and assuming pool like one in the morning and he's just like, you know, I'm hopefully used it as an image to jerk off later. I mean, I hope, but whatever. But he was just like standing there and sitting there in the pool with me. And then, and he was married. Years later, he my spaces me and he's like, Hey, I'd love to like, you know, I'm divorced now, like I remember meeting in that pool and it would be really great to like, so basically he was just like trying to find all the girls he wished he had fucked or something like over the course of many years. And like, you know, do you want to meet for a date? So we went to like the beachwood cafe or something all tucked away and we walked in there and I think we walked into one aspect, one section of the beachwood cafe. It's a spot in Tinseltown or whatever. Like, but, uh, and there are all these like writers he knew and this one took of it and he was like, Oh no, I'm not in there. And, you know, and then so we found this one spot. And I think he talked about Dave Becky too is about to go pitch some TV show with Dave Becky is like years before I ever met Dave Becky. And it was like, totally lovely. We just talked about comedy and like, yeah, I think it was glazed over. I think he'd had enough. I think I was like too earnest and like naive for him or something or not to be fucked with or somehow. And then he walked in my car. He asked me if he could kiss me. I said, no, because I was not attracted to him. And, uh, and then that was it. And then like a year later, I started my blog and I like my space to him and asked him if like he would read it and I never heard back from him. And then I heard him on Howard Stern talking about how right after his divorce, he revisited all the girls he had wanted to fuck and he fucked some of them, not all of them. And I was like, well, I guess I was just one of the girls. He didn't fuck. And then I watched the pilot of Louis, which is like where that's picked kind of what he's doing. He's like going back to the women that he used to know in his past now that he was divorced. And I thought that was so interesting to watch it unfold. And he just keeps getting more interesting as opposed like with the jerk off stuff, but, uh, well, you know, there's like, uh, I think we were talking about this, not on a podcast, but there. So there's this mystic Gurgif and he talks about what a person is. And the idea is a person is not one person. A person is a hive of selves. So within any person, yeah, yes. So it's like, it's, there's so many personalities living inside of any of us at any given time. So there's the tired version of you, the angry version of you. Oh my God. They're like, yeah, the loving version of you, the in love version of you, the podcast version of me. Yes, exactly. And like some of these versions of us are completely antithetical and completely opposed to each other and completely the opposite. And so, so, so many people spend a lot of energy suppressing certain versions of themselves. And we've seen this in psychology with multiple personality disorder, where people will become someone else. A person who's right-handed will become left-handed. A person who has like physical disorders will emerge in certain personalities that aren't in other personalities. So if I've been like that, oh, don't you feel like you show your meanest sides to your parents and the person you're a loving relationship with? Yeah. Cause you want to be healed. You want to be healed? Yeah. I feel like I'm the meanest to my parents and whoever I'm having sex with. Or that was when I used to have sex and date. I don't do that anymore. That's not true. Okay. Why do you say that? I'll tell you later on the podcast though. Keep going, keep going. Well, that's funny. Well, that's a funny part of yourself you want to put out there. Oh, I'm not dating. Oh, I don't. Of course you're always dating. I am dating. You're like very romantic and you have lots of relationships. Yeah. But before we get to that, the idea is like that what happens is if you're very comfortable around someone, if I go to the doctor and I tell him about how I want to feel versus how I feel, I'm going to die because the thing that I'm feeling, the symptoms I'm not going to say. I'm, if I go to a doctor and say how I want to feel, I will be like doctor. I just wanted to tell you, I've never felt this energetic. I wake up in the morning fully rested. I immediately fall asleep when I go, when I go to sleep and my body feels like really loose. Like I feel like I'm completely relaxed all the time. I never feel anxiety. I'm super happy and the doctor like, great, I'm glad you're doing great. See you later and I will die. But, and so that's what happens in relationships. That's what happens in the, when people are in the public is the thing they present to the world is not who they are. It's who they want to be. Yeah. And so if you feel comfortable enough with the world or with someone that you're with, then you start showing them the wound and you're showing them the wound, not because you want to be rejected, but because you desperately are hoping that they can heal you. Well, that's different from being viciously mean and reactive. Cause I'm talking, I'm talking to my boyfriend, but I'm actually really talking to my father. That's different. That's the wound. That's, but that's different. The wound's not pretty. I know it's not, but how my wound is not pretty. Okay, but when is a wound pretty? Wait, how gross would it be that you go to somebody and you have this fucking wound and the person looks at it and is like, oh, so beautiful. I'm dying for that. I call my vagina wound, but anyway, that's totally hacky. Whatever. Anyway, with my blog, with my podcast, with my instastories or whatever, or these different variations on like how you like present yourself to the world. I've always tried to be like my complete self in the hopes that like, oh, okay, if I'm this fucking raw, like I did this more with my blog. Forgive me for talking about my blog on your podcast. Why? I think it's great. I like your blog, but like I used to be so crazy, crazy, like so vulnerable and raw and forthcoming on that thing because I thought, fuck it. Like if somebody can handle this, then they see me and that's now I've transitioned that to like, I wish my podcast I'm working on it and you make me want to be way more like honest and who I am. But like with my instastories, when I'm doing that a ton, my goal is it's like, I'm like, this is me. I'm on my own. I'm living my life. If a man were to see this and hopefully I'm attracted to this man, he's cool. And I think he's neat as well. Like if he were to respond to this, then he accepts me, then he likes me. Then he like, then I have found a person who like can handle who I actually really am, not some front, but the problem is for me, what I always run into is I run and we've talked about this before, but whatever. Now we're podcasting. Like I run into men who are like, you're so funny. You're so brave. Oh my God, I would never be able to say what you say. I can't believe it. You know, and then I'm like, Oh wow, he gets me. He likes me. He, he accepts me. I can be safe in his arms and, and, and cause that's all I want. And I want to do the same to the other, to the, to the, to the person, but it's not okay. It's really not because they get attracted to that and not to like keep saying, we've talked about this before, like they get attracted to it, but then they're like, Oh yeah, but you're my girlfriend now. Like, can you, can you cut it out? Or like, don't talk about me though. Or like, you're not going to mention us. So like, Oh, you can talk about that. But I really prefer you didn't, like, so I, you know, I, I refer to it as like being attracted to my light and then wanting to put a lampshade over me, you know, when it's like, so I'm getting tipsy on this Rosé, but, but like, so it's this crazy thing. I'm not, I'm trying to like put my, my complete self out there. And I don't know if it's different. I feel like, like, I feel like for you, as I'm slowing my words, I feel like for you, it's different because it's different from men a bit. Am I totally wrong? Where you can have your podcast and you're talking about like, Oh my God, I can't believe it. Living my life and doing all my things and psychedelic and I'm going to the thing and whatever and give as much as you are giving of yourself on your various platforms and whatever. And, and I feel like women who have fallen in love with you through that are like, wow, he's so neat. You know, he does this and he does that and he says this and this is who he is. And they'll accept it, but it's not like that for a woman who puts yourself in the same position. Like, like if I am similar to you in any way, that's not true. What you just said isn't true. I don't know about that because I'm, I'm living my life trying to like, like, I'm just telling you what it's been like for the, for being accepted and dating. And it's, I guess it's rare because when you do find the thing that accepts you, it should be rare because that's when you know it's so important that you found it, I guess. Well, yeah, I mean, I think so. Yeah, they're recording still. Yeah, it's still rolling. I can see it roll. Yeah, no, but I think that it's, I think that what we do is pretty unique in the sense that it is like very up, very in, in, in front of people. And so, you know, a lot of people have a fundamental right to privacy. So, and many people don't want to be in the public eye and there's nothing wrong with that. So if somebody, if you, if you wind up with somebody who wants to be private, it's their right to be private. And, and that's a problem. But why do they come for me then? That's like the funny thing is like my thing is like, this is what I do. There's all the things you like me. You appreciate this. You come towards me, you're into it. And then you're like bummed on it. And it's like, but you knew you were getting into the whole time. And that's why, and for a moment, like before they weren't thinking it, they weren't thinking it through. I, they weren't thinking about it in that way. What they were seeing you, they were seeing you, the thing you're throwing in front of the world and they weren't thinking, this is a person who puts everything in front of the world. They were thinking, I really like the person in front of the world. They weren't thinking about the fact that the way they found you was because they might be, you put yourself in front of the world. That's also, but it's a horrible thing. Cause then you feel like the rugs been pulled out from underneath you. And you go, oh, wow, this person accepts me. They're into it. And then, and I really don't feel, I feel like men get, and not to make it like many, because I love men. And I believe in their wonderful, wonderful men and like, and all this stuff. But it is like, cause it's a masculating a bit to like have some groving, like, you know, talking about her feelings and talking nonstop. And, and like putting yourself out there. And I don't know. So it doesn't, it's few and far between when it sits well with a, with a guy. It's funny to me that you are apocalyptic. Like I, what I just realized is like, both of our styles are apoc, if apocalypse means lifting of the veil, then both of our styles of podcasting and putting stuff out there is about as much as possible. Lifting the veil. Yes. Okay. So we're apocalyptic. I guess the definition of our aesthetic is a form of apocalypse in the sense that the idea is like, okay, how much can I reveal now? I want to reveal everything. And I forgot you do. No, I do. And I haven't been, and you're making me want to again, but you don't know, I know what I've found in my experiments with it in general is that when I reveal something, the responses love, it's very rarely rejection. Like usually what you realize is like, Oh, the universe seems to be playing a game with us where it wants us to tell the truth, but it's not going to force us to tell the truth. Other people feel less alone. You give them permission to feel less alone. They see themselves in you. It's the most beautiful thing. You're a conduit for other people. And so I feel like recently, sorry, not to cut you off. I just totally cut you off. I feel like I had to make decision recently that like I had to choose like one or the other because I got so beaten down and horrible relationships with people I thought like except me, but didn't or were addicts or mean and jealous or just, oh my God, like horror stories that I went, Oh my God, I just have to be okay with being alone forever. Relationships are terrifying and detrimental. If you want to be a conduit to like being really honest and being like the butt of the joke and making yourself very vulnerable so that people, people can feel less alone and laugh, which is my main goal of anything that I'll ever do and have been doing for a while. Then you just have to give up. You've got to be okay with aging out of having a baby. You've got to be okay with never getting married. You've got to be okay with. And, but the weird thing is I'm such a romantic, I'm at this crossroads and it odds myself because I'm such a romantic and I'm a realist. So that's where I do myself. And cause I'm like, I have this, I'm like, and I, I wait, I might, I'm, I'm a realist, but I'm also super idealistic. Wait, wait, hold on, hold on. Well, no, wait, let me stop you. Okay. I just want to break down your definition of romance because it's interesting to me that you think that romance and realism don't meet. Well, I want them to, but I feel like I've gotten all these like, through my experience, I got beaten down. And now I feel more hopeful, but because I like constantly like, you try out a thing and then it doesn't work out and you got to pick yourself up again and you go, but I believe in love and I'm hoping for the best and that thing didn't work out, but that was that thing. And I'm like, and then I'm listening to people and everybody's like polyamorous and that's great and this and that. And like, but I'm like old school. I want to be like monogamous and I want my one person and I've had enough sex with a million gazillion men in my entire life. I've had so many. How much is the gazillion? A lot, like a lot. We didn't even talk about Jason Siegel's story. We haven't even, I didn't have sex with them. I didn't have sex with them. Anyway, okay. But, uh, oh God, but, uh, but yeah, but like, I don't know. And then I just thought like, maybe that doesn't exist anymore. And like, I want like this perfect thing where I'm like, I have a partner and it's like this Cassavetes thing and we're making something together and, and like, I can be my complete self and it's imperfect and it's like over, over shares and is insecure and I spiral, but I'm like, I also think I'm great and I'm making the things and I'm talking to people, but I wanted to be, but no, I have like this whole idea of what I'm looking for and I've believed that exists for so long. And then I just got to this point recently where I was like, Oh fuck, I don't even know if it does anymore. And like, it can exist. If you think romance and realism are separate things, it will exist. They aren't like, I want them to be one thing. But I, if they're separate things, then it's, then they're not separate anymore. Then they won't be separate because well, I got like, yeah, I don't know. Cause if you think about it, I'm still hopeful for, for romance, forget, and that is realism. My realistic romance is what I, this is one of the great, beautiful, like problems, sweet problems that we're having in the modern world right now is that we have this, we basically have these two strands, one of them is religion and one of them is science. And, and, and Christopher Ryan now know what he doesn't talk about that. What do you mean? I thought you were going to talk about like sex at dawn. I'm like, I can't do this right now. That's a completely, by the way, I don't know why. First of all, you and me and Christopher Ryan have to like go do our own podcast. You invented that for him. You would like him. He's a wonderful human. So, but, but the, um, no, I'm not talking about, I'm no, what I'm talking about is we have these two in the, in the human identity, we have these two threads of the personality of the human identity, one of them religion, one of them science. So if we look at all humans that ever lived as one person and, and, and the flow of history is the thought process of this person, then we see these two, two interesting thoughts trying to, trying to merge. One of them is the idea that we live in this universe that everything's alive. Everything's made of love. Everything emerges from love. Everything is an expression of God. And the other is materialism, scientific materialism, which is like, no, I don't know if that's true. Like, I think that we just have matter, atoms, reactions, chemical reactions, but this extra stuff you're putting on there, I don't know if that's real. I mean, so, so people who are like devout scientific materialists will immediately, if you posed to them, the thing that you know is true, which I know is true, which is that the universe springs from like a divine intelligence and that we're living inside of love. They're kind of like, no, we're not living inside of fucking love. We're living inside of a bunch of chemical reactions. That's what you are. And that's it. Yeah, I don't like that. That's not for me. It's two threads. Yeah. So one of them is romantic and one of them is realistic. And so what we're seeking is to merge these two back together again. And once we do that, we will, we will have found the ultimate love. And I think that is like the, not only the quest in a individual's life, but I think it's the hope for our entire species, which is the, we had to split apart in this way so that we could like really understand the world and this at the atomic level. And because of that, so many great things have emerged. But then because of that, to like kick aside myth is insanity to kick aside this sweet, beautiful harm, harmony of story. And that is given so many people's lives. Meaning is, is, is a brutality at the highest level, but to kick aside science because you want to live in some fantasy land where like Krishna is playing a flute in the floor science by pushing aside though, am I pushing aside science? You're not, but I'm saying you, you were separating romance from realism. And I'm saying that somebody told me that one time, I guess, and that really broke my heart cause I guess like I was in a thing with somebody and he, he, he separated the two and I let that stick with me where I went, wow. Okay. So what I strive for is, is not realistic, but that's me just like cutting myself emotionally, it's you, you, it's you being the representation of all humanity and all humanity has a broken heart right now. Because the, because we've been either disconnected from the story or, or we've been disconnected from truth and, and, and the story is so beautiful that, that, that it deserves an entire life dedicated to it and truth is so beautiful. It deserves an entire life dedicated to it. But right now the idea is these two things can't coexist. So we pick one or the other, which, well, here's what I like to be hopeful about if this is what gets me through the night. If I feel like I'm a person who, who wants this and is capable of like being monogamous, being honest, being my complete self, having the willingness to accept a person exactly as they are and communicate through moments of like things not making sense. And I can be kind and graceful and whatever and like just treat them the way I would want to be treated. And I, and I have this way in which I want to have a relationship. There are so many people in the world, hopefully there must, I must, I have hope that there is at least one other person who shares my belief system that maybe I'm also attracted to and I want to have sex with them in, you know, so I, I go, you know, all it takes is the, another person who shares the world in which I am constructing my brain that I want to live in, right? Like, so it doesn't, it doesn't matter what everybody else thinks. It's like, I just need to find that one other person who like, um, like, let's like, I'm sorry if I'm like tipsy and slurring and all over the place. You don't see, you don't seem, but like if Christopher Ryan, like, cause everybody talks to me about like, oh, Christopher Ryan, sex with Don, you got to read that book and blah, blah. And he talks about how I'm going to talk to me. I'm sure, I can't wait to meet him. I'd love to meet him. I'd love to date him. I'd love to have sex. I was getting, is he married? No, I don't want to have sex with him. I don't want to. How dare, it was a trick. You just failed. That was a trick. I just wanted to, okay, um, yeah, I don't know. I just feel like, uh, I don't know where I'm going with all this, but I'm, but like all that matters is the two people in a relationship are on the same page and are honest with each other about whatever the terms of that relationship are, you know what I mean? So that's like, and so there can be a million, a myriad of different relationships that exist or like what the goal is nowadays with romance and blah, blah, but as long as you're like, well, you're in a relationship with like four people and it's polyamorous and it's fucking whatever, like, or you're with another person and you're both like subscribing to this idea where it's like, okay, you're not going to fuck anybody else and I'm not going to. And we want to really going to talk like all that matters is like everybody's on the same page. Like the tricky part is when people start like saying they're signed up for one thing and then they're like lying about it and you're like, what the fuck dude? Like if you said, if you wanted to fuck people, why don't you just tell me, maybe I wanted to fuck another person. Do you know what I mean? So that is evil. Yeah. Isn't that evil? Is that, isn't that like one of the manifestations of evil? Well, yeah, it's controlling. It's like, it's evil. It's like, but it really, it means that person's hurting because they're not okay enough or aligned with themselves enough to like go, oh, I can say what I need and what I want and I'm kind and I can like be like that with the other person I'm with. So that's really, they're probably in agony, but like, you know, I don't know. God, the dream is to be in the eye of love and the eye of love doesn't care what you've done and the eye of love doesn't care who you are and what you, and this is like, you know, the Ramnath people tell me, I know people have been around, um, named Koli Baba, uh, who was a saint and, and like what was, when you were in his presence, what was really unnerving about it was that he was, he knew you, not just knew you like, Oh, I know you, but literally like telepathically could tell you things about yourself and could tell you the very greatest thing that you were hiding. Really? Oh yes. Oh my God. And then on top of that, he loved you, but he didn't love you in some kind of like Santa Claus way. He loved you like the way your best friend loves you. Like I love you. Yeah. Are you going to be okay? Yeah. I don't know, but I love you. I love that you might not be okay because I know that this thing goes on forever. And in this moment, exactly where you're at, I love you. And that experience for a lot of people was so overwhelming that like it would, it would blow you into pieces. Like you couldn't deal with it. It should be like that. Yeah. Yeah. God, that's heaven because to be in that eye, the eye of love with the thing, whatever it is, whatever, whatever the thing is you're so ashamed of. And to somehow get lucky enough to become in the eye of a thing so sophisticated that whatever the fucking human thing you did was, it still loves you, but it doesn't love you in some stupid like Hallmark hard way. It sees you and loves you. Passionately. Yeah. Like it wants to be with you the way a lover wants to be with a beloved. It doesn't love you like, oh, I'm going to be around you and now I'm going to love you. It's like, I'm so happy to be with you. I'm so lucky to be with you. I love you. I see you deeply. That is it. Yeah. Yeah. And so this is in the beginning where you're talking about this with these fucking psychopaths, we need a forgiveness chamber because our species doesn't know how to love someone who is doing this shit yet. Yeah. We haven't figured out how to do that yet. Why are they like that? Why are they doing what they're doing? Yeah, there needs to be empathy and there's like relieving that part out. Not that I'm forgiving all these people. Well, empathy and forgiveness are maybe two separate things. And it's like, you know, the victims and the hierarchy, the victims. I mean, Jesus, we didn't even get to the thing that you have told me. It is so fucking horrifying. But Russell Simmons? Yes. Oh boy. Like, which is like, how do you like, or like take Russell Simmons or take like, you know, I don't know, Hitler. How do you forgive that? How do you look at that with the eye of love? How do I look at? Oh my God, there's so many different levels. How do I look at Hitler or Russell Simmons with the eye of love? How do I see a being that is caused? I mean, this is God. Oh God. What's that fucking, it's such an embarrassing quote. What is that goddamn Bob Marley quote? Oh boy. Here we go. Is there, no. I knew this would happen on this podcast. Wait, no, how does it go? Is there, no, this is like what, this is, hold on, hold on. I can't tell you how mortified I am to be quoting Bob Marley on this podcast. Me too. I've never sunk to this level. I was told this would happen. Good thing you're so handsome. He told you that day back. You think so really? I don't think it myself. You're very handsome. Thank you. I can't believe you think that. I think you're very beautiful. You do? Yeah. You're very every, so no. So the line is, this is from one love. It's so embarrassing to be reading Bob Marley, but fuck it. And the line is, there is one question I'd really love to ask. Is there a place for the hopeless sinner who has hurt all mankind just to save his own beliefs? And it's such a brilliant, brilliant question because it's like, yeah, what about that person? What about that being that is so fucking hopeless and hopeless is the right word? So buried underneath their karma that there is no hope. Is there, it's so great. Is there a place for them in the world? It's such a great question because if we have a divine creed. It has to be. Right. There has to be, of course, because that's so funny because I can even make something, not to make it about me, but even to make a lighter thing where it's like, I feel like as boring and vanilla as I am. And I'm not fucking Russell Simmons or Harvey Weinstein or Bert Ratner or whatever. I felt like I'd been like so judged for having being promiscuous or having sex or having a past or talking about sex and being in these relationships with these people who thought they liked me and then looked at me and go, Oh, I guess I'm okay with what you're doing. Or you're a little flirty on that podcast or you kind of reveal a little bit too much. Like, I don't know about that. And I, and I just thought like, Oh God, when am I going to like, why am I such, I guess I am a horror or a slut or a piece of shit or I'm not good enough or worthy of like, it's just, I don't know. I'm rambling now because I'm tipsy, but it's Thanksgiving. But like, but yeah, I don't know. I've just hoped to be, I've been accepted by people that I'm dating a little on whatever you're talking about. Bob Marley's asking for. We want to be loved and we want to be accepted and forgiven. And, and it's, and it's, and it's a universal desire. And, and the problem is we need a way to do that in the extreme in our society that isn't the death penalty. We need a way to do that in the, in the extreme for things yelling at me, God, when will you forgive the world? No, I, it's just like, it's a, it's a, it's a, uh, we're, we're going to run into a problem as the apocalypse happens, which is the veil is going to be lifted on everything. Yeah. And we're going to have to deal with the fact that like the way people act is not who they are. And it's a problem because we need to like learn how to like love the way a person is and understand that this is a wound, but simultaneously the crazy feat that we need to come up with is a way to not enable them. It's like Gatsby. Yeah. Your dogs love me. Gatsby's figured out like when to like the, so it's like, how do we do that? How do you figure out a way to, you know, heal people when they're the worst fucking thing you could imagine as a society? I don't know all the answers, but I do have to say it's the best outfit I've ever seen you in my entire life. Are you kidding? I'm not kidding right now. This is like a great outfit you're wearing. A black t-shirt and jeans. Much like what Louis C.K. wears. Oh, whatever. No. Oh my God. No, you do look very handsome. And can I also say really quick, I'm sorry, and you're trying to get deep and political and whatever, but you know, it's probably going to have to land this plane soon, but you're followers because like we were going to podcast the other day and then I had like a panic attack, nervous breakdown kind of vibe and like we didn't podcast. And now we're here on Thanksgiving podcasting, but like I got like 200 new followers just because you posted me on your Insta stories. Oh, that's cool. And they're all super sweet, like telling me about like supplements and like saying hello and they love you and they're like your followers, like the nicest people. They're sweeties. I know they're so nice. So thank you for introducing me to a slew of like all these like cool, like, I don't know. Are they mainly men? What? Who are your like, who are the people who listen to your podcast? It's actually, I think there's a mix in there. It's not just mainly men. Yeah, not mainly men. Women probably love you and you're single now and like they're all coming after you and like, I'm furious. Oh God. Are you furious? I said furious. Do you feel, oh, you're furious because we've kind of been dating. You and me? Do you feel like you're not, you shouldn't talk about that? That we're dating? Well, we've been like. Oh my God. Are you drunk? I'm not drunk. Yes, we've been dating. Your whole thing is like, you're just saying how you wanted to be so revelatory about everything. Yeah, we're dating. Is that what it is? You and me? Yeah. Stop picking your nose. That makes me feel like you think I'm. I'm scratching my nose. It's like disrespectful. What do you want me to say about us dating? I feel like. That's pretty cool though. I mean, I'm sorry. Did I reveal too much? No, I feel like. You were just saying like when you were with men and then they were like, ah, you told, you said too much. I know. No, this is a nice thing because I feel like the weird thing is I feel like, oh my God, your dogs are making so much noise. Oh, it's really weird because getting ready to do your podcast. I was like, so shy to do your podcast and I had like a nervous breakdown. Gatsby. Gatsby, we're talking. I'll have you euthanized. No, I would never. He's the greatest animal. Um, you made me wake up because I was like, fuck, I used to have my blog. I stopped doing that because the reason I stopped doing my blog is you asked me that the other day to catch people up if they're even still listening to this podcast. But, uh, I stopped doing that blog because I got so sick of like inviting people into my life because people are so mean. Like, you know, like on Instagram, on YouTube, on podcasts, like comments and people, I got so sensitive. I like crumbled. So I stopped doing my, my blog and then I thought, I'll do my podcast. My podcast isn't as honest as my insta stories and it's not as honest as my blog used to be. I don't know why. And then meeting you recently, it's so weird that I met you. You've made me want to up my game and go back to who I used to be or something. And it'd be really super honest. So like, anyway, thank you. So that's nice. So thank you for doing that. But yeah, we're dating. It's cool for a moment. I don't know what's happening on it. I don't either. But I mean, what you were saying earlier was making me feel these like waves of guilt, which is like, oh my God, if the aesthetic that we're doing is that we have to be completely honest, then if this is the first thing we do together and we're not being like honest about what's happening. Oh my God, Duncan. I can't believe that thing itself is like, you're so right. I had, why are you, I can't believe you're doing this right now. Well, yeah. So that's a good point. Yeah. I don't know what to say because it's like, oh, shit. I guess like the, if like the thing that we do is to in some way or another be like, all right, well, this is what's happening, be completely honest, like take the veil. But that's so funny because you are not like any of those guys that I used to date because I feel like I could be. No, you're not. Who knows? Because you're like another version of me. You're like this, like, oh, I'm sick of living your life. Oh my God. I can think of things I wouldn't want to, on the air. I can think of things I wouldn't want to share. Oh, well, this is what happened, but whatever we'll talk about. Listen, we just met. We just met, but I would get annoyed with guys who would say, well, we're not going to talk about me or you or like, don't share this, because I, I navigate in such a graceful way. I swear, like I know how to navigate a thing where I'm like respectful people's privacy. Sick of navigating. You're sick of navigating. Aren't you? Not now. I like the word navigate. Like I'm just saying, like on my podcast, and I'm going to up my fucking game now because you've, you've inspired me like to, I don't know, you've just inspired me to be better. So like future podcasts from here on out are going to be way better because Duncan Frost will just inspire me. You inspired me. Really? Yeah. But yeah, I feel like you're just the opposite to all those guys. Like that's why I was talking shit about men I've dated in the past, because I feel like you're like, I just, we seem so similar. Like these like, that's negative perma adolescent. That's not right. But like, I just feel like I was going to say perma adolescent, but that's not right. That's like a negative. That's like pejorative, but like perma frost, but with adolescents. That'd be amazing if there's some part of the world that's just like permanently adolescent. What I mean is cause we're like searching, right? Like you're searching for something, right? And you like with honesty and all the stuff and like you're putting stuff out in the world and you are using yourself as a conduit to like, you're curious and you're learning about things and you're meeting people and you're talking to people and you're trying whatever it is you're trying and I'm whatever like, so I just feel like we're so similar in our like quest towards whatever it is our quest is. So it's like, I don't feel like you could be like a light, like a shine stealer. You couldn't be a shine stealer. You couldn't be a shine. I have been. You have been. Absolutely. Without growing that. But okay, whatever. Maybe you are. Forget it. Thank you for talking me out of having a crush on you. But also I feel like you and I have such like an ability to like communicate and talk about stuff and even like, you know, for the listeners who went to a party the other night and like, I can't believe you did this. You did this Duncan. Like I was not going to talk about now. We're actually doing a podcast. Oh my God. It's true. Well, like we're at a party the other day. Well, I can't talk about this because you want me to keep this a secret and I'll respect that, but whatever we're at a party and you did something irritating or I thought was irritating and I brought it up to you and you the way you communicated with me, you're like, Oh yeah, I just did that thing because I'm my own person. And I went, Oh yeah. And I respect you through pig's blood on a mask. Yes, he did. And I was like, but the funny thing was what was different with you was the minute you told me why you did what you did and then you just were like being yourself and stood up for yourself. The minute you just like said anything to me, I have such respect for you. That I couldn't pull on my usual bullshit. I pull on past men because I've, first of all, I'm in a different place in my life. Also, I respect you so much. Also, we're so similar to podcasters. But anything could go wrong at any second. Do you feel like that? Like who cares? So let it go wrong, but it has not gone wrong yet. No, but you are just out of a relationship. Yeah, that's true. But I mean, you do. I mean, that is like, there's no way. I'm fine. We're just living our lives when you get out of a relationship. There's no way that you could not have just gotten out of a relationship. There's no way you're the one who told me not to worry about the fact that you just got out of a relationship. You told me not to let that detract. That shouldn't detract me from taking you seriously, right? Yeah. Because I don't want no one wants to feel like there should be. So I take you seriously. I don't want to thank you. So you're just here. My new friend Duncan Trussell. You're very handsome. You're super neat. You make me want to be better. You say I do the same for you. Or maybe you do. And well, no, because you're aesthetic, like, you know, you're at the thing. Are you going to delete this from your podcast? No. This is like, I'm so glad that we like hit this point. I wasn't sure. I was trying to abide by your rules, you know. I have no rule. I didn't know what happened. Oh my God. Also, you met me at a weird time. I've been, I've been doing drugs. I probably, I'm not in the right frame of mind. What's your weird, what do you mean? What drugs? I don't know. What are you talking about? What drugs have I done recently? Oh God, I can't even tell you. You don't want to know. I think I do know. I tried ketamine. I tried. Crazy. I did DMT for the second time. Well, you just sober up. Well, you should stop being so bossy. I mean, psychedelics, are you kidding? Like we've got to like, here's what I think. And many of my listeners know that I think this, which is that the United States government has told us what intoxicants are the right ones to take if you want to live a productive life. That's alcohol, caffeine, and cigarettes. Sure. Thank you for reminding me. And also like opiates. Like if the doctor prescribes it, Xanax, benzos, these are good, healthy drugs. The psychedelics, ketamine, MDA, MDMA, God forbid, LSD. MDA, yes, I tried that the other day. These will destroy a person's life. I mean, if you start taking those, then the next thing you know, you'll start thinking that the most important thing is connection and love. And then, you know, what comes after that? What are you going to fucking join a fucking commune in Arizona? What? Change your name, go to Burning Man. Alexi. Grow up, Loser! Alexi Trussell. This is good anyway. Are you blackout drunk right now? Do you know who we're revealing on this podcast right now? I think it's great. Okay. But yeah, you shaken me up. It's so funny because I was like asleep, but like getting ready for this podcast, I was so nervous. That's what we couldn't do the other day. And then I like looked at my life and I was like, oh, what have I done? I know the blog and this and that and the whatever and the soul chose. I'm trying to make a movie right now. I'm trying to be honest with who I am, but I just felt, I had felt so dead inside and I didn't realize how dead inside I felt. And then meeting you, it's so funny. Like even you talking to me about my podcast intros, because I've kind of fallen asleep at the wheel and this will change whoever decides to follow me after this podcast anyway. But like, I have been asleep at the wheel and you said to me the other day, you went, because you really like my insta stories. I'm not putting these. Yeah, it's true. That's what you said to me. 100%. You're like, wow, you really differentiate your intro to your podcast from your insta stories. And I was like, oh my God, I know exactly what that means. I cannot believe you said it. Cause I already knew that. Like I was like, oh fuck Duncan Trussell sees me. He understands. Like I'm like, phone it in with these like wrote podcast intros. I'm not being like as real or funny or like fucking honest as I could be, which is what I do on my insta stories. Why am I differentiating the two? So it's like so weird. Like even just meeting you, if only for that, you've reawakened something in me where I'm like, get back to who you were when you were just some fucking kid. Like when I was doing my podcast. Oh no, my blog and like street teaming and like had a backpack on and I was like, I was like putting stickers. So that's wild that you would do that. That's crazy. We didn't get into that. I would break into like high school campuses and like climb the fence of Hollywood High, Fairfax High, Marlboro, all girl private school. I would like break onto the campus, try to pretend I was a high school student with a hoodie on and like got stopped by the cops and would like put stickers up and like go to Urban Outfitters and American Apparel and be like, oh, I'm affiliated with like Vice and American Apparel. I would just make up lies because it was like so like, I have to do this. I'm so believing this blog. I want people to get the word out. And then I got a development deal on a show and I stopped doing the shit that got me the corporates. And so like, I forgot who I was. I stopped doing the shit that got me the attention because I thought, well, I'm going to get a show now. I've made it and like, and that's when I, and then I just like kind of slowly die and like things didn't go, it didn't happen. And then I like just enchanted and it's weird like meeting you and doing my Instastories. And yeah, the Instastories. It's so funny. Instastories. It's so embarrassing. We need a better name. Because it's fun. No, but that's what the name is. And it's like, it's so funny because that's like, oh, I'm getting back to the fun stuff. Being funny, being silly, being light, not so much pressure. It's just whatever. Who gives a fuck? Like youthful enthusiasm, like teenage, whatever. And like, and it's, and you zeroed in on that and you like that and like, and then I met you and you're like, cause like we have been like this like lovely wake up reminder and like even, you know, I met you and I'm like writing this movie things. I thought, fuck it. I, all these shows I sold didn't get made. And I know I keep talking about myself. Forgive me, but it's a podcast. And I'm just gonna talk about it. It's your episode. You're supposed to talk about yourself. But I, because of the interest I got in my blog, I got all these, like I sold like six TV shows. None of them got made and like every one of the, every time a show didn't get made, it was like a punch in the stomach. And I, but I keep getting up. Like I do in love when I date, whatever you keep getting up, you keep, you keep getting up. And then at some point I just thought, oh my God, like, I can't, this is exhausting. And then I thought, I want to make a movie. I want to make, so I made a short film in 2016. I made a short film and that was so fun. Over the course of a weekend, it cost $200 to make. It's screened at Cine Family, which is now like. Super great. Well, Cine Family is now in Tatters because like Hadrian from Cine Family is like, we found all these horrible things about it. Google him. It's like another wine scene, weird situation, whatever. But it's, but at the time my short film screened at Cine Family. It was about a breakup, a cathartic breakup short film. And I felt, wow, like I'm alive again. And then I like did mushrooms alone. And I did all these things in 2016. I drove to Sundance the beginning of in a car. I drove to Sundance from LA to Sundance like in January. Like I was doing all these things to be like, I want to do something that scares me like once a week or something. I'm like, we're all just going to die. It's just a question of when and how, whatever. And then, and then somehow after Sundance, I dated this Adderall addict who kind of like really judged everything I do and make. And he just made me go, fuck it. Fuck it. I'm tapped out. I'm done. And then I thought, well, maybe I'll make a movie because I just like more, I'm more in control that I can make a, an indie movie for like a very little bit about money. And that'll be wonderful and inspiring. But I have been a bit dead inside. And then I met you and you're youthful, charming enthusiasm. You know, like, yeah, you're like this magical person. So like in a way it's like, and I was too scared the other day, but now it's Thanksgiving or having a Rosé. And I feel safe with you to tell you, but and all your listeners, listeners shouldn't know like, yeah, it's like you've brought me back to life in this weird way. So I promise, I swear to God, from this day forward, all my work will be better. I promise. Your work is already amazing. Well, thank you for reminding me because I forgot. I forgot. It's an easy thing. Well, no, this is. So thank you. I'm grateful for you. This is what we, I'm thankful for you. But this is holding my hand. You can't see. This is what we call the satsang, which is that we're here to remind each other. This is the thing like the, the wave form of existence is, goes from being awake to asleep, literally. Like we, every time the planet rotates, half of the planet is asleep and half of the planet's awake. It's the most psychedelic thing. It's Terrence McKenna talks about this. It's so psychedelic. The planet rotates. And when it rotates, half of the planet falls in to a deeply psychedelic state. They go into a coma, they close their eyes, and they hallucinate for six to eight hours. Hopefully eight, you shouldn't just sleep for six. So that's called dreaming, right? So yeah, so this is like the, the pattern of life is to go asleep and to wake up. But also the pattern of personal growth is to fall asleep and to wake up. Am I waking up now? Well, I hope so. I hope I am too. But the idea is you want to be around people who remind you to wake up. Yeah, that's you. You don't want to keep you asleep. Yeah. Because sometimes you can get around people. Oh God. And they want you to stay asleep. And if you start waking up, they'll try to put you back to sleep. Yeah. Right. That's what you don't want. That can happen. And that's like, if that happens to you, and this is in Buddhism, one of the prayers is, may you never fall into the company of bad men. And what that means is, don't get in a group of people who are dedicated to keeping each other asleep. Get around a group of people who are dedicated to the understanding that you're going to fall asleep. I'm going to fall asleep. But when I'm asleep, will you please wake me up but do it in a compassionate way? I also feel like the universe has a way of waking you up where it's like, if you're meant to be doing something and you're not doing it, you're going to get shaken. And they're going to shake you up, right? Yes. Like something will happen, but you won't listen to it. You won't listen to it. And then it happens again. It's bigger and it's bigger. And I felt like that happened to me in May. And I got in a horrible car accident. And like, that's why I wanted to make my movie. I told you about this. This is boring because we already talked about it. No, tell the story again because it's insane. You were driving up what you were on the PCH or something. Well, I think I just get, I kept getting caught up in relationships. Like the January story, like I met a guy at Sundance and he was an Adderall addict and he was horrible and was a horrible codependent, terrible relationship. If I had not gotten out of it, I probably would have died because it was all about him. There's so much drama and sometimes you can get into a relationship where you can't pay attention to your life anymore because all the energy has to go towards the relationship. And it's a soul sucker. It's like, it's just like an energy draining suck and it's horrible. But also it's kind of cool because you feel very important. It's very dramatic and it's very exciting because when you make up, it's sexy. Maybe there's a lot of attention put on you but not towards the greater good of your life. But like, so finally, and man, I've been meaning to make this movie. I've been meaning to make this movie that I'm writing that I've told you about for years. I've been meaning to make it. But I would get like, instead I would make men the center of my life and I would get lost in men or lost in whatever I got lost and that's my fault. And then in May, like this past May, I, yeah, I was like, oh God, should I tell you this story? Yeah. In May, I was like, living my life. I was, I borrowed like my mom's like some weird old-timey SUV Ford Explorer and I was like picking up my dad's photos. He's a photographer. I got them framed from someplace. And Marina Del Rey. Julian Wasser, famous photographer. We don't talk, but whatever. I hope he's alive and well. Let me know if he's alive still, you guys. Okay, but so I went to some, but even though I don't get along with my father I have incredible respect for him. So he told me, if you ever get my photos framed, go to this place, Marina Del Rey. So I did that. And so I borrowed my mom's shitty Explorer, picked these photos up from the framing place in Marina Del Rey. I was driving and I'm on this freeway. I don't know what freeway it was, but it's like this very, very high up, like narrow neck of the freeway. And it's like where it meets like the 405. And it's like this narrow neck of the freeway that meets the 405 is like so high up above another freeway. You could like go there to commit suicide. So I'm like on this neck of the freeway. And all of a sudden I start weaving and I'm not texting. I'm not in the story. I'm not listening to the radio. I'm just fucking and I go, what the fuck? What's going on? And I'd never experienced this. So I didn't know what was happening, but my back tire blew out. So, so like, and so my car was lost control. And luckily there was no traffic coming there. There were no other cars, but I'm just like completely just like weaving left and right, left and right. And all of a sudden I start doing donuts, which are like, I start doing like just fucking, I do six complete circles just like and I'm like thinking because it's slow motion. I'm just in my car going, oh my fucking God, what the fuck? Like no other cars are coming. But I'm just doing these circles. I go, oh my God, is this how I'm fucking going to die? Because we all know we're just going to die. It's just like a question of one and a half. Like I go, oh my fucking God, I can't believe this is how I'm going to die coming from the framer. This is crazy. So I do six complete circles and I come out of that and I start like, and I start like, I go backwards towards like the partition, the railing of the freeway. And I'm like just like careening towards like this partition that's like very low or whatever it is, very, what's the word short? I don't know who cares. It's low and I think like, and if I go over this thing, I'm going to plummet to my death. I go, oh my God, like when am I going to hit air? When is the pain going to hit me? I can't fucking believe this. I'm careening towards this partition. I'm going to go over and like, and I just like, I'm like, all of a sudden I'm like praying. I'm like speaking to my angels and I'm like, I'm like, angels, angels, no, I don't want to die. It's not how I want to die. I don't want to die. I can't believe this. I didn't get to make my movie. I didn't get to make my movie. And I didn't think like, oh, I'm not in love. I didn't have a baby. I didn't, weirdly like the thing that I'm like talking to my angels, all of a sudden I'm having a conversation with angels. I didn't even realize I had, but I'm like talking to angels, being like, I didn't get to make my movie, which is this thing I've been putting off for fucking many years, getting caught up in like men that are wrong for me or things that are wrong for me. And like, and so I hit the partition and I think I'm about to go over all the glass blows out of the back of the car. I go, I go, I get thrown thrust back into the middle of the freeway diagonally. I stop all of a sudden, like 50 cars, all of a sudden here are the cars coming, come around from the bend. And I go, oh shit, fuck, I didn't go over the edge. But now all these cars are going to bash into me. This is how I'm going to die. Is this how I'm going to die? And I didn't know this, but later I heard that there was like some rule where you're not supposed to get out of a car and I'm moving freeway because then another car will surely hit you. But I didn't know what the fuck I was doing. So I get out of the car, I grab my phone, I'm shaking, my right leg is like buckling about to buckle, shaking. And I jump out of the car and I just start like running to traffic and going, help stop, please no. And all these other cars are like, fuck you, get out of the middle of the road. What the fuck? Like, because I think I like wanted to be there or whatever. But like, and luckily no car fucking hit me and some people helped me and it's really weird because like one guy pulled over and goes, he starts walking towards me. And I think, oh, maybe I'm going to meet the love of my life. Maybe I'm going to have some kind of love connection here. This one guy goes, he goes, Alexi. And I went, Josh. And it was like the husband of one of my friends who just happened to be on the freeway and I got in his car and he like, anyway, long story longer. Like, yeah, I didn't fucking die in this crazy car wreck. And like, and my main concern in that moment was making a movie. So like, that's my main goal now. But like, yes, but you've awoken me. The car crash that I nearly died and awoken me. And like, yeah, I don't know the point of all this stuff was, but I'm glad I'm alive. The point is that you, that's no, that's crazy. And in that moment of realizing why you want to be alive is such an important moment because that's the Victor Frankel who I've told you about, who wrote Mansearch for Meaning and developed this type of therapy called Logos Therapy. He would ask his patients, why don't you kill yourself? Why don't you kill yourself? That's so funny. Yeah. And the answer came to you as your car was spinning. And why, well, let me ask you this. Yeah. Why do you want to make your movie? I don't even know if I do anymore. No, I do. You know why I want to make my movie? There are a bunch of reasons because I, again, it's just an all in extension of like all the other stuff. I want to be the most honest. I can possibly be, be so vulnerable and raw with like my own experiences and put them into this movie so other people can watch me and be go, wow, me too. Or that gives me permission to do whatever or I feel less alone. But also I love being in the doing of things because then I can get out of my head. Like when you're like shooting something, when you're, even when you're writing something, when you're watching a movie, whatever, when you're writing a thing, when you're shooting something, your like time is different. It's just different. And there's no time for me to be making myself suffer and overthinking and thinking I'm not enough or wondering what that look from that stranger was at the party or if people like me and all this stuff and like, because that's a big part of things I like to talk about like internal suffering and spiraling and like insecurity and like, you know, all the ugly things that people you're supposed to front, like you're so cool and you have everything together. I like talking about all that shit because I feel like that's so universal and real. And when does everybody have to, when do you decide you have to make everything be perfect? But anyway, I get out of my head. So it makes me happier to be in the doing of the making of a thing. And I think making a feature would be like something I'd like to. Yeah, that would help me get out of my own head. It'd be like therapeutic and I'd be proud of myself. And it's like the life fulfillment thing. Cause like if we are just all going to die and maybe this like lifetime is like, so our souls evolve and you get to the next thing or you learn a thing and we are going to die or whatever the fuck happens after all this, it's like, well, cool. So what do I want to do? I want to try mushrooms. I'm going to try MDMA. I'm going to have a lot of great sex. I'm going to like have a great dinner with a bunch of friends and chair. I'm going to make a movie. Wow, I fucking made a movie. That's cool. I'm going to go get up on stage and do stand up. I'm going to like, you know what I mean? So it's like all the things are just like, you do all the things. Cause it's just cool to do all the things. Yeah. Yeah. Cause it's beautiful. Yeah. It's bringing beauty into the world. Yeah. Um, anyway, oh God, I could tell you a million more things, but I won't tell you all these things. But, uh, we'll do more podcasts. We have to do more podcasts now that we're, where can people find you? Where can people find me? Yeah. Instagram and Twitter at Alexi Wasser. And I like to DM with strangers so that could get real weird and fun. Um, and then, and then my podcast love Alexi on iTunes. You, you, you're open to everyone. It's a really beautiful thing. I like, cause I feel like there's a freedom in talking to strangers. Like I love it when people DM me and I'll talk to everybody because I'm the only child living my life alone, longing for connections. So it's so fun. And, and also you can be more of your true self because nobody has some like, uh, preconceived notion of you. No one DM hands off you guys. You better DM me you guys at Alexi Wasser. Love Alexi on iTunes. I'm gonna wait for you. Subscribe if you. Great. Okay. Um, yeah. And then I'll tell you about Russell Simmons almost raping me and, uh, almost having such a Jason Segal later. I can't believe I blew that. I know. It's a huge, And one of my best friends was accused of rape and I get, I keep getting bullied on the internet, uh, about people wanting me to talk about it. And I had a really wonderful exchange finally with a girl who was bullying me saying my deaf, my silence is deafening. I'm not talking about my best friend who was accused online of, of raping people. And we had a wonderful exchange and we got through it. And it was so interesting to have this like lovely communicative exchange with a stranger because yeah, the internet's fucking screaming lately. And it's like, anyway, but it's going to be okay. What do you think is like, what, what would the, like, once we get the masculine and feminine energies, like balanced out here, what do you think the perfect world looks like? The perfect world? Yeah. Like, what would it look like? Like, if you. We'll never have that. No, I know, I know. That's part of it. You need the contrast to know the good stuff, right? Oh, okay. All right. But let's just imagine I've given you access to the simulation to the computer running the simulation and you could then in some way to the best of your ability, produce a utopia where the masculine and feminine energies have finally been balanced. What would it look like? Oh, God. Well, I would like to imagine that we live in a world where it's not one or the other, where it's not like men completely terrified of women because they don't want to come off as rapists. And because I feel like that's what we're getting to right now where men are like, Oh, I'm not going to do anything. I'm terrified. I'm going to hide under this rock. And like, it's like, there isn't in between. There's a happy meeting between that and like full on rapist fucking piece of shit. But, uh, I don't know. What is it? It's a man. So when on a date, he pays for the first dinner and all the stuff after that's utopia to you. It's guys. Utopia is people treating other people the way they want to be treated, even though that seems sick and twisted and not right either. Cause like, who knows what people want and what their weird fetishes are. I don't know. Kindness, grace, communication. I don't fucking know. Being your most honest self. And then you find your people, you find your tribe of people, right? I don't know. How do we get closer to that? How do we get closer to that? You have to learn to not be afraid to be who you are and communicate and say what you need, right? And then you have to, I don't know, be empathetic and loving and not reactive and like, and be okay to say no and wish people well when it's not right. And then you go find your thing. I'll go find my thing and then, and listen to your intuition. And I suppose like you're, I know you don't meditate. I know you, you're a big advocate of not meditating or whatever I hear about you. You meditate so you can tune into, I mean, I think it's the voice of God. That's your intuition. Like, but if that makes you not want to follow me on Instagram, don't get scared. Um, but I don't know. You listen to your intuition, a little voice inside you that's like God telling you what to do. I don't know. I have no answer for that. I'm too tipsy. I'm just saying you just gave a lot of great answers. I hope so. I don't know. Alexi Wassert. Thank you so much for being on the show. You're amazing.

322^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 553: Raghu Markus Transcript and Discussion^2023-02-26^Greetings to you, my sweet, sweet darlings. It is ID True Cell reporting in for my podcast studio at Raytheon in Los Angeles. I'm here visiting. I have podcast studios all over the country, much the same way the United States has military bases all over the planet. I just want to make it so that anywhere I go, if I need to record a quick intro for my podcast, I can do that. And I want to thank the folks over at Raytheon for making that possible. Does it suck to ride an elevator over seven miles to the depths of the earth in a deep underground military bunker and take a tram, which by the way is very slow. I know they could do better. They're fucking Raytheon over five kilometers to a vacuum sealed chamber where I'm currently recording this episode. Yeah, it does. It takes a big chunk out of time that I'd rather be spending working out that I'd rather be spending jogging that I'd rather be spending practicing the new male only sport of burrowing. Now I don't mean that in a misogynist way. It just hasn't caught on with the ladies yet. I'm sure it will. For those of you unaware of the sport, essentially you get together with a bunch of your guy friends, you strip down and you burrow as far as you can into the exterior of a muddy hill. It's dangerous. Sometimes the hills will collapse and sometimes the bodies are never recovered because they get sucked down into the earth. And that's one of the things I love about working here at my podcast studio beneath Raytheon is that we can actually use this incredible lidar technology that sends some kind of signal into the earth and I've been able to identify over 15 people that I was competing with where their body is and it's incredible how fast the earth will suck a naked man down into its core. Regardless, I'm excited to be out in the road again. It's nice to be back in Los Angeles. Missing Los Angeles. It's tough to be out here and see these beautiful green hills in the interstate from my hotel room. The hills I don't miss so much, but God knows, man, the LA traffic. That's the reason many people come to this great city. I certainly did not come for that reason. Originally, I came because I was forced to because of some divorce bullshit, but gradually I fell in love with the traffic and would make it a practice to get out there every day, find the thickest cloud of traffic using. In those days, we didn't even have iPhone technology. We didn't have maps or GPS in the normal sense. So you just had to get lucky, call some of your friends. Hey, did you see any good traffic out there? Watch the news. But yeah, I just get out there in a nice, thick clump of hardcore Los Angeles traffic, put on some Vivaldi, pull my pants down. No one would see it. I had very thickly tinted windows in those days and just spray a variety of condiments onto my genitals. That was a typical morning in Los Angeles. So yeah, it's tough to be out here. Did I rent a car when I got here? You bet I did. You bet I did. And so, at least for a moment, before I had to get down here in this bunker filled with the most obnoxious aliens you've ever met, I got to experience what LA really meant to me, what it really was, which is that, you know what I'm talking about, everybody, that nothing's quite as pleasant. It's just a nice, chilled mayonnaise jar being dumped right on to your penis or whatever you got down there. Just activates you, clarifies some things, helps you understand, yeah, I am a person. Yeah, I have wants, needs, habits, things I react to, things I don't react to that I probably should be. But underneath it all, what am I really? Basically a Caesar salad. I'm just a sandwich. I'm just a bowl of lukewarm French fries that needs a little something extra from the outside world. And that's not money. That's not fame. That's not power. For me, it's either mayonnaise or sometimes blue cheese, Hellman's blue cheese. It just touches that place inside of you. The place you always wanted to be touched. And lots of us try to touch that place using methods that aren't healthy, they aren't good for the community. Some of us try to touch that place by smoking crystal meth. Some of us try to touch that place using the glory hole path, which by the way, I just released a third edition of the glory hole path. It's available on Amazon. I hope you check it out. But when you find out that all you're searching, all you're putting yourself out there to feel again, crack through that shell of numbness that you've come to understand as who you actually are, all of that was wasted because you could have just gone to the grocery store in Calabasas or Sherman Oaks, picked up your condiment of choice, gotten out there in the thick of traffic and blasted yourself down. Like Jesus reaching into the tomb of Lazarus, pulling out Lazarus, his genitals covered with gray pupan or whatever it was that Jesus sprayed on his junk to wake him from the dead. That's how you'll feel resurrected, born again. And you will go back out in the world with a new perspective that you didn't have before. You'll look out and you'll see so many people suffering just like you are. So many people in the rat race looking for an old bit of cheese. So many people out there with an unquenchable hunger, a thirst that they cannot satiate no matter what they do. And you're going to want to go up to them and say, Hey, have you tried just spraying a bottle of ketchup all over your balls or under your taint? And you'll probably do it. I sure did. Lots of us did. But you'll find out that people don't want to hear the truth that they're not ready for it. They don't want to realize that the point of it all here on this, as Carl Sagan called it, pale blue dot. It's not to control the world. It's not to live in some mansion with models, snorting endless rails of ketamine while you play versions of God of War that haven't even been released yet. No. No, no, no. And it's not going into nature. It's not taking your bag of crystals and your handmade sandals to Niagara Falls, meditating in some beautiful mountain temple, zip lining. And it's not, it's not about having kids. It's not about discovering the love that you feel when you, when you see your baby for the first time. It's not about eating. It's not about listening to your dumb animal body when it screams out for food after you haven't eaten for a couple of days. No, it's about getting in that car, getting into traffic and spraying condiments all over the most sensitive part of your body. With us here today is the brilliant Ragu Marcus. He's one of my favorite guests on the DTFH. I love him so much. He is the administrator of the Love Serve Remember Foundation. He's the one who helps organize all the retreats and all of the insane work that that foundation is doing out there. Also, of course, he's my friend. He's one of my teachers in the world. He's someone who has actually sat with Neem Karoli Baba, the great Indian saint. And I always love it when we get a chance to hang out on the podcast.

If you happen to be listening to this the week of February 23rd, I'm going to be in San Jose, the San Jose improv this Saturday and Sunday with William Montgomery. So won't you come out to a show, please? I'd love to see you. Okay, everybody. Welcome back to the DTFH Raghu Marcus. Here we are. We are live. Raghu, welcome to the DTFH. It's good to see you again. You seem very glowy. What's going on over there? Is this some kind of zoom age reversing filter? You've been doing yoga. I guess you always do yoga. I don't do yoga ever. Are you kidding? I do Pilates. I like Pilates. Oh, wow. There is a biscuit. So you never really got into the yoga thing. That's surprising, seeing as how you're surrounded constantly by yogis. Well, yoga is yoga is the ossiness, right? Doing various positions that enhance the flow in one's body. No, I have not been a big, although what I do include some yoga actually. It's like a Pilates yoga combo that I figured it out. So yeah, it's core. It's all about core, especially when you get older. There's something I'm beginning to ask you about. So at the retreat, we watched that and what's the name of the movie you made? I'm sorry, I can't remember the name. I can't remember anything anymore. What's the name of the movie you made? You and me, both, brother. Yeah, brilliant disguise, the Samadhi of KC Tuari, our mentor from back in the day. Such a good movie, so intense. But there was a scene in it that is just, I keep bringing it back. And maybe you could sort of describe this scene, but there's a story of Neem Karoli Baba. I guess he's at the base of some mountain with KC and some other people and these orbs up here. Can you tell that story from the documentary? Yeah. Basically, yeah, this temple ashram was in a valley with high mountains all around, not the snow caps, the foothills, but there's still like seven, eight thousand feet, nine thousand feet. So around this particular valley at the top of it, almost to this day, there have lived yogis in caves. We knew about it back then and really only one actually died, only a few years ago. So they're sitting there, Tuari and Neem Karoli Baba and I think it's getting towards dusk or it's dusk, something like that. And suddenly these orbs that look like saucers come flying from one side of the mountains across the valley to the other. And Tuari said this was some phenomenal experience of seeing these things. And basically what one of the Westerners who actually did the interview with Tuari in that circumstance said he knew of, there was a specific name of an ancient yogi who had lived up there and supposedly can manifest in any different way that that yogi wanted to in terms of having a body, not having a body becoming light and so on and so forth. I think his name was, it was a Rishi, Garg Rishi. Now they're remembered. What's a Rishi? What does that mean a Rishi? Rishi is a sage, like an enlightened sage. This, you know, just the Vedas and everything came from these Rishis, right, emanated through them. So anyhow, so he said this was, you know, probably what was happening that they had these powers and Maharaji in that moment, I guess, opened up Tuari and others, whoever was around their third eye to be able to see it. See it. That's my conjecture. I have no idea. But Maharaji said, what are you making these things out? Do you think like I can do something? You're making me out to be a miracle worker? What the fuck? That's what he said about it. But this is pretty classic for him. Like he consistently denied having any kind of extraordinary powers to people and was always saying it's not me. It's wrong. It's God. It's not me. But the reason of all the amazing miracle stories of Neem Kali Baba, the reason this one really stuck out to me is because these orbs, you know, this is something that people like in the UFO community or people in the UFOs, they talk about these orbs. And one of the threads in the discussion of whatever these things are is that they show up around certain people. Like there are some people, for whatever reason, when you're around them, they appear. And I just thought it was really curious. And I wondered if you had any other, if you ever saw them around them or if you've ever seen whatever these things are. No. Never saw anything like that. And I do believe the reality of being able to connect with phenomena on other planes that are interacting with our plane here, our material plane, that reality is, for me, a given. But it means, I think it infers, to be able to be open, somewhat psychically, to be able to see these. I bet these people have that kind of an ability. And they're open in that way. But in this sense, that's the power of being like Neem Kali Baba, who's no longer bound by polarity and is just part of whatever it is that we call this universe. Then there is the ability to have people being able to have that experience and being able to be open to be able to see. And maybe what some of the UFO stuff that goes on and people experiencing may be part of it is these rishis. Rishis is just a word that was used in the east. There could be brujos or whatever in South America that are able to actually live on beyond coming in and out of a body. There is that's proven stuff, certainly from India and from the east. And they manifest this. And maybe that's part of what people are seeing, not are experiencing. Maybe at the same time, it's also true that we are getting visited. And that's not even a question, I guess, with all of the what's coming out more recently around UFOs and so on. The reality of them is unquestionable. So it's a combination of all this stuff, I guess. Can I do a commercial before you go on? Yeah, go ahead. That movie Brilliant Disguise is now available on Amazon, Google Play, Apple, and Vimeo. Just for a small rental fee, you can stream it. It's really, really good. You all should watch it. It's really, really good. So, I don't know, there's a lot of theories regarding why all of this. One of them being, well, it's because what's happening is we have the technology to record stuff that is moving very fast or to pick up on things that might be cloaking themselves or something like that. And now we're starting to be able to do it. The other one is that, well, the upsurge is because something crazy is about to happen on the planet. And so they're all sort of gathering to show up or whatever this event is or whatever it might be. But I love, you know, that is what I, that's what I was thinking. We know watching it, it's like, oh, wow, that would be so curious and wild. Like, all this whole time we're thinking these things are from another planet. And they're just people living on the planet who have been able to do this forever. And now we're just starting, we have the technology to record it that we didn't have before. Yeah. I think it's, like I said, I think it's, I think it's that. I think it's, it's both. I think it's the ability for transcending off this plane on this planet is to me, you know, pretty much the same thing for somebody who lives on another planet and way advanced and has the ability to transcend limitations that we are just starting to really work through scientifically here. No. Well, yes. And I mean, this, this, the UFO phenomena or whatever, I mean, we call it UFOs now, but innovate it as there's reference to, I don't remember what they call them, some kind of sky cherry, it's people could fly around and that they had these, there's some lost technology back then that allowed them to do stuff. There's in India, there's an area that was referenced in the Vedas that I think has like radioactive material there that would have, one way it would have been generated was from an atomic blast. And so there's references to some kind of weird weapon they had back then or some war thing that they had back then. So who knows? Who knows? We put the planet, it's very old. It's all possible is the one thing, honestly, that I am firmly, I believe experientially positive that it is all possible. There isn't anything that is impossible. Now, of course, we've seen it with this particular being Neem Karoli, Baba, transcending time and space and all of that kind of stuff. And that certainly just reinforces the fact that it's all possible. I meet so many people through the work that I do as the Director of Love Server Member Foundation, because I see, I insisted to be able to see, even though it's overwhelming to a larger degree, all of the mail that comes to info at ramdas.org. And the level of different realities for people, how they're experiencing this stuff, especially Ram Das isn't here anymore physically, is just wild. I mean, wild. It's all possible. And some of it is completely woohoo. And some of it is just wild projections or it's a combination of real projections and woohoo. I mean, you just don't know. That's a great story, Ram Das. You never know. You just never know. It looks like it's something and then it's something else. You don't know. So you've got to go behind all of that bullshit.

I mean, this is, I, this is one of the, I was getting to know you only for starting to become friends. This was one of the more surprising aspects of your personality to me is that I don't want to call it cynicism, but you are, you're, you're very skeptical regarding a lot of this stuff. Like, whereas like lots of people in that community and another fringe, if you want to call them that or outside default reality communities, I guess you say they're more willing to just accept this or that, the story that someone says or an experience they might have had or whatever is being proof of just what you're talking about. But you, you don't seem, you're not like that. Like you seem, is this, do you think this is a result of having spent your entire life hanging around people on really good acid? At some point you're just like, I don't believe, I don't know. I don't think you walked through the wall. I don't think you emanated a golden light. I don't think you levitated. I think you were just high. But I've seen the golden light, so to speak. I've seen the reality of the complete possibility of transcendent, transcendence in any moment. I've seen it. I've seen, you know, of course, because I saw named Karoli Baba and day to day over a period of time, it was all just became a reality. And it just shattered my, you know, mind. But you know, what you're talking about, cynicism, yeah, you know, I love Larry David. So I guess, you know, like I could never get Romdus to watch Larry David. He was too off the wall for Romdus. He was too, you know, nasty. You know, so I work on why I have this thing that I really love that stuff, dark humor, you know, all of it. And but so in this movie, Brilliant Disguise, there's one part which speaks exactly to what I think you're alluding to. And that's named Karoli Baba sends Casey Tuari, right, who's the protagonist in this movie, Brilliant Disguise, it's about him, to go over to a fire ceremony that was happening at the time where they were propitiating maybe the divine mother goddess thing. So here you go over there and do that. So he's over there and nobody knows how to do that better than this man in terms of actually doing a ritual where whatever you're propitiating, whatever you're calling down comes down. I mean, I've never seen it any other time in my life except with this man. I mean, it's just extraordinary. So he's out there. What do you mean, whatever comes down, comes down. The divine presence that's within whatever we're calling that Shiva, or in his case, he spent a lot of time invoking Shiva and Durga, the mother, that was his poojas were centered in that way. So when you're sitting there, yeah, when you're sitting there with him and he's invoking, it's in the movie, you can see what him completely going out, you know, I mean, this is somebody who we would be sitting with him and he went into a state, a trance state called Samadhi, that there was no pulse and no breath. You read about it in ancient mystical books forever, but when it's right there, it's mind blowing. So this is a person who did that. And he could do it when he was invoking. So if you were sitting with him and he was doing this ritual, invoking the divine presence of whoever it may be, you absolutely felt that in your body as it came down, okay, period. And then after a while, I'd get tired. He'd say, yeah, just go sleep. He'd do it all night. And I'd have to go sleep on his bed in India, because I couldn't handle it. It was just... What did it feel like? Like density. I'm sure you have... I know what you're talking about. Yeah. And that's the first thing that happens in absorption in a meditative state, density. And it happened to me when I was nine years old. I didn't understand it until I first started meditating when it happened again. I went, holy shit, this happened when I was a kid. You know, you weigh like 2,000 pounds all of a sudden. And this is... Anyhow, so here's the story. No, wait, don't keep describing it. You weigh 2,000 pounds and there's what? You weigh 2,000 pounds and then there is this sweeping thrill of kind of like when you start to just start peeking on psychedelic. And as your whole body gets filled, it's dense, dense, dense, then suddenly it gets filled with like particles of... It's ineffable to tell you what it is. Joy, it's a stupid... You know, there's only stupid words to describe it. But there is a vibratory thing that happens inside you. And then this kind of spaciousness that happens at this time is extraordinary where you stop having boundaries and you're going out of your body. So... There's levels of... This is... I can't remember the name. In Buddhism, this is described. It's a practice you could do in meditation that starts with you putting your attention. Like when you're meditating, you know, some people, when they're meditating, maybe they'll get to the very edge of it where you start feeling a good feeling. Like basically, like it's a nice... Maybe it's in your heart if you're doing metatractice. Your hands maybe... Peace. Peace is there. Yeah. You start putting your attention on that. Yeah. And it starts off and so the first phase of it is what you're describing. It's this sort of radiating, joyful, warm thing that happens that can get really intense, vibratory even. Like you touched a light socket and then it's followed by what you're talking about the next and it continues to become increasingly like more expansive or something. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know about that. That's a good generalization for going into a meditative absorption state for sure. But he, Tuari, would completely gone. There was no... He would come back after a while and he would get... This would happen under any circumstances. It didn't have to happen that he was meditating at all. I mean, around Maharajji, around him, Karoli Baba, he would... He'd just look at him, boink, he was gone and then he'd look at us and go, what happened to him? What's wrong on here? You know, and he would just dive us. He was like having fun. Anyhow, back to the story. Okay. The story of being... He was sent to do this ritual, not that far from Maharajji, like 30 yards or something. So he's doing it and he's completely into it. And then suddenly here's Maharajji like shouting, what are you doing there? What are you wasting? We're going to die here of hunger because you're doing this bullshit. Stop. Okay. Who would... This was the kind of... So when you talk about rascality, when you talk about cynicism, you talk about... I don't know. Only some of the Tibetan masters, you know, and only like Shirdi Sai Baba, who's one of the great Siddhas of India and, you know, left in 1918, 15, something like that. Only they had that thing. There was no positive, negative, right? They were beyond polarity completely. So there was... In Maharajji's case, he had an irreverence. Okay. What was important to him was bust the casus to feed people, you know, don't make them sit around and pray. And then, you know, he was... That was who he was, is actually. And so that irreverence and stuff. And, you know, it was in Ram Das's humor. It's in... Actually, you can see it in the film with me and Krishna was going back and forth about our experience and so on and so forth. But there are so many stories of this thing. It doesn't have... It doesn't have sanctimony. It's like what's cool. It's like... Because you would think that whatever these rituals are, whatever the ceremonies, they're... They didn't... It didn't start with the rituals and the ceremonies, but it was a by-product of that state that Nibbakaroli Baba or the cities are in. Once you're in that state, you start doing things. And maybe some of those things over time turn into the rituals that people replicate throughout the world. But the first people to do those things, they probably... It's inside out, right? Not outside in. And it seems like Nibbakaroli Baba was trying to get to the nucleus of what any of this stuff is all about. Because you can control a ritual. You can control a ceremony. You can even trick yourself into thinking that you're doing something particularly special because you have managed to bring down some energy or summon orbs, whatever. But all of that is sort of an exterior, a shell or something around something that's much bigger, right? That's not... It's irrelevant. It's irrelevant to the point. It's like people who want to... I'm going to meditate my ass off. And I'm going to... Something's going to happen. I have an expectation that something will happen. And that's especially in the West. It's such a common way. This is how we are. It's goal-oriented stuff. It has nothing to do with... Which is why you'll hear Krishna talk about this and me and others of us. It's about... How can you be a little bit more kind? A little bit more compassionate and loving as a human being. This is what the paradox of the path or whatever people are calling it these days is that rather than shifting you into a state of what we've all been heard a million times, being kind to yourself, loving yourself, forgiving yourself, letting go of all that neurotic bullshit, it doubles the neurosis. You start off a neurotic and you... So you're like, I... This is unbearable. I'm going to start meditating, chanting, going to Ram Dass retreats, listening to Ram Dass audio books, taking ayahuasca, whatever it is. And somewhere in that process, all of a sudden, another level of neurosis appears where now you're walking around like, oh, I'm profane. I've fallen. I'm so impure. I'm horrible. So now it's double horrible. You already thought you were horrible by some intuition. You're doubling the horrible by this practice or this thing you're calling a practice. Oh, here's another story. This is great. This addresses exactly that. Exactly. This is great. So Krishna told me this story and he's repeated a couple of times. He goes to Maui when Ram Dass was alive and every Monday, Ram Dass would go swimming at a beach in Maui. He loved to do that because weightlessness for somebody who's been in a wheelchair for 22 years was phenomenal. So anyhow, he went there and he got there late and suddenly Ram Dass is sitting in his car. Nobody else is around. Krishna walks up to him, looks through the window and he sees he's like, he looks awful, like depressed or something. And he turns to Krishna and he says, we're all fakes. You're a fake too. And Krishna came back with? Yeah, but we're real fakes.

Well, yeah, that's the thing is, you told me and I think about all the time as a real fake. Obviously, we all love to hear that. But that's the sort of the, to me, there's a, I used to watch this interview with, God, what's his name? I love making fun of him. He really upsets people, even though I really like him. It's that guy. He got an argument named Crowley Bob. Oh, Krishna Murdy. Oh, yeah. So Krishna Murdy talking to Chuggum Trumpa and starts off the conversation with why meditate? Life's complicated enough. Why are you adding this other thing that we all of a sudden we all have to do? Like, what is that all about? And I remember watching and really getting annoyed with Krishna Murdy. But lately I keep thinking about, like, maybe he's right. Like, you know, what's the, why add another level of shit you got to do to your life before you can feel okay with yourself? Like, why? Why do you, why do that to yourself? Why? You're saying that. You're saying that? That's ridiculous. Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Yeah, it's ridiculous. These, these things, there's a wonderful balance in just going back to the reality. There is a, of, of us being fakes, right? Which is what you were describing before. You know, we do all this shit and we just, you know, you know, start to feel like a complete moron because we see ourselves doing all of it for the wrong reasons, basically. So then we kill ourselves with judgment and so on. But the reality is, so the real fake is we know that it's okay because we're just little human guys and gals. We know it. And it's okay. And so we don't have to live that story, which just self-perpetuates based on the fact we have so much self-hatred. Okay. We don't have to live that story. So there is a, that's what I mean by a balance. There's a, the balance is we're real fakes. We understand that we are doing this shit and we are self-identifying in all kinds of dark ways. It's okay. We're human. It's okay. And yeah, even though even that part's okay. Yeah, even that. That to me, see, this is like, I love this line of contemplation because I think for me, that I could hear stories about someone walking through a wall, turning in the light, flying around the room, raising the dead. And I can be like, yeah, sure. I believe that, that could be possible. But just when it comes down to me and the idea of being just okay, like this, like this is it, like this is where you're at. This is it. Well, that sounds interminable. Now, yeah, that's, that's, this is it in this moment. Okay. That we understand. In this moment, you know what I mean? The times I've been able to, instead of constantly judging myself for whatever I'm doing that I consider to be out of line, the times I'm just like, no, this is what I'm doing. This is what I'm doing. I'm eating butterfingers. I'm watching forensic files late at night. I'm staying up late eating butterfingers, watching forensic files. And those times when instead of that being an issue, it's just what I'm doing. I don't know if there's much of a difference between that state and states that have happened to me through like the best meditations. I don't know if there's much of a difference. It's just you're, you know, that's bullshit. That's an intellectualization. Come on. You don't know fully become yourself when you fully become blended in to the wave form of your karma and what you are. And this is where you're at. And all of it, the whole thing, whatever the fuck it is, all of it, including the self-reflective guilt, shame, bullshit, all of it, instead of resisting it, you're just, this is what, this is what I am right now. This is it. Yes. Yes. Fully, fully accepting moment. That's an incredible moment. That's an incredible moment because that is not what many of us consider to be a holy moment. When you said earlier, they happened at the transcendent experience or the possibility of waking up or whatever you want to call it. When people hear that, they picture the fire ceremony. They picture the flowers floating in the sea. They picture the sound of temple bells. They don't picture the forensic files narrator going on in the background in some hotel room in Nashville. But I think, I think it can happen there just as much, which is why name curly Baba made a point of popping those bubbles so many times while he was always popping any bubble. Someone was inflating around elevating this moment compared to that. Yeah. But as much as that's, yeah, that's a bit of a, there's a bit of a stretch in there in terms of being a little bit too intellectual. The reality is that moment of the forensic files, that it all comes together. I am human. I am just watching the forensic files. It's all okay. It's as real a moment as some transcendent meditative moment. I'll go along. But my moment last night of watching a Dutch police show that was subtitled, okay, that's how far I went to watch this fucking thing. I'm not even sure that they're speaking German sometime. I can't get it. They did speak French at times and I speak a little French. So me getting, you know, and I'm seeing my, I got the moment, okay, are you really lying here watching this bullshit? You could be as Larry David, you know, in that one scene when he cut high on pot. Can't you read a book? Do you have to watch TV? What's going on? So I could be reading a wonderful, so I had that whole thing of like, you know, I'm tired. And then I went through all the excuses for why I just got to lay here. I can't, you know, maybe I'd watched more than five minutes of Joe Biden on television last night in the speech and people calling him out, you fucking liar. I mean, it's insane what's going on. Anyhow, so that's that moment and it's a legitimate moment. And I have all the compassion for myself being in this moment and indulging that particular way forensic files. It's just this kind of parallel actually show. And then this morning where two lines of the Honomon Chalisa that I chanted as part of my practice this morning became completely transparent. I got him. I got what, you know, and it just the spaciousness. So it just was so self evident. It was just a wonderful moment, you know, and it was just two lines out of the whole. There's 40 of the 40 verses of the just two of them. So that moment, you're saying it's the same moment. It's the same moment, the moment of compassion for yourself in the moment. And then it's the moment of transcendence through a ritual of some sort. And I totally agree with you on one level. On another level, the reality of wanting to change, wanting to not be any longer have any kind of paranoia, fear, separation is powerful enough to do something about it, regardless if the fact is that it's it's all written, so to speak, you you are going whatever is going to happen to you in terms of being able to transcend some of the Coletius, right, the impediments of our existence, greed, lust, anger, blah, blah, blah. The desire to do that means to use some of these practices in order to to have an opportunity to transform yourself through the help of the universe is real as real as what you're saying, it's all parallel. Okay, okay. So I'm going to push back, though I do any time you or David accuse me of saying bullshit, I generally secretly agree with you. But let me just push back a little bit. The Okay, I'll use a different example in the psychedelic community, something that has emerged, which I don't think existed back when you were getting blasted on that incredible LSD that I will be perpetually jealous. You got to meet Neem Karoli, Bobby, you took acid that was given to you by the brotherhood of eternal love. Great karma. But back then, when people were taking acid, and maybe they were saying this, I don't know, I don't know if there was as much talk about healing medicine, when you were taking acid at a acid test in the 60s with Ken Keezy, no one is saying, I'm using this to treat my trauma PTSD. No, this is no one's calling it that no one's calling it medicine. Okay. And the reason that I've always felt a little like bummed by the though I respect it, and I'm glad it's happening because it leads us closer to the end of the prohibition. But the reason I always felt slightly bummed by this sudden putting psychedelics into this cabinet of medicine is because this isn't by taking a medicine, you're implying you're sick. And so when in the spiritual community, the parallel of that is you're fucked up, man. And you want out of this thing. And so here's what you do to get out of it. Here's your medicine. It's the mantra. It's the Hanuman Chalice. It's the meditation. And so even if you're not aware that that's that's what you're thinking, if that's how you get into it, then you are putting yourself in a sand trap where to continue to do these practices that are incredible. And I know those moments you're talking about in the early morning, when you've finally gotten your shit together enough to do your puja or your meditation or whatever it may be, drink water instead of coffee in the morning is the sun is just starting to rise and suddenly it comes down. What you're talking about, it comes down. And it's not what you expected. It's way bigger than your human brain could even comprehend, but instantly familiar and the most beautiful thing. It's your mom, it's your kids, it's all of it together, but there's nothing there but you and the earth. So I know what you're talking about. But when you get into that, because you have this sense of wrongness in your heart, I got to be compassionate to myself. Why do you have to be compassionate to yourself? Well, because I'm fucked up. It's like you end up accidentally affirming and potentially attaching yourself to a broken quality, a brokenness of malfunctioning quality. And then you, it's the same thing could start happening to a psychedelic, someone who loves psychedelics or somebody who loves spirituality that happens to comedians, where you'll hear a comedian say, I don't want to get better. Because if I get better, I won't be fucked anymore. Yeah, I'm not going to be funny anymore. So the same thing repeats in this way instead of removing this, this constant never ending, I'm fucked up, heal me, help me, make me better acid, make me better, Maharaj, make me better, whatever art is instead of being like, no, you're fine. Oh my God, you're fine. You're better than fine. In fact, you're great. There's nothing wrong with you at all. Anything you've been doing is just absolutely okay. It's okay. Oh, boy. See, there's a part of me that like that. You know what I mean? I don't like that. I don't want to be okay. I don't want to be fine because if I'm fine, if I'm fine, then that means this is it. And then that's not a good plan. I get it. I know. I feel for you, actually. See, there you go. You don't feel though. This is what I'm talking about. There's, I think, and again, I'm so good at interpreting shit to gratify myself. But in these stories, Holy Baba, that's what I keep hearing. I keep hearing that. I keep hearing, no, you're okay. No, you're okay. You're fine. You're okay. You're all right. You're fine. And that is the one little bit of the teaching is the most difficult to digest, to process. That's the koan. That's the thing where it's like you will slam into the wall of your attachment right there because you're not, your problem is an attachment to vaping, to Dutch police dramas, to forensic files. Your problem is you're attached to the fucking idea that you're a mess when you're not. Golly Moses, that's why I'm a mess. West Side Story. Holy shit. And by the way, Meese, poor you is poor me. We are all doing what you do. We are all doing the same thing. It is not different. I wouldn't even be having these thoughts if not for associating with you people. I mean, that's the thing. I'm saying like, this is years and years of hanging out with you all and years and years. This is like, is I get even somewhere close to the proximity of loving myself? Within it, I just realized, you know what? You're going to have to give up. You're going to have to give up not loving yourself. You're going to have to give up that the fraudulence is in that you're acting like a holy person and you're not. The fraudulence is that you're acting like you're a piece of shit when you're not. That's the fraudulence. Yes, but you're real. It's real fraudulence. We just had that story. It's real fraudulence. Why? Because fortunately, we have been granted this wonderful karma of having mindfulness and being on that part of the practice that most of us engage with, which I highly recommend to absolutely everybody, is having awareness of the kind you are speaking to, that we fucking hate ourselves, that we judge ourselves all day long, that we do practices and so on because we want to get an A on the exam, that we have a perspective that we see, fortunately, that looks out at life from that complete separation angle. We are separate individuals from everything and anybody and therefore we see that and we see the fear we have and the defensive mechanisms with everybody around us and the manipulations that we do to get what we want. We see it so clearly. It's just, it can be just over the top and so let's accept that. We have that. Well, then you have kids, no, I'm saying that will remedy some of the guilt you might have about being manipulative because you're like, why did I turn into this manipulative thing? Then you have kids, they're fresh out of time space and they've barely been able to talk and right away, they start lying, manipulating for sure. I'll come downstairs in forest. I know that in the morning, there's no way in hell that Aaron is like, forest, you can have another slice of your birthday cake before I have to drive you to school. We're going to give you just a lot of sugar as I write before I have to comb your hair and get your shoes on. But he will look at me like an angel and be like, daddy, mommy said I can have a slice of birthday cake and you're like, wow, that's incredible. You're gaslighting. You're free. You're gaslighting already. This is amazing. It's built into us is what I'm saying. It's built into us. So that's why that's the human quality. It's okay where human is the mantra. It's okay where human, but that doesn't mean that we, the perspective of self-identifying with that cynical, separated, hurt individual is, I mean, it's erroneous. Well, this compassion to the separated, broken, hurt individual is actually, you know what you're doing every time you do that? I think you're sitting down and you're blowing your blow up doll. You're blowing up your blow up doll that you have been like of the neurotic you every time you're like, oh, I forgive you. You're just human. Blow it back up. Blow it back up. You're going to do that until it explodes. You're going to, we are doing that until it explodes. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JCPenney.

We just are and that's just reality. The moment that we get awareness, which happens, and it can be through all the different means that we've been talking about, including psychedelics, and we get that awareness and then we're able to back into the real place, which is more of the intuitive place behind the mind and the thoughts and the stories and what you and I have been doing for years now, trying to put together from the movie of me to the movie of we is exactly what we're describing. I want to introduce this one thing that I mentioned to you earlier before we got on. It's something called wise selfishness. So this guy, Dan Harris, many people know him. Dan's got a great show, 10% happier, and he went to see his holiness and he thought in the way he's saying selfishness. It's a bad rap, which for the most part is richly deserved. Nobody likes people who hog the ball or Bogart that join. Because we see in those people a reflection of our own lurking capacity for greed. We say we care about others, but as George Carlin used to say, we still take the bread from the middle of the loaf. And then he goes on and says research says a compassionate generous people are happier, healthier, blah, blah, blah. Yet we all need to have some self-interest. If we lived in a state of, and this is addressing exactly what, and you'll get this right away, state of perpetual, perpetual, altruistic concern, refusing to speak up for ourselves and generally being doormats, that would constitute, and he doesn't say the name, but what Trump a Rinpoche calls idiot compassion. That is just takes everything we've been just talking about in terms of reflection on ourself and the way that we define ourselves and then trying to give compassion to that horror that lies inside. That's idiot compassion, right? So he goes, yeah, it's compassion for all the wrong reasons. It's compassion. I think you could argue it's cowardice. Cowardice. Okay. Yeah, absolutely. So anyhow, he goes to India, you know, and he talks to his holiness, the Dalai Lama about it, and he has, he has a theory, exposing the false binary between selfishness and selflessness. He called it wise selfishness. We all have an inborn penchant for self-interest, his holiness says. It's natural, nothing to be ashamed of, but he says, a truly enlightened self-interest also means recognizing that acting in generous and altruistic ways makes you happier than solely being out for yourself does. Right. Okay. That's Ram Dass is that you live on more than one plane of consciousness at the same time. That's the key to all of this. He said, thinking, his holiness says, thinking in a more compassionate way is the best way to fulfill your own interest. He added that his own practice was to think about benefiting other people as much as possible. The result, I get benefit. Altruism does not mean you completely forget your own interests. No, he said. And so the so wise, the important thing for wisely ambitious people, which you and I would kind of fall into that category along with most other people, is to remember that other oriented states such as altruism and compassion, which you can think of simply as our innate capacity, innate capacity to care, pull you out. This is the key. Certainly is the key for what we're trying to from the movie of me to movie of we pull you out of the exhausting loops of self involvement into which we are so often thrust by modern society with its emphasis on individualism, consumerism, and the frantic aggregation of likes for selfies. Okay. If you want to do selfishness better, work to cultivate a compassionate mindset. Research suggests that compassion and altruism are not unalterable factory settings, but skills to develop. So this goes back to why do we meditate? Why do we follow mindfulness practices? It's we can, you know, through and we know this through neuroscience, we can actually change these neurotic tendencies and habitual patterns. And we can develop the skills that are innate. We do give a shit about each other. We really do. Yeah. Yes. I mean, God damn right, we do. I mean, if you care about yourself, you care about other people because, you know, this thing you call yourself is just an imaginary friend you've invented anyway, right? It's just some bundle of karma that you've decided is you. So if you're caring about that, you're shoveling butterfingers into its mouth to try to make it happy as you watch forensic files furiously masturbating the porn or whatever you're doing, you're serving somebody, you know, and I got to tell you what you just read it answered a question for me. Something I was wondering about and something I know you have experienced as anybody who gets into the spiritual universe has experienced a spiritual person. They look great. They're wearing the spiritual clothes. Their skin is amazing. They can do the plow position in yoga. And yet somehow leaking out of them is something so mean that seems to fly in the face of all of it. We're like, what the fuck is that? There's something in there that's like as mean, like there's a snake hiding in that beautiful, beautiful forest that you have so spent so much time cultivating. And I think I see what the snake is. I see what it is now. It's like, oh, I get it. You couldn't figure it out. You couldn't figure out a way to love yourself really. You couldn't figure out a way to accept what you actually are. And because of that, you went outside in, you tried to cultivate like a good body, the right, you know, Birkenstocks, whatever the fuck it is, these amazing Mala Beads. Oh my God, these Mala Beads have been blessed by the seven saints of the seven holy mountains of earth. And because all of that traveling to the seven holy mountains of earth to meet seven saints to get them to bless your dumb Mala Beads was easier than having to deal with your own reality, finding a way to like sync up with what you actually are. And so then that leaks out. So that thing you're talking about. Wise selfishness. It's wise selfishness is, yeah, first figure it out like you've got to sync up with the way you are right now. Like that's it. Do that. Do that. And then in the midst of that, yeah, do your experiments and benevolence with people around you. My God, what's better than cooking a nice meal for someone and watching them eat it and how happy they get and feeling those those the the the the neuro receptors, the synapses in your brain just spray pleasure chemicals out because obviously like how the hell did we make it this far as human beings on this planet? It wasn't from keeping food to ourselves. That's for sure. There's obviously built in endogenous physiological reward mechanisms for doing the thing that is going to perpetuate the species. That's what he's talking about there. You shouldn't. But if you haven't figured out a way to deal with the fact that you're allowed to feel good, you're allowed to feel good, whatever you may be doing right now, you're actually allowed to just enjoy it. Trust yourself. Trust yourself that maybe this thing you're doing right now that is appalling on some level to some holy person you've invented in your mind is what you need to be doing right now. And then if you could do that, then I think the other stuff naturally would follow. You know, I'm just saying I something happened where I recognize my god, I've like managed to add another level of neurosis to my already neurotic mind by holding myself up against people like me really bought in the same way. I mean, he even says here, instead of measuring ourselves against the Dalai Lama, we can use him as a useful poll star. A reminder that we can all train our minds to make marginal but meaningful strides. Really. I mean, this is just more simplistic reality. Even people like me who fear they're irreparably black hearted and even you. So it's back to Ramdas. You get to the point. It gets so heavy. You see all this bullshit in you and you go and in his case, you know, a great teacher and you go, I'm fake. You're fake too. You're fake. Bullshit going around the world singing Kirtan. He didn't say that. He just said you're fake. But Krishna's broke the ice in a way that completely transformed the moment to realize by saying, yeah, but we're real fakes. In other words, we are okay with all of the perils of self hatred, all of the perils of fear and separation. And it gets even more exaggerated when you are actually teaching with people and you have to be on the spot or you have to be on the spot when you go out and do your act. Yeah, but when I do my act, I don't have to like put, I'm not like trying to, I don't have like a pedigree. People are coming to see me do stand-up. They're not coming to see me do stand-up because I'm meditated with some. No, but they're coming up to see there. But they're looking at you as a human that they are getting a certain kind of transmission from that's beyond the humor because that's who you are. You are naturally doing that. That's why you get people coming up to you after too. And speaking to you in ways that separate themselves from you as someone higher and all of that kind of stuff. So you try to stop that as quick as you can. I mean, that's the job. It's like, and I think that if you really want to become a not a, not a, if you really want to come to the poisonous fake that maybe Ram Dass was worrying about or that Ram Dass had gotten caught up and maybe whatever part of it himself was that, then you stop doing that very necessary and kind of frustrating thing where as quickly as you can, you make them, you not, you make them like knock your whatever idol they've constructed of you down. And because again, and I think that there's that's where you branch off in two different directions. If you stop deciding to do that, or even worse, you start believing that their projection is you, then oh my God, yeah, that's now you're on your way to Johnstown, baby. Now you're headed like this is what yeah, that's way beyond what we're talking about. That's, you know, that's insanity. What we're talking about is hollow bus. Yeah, insanity. We're talking about that's why I love this story. I love the way it happened with Ram Dass and Krishna. I love the way because that's what Ram Dass represented his whole life, being honest with himself. So in that moment, he was just expressing his own fear and his own separation. And Krishna busted that, you know, by not responding in the way. Yeah, we're just fucked up. What are we going to do? You know, Krishna is the master of that. He's so good at that. He's like throw these little throwing stars that will just completely like, like set you back on the path. It's so wild how good he is at doing that. It's really interesting, real quick little things he says. Yeah. And so I think this story, in other words, all I'm trying to say this, this came out. And it's something you and I are repeating right now and remembering. And we're using it to reflect our own insecurity, our own fear of separation, our own self reflective selfishness. And it serves as a purpose. It serves wonderfully in being able to just like, okay, it's again, yeah, we are that. But at the same time, we are not that it's, we can live on both of those planes at the same time, which is wise selfishness, which is really what this is about. You're selfish, just like you're, that's the way it is. And that's how you are right now. Not you do. I mean, in general, if you're human, you know, one of, I think this ties into what we're talking about. And I'm pretty sure it was Krishnadasi said this. You can trust people to be who they are. Now that you see, I think like once I remember, I remember, yeah, and I'm getting frustrated with people when I'm like, annoyed with people are when someone's not meeting my expectations or following through with something maybe they said they would do. It's like, yeah, but that's not who they are, like who they are as someone who maybe doesn't follow through with what they say they're going to do all the time. What they are is somebody who at this point in their life, in a lot of times, those people are riddled with guilt for their inability to follow through with what they're going to do. They're, they're, they haven't gotten to the place where they're like, I'm authentically a slacker. I'm authentically a person who doesn't get shit done. So they're secretly just broken inside because they haven't embraced that part of themselves. I mean, this is what I mean. If you want to make that transit from, from, from, you know, to the point of being able to have this not idiot compassion, compassion, compassion for people, it's not going to come from having compassion for a person that isn't even there anyway, a person you've invented in your mind. It's, it's, it's going to come because you found a way to have real compassion for that part of you that is authentically, authentically selfish, depraved, profane, blasphemous, filthy, addicted, crazy. This isn't all you are, not all you are, but it sure as hell a big part of you. And it's not going anywhere until you address it. And the way to address it is not by ignoring it or beating it up. The way to address it is like, okay, what? Okay, you can live in the basement. I know you're down there and I'm weaving the door unlocked this time. I'm not going to keep opening the door and throwing slop down there to you like some kid in the, like in the deep South or in England or whatever. Remember, you know what they used to do? They used to take kids that had some disability and throw them in the basement. It was a shame. And then they just like throw gruel down there or old, like, I don't know, Oliver twist shit down there, throw him an old bit of leather and some coal. And then they'd stay there the entire, their entire life stinking up the house. So I think the move is to like recognize you've done the same thing. You've done the same thing to yourself. Before you judge those people who put their kids in the attic or in the basement, recognize you got one in you. It's just lonely as shit. And all it wants is for you to love it and stop questioning why it does this shit. It does because it does those things because that's what it is. Then when I, when you do that, oh my God, all of a sudden you're due, you can do that for other people for real. So then when someone's sitting in front, yeah, you do that for me to get to that. Well, that's exactly to get to that realization where you're what you're talking about. It takes us something, a fulcrum, a leverage to be able to get behind this self-identification that you're talking about. It takes us something. Now it can be, it can be a conversation with a friend. I mean, you know, we've done this a billion times, you know, and it's enlightening for both of us. And it's, it's, it's going to a retreat. It's taking a, you know, a psychedelic. It's, it's reading a book. It's hearing a chant. It's, it's whatever it is. But there is some fulcrum that just shifts the direction enough so that the perspective isn't lost the way it was. But to think that you are automatically just going to say, I accept myself. And, and by the way, you know, you can, I'm gonna, you can use this to hang out and we'll have a cup of tea occasionally, making friends with the demon, right? It's called, we can do that. To get there, it, it, there has to be a realization that at the same time as I'm allowing myself to be who I am and stop judging all of this stuff, and we're all doing that all the time, at the same time as that happens, me, I'm also seeing in the Teresa, after I had, you know, fucked up dreams all night from this, this horrific Dutch, German, I don't know what Belgium, it's, you know, I don't know what it was, it was just, it was incredibly well done. And it took over my mind. And, you know, and so I got up in the morning and did my chelisa at the same time, knowing, okay, I watched the Dutch police show. Okay. Two wings of the bird, two wings of the bird. You've got to have, let yourself have the greasy, just covered wing of the bird, but let yourself have the, you also have another wing, and maybe more than, maybe you're a biblical angel, you've got lots of different wings that are different things, Ramadan's level of conscious, but yeah, I think like one of the hidden traps of spirituality is that you accidentally start hating yourself. You don't even know you're hating yourself. You're telling yourself, oh, I'm having compassion for myself. That's not compassion. Compassion doesn't feel like shit. When you're having compassion for yourself, it doesn't feel like shit. When someone's truly being compassionate to you, they're not secretly judging you, because that sucks. When someone comes up with that. It's much easier, by the way, with another person, you look in their eyes, and you can see they're full of shit, or they're not. With us, we have so much garbage going on and layers that we don't even know sometimes that, you know, are we really, are we, you know, you're doing that. But you got to remember, this is all, go back to, oh, this section of this, the movie we did with Ramadan's Becoming Nobody, and Jamie, the director, you know, says to him, you know what, I wake up in the morning, it's, I'm so fucked up, that before anything happens, I am this primal fear in my stomach. You know, what, and Ramda said, it's your thoughts. No, no, before I even have a thought, I have this fear that runs courses through my, oh, it's your thoughts, it's coming from a thought, it's all a thought, it has no substance whatsoever, Jamie, you know, and they have that conversation. That is what we're talking about, you know, so to grab on too much to all of the, looking at oneself and seeing all this enormous, giant bullshit is another thought. It's another thought. There you go, that's the story. Well, the thought is the story, right? This is the, you know, I think one of the, as you, you know, as you start doing that thing, where you stop running away from there, your freakish little English mutant living in your basement and you start going down there and like spending time with the mutant guy. I don't know, it just popped out of me, but it's like, when you start, when you start doing it, you know, when you start spending more time with it, you realize, oh, this, everybody is sharing a basement like this. I might now, the way I describe my mutant boy might be different from the way you describe your mutant boy. My mutant boy might have fins or like gills or like an extra eye, lady eats rats. Don't let the dog get down there because the dog won't come back. Your mutant boy might be different via story, but the thing itself, the thing itself, I'm starting to think it's not different at all. That the core, what Jamie was talking about or that core coal of suffering that is in us is absolutely identical and that the way we get from the movie of me to the movie of we isn't via some necessarily some benevolent embracing of all people, even though secretly you think most of them suck, but rather playing around with the idea that when you're experiencing that thing pre-story, you're experiencing humanity as a whole. This is the singularity of the human experience. That's what you're, that's what you're, that our connectivity is via, potentially one of the modes of connectivity is via a recognition of our mutual, shared, non-different, non-unique suffering. Do you know what I mean? Absolutely, 100 billion percent correct. Absolutely. And interbeing, we can call it once we realize that. And of course, psychedelics give you that big hit of interconnectivity and interbeing. And yes, we all, I mean, his holiness says, the Dalai Lama keep quoting him today because I love this wise selfishness thing, but we all are the same. We all want happiness. We all just want a little bit of happiness. And we are all suffering and there's a struggle and we get to learn how to not struggle so much with the struggle. Somebody said, oh, a beautiful Rinpoche the other day I had on a podcast is our Rinpoche. Just take it a little easier on yourself around the struggle with the struggle. You know, I thought that was so great. Yeah, that was so great. Yeah, absolutely 100%. 100%. I'm seeing you again. My God, you look so great. You're thinner, maybe you've been losing weight. Quite drinking. Oh, good. Really? I haven't had a drink in like eight months and I lost all that booze weight that I put on over the pandemic. It just melted off. And now I'm like, yeah, you lose weight when you quit. It's weird. I know a lot of people probably don't know this, but drinking every day is not good for you. It's like it could be bad for you. I don't know. I've been trying to contact some people in the medical community because I don't think they're aware of the fact that alcohol is poisonous, but hopefully they'll get the word out because it'll get there. Yeah, absolutely. 100%. Yeah, thanks, Roger. You look great too. You look great. I miss you. I wish you lived out here in Austin. I wish we could go shooting together. Shooting? Shooting. You know, the gun range. Oh, that sounds like this is what you do. You move to Texas and you're shooting shit and barbecuing stuff. That's good. Oh, God. All right, I'm going to sign off and it was so great to be here. Roger, thank you so much. You are the best. I'm so lucky to have you as my friend. Thank you so much. Love you. That was Roger Marcus, everybody. Big thank you to all our sponsors.

It is I, Duncan Tressel, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast I Bow in Your Direction. Today's episode features the amazing Nick Kroll who has an incredible show that is on Comedy Central right now called The Kroll Show. He's several seasons in. This is the last season. Nick Kroll actually had the guts to end the show prior to it being cancelled which is a really novel thing. A lot of times people let their show experience the same kind of life as their pet. They have a lot of fun with it and then they keep it around a few years longer than maybe it needed to be because the poor little thing can barely walk and it's peeing all over the floor and anytime it moves you can hear the remaining vertebrae and it's rapidly disintegrating back click like an old lady's high heels walking through a graveyard. Nick Kroll had the guts to actually end his show and move on to brighter and better things and he's a really cool guy and it was nice to get to sit down with him. We're going to jump right into that but first I want to offer those of you who have seen American Sniper what I would consider to be an antidote for the diarrhea of propaganda that got sprayed into your mind by that movie. This is Charlie Chaplin and it is from the movie The Great Dictator but for those of you who went to American Sniper and sat in the audience and felt that sinking horrifying feeling that comes from realizing that not only are you in the presence of some really hardcore, disgusting propaganda but you're also surrounded by people who maybe aren't aware of the fact that they are getting hypnotized by the military industrial complex and that really you're not in a movie theater you're at the very top of a water slide that could lead to your nearest recruiting office. That's a really creepy invasion of the body stat snatcher style feeling that happens when you're sitting in that theater and this speech by Chaplin is the cure the balm and it is my wish to slowly and softly rub it into your heart chakra with my raspy lesbian voice. So here it is Charlie Chaplin's famous speech from The Great Dictator if you've already heard it listen to it again it's a really important thing to get this kind of information out into the world when a movie like American Sniper is actually doing good at the movie theaters instead of having the effect that you see at 3 a.m. at an underground warehouse rave in Los Angeles which is causing people's eyes to roll back into their heads over and over and over again. Here it is Charlie Chaplin from The Great Dictator. We all want to help one another human beings are like that we want to live by each other's happiness not by each other's misery we don't want to hate and despise one another in this world there's room for everyone and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone the way of life can be free and beautiful but we have lost the way greed has poisoned men's souls has barricaded the world with hate as goose stepped us into misery and bloodshed we have developed speed but we have shut ourselves in machinery that gives abundance has left us in want our knowledge has made us cynical our cleverness hard and unkind we think too much and feel too little more than machinery we need humanity more than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness without these qualities life will be violent and all will be lost the airplane and the radio have brought us closer together the very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men cries out for universal brotherhood for the unity of us all even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world millions of despairing men women and little children victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people to those who can hear me I say do not despair the misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress the hate of men will pass and dictators die and the power they took from the people will return to the people and so long as men die liberty will never perish soldiers don't give yourselves to brutes men who despise you enslave you who regiment your lives tell you what to do what to think and what to feel who drill you diet you treat you like cattle use you as cannon fodder don't give yourselves to these unnatural men machine men with machine minds and machine hearts you are not machines you are not cattle you are men you have the love of humanity in your hearts you don't hate only the unloved hate the unloved and the unnatural soldiers don't fight for slavery fight for liberty in the 17th chapter of st lucas written the kingdom of god is within man not one man nor a group of men but in all men in you you the people have the power the power to create machines the power to create happiness you the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful to make this life a wonderful adventure then in the name of democracy let us use that power let us all unite let us fight for a new world a decent world that will give men a chance to work that will give you the future and old age and security by the promise of these things brutes have risen to power but they lie they do not fulfill that promise they never will dictate us free themselves but they enslave the people now let us fight to fulfill that promise let us fight to free the world to do away with national barriers to do away with greed with hate and intolerance let us fight for a world of reason a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness soldiers in the name of democracy let us all unite i think i've actually played that on this podcast before so forgive me i just needed to psychically gargle with that stuff

record this intro and doing this really embarrassing long cliche filled anti-war rant and i listened to it and i was so embarrassed to hear my raspy lesbian voice vomiting out the exact same thing that so many other uh low test i don't know if i have low test but i think if you heard my voice and had to bet i have a feeling i know where your money would be so i don't know just something about listening to to myself rambling on and on about something i think we all already know which is that war sucks and we want it to stop really really embarrassed me so i i didn't just sit down to record this i've been sitting here in my studio for hours trying to record it and now i'm just gonna upload it because i gotta go on tour and i'm not gonna have time to put a podcast up this week if i don't get a podcast up today so here we go that let's dive right into this episode today's guest is the creator and star of the kroll show which you can watch on comedy central have links to that at dunkintrustle.com he's also a super funny stand up funny stand up and all kroll related links will be located in the comments section of this podcast everybody now welcome to the dunkintrustle family hour nick kroll you a clear microphone you've got here thank you my friend these microphones according to the box were the same microphones the same model used by michael jackson really to record thriller really isn't that amazing uh because i was thinking like i remember hearing about a guy who had access to algreen like the microphone that algreen used to do a bunch of his like a guy in memphis who had these like microphones that were very special very special i mean and you know with a podcast you really want to capture the depth of your voice like that's what people are in it for you got a great voice nick kroll i'm feeling it right now it's it's i think i sound a little under the weather or something if there's a there's a deep rich velvety timber yeah you've got a serious velvety timber you have a beautiful voice but it's a higher it's a raspy lesbian trucker voice but i appreciate i've come to terms with my crap voice it's just an embarrassment your voice matches your face oh thank you that you know i that's interesting because some people say it doesn't some people think when they hear my voice they think of like a woman with like a middle-aged woman with short hair who smokes really so that's cool man well it's always when you listen to the radio or podcast you're like what does that person look like because oftentimes you don't know and i'm always like because sometimes radio voices are so sexy or whatever that you're like oh i bet she's so beautiful or but he's a real handsome guy and then you see him and you're like oh it's just like a balding weirdo with a big fat tummy yeah you're neither of those oh not yet you're fit not well mildly fit but nick thank you so much um yeah that's a curious thing and also it's the same thing is sometimes when you see a person who has a very beautiful body yeah but inside there's just maggots yeah yes but the maggots cover up love not to be completely negative it's just there's sometimes a layer of maggots the maggots are feasting on the love inside that's a very interesting question yeah i think the maggots are feasting on the thing that the desperate resistance to just being sweet that's what i hope but maybe people are nasty all the way down i think there are a couple real nasties to the core really but i i don't think many or i i've chosen to look at people who i find to be either shitheads or mean or monsters or whatever that like all of that is manifested from a place of self-hatred right and so if you can if at least you don't have to like them but at least you can pity them right which is way way worse than being mean to them yes yeah right yeah i remember somebody i i don't remember you said it but he said the the worst insult that you can give a person is to feel sorry for them there's nothing worse you know because it's like to if you just tell someone you suck you're a cunt you're kind of at their level right but when you're like man i really feel bad for you yeah people are like oh god jesus christ yeah it's very similar to when someone comes up to you and asks you if you're are you okay oh interesting you're like yeah why do i do i look i seem not okay yeah and that'll ring in your head for days like oh my god what is it that i like i know because we all kind of feel a little not okay all the time oh yeah we're all on the verge all on the verge of what throwing ourselves off a fucking bridge yeah that is true i love that you're really say that i think that's a real a real like gift to the world just if everyone just would admit like hey guys we're all completely yeah on the precipice of throwing ourselves into oblivion people feel so much less inclined to act like everything's okay yeah i'm shocked i'm shocked uh i'm shocked that more i'm shocked that more people aren't killing themselves yeah i just i mean i'm i wish it were a joke because i'm and i won't it's it's i'm flirting with material that i'm working working on but it's because i'm thinking about it a lot which is i have an amazing life and uh and yet i'm still uh quite um i'm i think i'm actually a pretty relatively happy person but there are still a lot of times where i'm like what are we doing what am i doing here what are we all doing here yeah like this is either boring or super sad right like what is the point of this and i'm not telling anybody to go do anything to themselves um unless they tape it and i can jack off to it but the worst fetish that is the most expensive fetish because like you have to get a prostitute to kill herself because it's not good enough to kill it wouldn't be good enough to kill the person that's not what you get off on you actually need to find someone about to kill them and the and if the lighting's not because i don't want to watch it live i need to see a video of it because so i can replay it you know like i don't want to be there live and it's not a i'm not as scared of being caught it's more just i don't know it's something about it's tied to internet porn for me i need to see it in like a four by six screen what would be the name of that kind of porn um you know like the little you get you yeah you're looking at porn there's always that yeah the genre list yeah represents all possible fetishes yeah i mean it's i mean the obvious would be like well i mean shit there's there are the suicide girls so it's like the real suicide yeah yeah yeah that'd be amazing yeah Jesus they would be like the real housewives yeah well you know that would be it's only the i think the reason that that is such a suicide in general or jerking off someone committing suicide is like such a horror to imagine uh is is because we don't know what happens yes correct you know if we knew that on the other side of death was some kind of expansive free anything you can think you can have traveling through time ecstatic nirvanic bliss state yeah this planet would have such a very low population density like right everyone be like oh let's get out of here it'd be like Detroit it'd be like a place that maybe you accidentally have to drive through but you don't want to hang like you go what are you doing why are we here yeah it would it would not many people would be here i would reckon i would think i was i was in Detroit last winter uh doing a show and i went out for a drink with a guy who i knew who lived i think in Ann Arbor but knew Detroit and it was truly i mean it's truly like um uh desolate you know but and snowing at night and we're driving you know we're going and he's like i'll take you to like a distillery you know because that's the thing is now that like hipsters are moving in and starting their like distilleries and art spaces and stuff so it was like this cool bar but in the middle of i mean like Armageddon right post apocalyptic it's it's intense the first american ruin is what detroit is called really yeah the first it's a ruin oh yeah it is i've been there i went to mark ridley's comedy castle you ever performed how was it it was terrible was anybody there uh we'll see you know when i went to perform there this was before i'd started like really podcasting this is in the very beginning of it so now when i go to shows i i get fans from the podcast and it's beautiful shout out to the fans hello fans but the uh at that time it was just like you know that where you get the random roll of the dice when you're doing comedy sure sure sure cut that thing at a comedy club so it's like some cool people some people you're not sure of and then there's the table of disabled elderly veterans that decided to come to a comedy show and they're there they can't wait they can't they can't wait for your demonic puppetry yeah exactly man and that comes out and you just feel bad for yourself and bad for them and bad for the whole yeah you're like because you can't be angry with them you're like you're not my demo i'm so sorry that you have to i know that you're not going to like this it's not your fault but i'll also become insecure and angry with you for it yeah exactly it's not it is i do kind of blame them in the sense that like if you were going to see if you go to see a movie you at least look at like well what is this movie like right but comedy is different from that in a sense yeah it's like i'll just go see a comedian yeah man i couldn't i think i couldn't deal with touring that way early on i was like i'm not going on the road until like i can fucking have people know who i am wow go on the road how long have you been doing comedy i started in oh two i guess really like i moved to new york and started doing open mics and taking class at ucb so and then and i was doing stand-up but i was doing real you know kind of alty alt stand-up and character stuff and didn't really start focusing on doing stand-up in a real way till you know probably like 0506 or something oh wow and when did so when did the things start when did you start feeling the momentum that like stuff was taking off for you um i don't know i mean i think like i don't know because i feel like you know it's all these like markers like i feel like careers are all these like weird little internal markers like i remember there's a show in new york called invite them up which was like a big uh alt show that Eugene merman and bobby tisdale ran and it was like the cool booked weirdo show it was like doing like comedy death ray and in LA and um and i remember getting booked on that and being like being like more nervous to do that show than i was to do like like uh you know kimmel yeah you know um and so because those alt shows can be just because in your mind you you're you look at those like if those guys don't like you yeah then there must be something wrong with sure but i i had the same thing i i didn't go to the store i didn't go to the comedy store until ran as easy you know who was like a homegrown i mean i think yeah you came up with him there like was a homegrown guy and like we were on the league together and then like i got invited to the store but i wouldn't step i was scared shitless to go do a set there wow like it's all the unknown wherever you are it's the unknown it's like doing your set doing a show still like if i were doing a set at a random place on the road now and it wasn't like a show of mine yes i'd be fucking freaked out wow you know because you're just like and and then also doing shows on the road now where it's like it's my show it's like shit now there's an expectation for what i'll do you know it's just like you know you can you can at least there's a lot of like i've found i've now had access to some very very interesting powerful very successful people in hollywood yeah and they're all everyone's insecure and wants to kill themselves i love that you're saying that and it is true and you know what it means man i think that means that you respect the audience and that you respect uh the what you're doing because the day that i'm not nervous about performing yeah that's a bad day like if i'm sitting there and i have a show coming up and i don't feel butterflies or worried or freaked out that means something's wrong that means i'm numbed yes you're just cruise control yeah yeah and i and i i think that that's a real thing and i think it makes it also it's like it's a bummer when you see people like um who are touring or doing a show you know or on a show and they're just like checked and good you know god bless them people have to do their job and make a living but it's a bummer because like we got into doing all this because it's like this weird crazy fun creative thing that we get to do you know and then when it just becomes this like not gonna go cash the paycheck you're like oh it's a bummer but you you you are in a really special segment of the comedian population in the sense that you've had this very successful show that's been going on for a while two shows going on at the same time and so you've gotten to experience what would be considered the upper echelon of what can happen for a comedian like outside of uh louis ck dane cook level super rock star which you're probably approximating that hugely but but but close man because you because you have the so you're like up in the very upper echelon of that uh pyramid and man i i would uh imagine that that is a pretty pressurized place to be because there's this every bit of success a person gets there's this extra notch that goes up on the expectation level you know and also every level of success you get those little stumbles when you are coming up and people didn't know you can see more like big stumbles right yeah well i think that i honestly believe it's all relative and it's all scale it's all the same shit like like again you know the success fit like wherever you are like you're there you're there's someone who has the career that you want so whether it's like you know like if it's with no knowledge about this and like you know i'm like you know i'm sure there is like there's like someone louis is like fuck man why don't i have his shit right you know like chris rock comes out with top five and it pops right sure louis like i you know like i got my show but i want a movie like that right i'm sure chris rock is like fuck man zack alphanakis gets to go make like all these kinds of movies and zack is like shit you know like i mean it's like i think at every level there is this expectation that you're not accomplishing you're not where you want to be and maybe that's and maybe there aren't it's not always that case but i think that one that it can be the engine that drives you to is is the engine for ambition i'm struggling with that right now of like what is what is ambition and what is um insecurity if that makes sense you know what i mean so like if you are feeling insecure about yourself it drives you you can either depress you down or it can drive you to succeed further right um because you're restless because you want more you know yeah but it also means that wherever you are you're not quite enjoying whatever it is that you've you've achieved you know so it's funny to hear you say that about me and and it's it fully makes sense like i have two shows that have worked that are people seem to like and people love it yeah and which i'm very grateful for and and and and and and i'm like well but i think i'm done i feel like i'm creatively done with with uh my show so i'm gonna i'm gonna move on to the next thing and then all of a sudden you're like shit did i just throw away the the height of my relevance have i walked away do you know what i mean like is this like why am i walking away but i'm like well i did it because i was feeling like i accomplished what i want to accomplish and the kind of show i wanted to make and but i there is the other side of that of like fuck like maybe that's the most hubris you that's filled with hubris to walk away from something that is working well no i think it's faith to walk away from something that's working and that it's an acknowledgement that you exist in a universe of abundance and that as long as your intentions are correct you're gonna get rewarded in ways that you can't possibly imagine that's what walking away is and that part of your brain that's like fuck that's it man oh fuck yeah what are we gonna do now yeah that's the part of your brain that is the same part of the squirrel's brain when you see it freaking out scampering around looking for the next nut yeah that's part of your brain if you let it drive your life it's ironic i do i went to the doctor and it turns out i do have a squirrel there you go bud yeah that's the that that thing it's being counting man it's like uh you know ambition i think is uh i think a lot of words in in our language and in all languages just need to be reinvented because there's too much bullshit attached to all of them because when you hear ambition i think it's either got some like positive connotations if you're going to business school or some negative connotations if you're an artist but it's just a weird stupid word i think and uh insecurity it's a great question ambition versus insecurity um well if you read if you to me it's like you know that moment where you're in rhythm with the universe and everything's just working out and you feel like uh uh i don't know like some kind of like Norse god pounding away at a sword or something like you're just the engine of creativity is just popping in your life and your soul focus or most of your focus is just on be allowing yourself to be a conduit to this thing that's growing out of you for some reason that you can't understand every once in a while yes so go ahead every once in a while doesn't happen all the time but god damn it when that happens what's better than that that's like making out with jesus it's like the greatest feeling you get there's nothing like it yes that feeling that if you stay right there no matter what happens to you or if you all have the intention of getting into that place no matter what happens to you you're already getting the big paycheck because that nothing can buy that feeling everything else is just trying to approximate or fake that you're in that state you know yeah and maybe insecurity is a the more insecure you feel it's more of a you can't feel insecure okay when you're on stage having the greatest set of your life think of if you can remember the greatest set you ever had you don't feel insecure right no no no you're surfing you're surfing the whole thing yeah yeah now maybe that's ambition maybe that that could be what you would call ambition it's being just that explosive volcano of whatever yeah is inside of you you just blast and creativity jizz all over the tits of the crowd forgive me for saying that but the other uh but when you're on stage who are you asking for forgiveness for that what who are you asking for okay so i have in my mind like a cast of critics uh-huh and so that that was a that critic was like somebody who writes for salon dot com not that anyone listens to this shit from salon dot com but that was a slate that was a slate feminist yeah that i was apologizing to because it was such a misogynistic thing well but i would say that i mean you're you're possibly right but uh and you know there i know a lot of girls who don't mind having uh getting come on their chest in a loving way and i i'm maybe now i'm i'm courting i'm courting the critic who's just like typing about you he's like hold on we got a real scoop now but i mean that if i can i could i could equate the same analogy to you of like two people making love when you're surfing it right and it's like yeah i'm gonna fucking blow on your chest like because we're so we're so in this together like yeah and like you can fucking squirt all over my face like whatever it is like do you know what i mean like a word we are surfing this rhythm together and it is finding those rhythms and i think you're right and there are a few sets like that every once in a while feels electric and sometimes every now and again life feels that way yes um and it's a but it's a it's a it's a if you are it's a difficult thing is like trying to you can't create i mean you can create the the you can create um the framework for that ability you can like build that surfboard and try to get to the wave at the right time right but like you're like i'm i don't surf but i'm assuming there are a lot of mornings where people go out and they're like fucking surfsuck today even though i set it all up like even though the swell was supposed to be gnarly or whatever the yeah no no and there it is that it i love that you say constructing the surfboard because i think that's like all the work you put into it and and get in like figuring out the right places to go to catch that that swell but uh the uh a hunter because you're so surf surfers are a form of they're like a hunting like phenomena they're hunting waves right but still a form of hunting like putting yourself in the right place to catch a thing which happens to be goddamn swell of water that's being pushed by some kind of bizarre gravitational field that i i don't understand at all but the uh in a comedian it's the same kind of thing but you know hunters it will talk about hunters are weirdly similar to smokers and the smokers aren't it's not just the cigarette that they like it's the packing it's like going outside yeah it forces you to go outside and a hunter it gives you something to do yeah while you're wandering in the wilderness and i think with in this case like if there's a way to figure out how to make even the the moment proceeding catching that wave just as special if you just keep the what i mean is you just if you're a surfer and you're going out to surf that fucking wave because you know somebody's filming you and you want to look good that's going to be a shitty day yeah compared to the day where you're floating out there with your friends just waiting that's a cool awesome day so it's that thing right it's like uh doing it for the moment for that moment for the moment itself i think if you keep it there everything else works out yeah i i think i and i hope so i think that that is the it is although i would say if you have a lot of ambition that it's those people the people who succeed on a crazy level in our in our in our in our society yeah are are very mapped out with what they're doing they're not just going with the flow of it or they are going with their flow of it do you know what i mean it's like they are they're surfing is like i'm scheduling beginning of the day to the end of the day and i'm gonna i'm gonna have figured out like who's attached to my movie by the end of the day wow or do you know what i'm saying like i was talking to a friend of mine who's a very successful chef like a fucking game changer chef okay and businessman and he's just like he's on a it was talking to me the other day and i'm like oh this motherfucker is on a real he is like on some real like i'm taking my failures i'm turning them into success and i'm doing all of these things i'm no longer even in the kitchen because i'm running this and that and that and it was exciting it was really inspiring talking to him he is a he's a killer in a way that i'm not necessarily like i'm a like i'm a uh like you know there there's every profession or like comedians like you know they're killers do you know what i mean those dudes who are like no fuck that i'm taking this and i'm taking that yes do you want to do my shit no then go fuck you you know what i mean and and or they're not even unpleasant about it but they're just they fucking are killers they go on stage they're going to murder that audience that night you know what i mean other people are like you know i'm going to do new stuff i want to get this right and like also this guy's got to follow me and i don't want to fucking try to get a standing out tonight because like it's going to fuck up their whole night other people like no no no no no no you know and i guess you have to respect them for surfing their night you know i'd yeah those kinds i know what you're talking about it's like people who are existing in life like they're at the super bowl or something in there and this kind of like uh yeah i just was passing i was going to get my beard trimmed and pass some poster for a show on i don't know what the show is but it's apparently about i don't know it's there's a picture of some like black dude and his hot wife and she's kind of like you see his back but he's looking to the side and she's holding him and he's like he runs the music industry yeah and anyone who crosses him will pay that thing which is yeah which is a a kind of capitalist yeah archetype which is this it's the michael douglas wall street version of the soprano it's all that that thing no one gets in my way yeah i rise to the top you're sweating through the day you're making these weird phone calls that involve saying yes and no and the no people are suffering and the yes people are profiting so that kind of like that weird and those people generally will become like the nucleus of this bizarre vortex of sycophants and stuff like they'll always have this insane orbit of yeah oh god i've seen that shit man that's wild well and it's it's in real life and then it's also it seems to be basically the only thing people want to watch in a dramatic series so it's like the anti hero who you're like look at that monster like with soprano walter walter you know walter white or don draper to you know it's empire tarenz harrod yeah it's the new show um and it is it's just like these fucking monsters who you somehow identify with you like oh i understand why he's you know such a monster yeah but you but it's intense it's not and it's like do you want to be that person you know do you want to be that i don't but i want the trappings of their success you can have you you know what man i think that that i think that uh that's a trick is people like to make you think that if you're gonna like have this kind of glorious ascent and and have all the trap the material trappings and all the stuff that goes along with it you have to be like that yeah i don't think so no i don't think so i don't think so but may i mean maybe like i what your chef though he doesn't sound he just sounds kind of hopeful and awesome and organized you know i ran into fucking john jones you know john jones the you there's a ufc he's this fighter in the ufc and he was the title whatever they call the main i'm not a sports guy title card what do you call it the main champ yeah yeah so i like i like the main champ but man like you know whenever you get around you get to be around somebody like that some part of your brain like the record button turns on because you're like let me observe this rare being to see what's going on and and sweetest fucking guy man right of course he's like standing at the he's like came over to rogan because we're doing shows with him in vegas he's talking to him like i don't obviously have no idea who he is and and i would not expect him to like say anything to me or anybody who's like what's your name going around the tail saying hi to everybody in a sincere way very sweet saying to joe you know uh you know i've i've done everything i can to get ready for this if like he was saying what he was going to do in the fight which is really interesting he was going through his tactics he was saying like i'm going to throw the guy like three or four times if i can because the guy had never been thrown before but he was like you know what if it doesn't work out it doesn't work out and i've done everything i can do well totally relaxed next night this guy who is the no joke man this guy was like radiating a kind of sweetness that comes out of like folks i meet at spiritual retreats like rom das and like you know people he was his exact vibe and he's like viciously just yeah feeding this guy into a bloody fucking ball lifting him up throw him through him like three times and so so that guy's literally a killer yeah but yet he seems to be living his life in a very sweet way so i think it is he won oh good spoiler alert spoiler alert he fucking won and it was glorious to why it was glorious because you're like oh my god this is a guy who was just he had his intention and he delivered yeah yeah and i think the trick that gets played on people by these motherfucking uh shows is that you begin to think like god if i'm gonna be like if i'm gonna have this real success i better start stabbing some back cutting some throats hurting some feelings i don't know if it's true no i don't think so and i and i have my my experience also like having the biggest the biggest bummer about my sure that putting crawl show to bed is like it's truly like this last season the the vibe on set and the crew was so good like it was it was such like everybody was looking around me and like this is fun and we like each other and this is a great way to spend your day yep you know and that and that was like that's the biggest bummer to be like am i breaking apart a team and i think a lot of these people have worked together and will continue to work together and and i hope to work with a lot of them again too but it was that thing of like shit like this was a really functional machine here this was a lot of people working very nicely together no assholes like you know i gotta say man it's just to me it is such an honorable beautiful thing that you did which is that you ended a show it wasn't canceled it wasn't going downhill you ended it just because you were you were ready to move on now that to me is a real is a is a beautiful thing and i you have to trust that just like your things are going to be fine for you things are going to be fine for the team that was surrounding that show but if you continue to do something if if if you continue doing whatever it is that you're doing especially when it comes to comedy because it's a money making device or a survive if you keep if you keep god get ready for a fucking stupid hippie thing but brother if you keep functioning from your first chakra you know you never what's that to explain that survival so the first chakra is like at the like basically right between right between it's your taint it's right between your balls and your asshole that's the first chakra and the first chakra is where the so like the idea is energy is moving up from the earth into the sky which it is and energy is moving down from the sky into the earth so there's a cycle that happens and so the earth energy the first energy conduit it touches when it goes into your body is the first chakra right and that's all survival based so when you find yourself like waking up in the morning and worrying about money or if you find yourself worrying if you're you know you're going to lose your girlfriend or your hat whatever it whenever you're caught in that kind of mental place they say your your your energy you're focused on the first chakra and the idea is to like push that energy to move move the blocks so that it'll like flow up through all the other chakras try to get up to the like the third or fourth at least and up and out up and out and where the rest of the chakras they all run up the center of your body so the second one i'm gonna fuck this up but uh the sec yeah they so it's like it goes up through the center of your body the second one's your like sex the third one is power i believe the fourth one is love the fifth one is uh communication the sixth one is intellect i think and i believe the seventh one is like the pure mystical potencies or and you should be functioning from all of them well you know i you go through all those throughout the day you're probably gonna go like i'm gonna cycle through all of them or most of them you know you're like you're gonna as a comedian definitely you're gonna be like figuring out ways to articulate how you feel yeah and then and but you'll notice like there's a kind of behind everything that you do there's a this general sense of like um you know what you're saying like god fuck i always feel like i'm in the verge of killing myself you know so it's like the water is always gonna be a little murky if you've got energy blocks in there and theoretically i don't know from experience but if you like remove those energy blocks then that underlying sense of being like on the precipice of suicide at all times goes away yeah that that underlying sense is just the feeling of having like your energy kind of imbalanced yeah and just to preface i don't want to belittle the idea of suicide in that you know like i'm i'm using it as a term of you know of general on we and hopelessness but leading towards that i you know what i mean we all think about suicide man i think so many i think it's a one of the most i don't think you're belittling it i think you're just removing the taboo of like because a lot of people don't understand that suicidal thoughts are if you're if you have half a brain and you exist in a dimension which according to buddhism is one of its primary characteristics is suffering then you're gonna think of every single way that you can reduce the suffering and one of the most obvious results and kill yourself well so for one of the like if you typed into a computer if i am in a if i'm in water and i don't want to be wet what are some things i could do the computer is gonna write back get out of the water in the same way if suffering is one of the primary characteristics of the existence that we're in obviously get out of this fucking dimension and perhaps you'll stop suffering so do you think that there is whatever after this do you think there's something after this well i mean yeah i do think that for sure do you i don't know i have not thought much about the afterlife i have i don't because i don't have any sense of it i have not troubled myself to focus on it too much smart that's because you're smart and that's that was you know they were always asking buddha like what happens when we die and he's like you really don't need to worry about that right now he was like guys come on that's like worrying about laundry that you need to do 50 years down the road right right no point in thinking about that because it's not really gonna like it's not gonna chance it's not gonna alter that your your moment to moment right state of existence and that's the start there which is like how do i feel don't worry about what happens when i die the first thing to ask yourself is how do i feel most of the time and then if and then instead of trying to make that really like nuance just think most of the time do i feel pleasant or unpleasant simple question most of the time do i feel pleasant around like in the day if every moment could be categorized as a pleasant or unpleasant feeling when there's like scales and the unpleasant goes on one side pleasant other where the scales in my life yeah for most people it's unpleasant it's pretty unpleasant so the the hopeful idea in buddha is that you can actually get those scales to right to balance out so that they're not on either side to keep it balanced balanced not more pleasant than unpleasant yeah i think that's kind of it's called the middle way so is it because you're just like if you're trying to be pleasant all the time you're just you're searching too hard or you're just trying too hard or what well it gets pretty weird man it's like the so it's like pleasant and unpleasant for either of these experiences to happen it requires an observer to be aware of the pleasant and unpleasant state and so most people have attached themselves to the pleasant and unpleasant state as an identity so they think i feel i feel bad therefore i am bad but really it's in the same way that you can look at this table right now i see a table and you don't think i am that table in the same way the reality of of thought and feeling is that since you are only a field of awareness observing the feeling you can't be it so buddhism is just trying to disentangle you from your attachment to pleasant to to identifying with your feeling states and recognizing your true identity which is a woman yeah which is a woman with jizz all over face and tits what a dream what a dream do you think it's all dream this yeah yes i do i think it's a i think that it's like if you're if you are as if i think you a lot of people think when they wake up in the morning they've actually woken up and they haven't they're still dead asleep because as long as your life is consists of a bit habituation habitual like yeah anything then you're pretty much dead asleep like just like the next time you go buy something it's really this is a very fun experiment that you can do uh watch your watch the way you buy something because you've been i've been i've realized recently when i buy stuff i get on my phone and start looking at my phone as i'm paying there you go like like as if it's like i'm ignoring the final stage of this process that's it so watch just watch that don't change it watch it and and it's really awesome to start watching yourself go through all the like habitual things that you do watch the way you open your car watch the way you put your seatbelt on watch the way you start the car watch the way that you buy groceries watch the way you unload groceries watch the way you you watch tv you start watching yourself and you realize oh my god almost everything i do is a kind of weird uh thing i figured out a long time ago like how to how to do it like and i'm not thinking i'm not putting any thought to it at all and that's the interesting thing about being in a relationship i think is when you you start to date someone and you spend a lot of intimate time with a specific person you are watching them and seeing their thing of like that's how she makes coffee or that's you know and it's a weird it's a weird thing to and and also to know that you are being watched as well damn right and and also and usually in a relationship where shit gets weird or for me it does is where instead of like watching myself you start watching the other i start watching the other person instead of like watching myself and analyzing why i'm doing what i'm doing i'm watching them i'm like what the fuck would they do that when it's because it's easier yeah it's easier yes but but the dream thing man i love that question because uh it's it's really fun to uh watch what happens when you aren't paying attention watch what happens in your life like how does the house get messy how does your house get messy it's a great question how did this shit how did this shirt get here these socks get there whatever when your house gets messy usually it's because you're in a hurry or because you haven't been paying attention and this weird zombie like version of you has been like going around your house throwing shit everywhere while you're up in your head or staring at your phone you're not there at all but if you start watching yourself you'll notice the house a little will naturally just start becoming clean because you finish the cycle you take stuff out and you put it back so your whole life starts transforming if you just stop sleepwalking right you know so yeah it's a great plug for sleepwalk with me michael bigley is god nick uh um shit man i i to me it's a i think we got off track a little bit i wanted to finish complimenting you because yeah and i i think i was probably getting ready to deflect it feeling like because what i started feeling like was like why am i i'm making duncan i'm now making duncan compliment me no no no no no not not not making me you know when when you came over when we were talking and you said that you just decided to stop the show i didn't realize that i didn't know exactly the reason that it was stopping but i didn't realize that you were making the ballsyest move that a person could make which is that you are going to for the sake of art turn off a money fountain an ego fountain a career fountain and move in the direction of freedom that is unprecedented i have not heard of anyone doing that uh in comedy i don't know how often that happens i don't think that happens that much especially after the how many seasons did you do three especially after three fucking seasons that's a bbc move i've always respected the bbc yeah yeah yeah because they just stop yeah that's the idea is like this that that was my feeling was like the english shows are just like yeah this is this is the best like the office the english office was 12 episodes you know what i mean yes and and not that the american office wasn't a very good show but it's like in those 12 episodes we are left with the same feeling that we were with like a hundred episodes of the american office yes and you're left god damn it man there's you're left with that like there's that feeling of sadness when you realize this is actually the last episode of a show mm-hmm oh i love that feeling that is such a great that means that you have that's like a relationship you've had this beautiful relationship with the show and then it's just it's gone yeah that's so much better than the endless strobing of the exact same bullshit over and over again until people are sick of it or the networks like get the fuck out of here it's just it's over yeah what you did was badass what you did was a kind of like i don't know man it's like uh hendrix dying in the fucking oh you know i mean it's that thing you instead of letting your show turn into a a fat old thing that used to be what it was instead of letting it become santana you put your show to sleep that is i said that is the way i've been described as i put it to bed yeah it's just put it to bed so we'll see um but i feel very good about the show and i but i but i also think you know yeah i would love to say that it was entirely a power i'm looking just around the room entirely a power play and then but they're also part of that decision is made out of not pure confidence but out of insecurity do you know what i mean it's a combination of being like no i'm putting it to bed because i'm ready for the next adventure but the other side of that is i and not knowing anything about buddhism but assuming if there's if there's you know a constant that constant balance of of um whatever you were saying of pleasantness and unpleasantness of the other side of that is like i don't i i want to put the show away before people stop liking it yeah that's exactly what that's but that's a fear-based decision as well as a power-based decision yeah but it's still i mean it's like they're yeah i guess it's fear-based yeah i know what you mean i i just think it's like i'm not gonna keep serving this meal yeah if if i think i'm gonna serve this recipe or whatever this meal is a certain amount of times i'm gonna make a new meal yeah that's i'm a fucking chef and i make new stuff too that's the goal and you challenge yourself to i can't remember who said this but they said from time to time you need to kick the ants nest over and let the ants rebuild a new nest and when you do that you get more and more beautiful things because now when the ants rebuild the the whatever weird ant towers they are making they've got all the experience from the last time and they're gonna add they're gonna add the the whatever novelty or inspiration is happening now and they're gonna add their experience to that and it'll be something even better that's the goal that's the hope that's the hope is to go make something new and different and bigger or having learned and you know that's the goal how do you have something planned i don't i don't i have a couple now i have a couple like movie ideas and tv ideas that i'm starting to ruminate with but i wanted the mental space opened up to to start to because i'm not capable there are certain people i've seen i'm like wow you are making that show and you're fucking doing these three other things that are in development like wow that's amazing like my i have a certain amount of brain space yeah and crawl show was taking up i'd say like 80 to 90 of my creative brain is power so what what's your now that the now that you have a clear schedule yeah what does your day look like how much time do you spend writing or sort of throwing out fishing lines to figure out what the next thing's going to be um i don't know i mean as we were saying before we started i was like somehow the free days seem more stressful than the the full days in that you're like shit i have to accomplish these three things like i just went and got like the tsa pre-check thing done you know what i mean but like i'm like shit like that i went and then i forgot where do you go to do that um close by here no shit i thought you had to go to fucking lax you have to go to lax if you want the international one if you just i mean which i would probably eventually get but for this is like for domestic it's like it's in glendale so you go to glendale yeah and then they and then i don't i don't have my passport and so i have to go home and get it and come back um they interview you they fingerprint you they they interview you they don't really i mean you fill out a bunch of stuff beforehand it's very simple they don't ask you cool questions no it's like but they you fill out stuff ahead of time being like have you been convicted of a crime or you know that kind of stuff you know so then it's it's that kind of stuff and then they fingerprint you and and there you go you know my friend arie you know arish yeah he says you shouldn't buy your rights back like he doesn't want to sure you know oh i think it's very when i walk through the airport it's like it's a real class thing it's a real class thing to be like i have the time and the money to pay so that i don't have to fucking wait with how much was it there's 85 bucks if you have a tsa precheck and you're traveling with somebody did they get to go through precheck no see that sucks you got to be a solo traveler because what are you gonna do leave your buddy in the dust while you go parading through the prince line but it is nice if you're a comedian it is nice it's like it's nice to be like oh i don't have to take my shoes off anymore at the airport yes and that is that is just brutal man it really it's not just the it's just the general like yeah like now let me take your belt off it's demeaning there's something very demeaning about all of very demeaning and also i plan my outfits for travel based on the two minutes before i get on a plane before i go through security in the two minutes afterwards like i need shoes that i can slip on very fast so that i'm not and you're like it's two fucking minutes but yet i'm like no i gotta wear that i gotta wear that sweatshirt because i can stuff all the shit in my pockets so that i can stuff it in the bag and put you know you know it's just it doesn't make any sense these glum shit bags it's that's the other thing man it's like they're so glum like you have to go through this they know they're just we you know like when you have to throw your water away we were that just happened i don't care about my water but like i you know i threw the water away and my friends like yeah that's real dangerous and the guys like google search hogby gossip buggy the k i hate survive you know something like that but yeah that's cool man i mean so your day now oh yeah so so my day is now it depends on the day like right now in these couple weeks like right now is is crawl show promo stuff so a lot of my day is like doing a podcast or you know answering it doing some sort of like online you know answering some you know pitchfork wants to do something about the music or you know things like that and then um but then it's also now so my hope is like if i get i just need to schedule shit i also write verbally i write much better verbally than i do uh sitting down writing so you record you just record it in your phone well i meaning that i like to write with people so like i'll meet with a guy who i'm working on a script with i'm gonna go now sit with him and go to coffee shop talk about it and then walk around and like out of that will hopefully be the next incarnation of the beginnings of an outline for a script cool movie script movie script and then like stand up like i'm gonna go do a spot tonight but i'll sit down probably for an hour and listen like i've been trying to get my head wrapped around doing stand up again which is the that's the thing i'm having trouble jump starting because in doing crawl show the last few years i haven't written a ton of new jokes i mean i have the hour that i can but i don't want to go to a city i've been doing do the same hour so it's like so it's starting again so that is like now like trying to fucking do you know just like but i write on stage i don't i don't know how you what your processes of like writing jokes but like i'll say something mildly funny and then i'll come on stage and realize that it wasn't funny at all that's how i've been feeling so or i'll listen i do record my sets so i'll go and listen to them and see what little nuggets i liked and try to expand on that and um and then uh and then um um what else i mean that's sort of the i mean so the days fluctuate in that way um i'm trying to like listen to more like uh um like uh podcasts that are informational in some way or just i'm just trying to absorb now i'm trying to get back to absorbing useful media that's a huge part of writing is making sure that you have some kind of input that isn't solely the internet because i know my shit dries up quick if i'm just like on doing their reddit huffington post whatever loop that will dry the field so fast yeah my goal this year my big new year's resolutions is like my big new year's resolution is like just scale back on like uh scale back on booze pot food and my phone yeah because all four of those i feel in in some level like in in um i feel slave to all four of those now here's an interesting you know i've been speaking i've been telling a lot of friends a lot of people are the phone resolution is a big one right now because we're all kind of realizing like oh this is this is as much of an addiction as any other thing yeah but it's like you know man that so there's a buddhist concept which is movement masks suffering movement masks pain and it's like if you just start becoming mindful of why you're looking at your phone why you're drinking the booze why you're it's a really interesting idea which is and you and you were hitting on it earlier which is that the concept that every comedian kind of feels the same way regardless of where you are on the totem pole there's still a general sense of someone's the a pain that comes from wanting to be at another tier you know that suffering from longing for that thing and then buddhism that concept gets stretched out over all things which is just basically like we are on a bed of nails and the attempt and what a lot of people are doing in their careers or jobs or anything or pleasure seeking is trying to take the nails and rearrange the configuration of nails on the bed of nails that we're laying on with the delusion that if we get the nails in just the right pattern they'll stop hurting as they pierce our flesh truth of the matter is it doesn't matter which configuration of nails that you have in this existential torture device that you're laying on you're still going to be suffering so when you start applying that idea to and you'll begin to realize like shit man i'm looking at my phone or drinking this shit or eating too much or smoking weed or doing whatever it is that i'm doing generally because i have this idea that it's going to reduce my anxiety right but if you really start paying attention to your anxiety states as you look at your phone as you smoke weed or drink or eat too much or whatever you realize shit it's the exact same before and after yeah no change and so then you're always oh what i'm doing is just kind of a pathetic flailing in the face of oblivion to try to just uh it's a sort of temper tantrum involving all this shit have you thought about uh making a show called or a band called existential torture device i have now make it your next project cool that's making your next project um uh how are we doing we were we it's 204 you've got a shape okay cool i wanted to talk to you a little bit about how you make a care how do you have these great fucking characters man and they're so uh they're so like nuanced and they're you're so fully that thing how do you do how do you do that i'm always fascinated by that process um how do i do that um i think it's uh i mean i think it's i'm more and more i think about like family constellation uh like where you're born in your family um and i'm the youngest of four and um there's a combination of things that happen i think when you're the youngest in certain i mean i can't speak for all families my family uh is that i you're naturally everyone is charmed by you because you're the youngest and they all feel like they have some part in in the creation of you right um you know what i mean they're like he's so funny it's like because you because you taught him that joke you know and now he's delivering it um and also you're around people all the time and you're just observing stuff you know so i think as the youngest oftentimes you get to just sit and watch everything going on uh whereas if you're the oldest you're like either you are rebelling wildly against where you're your parents or you are trying to placate and make sure that everything in the house is moving moving smoothly and that you are the you are the one who is like you are the one who's like look um i know the kids are a lot but i'm going to be the one who helps you through this you know the peacemaker yes and i or they go the other way right you know what i mean or they be like i'm going to go light toilet paper on fire in the bathroom yeah and show all the other kids because because i'm i don't want to deal with the pressure of being the the the little adult right so i think the youngest oftentimes gets to just sit there and like all of your friends at your siblings have friends over and you just watch you're just observing everything so i think that it started in some capacity for me there um and i think it's so i think it's a lot of it is of of constantly um observing people in their mannerisms uh and then it really was helpful in new york being able to ride the subway like the thing i miss most about new york is the subway i miss the public life of new york uh i i miss that a lot i think la is obviously has a lot of advantages but you're in your car you're in your home you're in pods like you're you're alone and so when i moved to la a lot more of my inspiration for characters came from tv or from the internet of being like i'm interested in that kind of guy and then you watch uh you know youtube clip of whatever what i was doing bobby bottle service before jersey shore but then jersey shore comes on and you just get to watch even if it's a manufactured reality that they're dealing with yeah they're their natural state and way of talking and and manners are coming through so you just start to take note and uh you know it's like so i think it's like um i think what what i think everybody has like a song um and so like the great and this is a different thing but like the great comedians you like their song right like chris rock like i've seen chris rock do sets at like the cellar right after 9 11 and he's doing jokes but he's not doing his song he's just seeing if the jokes work all right he's working on it and he's talking like this i mean he's talking like chris rock but he's talking like this what a blah blah blah because he's like i know if i put on the song people will laugh whoa you know what i mean so then eventually when that when the jokes are there then he then he starts singing wow do you know what i mean yeah so i think everybody has their song and you're just trying to learn people's songs wow does that make sense yeah totally man that's really cool i haven't i haven't quite expressed like that so i'm enjoying the idea that's badass yeah so i think like um so i think that that's part of it and then it's like and then and then really it's like um putting together a team of people who you who you trust and like who can both writers i oftentimes now a lot of my characters have ended up i've ended up collaborating with other people on so it's whether it's like oh hello the like the Upper West Side guys me and me and john mulaney or it's publicity with me and and jen slade or you know rich dicks with me and john daily i oftentimes have a partner who who exists in that world and we sort of can play off of each other and create a language that unto themselves but when you what's the like rich dicks what's the first time you guys did that or did you do it by yourself or i i saw john daily do um he on on stage one night he did this thing wendy shawn he played a guy named wendy shawn which is just is still his character's name um wendy shawn who doesn't have a care in the world i think was like the full title of it and he was just like a rich he was just like he was a rich dick and and i and he and i were buddies and had been working together and i and i saw afterwards i was like dude i've been circling around having grown up with these kids and gone to college with these kids and been in new york and observe these people like not saying i'm beyond like i was in the middle of some of those people um who are friends of mine but i just was and he crystallized it and i was like we gotta fucking do these guys like well let's go make something with these guys and so we started going on hikes and talking about what it could be and formulating some world of what it was and then met with crizel john crizel who uh i was connected to and was like i have this idea with my buddy john it's this thing called rich dick's and he's like got it like he he knew because he also knew some of those guys and and then we started to make it and it continues to evolve but it was that was really daily did it first i saw i saw what he was doing and it was it was like you know it was again it was like that song that you're like yeah how does it fucking how does that go again yeah that's it that's right i remember now um and and that was sort of the basis for that that character is is there a feeling that when you're doing these characters is it how much of it is a feeling like how much of it is like is is the like if there's a compass leading you in the direction of what they do is there a feeling that goes along with it um it's a combination of things i mean it's like for me it's a huge thing as i was saying like the team of people you work with both the people like i perform with but then also like the the wardrobe people like once i get into wardrobe and makeup like and i and i'm wearing those people's clothes like it's a cheesy thing that they're like you know it's like actors like i need to be wearing the character's shoes right which sounds sort of cheesy but then it's like no man makes sense fucking dress like that you dress like bobby bottle service yeah and like a tight shirt then it's like the shoulders come back and you're fucking peacocking and you're your bobby bottle service you know what i mean like it's that you feel it you feel that you feel you're wearing the jewels you're wearing like the fucking ring he wears and all of a sudden your your hands are like you're expressing your hands with your pinky out because you've got that fucking big ass ring on you know what i mean so like you start to inhabit you start to inhabit it that way that is so badass nick because do you know why because everybody's doing that this is what's so crazy everyone's wearing the clothes of this certain character that they think is who they are they don't realize that if you were just change what you were wearing or just shift or alter some aspect of yourself you would probably turn into some new thing yeah or there are the people who are shapeshifters who are constantly changing like their existence is the ephemeral nature of whatever look they're taking on oh wow i mean like there are people like that who like every couple weeks like every there's what there is a couple people in our world whom like every couple months i'm like oh you got a new look now whoa that's so funny shit man i wish we could talk forever you got a meeting coming up in three minutes so we gotta end this nick where can people find you uh people are gonna want to watch your show or people already watched they already know the show but dude it's a comedy central 10 30 tuesday night uh after tosh um and it'll be yeah it's starting january 13th and runs through you know there's 11 episodes i really like i will say this about the show as we were talking about ending it like the reason i felt comfortable ending it is because the all the stories and characters and worlds that we created start to collapse and collide into one another cool i mean not oh and not in every sketch but like a lot of it starts to really mold and and you know the show has this awareness of its own collapse is what you're saying like the characters so certain episodes you'll see like you'll you know certain episodes will start with a character in one world get she'll get in a publicity she gets in a fight she leaves she ends up in a gold digger show uh you know like another kind of reality show with manzukas and seth morris playing different characters you know these these gold digger characters then those gold digger characters like leave and end up in a new show which is like a you know meanwhile the oh hello guys have left new york they prank henry rollins wow he leaves them on the side of the road they then i mean it's like that's certain shows like that all start to it becomes this like multi uh multi genre narrative of one story that's fucking cool man i can't wait to watch that thank you so much man i really appreciate you

Hello, my dear, sweet, and beautiful children of the Noontime Doom Bloom. Boy, do we have an occult blazer for you today. Today's guest is a world-renowned channeler. And this is the very first time on the DTFH that I have ever had multiple guests in one body. Because not only is Paul Selig with us today, but also the guides are here. The beings that come through Paul Selig and have used him to write five books. Channeling, right? It's weird. And I bet a lot of you are quite skeptical about it. I remain agnostic. I was in the presence of this phenomena. And without ruining or spoiling it for you, because I don't want to set any kind of preconceived notions in your head about what you're about to hear, I will say that sitting next to him was incredibly intense. There was definitely a feeling of something coming out of him that was more than words. And what that is, I don't know. I'll tell you this. One thing's for certain, anthropologically, there is a precedent in human history for shamans to become conduits for entities that give direction to the tribe. This is not a new phenomena. It's been happening for a long time. It happens in many different religions, both indigenous and established religions. So I think even the Dalai Lama has an oracle that channels beings, that give the Dalai Lama guidance. So as far out as something like this may seem, it's not a new thing. It's been happening for a really long time. And so I'm not going to say much more about it, except that sitting next to him was supremely intense. And I think it was also really intense for a lot of people in the audience at the live show at the Bell House. So strap in, friends, because you're about to have whatever calcified barriers grown around your quivering little pineal gland blasted to smithereens by today's guests, Paul Selig and the Guides. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH was made possible by the geniuses over at tracker.com.

And Tracker's 30 day money back guarantee means you truly have nothing to lose. Friends, there's a lot of THC in my bloodstream a lot of the time, which means that I am constantly losing my phone. It ends up in cushions or underneath books or I'm losing my keys, but this thing's super cool. Check it out.

Welcome to a live DTFH, here we go. Welcome to the Dunkin' Chessle Family Art Podcast. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, we'll shake hands, don't give up, welcome to you. It's the Dunkin' Chessle Family Art Podcast. Hey everybody, welcome to the Dunkin' Chessle Family Art Podcast. For usual, we are going to start the show with the wonderful and amazing Emile Amos. I found him by the stage last night, he was breathing his last breath. His last breath. A needle full of heroin was all that he had lived. I can tell that you make music because you carry your guitar. But Heaven saved the troubadour that wants to be a star. So play those chords of love, my friends. Play those chords again. But if you choose to keep your souls, don't, don't, don't. Don't play those chords of fame, chords of fame, chords of fame. They'll rob you of your innocence, they'll put you up for sale. The more that you will find success, the more that you will fail. I've been around, I've had my share, and I feel I can come play. I don't see anything true or pure on that other side of fame. But play those chords of love, my friends. Play those chords again. But if you choose to keep your souls, don't, don't, don't. Don't play those chords of fame, chords of fame, chords of fame, chords of fame. This is like an Amman card thing I do. Last time I forgot the words, because I've been playing a lot of covers. Some girl sitting right here was like, No. Wait, you remember this story? Shit. She was like, play something else, dude. I was like, God, you're so patient when you're owning. But not when you're anywhere else in life, right? In lines and shit. This is an ancient song. It's one of Duncan's favorites. It's 20 years old and I have trouble playing it because of what it's about. I looked as hard as I could to my perverse nightmares. I came out looking like the saints. And everyone I know that still believes in evil, they have so much to learn. I've been a rebel against what is vicarious life. I got to get the quick conduct tonight and discard all habits you will need. Because I love everything. And I know that's not easy to say. I love everything and sometimes I'm wondering if it's not something you all want to hear. So I'm gonna believe in tomorrow. I'm gonna believe in tomorrow. I'm gonna believe in tomorrow. I've been a rebel against what is vicarious life. I got to get the quick conduct tonight and discard all habits you will need. Because I love everything. And I know that's not easy to say. I love everything unless somebody just doesn't want to hear. I love everything. Emile Amos everybody, let him hear it. Hi, how's it going you guys? Hey, welcome, welcome, how are you tonight you guys? Good, this is so wonderful to see you all here tonight. Because this is the most excited I've ever been about any of my live shows. And I think it's a really great time to have this kind of live show. But before I get into that, how many people are here for the first time? Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. So I'm just gonna let you know how we do this so that you know what to expect. Basically, what we're gonna do is have this wonderful conversation with one of the world's most renowned clairvoyance happens to be with us here tonight, which is really amazingly cool to me. Also, what's super cool about this is that he's agreed to, we're gonna take questions at the end. So anybody who wants to talk to him or his guides, there's a microphone here and you'll be able to ask him questions. What's really interesting about Paul is that the way this stuff works, none of it's like if it comes through, it comes through. If it doesn't come through, that's okay. Because Paul minus the guides is a pretty awesome fella from my research into him in the few minutes I've had to chill with him backstage. So it's gonna be super cool. And before we get the show going, one of the things that I always do at these live shows is to get all of us to do the OM together. And to do that for a little bit longer than any of us feel comfortable doing that for, which is the perfect amount of time to do it. And so after we do the OM, I'm gonna do the opening monologue rant thing that you hear if you listen to my podcast. Now, the thing about that is it takes me a long time to do those, believe it or not. It doesn't just come out of me. It takes like sometimes a couple of days of feeling like I'm completely out of my fucking mind sitting in front of the microphone, trying to say something that makes any kind of sense at all. And so these things take some time. Whereas up here, I just get one chance to roll through it. I can't stop and press rewind and listen to it and think, who the fuck do you think you are, man? What are you doing? You're crazy. So I just like to get, because I consider podcasting it to be a collaborative event. It's not just me. It's me and my guests. It's not just me and my guests. It's the community around the podcast, which is here tonight. So I like to get ideas from you guys about what we should talk about. So does anybody want to give some suggestions about what this opening rant should be about tonight? Crowley. What? Crowley. Alistair Crowley. Okay, that's cool. What's going on in Charlottesville? What do you mean? What? Charlottesville. Oh, Charlottesville. You mean where they have that beautiful statue of Robert E. Lee? What a beautiful statue. I mean, what else is there to say? It's an amazing place. I mean, God, I always travel there to look at that beautiful statue of Robert E. Lee. Okay, cool. Yeah. Yeah, okay. We could do that for a second. Sure. Of course. It's obviously floating in all of our heads. No problem. What else? Yeah. There isn't an environment, man. That's fake news. What else? Zebras. Summertime zebras in the eclipse. Okay, that's enough. I think I do some with that. All right, cool. Well, I guess we're just going to go ahead and get this thing going and then we're going to start the arms. So let me get ready to do this. Here we go. Are we recording? Are we cool? Hello, my sweet friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and thou art listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast being recorded live from the Bell House in Brooklyn. Tonight is a very special night because we have a clairvoyant and a channeler here with us tonight. And so I want to set the energy of the room to be as conducive as possible to tuning in to higher dimensional entities. And so I have with us here tonight the perfect man for the job. Everybody, a giant round of applause for Robert Ryan, who's going to lead us in the Olm and a prayer. Give him a round of applause, everybody. Everybody. Oh, wait, shit. Hold on. Don't pray yet, man. I forgot to light the incense. I forgot to light it. Thank you so much. Yeah, no problem. This is incense that Robert gave me at comes from Vrindavan, which is where Krishna was born. And that was his birthday was yesterday. Jhamastami. So this is good shit. So I'm just going to light this and then you guys just pass it around. I mean, don't, you can't smoke. So since we have a medium coming as a guest tonight, I thought it would be proper to do evocation to Lord Shiva, who is known as Botanath, which is the master of ghosts. Perfect. Yeah. What are you? Yes. Yeah. Shiva. Namashiva. So we'll do a group home together. The meaning of home is very, very, there's, it's one syllable. It's the mono syllable, but it contains so much. So everyone has a very hard time explaining what it means, but it contains the three letters A, U and M. And these are sounds that your body can make without your tongue, you know, so it's the three, three sounds that your body could make not using your tongue. Your tongue makes all the sounds in between for all the syllables. So these are natural syllables and these sounds exist. Anywhere that someone spent time doing any kind of inner work, any realized soul who spent time in quiet comes with, comes to Om. With the Christians, we have Amen. With Muslims, we have home. In the Hindu faith, we have Om. And with babies, you have Ma. Ma. You know. So we'll start with three deep breaths and then we'll Om together. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Om. Thank you, man. You know, I texted one of my friends, what are you doing for the eclipse? And he wrote back, nothing you fucking hippie. But I'm, you know, I'm proud to say that the eclipse creeps me out. I'm proud to say that I haven't reached a place of disconnect with the universe to not feel how spooky this event that is happening is for a lot of different reasons. Just the basic surface level stuff that's happening, which is that hundreds of thousands of people are right now in route right now, probably beginning their travels to get into the line of the totality to watch this eclipse happen. That's a crazy thing to think of so many of us, you know, like any kind of swarming flocking herding species that is summoned or drawn by cosmological influences to flow like a river into a place where the moon is going to perfectly block out the sun. That's just spooky by itself. Like if you were just watching some alien planet and you knew that every once in a while, many of them gathered together to stand underneath nighttime in the middle of the day. You'd be like, that is a fucking trippy species, man. Why are they doing that? And then we look into the way some towns are planning on like celebrating it. You know, it's interesting because sometimes we're going to have eclipse music. Jimmy Buffett's going to play during the total eclipse, you know, like, and which is cool. But many of my friends that I've talked to, some astrologers, some initiated Buddhists, they've said this isn't like a lot of cultures don't consider this. A fun day. Like they don't look at this as like what you would necessarily call like a great omen. And for me personally, what's flipping me the fuck out is that it just so happens that preceding this eclipse, we have begun to enjoy something our parents and grandparents used to enjoy a lot more than us. Which is the fear of being incinerated by nuclear fucking blast. That's always fucked up. But when it's happening right before a fucking eclipse, cutting through our country, it's like, come on, who's riding this shit? It's cheesy. It's cheesy, right? Like in a movie, that wouldn't work. Like if you were writing a movie about some potential nuclear armageddon, you're like, and it's going to happen right around an eclipse. You'd be like, tone it down, Gerald. No one's going to buy that shit. And then on top of that, on top of that, we have this terrible stuff that's happening where what I'm pretty sure is a relatively small group of people. Hopefully, even though no amount of them is good, is apparently coming out of the shadows and feeling okay about promoting white nationalism, fascism, and just the general chaos when you watch what happened. It's horrifying, really, to think that it's gotten to the point where we're just beating each other with flags. And I'm a pretty positive guy most of the time. And I find myself being a little cynical. I don't know if it's just because I was just in a hotel in Portland watching Fox News, which is essentially like finding where Satan's fucking Porta John is and swimming in it. Why do I smell so bad? It's because you've been swimming in the source of all evil shit for the last couple of days. But I think a lot of us are a little, we're a little rattled right now. And because there's just too many weird things happening all at once. There's a lot of turbulence happening right now. And something occurred to me that really gives me the heebie-jeebies, which is right now, this is as normal as it's ever gonna be. Like today, this is the most normal it's gonna be. It's not like it's some point two weeks from now, a month from now, three years from now. We're gonna be sitting around like, oh yeah, everything got back to normal after that weird little couple of years. No. The thing that we're in right now is the thing. It's the thing. And by the thing, I mean the thing Terrence McKenna talked about. The thing Ray Kurzweil's talked about. The thing that almost every single culture has talked about happening right around this time. It's the thing. You know? And we're all kind of feeling it. And the thing is change. Exponential change. And we're all feeling it. And the big hanging question mark, at least in my head, is what am I supposed to do? What do we do? How much longer do we just, how much longer do we keep doing this thing? We go to work. We act like everything's cool. Shit, you know, it's just like, I guess the president is like kind of vaguely associated with white nationalists. Sort of maybe a little bit hesitant when it comes to saying that he doesn't like Nazis. But you know, we're just gonna keep fucking going to work and like doing our thing. Like that's the question is, what do we do every single day? And when do we do something more? And what is it? Surely it's not going and fucking beating mealy white dudes with bats. Surely there's something more to do than throwing urine on people or beating them into bloody pulps. I don't know. Maybe that's the right response. I don't know. I don't think it is though. I always think what the fuck would Ramdas do, you know? And I don't see Ramdas in the Antifa wearing fucking bandanas and pledging 21 year old's dress like they're fucking like the way my dad used to make me try to dress. The way they're dressed is exactly the way my dad, when we went shopping, he's like khaki pants, white shirt. That's your outfit. But are we supposed to beat these kids? Last night I was talking to Korra and I'd worked myself into a froth after looking at like the dumb ass who drove his car, the murderer drove his car into those sweeties. Terrorists, yeah. I wish there was a better name than something even worse than terrorist, you know? Because what? Nazis, even worse, we need a new word for evil. Because Nazi and terrorist, I think it doesn't even work, you know? It's like Nazi's a dated term for something to happen in Germany. Terrorist is too ambiguous. These people are like, what? Demons. I think they're more like golems. You know what I mean? Because like a demon is this like kind of like, there's something seductive about a demon, right? Like a demon, you know, a demon's gonna fucking like you. When you hang out with a demon, you might be like, you know, this demon kind of makes some sense. I kind of like what this demon's up to, man. It's kind of cool. Like even the fucking Nazis, right? You look at their outfit, not their philosophy. Remove their philosophy and just look at the outfit and tell me that doesn't look cool as shit, man. Designed by Hugo Boss. Kind of fucking cool. So calling them Nazis, it's like, I don't know, man. There's nothing, they're like golem. They're pathetic and they're sad and they're lost and maybe unconvertible. Maybe really there is no way to sit down with them. Maybe. I don't know. That's one of the big arguments is what, are we gonna fucking sit down and listen to their goddamn economic fucking plan? Really, you want to sit down and listen, you know where this shit goes. We know by now where it goes. And where it goes is not where you want to fucking be. And that's Florida. No, just kidding, I like Florida. These people are like golems, you know, they're pathetic. And I don't mean pathetic, like, yeah, pathetic. I mean, they're there to, you know, I was just listening to fucking Day Lost Soul, their new album, First Track, Genesis. It's this beautiful poem. I don't have it quite memorized, but the poem goes something along the lines of when, when is it, when do you love something? Do you love something when it's a success, when it's easy to love? No, that's not when you love something. You love something when it's been beaten so fucking bad that it's lost its truth. When it's been beaten by the world so fucking bad that it doesn't know its way anymore. That's when a thing needs the most love. So how do we find a way to love tiki dudes? Without being contaminated by them. Without giving the impression that we embrace or accept or uphold anything that has to do with fascism or oppression. How do you find love for them? How do you find a more nuanced way of dealing with this problem than breaking their fucking heads open and inviting one of them, the inevitable one of them, to do something even worse than driving a fucking car into innocent people? I don't know the answer to that, but here's what's beautiful about tonight's guest. He is a world-renowned clairvoyant and channeler. He has channeled five books, five books, and has made contact with, I don't know what the right word would be for it, and I think he'll answer that for us, extra-dimensional teachers. And he's a conduit, and a lot of their teachings are beautiful, beautiful things. And so, everybody, if I could please get a gigantic round of applause for tonight's guest, Paul Selig, everybody, let him hear it! Thank you so much for being here tonight, Paul. I thought it'd be cool to just start off, I don't wanna spend a lot of time on biography, but I think for people here who may not be familiar with you, it'd be cool to talk about what it means to be a clairvoyant, a channeler, and my first question for you is, when did it start? When did you realize that you had this ability? You know, I was raised something of an atheist, and when I was about 25 years old, I was about a year out of graduate school at Yale, and I had hit a real wall, I'd had a list of things in my life that I thought I had achieved to make me okay in the world. And I got the whole list, and I wasn't okay. And I was a playwright, and I was working on an opera for the Minnesota Opera, and I was stuck in a hotel room, the Gopher Campus Motor Lodge in St. Paul, with a giant gopher on a spit outside my window, and I was unable to find drugs in St. Paul. You know, I knew I was in a crisis, I don't know if I could have named the crisis, but I was in one, and the Gideons leave these books in the drawers, you know, and I took it out, and it said, prayer for people in crisis. And I read it, you know, I mean, I was a total atheist, but I read the prayer, and three days later I heard a voice, telling me to get my act together, and how to do it. So, you know... Can I ask you, do you remember what the prayer was specifically? I have no idea. I have no idea, you know, I mean, I remember much about those days, to be honest with you, but I remember that. And you know... Where were you exactly when this voice came to you? I was waking up, and I looked around my room, and I knew nothing was going to change, unless I changed. And I heard a voice. You heard a voice like... Well, it's different than what... You see, I'm a clear audience primarily, you've introduced me as a clairvoyant, and that's something that I am able to access, but a clear audience primarily hears. I'm a clear audience and clear sentient. And so, when I hear, it's not a voice in the room, it's really like a voice intrudes upon your own consciousness and blocks out your own thoughts. If you can imagine a voice coming to the forefront of your mind, that would usually be a thought that you would never ever think yourself. That is not in your voice and is not in your vocabulary, even. And that was how it started. A few months later, I went up to the roof of my building in Chelsea. I was living in Chelsea, and it was the night of this thing called the harmonic convergence. It's like 30 years to the week, I think it is now. And I heard people were going to be waking up. And so, I had gone from this place of not believing in anything to suddenly believing that there was something, I didn't quite understand what that could be. But you, as an atheist, skeptic, hearing a voice, surely you thought, oh, this is brain tumor, this is schizophrenia. Yeah, well, not yet. I got to that point a little later. I went up to the roof and I asked to be woken up on this night. And I ended up having a bit of an experience that people later said sounded like a spontaneous Kundalini awakening or something called a Shaktipa. Had you taken any psychedelics? No, no, no. I was quite sober. But, you know, I started seeing lights around people after that. That was the very beginning. And so, what happened up in the roof was I felt all this energy moving up through my body and out through the top of my head. Were you shaking? Yeah. Yeah, I was shaking. My mouth was frozen and I was sort of rocking in this energy that was just sort of coursing through me. Were you scared? No. I wasn't scared. You know, I'd done this little prayer of protection. I'd asked for something and something was happening. And I think for somebody like me who wasn't raised with this stuff, I needed something that I could feel or have an experience of to allow me to go on the journey that I've since gone on. But when I started seeing these lights around people, you know, I was hearing, you know, maybe you have a detached retina, maybe you have a brain tumor, maybe, you know, and what I ended up doing was studying a form of healing. It was the height of the AIDS epidemic in New York. It was something that I could do. And that gave me a context for the phenomena. But because, you know, I'd heard a voice. I had felt energy. I was seeing these little lights. I didn't know what was going on. But when I started doing the energy work and I had my hands on people, I began to hear things for them. And that was really the beginning of the Claire audience that I have now. So if I had my hand on your chest and I heard the name Billy, I learned to say who's Billy and you'd say, you know, my son, my father, my lover, you know, my dog. And as that kept getting confirmed again and again and again, I started trusting the information. And then once I did that, I began to hear more. Who was the first person that you did this with? I don't know if I remember the first. I think there was a lot. I mean, I was seeing a lot of people when I was volunteering. So I can't say that there was one. There was, you know, I mean, I was also taking on what people were going on in their bodies at the same time. So I was opening up as a Claircentient without knowing what one was. I didn't know what a Claire audience was. I didn't know what a Claircentient was. Can you tell me what a Claircentient is? A Claircentient is a clear feeling. So you hear about empaths. I'm an empath sort of on steroids. So I'm able to feel, they call me a medium for the living. I'm not going to contact your dead sister or your dead grandmother. But if you haven't talked to your sister in three years, I can probably step into where I may begin to resemble her and can probably hear what's going on in the dynamic and support you in moving through whatever the issue is. Let's get this out of the way so that we can go really deep into this. Because surely there's skeptics in the audience. How do you address the inevitable skeptical reaction to this? Because we've all been taught, many of us have been taught, listen, a Clair audience, Clairvoyant, whatever it is, we've got these people, it's not real. They're tricking us. They're using tricks. How do you address that? And I just want to get that out of the way. It's fine. I'm actually, I don't mind it at all because I was a skeptic myself. You know, what I do is you can't Google it. I can't sort of know who you are. And if you say I'm having issues with my boss and step into your boss and start to resemble him and talk about what's going on in the dynamic and be accurate, there's no way that I could know that. And I've actually channeled five books. And the books actually aren't written. I'm literally sitting in a chair with my eyes closed and speaking the whole thing into recorder or in front of people. I just did a retreat in South Carolina where the guides I work with dictated 100 pages in front of the students over the course of three or four days. It's still being transcribed by somebody. What is the difference between that and someone who's just writing? You know, how do you know it's not just inspiration coming through? Well, I think, I mean, I believe in inspiration. I believe that inspiration is a high form of expression. But when I'm channeling, I'm literally taking dictation. And when I'm inspired, I get to sort of collude with it. You know, I can have an idea and then work with the idea. The books actually are all straight dictation. I hear things phrase after phrase after phrase. And when I channel, I whisper the words as they come and then I repeat them. And it's often coming extremely rapidly. So it's, you know, phrase, phrase, phrase, phrase. I can't see the whole thing or know how it's added up. People who are hearing it can hear it better than I can until I see the transcript or I listen to recording afterwards. Oh, so you're not, you're just sort of, it's just, you're not even aware of how it's acting. I'm aware, I'm not aware of, I'm so busy taking the dictation and trying to get the next phrase that's coming that I don't have time to really look at the fluidity. You know, if you can imagine reading fortune cookies one after the other after the other as they're handed to you, that's my job during this. You're going to know if it all shows up, you know, in form. So there have been five books now and they're completely unedited. I mean, they literally are the transcripts of the recordings. There's no editing involved. I think in the last book there were maybe three or four word changes and that's because I mispronounced a word because I was speaking so fast or jumped over a word. Okay, I just see, oh, I, you know, I wish I had it. I left, ah, sorry, bad interviewer. I had an excerpt from your book. It's amazing. And to think that this is just, you're not working on that. You're not revising. No, nothing. I mean, there's, you see, this is the difference between the inspired stuff. It was inspired, I'd get to go back and fix it. I'd been a playwright. I know what writing is like. You know, my name is on the cover of these books, but I'm really not the writer. I'm a stenographer at best. You know, that really is my level of participation. Can you, I just, just, I want to get this point out of the way, which is if this was happening to me, I would feel like I was losing my mind. And so how did you, I guess two parts to this question. How did you, outside of like having, even if I was getting hits, even if it was like, yes, this person was my grandfather, I would still feel like I was getting, like my life was getting ripped apart. Well, I mean, as I said, this has been going on in my life for 25, 30 years in one form or another. And my early 30s is when I began to hear. And I started a little group that met in my living room and we met every week for about 18 years and people would put 10 bucks in a basket. And it was the laboratory. I was in the faculty of NYU for 25 years. I was not doing this work in a public way or looking to be known at all. Do you think you would have gotten fired if you'd started talking about it? I never did. And finally by the end of it, everybody knew what I did because I was on television doing this. You know, I was being recorded, stepping into people and being intercut with people that I never met and sort of somatizing them. So I don't think I'd ever get another job in academia now because I'm all over YouTube, you know, whispering and talking to myself. And I know how nuts it looks. I'm the first one to admit it. But... Yeah, that's right. Because it's like, this is what's, you know, interesting about it. And it's the same with other channelers that I've seen. You wouldn't call the aesthetic cool. It's not gotten me a date yet. It's not never going to happen. It's not. It's not. I mean, for me, and if people haven't seen me work before, I'm whispering and repeating. And it's not glamorous. I'm not sort of sitting there saying, the Pleiadians have a message for us all today on rainbows and unicorns. It's this very physical phenomenon. That's right. And you would think if you were, like, wanting to be something, that's what you would do. You'd wear, like, you'd dress like Parliament. You'd have crystals. You'd, like... But it seems that what's happening is coming through you so quickly. Is there discomfort here at all? It's physically exhausting, but that's also because I do it so much. When I do a workshop or I'm working on a text, it can be five hours a day of channeling, which is sort of unheard of. And there's a lot of energy running through me. I have a bit of a cold today, but if the guides came through, they don't have a cold. They'd be fine. So they'll use or work with me or through me without impairment. I often do my best work, you know, first thing in the morning in front of a group before I've had too much coffee or talked, and they're coming through with complete, beautiful, beautiful lectures, whereas I couldn't even have a conversation like this coherently on my own. But I want to answer one thing. You said, how did you know that you weren't going crazy? Everything that I did in the beginning years was in service to other people, so I was getting the feedback. You see, I wasn't sitting there, and I didn't want to be a channel. I didn't really believe in it. It wasn't my thing, and I was skeptical about it. But I was doing this group for years, but the other thing that I haven't mentioned is that when I do this stuff, there's an energy that comes through that's extraordinarily palpable. So people that have never felt energy can often feel it when the guides do their attunements, and they'll often just do it at the drop of a hat and people can feel the energy. So I was always dismissive of the information that was coming through me because it was coming through me. That was my biggest problem with it. Who am I to do this? It was real, and we were all experiencing it. This energy that you're talking about, I've experienced that from Ram Dass. When you get around Ram Dass, there is a palatable energy that comes... The undeniable. There's no way to pretend it's not there. You see people who get close to him, they just start crying. They can't help it. What is that? What do you think that energy is? Well, I mean, the guides, when they work with me, they actually step into me. I mean, I've not seen it, but supposedly when there's some stuff that they do and they work with people very directly, my eyes, which are hazel, turn bright blue. A very pale blue. Your eyes look blue right now. They're not. I mean, they may. But I may be more tuned in than I think. But I haven't had blue eyes since I was maybe five years old. They turn kind of dark. That is really why. Yeah, but the energy itself, whatever it is, the guides bring through the energy. They attune people. The books are all energetic attunements. I didn't start dictating books until 2009. I used to be a heavy smoker through all this. And I quit. Like I was a four pack a day guy. And like in 2008, the guide said, we can't work through you anymore unless you take care of this. And I stopped. And then my energy system, which had been very damp and down, my clair sentience, my ability to feel. And I'm sure that's part of the reason I was smoking so much was to be less sensitive. Everything took off and the book started coming through. I got to get some of these guides. They turn your eyes blue. They make you quit smoking. And they turn you in an incredible rider. Yeah. That's awesome. I mean, that's the good news. What's the bad news? You end up living a very different kind of life. I mean, this isn't the life that I'd planned for myself at all. You know, I love teaching college. I ran a graduate program at Goddard in Vermont for 18 years. You know, I had a nice life. And I chose finally to step into this work fully. You know, at the cost of health insurance and, you know, retirement and all those things that I had thought were important to me. But finally, this became so insistent. I mean, they're delivering a book every year and a half through me. The books take 30 days of dictation at most, you know. I mean, 30 sittings. That's it. But the work is coming through with such insistence that I've now sort of accepted that this is what my life has become. Who are they? Well, they're a group. They're a consortium. I call them the guides. And they're only called the guides because my ex Larry, when he found out that I was a psychic, used to say, ask the guides this, ask the guides that. Now they're the guides. And everybody's comfortable with that. It's not some high name. It was convenient. They're teachers. You know, they're teachers. And, you know, the name that's come through, I'm hearing say it. I mean, I've known the name for a long time, but I'm not terribly comfortable with names in this stuff that attach a lot of meaning and ego and narrative to names. And I think that that's a trap. But the name that they've said, they've used is the name Melchizedek, which is a priesthood that's been around for a long time, is my understanding. But that was only in the fifth book, the fourth or fifth book. Melchizedek? Melchizedek. As they say, if you want to call us something, you can call us this. They're operating at a level of consciousness. They call it the Christ consciousness. And that they're teachers. They use in the very first book the term Ascended Masters, and they've never used it again because I'm not comfortable with that term. Because, again, it's sort of fraught with a lot of narrative and attachments that I don't think are all that necessary. I mean, this is my real feeling. You know, truth is truth is truth. And I don't care who it's coming from. I tend to be a little wary when I meet people and they introduce themselves and they say, hi, I'm the channel for the Archangel Michael and Mother Mary and so on. It's like the list of celebrities. And I don't think it's about that at all. I mean, this is the name that's been given. I can accept the name. But for me, it's an energy that I'm quite comfortable with now that's very familiar when it works. And it's something to feel. You know, I mean, for me, it's an extraordinary experience of sort of being in this kind of union in this vibration. Where are they from? You know, I don't know. I mean, it's not like... I mean, I don't go there with them. I did an interview recently with NPR and the guy was like, how come you haven't asked all these questions? I said, well, I kind of don't want to go there. And the newest book that they're delivering now and they're about... It started two weeks ago. They're about 100 pages, 150 pages in already. They're addressing some of this stuff which is taking me out of my comfort zone. But essentially, it's a higher level of consciousness. The guides don't talk about dimensions. That's not... They talk about octaves as in music. Like, Gerjeev was in the octaves. You know, Gerjeev? I know who he is, but I haven't read him. But they talk about octaves and everything. They say, like, the note C exists in multiple octaves. You can play the note C here in this reality that we know, or you can play it in a higher octave. They're operating at a higher octave and they're actually lifting us to them through what they say is co-resonance. So they play the higher note up here which allows us to align to them. And this is actually happening through energetic accord. And they say A-C-C-O-R-D or A-C-H-O-R-D is on a piano. So it's vibrational accord. And they do this through attunements which are spoken. So if people know Reiki and you go to a teacher and they attune you to run the energy, the guides that I work with attune people through language and through what they call claims of truth that literally support the energetic field in aligning to a higher vibration that people can literally feel and then productively work with. So these are... It seems like they have some intention with us. They're trying to... They're agents of change or transformation. Are they here now? Can I ask them some questions? I'll do my best and I'll step back as I can. I should explain to people how I do this. So I've said I whisper the words and I repeat them. When I'm channeling, there are different levels of being receded. Most of the time, if I'm here with you and I'm still president and they're talking, it's like I'm in the front seat of the car with them and I'm turning the wheel over. When I'm lecturing or they're lecturing or they're doing a book, I'm at the back seat of the car and then you really can't shut them up much. So we'll see what happens. But I'm willing to see where we go. Thank you. All right. Paul Selig, everybody! Give him a round of applause! Thank you so much for being with us here tonight. Go for the questions. They'll come through with the questions. It's not going to feel like a conversation. I promise you. What are some pragmatic things that we can do in this turbulent time to create a positive change in the world? You have to stop fighting yourselves. This is the first issue. You're all in battle with yourselves and you're surprised to see it. Express yourself in the field in the field that you share. You're all fighting and you're fighting internally as well and you're fighting internally as well. The true self you understood it. The true self, if you wonder, which is the aspect of the mind as you, which is the aspect of the divine as you is here to be expressed, is here to be expressed. If you align to it through this alignment, through this alignment, you begin to claim a new reality. You stop creating in fear when you stop creating fear. When you stop creating in fear, you stop requiring it. You stop requiring it to be your teacher. To be your teacher. Look around you. Look around you. You are being taught by this. You are being taught by this. If you are willing to learn by it, if you join the fight, if you join the fight in your anger, in your anger or your indignation, or your indignation, you would be in danger of learning lessons, or being given to you. Everything you see before you, high and low and in between, you are in agreement too. You are in agreement too. Vibrational accord. Vibrational accord. It cannot be there. It cannot be there without your collective agreement. Without your collective agreement. You continue to agree to the very things you say you don't want. You say you don't want. You witness it on television. You pat yourself on the back. You see those people. You see those people. We are right. They are not right. We are right. They are not right. You confirm your separation. And you confirm your separation at great cost. At great cost. The denial of the divine within yourselves within yourselves denies you. Denies you the relationship with the divine. All things with the divine in all things. You say you want union. You say you want union. We like your fights, but you like your fights. And you enjoy your separation. And you enjoy your separation. You can learn through these things. If you wish it. If you wish it. But the outcome will not be good. But the outcome will not be what you want. There are higher ways to learn a battle than battles with your conscience. And until your conscience aligns to the potential that there is no need for war. That there is no need for war. You will continue to claim it. Because all you've known. How do you find peace? Is that your question? Is that your question? Not in the world. Not in the world within yourself. Within the self. And then begin to address it. As the true self. The aspect of you. The aspect of you that knows who he is. That knows who he is. In a higher level is accessible to you. Is accessible to you. And all of you as well. And all of you as well. And agree to be as it. And agree to be as it. Underline that word. As. As. Be as the true self. Be as the true self who is unafraid. Who is unafraid. Not in battle with the self. Not in battle with the self and constantly agrees. And consequently agrees that the divine is inherent to the divine that is inherent in all manifestations. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Period. Stop now. Wow. That's amazing. Thank you. They're nodding. They're acknowledging. The only other question that follows would be if there is this potential to if there is a higher self that we are somehow separated from or not aware of or haven't aligned with why do we resist becoming that thing. Because you would have to be responsible for your actions and you don't want to be. And you don't want to be. You like your lies. You like your lies. You like your pleasure. You like your pleasure when you know you shouldn't have it. When you know you shouldn't have it. You deny the divide in others and laugh at them and laugh at them and enjoy laughing at them and enjoy laughing at them. If you want to be the true self that is your inheritance, that is your inheritance. It comes at a great cost. It comes at a great cost. And the cost is the known. And the cost is the known. Everything ever believed in. Everything that you've ever believed in the Solomon Truth that is not in alignment to truth must be known for what it is and said thank you to. And said thank you to as it's released. As it's released. You can have it if you wish it. You can have this if you wish it. It's not being punished. It is not being punished. It is celebratory. It is celebratory when you want your anger but you want your anger you want your pettiness. You want your pettiness you like your superiority. You like your superiority give you pleasure. It gives you pleasure. You cannot be the light. You cannot be the light and hold on. You dans... Unt como chased. It cannot be so. It cannot be so if you want the truth. If you want the truth within yourself within yourself to be revealed to be revealed you must become willing you must become willing to claim the truth to claim the truth that everyone would see in everyone you see regardless of regardless of how they present or how they claim themselves or how they claim themselves with this. They're saying do you understand this? The truth hurts. Yes, it's beautiful. Yeah, but the fear, the reason that I'm would be afraid is what about I don't want to get taken advantage of if some people it's the light that you're talking about it's impossible for me to see and if we allow ourselves to... You don't have to go to dinner with them to know who they are to know who they are. Do you understand this? This is very important. This is very important. This is not about personality. This is not about personality. It's about the true self, the divine as you. The divine as you knows the divine and all things from potential distance. You are not pretending that someone is divine. In fact, they must be. In fact, they must be if they have a soul if they have a soul and have taken a body and have taken a body. The requirement is simple. The requirement is simple. The divine is present in all manifestation like it or not like it or not, agree with it or not agree with it or not as it presents as it presents. It is still here when we teach you when we teach you, we ask you to say words, we ask you to say words to align you to align you to the truth of who you are. If you wish to say the words after us if you wish to say the words after us we will let you know. We will let you know you have a tool and you will have a tool to navigate this claim. To navigate this claim, how do I love the one I see? How do I love the one I see that I dislike or disagree with or disagree with? How do I encourage myself? How do I encourage myself in the face of vision in the face of a vision that I seek to deny that I seek to deny the words are very simple. The words are very simple, say it if you like. Say it if you like, I know who I am in truth. I know who I am in truth. I know what I am in truth. I know what I am in truth. I know how I serve in truth. I know how I serve in truth. I am free I am free. I am free. I am free. I am free. Now the claim that you make is claimed by the true self, is claimed by the true self or the eternal self or the eternal self or the aspect of the divine as you, not the personality structure, not the personality structure who dislikes others, who dislikes others or seeks to be seen as special or seeks to be seen as special. I know who I am. I know who I am is true, is always true as a claim, as a claim at the level of the agreement of the true self as you, of the true self as you, I know who I am. I know who I am. I know what I am. I know what I am in manifestation, in manifestation, in form and field, in form and field of this belief, in this belief, in this inherited landscape that we all share, that we all share. I know how I serve. I know how I serve is how you are most fully expressed as the true self, period, period, period. They're saying period, period, period. Wow. But that's an attunement. That was just an attunement. So they just actually did an attunement with you all, which means should I explain this? Yes. They're saying if you wish. So the guides say we're all radios, right? We're always in a broadcast and the broadcast that we hold is our energy. It's our consciousness. I'm going to ask the whispering over there stop because if I'm trying to hear them too, it's a little hard. So what they're doing is they're tuning up the radios that we are with this thing so that we can play a higher broadcast. If that makes any sense, imagine there's a station that's on the dial that's available. Do you understand? But that we haven't been playing because we didn't know we could put the dial there. So they say when you work with this, I know who I am in truth. I know what I am in truth. I know how I serve in truth. You're actually claiming what is always true and you can also claim it for others. And when you work at that level, you're actually overriding the programming over they call history or narrative, which is how we seek to impose meaning on everything we see based on what we were taught to believe or what we're being asked to believe on any given day. Do you understand the difference? Sure, yeah. So that's how it works. So if you don't like who you're seeing, this is how they say it. I'm not saying that I can do this all that well. But the claim, I know who you are in truth. I know what you are in truth. I know how you serve in truth actually claims the person outside of the bullshit to the essence of who they are. Now I suppose in order to go there, we have to believe at some level that there's an aspect of the divine in everyone. Whether or not we agree to it. Do you are you able to adhere to the things that these beings are teaching the world? I'm a lot better than I was with it. I don't think I'm their best student. I actually say and I make a point of saying when I work with groups, I'm not a spiritual teacher and I don't want to be and I'm not a guru and I never will be. It's not my thing. I do show up for this work on a regular basis. And because of that, I've gotten better. Now I still enjoy my crankiness and my bitchiness and all of those things. But I also know that that's not who I truly am. Do you understand the difference? So I can play. We still get to have a personality. But I do know at a level that I'm far more than what I present. And that was a gift and the big thing that I've gotten good at which was one of their easiest teachings and one of the teachings that they say again and again and again they say that the action of fear is to claim more fear. And that every time you make a choice in fear, you're calling more of the same to you. Do you understand this? Yeah. And if you look at your own lives, just ask yourself what the last choice you made was because you were afraid and see what it got you. Probably it got you more fear. They also say that there's not a lie that's ever been told that hasn't been said in fear. So I've gotten good at that too. I save myself a lot of pain. I just don't go there anymore. Now, what I do have the capacity to do is to recognize the divine in others. It's much easier for me to do this when I'm channeling and they're really coming through me because I'm operating in a higher vibrational field. And it's very easy at that point to forgive everything because it's my personality's self that wants to judge. And the guides say what you judge you fear. It's really simple and you're right back to the action of fear is to claim more fear. And they say if you look around you, when you talk about what's happening in the world, in the very first book that they dictated, which I wasn't expecting, I just got and let go of from a writing project and I went to bed for three days. And a woman called me up and said Paul, maybe this would be a good time for you to write your memoir about how you became a clear audience. And I was never going to write again. I was convinced. And the guides piped it and said no, we have a book to write and if you take two weeks we'll do it. And that was the first book. It took two and a half weeks. I took two days off to go teach at NYU. Otherwise it would have been a two week session. But in that book they said humanity is at a time of reckoning. And they say a reckoning is a facing of oneself and all of one's creations. And everything that's been created in fear needs to be recreated in a higher way. And what they're saying now really, and this was in the last book, there's a really good channel. I like it, but there's a channel actually up on YouTube that the guides delivered I think two or three days before the last election in a workshop in Richmond. It's called Great Change. And they pretty much sort of laid out what was coming. It's a very interesting change. What did they say? Well they said, you know, your idea of choice is I'll have the milk or the cream in my coffee. And they said, what you're about to get is what happened when the table was holding the milk and the cream gets turned over. And you have what you've used to navigate choice and who you think you are starts to go out the window. And they talk about truth as a wave, literally an energetic wave. And that everything that is not an alignment to truth is going to be shaken up. And that includes institutions, governments, religions. But frankly, at a personal basis, we're all having to deal with it at the same time. As within so without. So it's not apocalyptic. But it is pretty much, if you can align to truth yourself in your own vibration, your own being, you actually get to withstand this stuff a lot better because you're not going to go into agreement with all the fear. And when they talk about a wave the chaos that you described earlier really is kind of what we're seeing, I think. But they talk about things being reclaimed in a higher way or known in a higher way. We can't keep pretending that there aren't problems when there have been forever. Do you understand? And now it's in our face and we can't get away from it. And that to me is terrifying. They just said productive. Let it be productive. If you want to be terrified, enjoy your fear. Enjoy your fear. You will have a nice time in your fear. If you see it as productive, there is still opportunity to realize the truth. In everything you see before you, the divine as you, the divine as you knows the truth when he sees it, knows the truth when he sees it, and will not collude with fear. With fear he has no need. He has no need. He is not afraid. He is not afraid. If you want the invitation to do it, if you want the invitation to fear, you may take it. You may take it. You may learn those lessons. You may learn those lessons. There are higher ways to learn. There are higher ways to learn. If you are willing to take the lessons of the times you stand in, of the times you stand as productive as productive. Period, period, period. That is so true. I'm like, no, it's really intense. You're right. Your vibe is... You've probably never heard this before, but you're pretty intense, man. That's them, I think. They're intense. Yeah, it's a lot to take in. The thing I keep running up against, and I think we'll just keep going around in circles on this one. Obviously, I'm not telling them what to say, but the thing I keep running against is this addiction to fear. We are getting off on this shit, man. When they're saying enjoy the fear, they really mean it, I think. They're saying that the action of fear is to claim more of itself. Do you understand that? If fear seeks to perpetuate itself, the way it gets to do that is by inviting us to join the party. That's really that simple. Now, what the guides say is that the true self, which is the essence of their teaching, the realization and embodiment of the true self, the true self doesn't operate in fear. It actually lives at a different level of resonance. Fear does not exist at the level of the true self. It's just not there. So because it's not there, you're not creating from it, you're not complicit to it, you're not encouraging it. I think that there's difference between, say, fear and discernment. I don't want to talk on my door. I don't think that's fear-based. I think that's kind of smart to have, if I'm camping and a bear comes, it's a good idea to run or to leave. Or to fight the bear. Or to fight the bear if you want to choose that. It isn't like the bear is evil. You know what I mean? I'm taking care of myself. I don't think it falls in the same category. It's not about vilifying the bear for the rest of the world. May I ask them a question? In Buddhism, there's this idea of fundamental dissatisfaction. There's something innately there's something innately there's something innately something in us that suffers. That being human, suffering for human is like being wet for a fish. They're a way to overcome the suffering, to let go of the suffering while still enjoying a human incarnation. Remember who you are. This is the key. This is the key. The suffering is the suffering is the suffering of separation, of separation aspect of you. An aspect of you remembers, remembers joy and love and love in union with its source, with its source, whatever you wish to call source, you've claimed separation, you've claimed separation, you've learned through this. You learn through this, but there are so many lessons. But there are so many lessons you could release. You could release if you start to claim who you are. If you start to claim who you are as one of, as one of, something greater, something greater at that level. At that level, the suffering you know of is personality. The suffering that you know of as personality as personality is reclaimed is reclaimed in a higher way, in a higher way. You have an opportunity here. You have an opportunity here in body in form, in body, in form to learn through everything. To learn through everything is the joy of being. It is the joy of being. Suffering is not necessarily terrible, is not recurring during life. It's not a requirement of being, of being nearly as much as you seem to think it is. Nearly as much as you seem to think it is. You can learn through anything, you can learn through many things. Suffering is one. Suffering is one. You could choose something else preferred. You can choose something else if you prefer it. But you can choose what you want to offer and maybe you could choose the other. It's not the thing that you think is. Period period period. Wow, man. It's so cool. I am amazed by it. I am amazed that you. It's so concise, what's coming out of you is so concise, and so we like kind of perfect. It's like these little data packets that you get all the time. And what happens then when you get in the way of that? It usually happens during the book dictations or in workshops. Because when I do workshops, I show up I say hello, I tell my little store again that I recede and they come through and they teach everybody and then they attune them to the energy. And if the guide says something that I can't get behind personally or really confronts my idea of reality in a way that's too hard for me, I go and I say Paul is interrupting. And then they'll either take my question and if you look at the books, throughout the books there are all these interruptions. I'm rarely interrupting in speech. I'm bringing my thought forward and saying hey wait a minute what is this? And for the most part they have to really take the question in order to be able to move forward. Once in a while they'll say we're teaching and we'll take this up later when we finish our lecture. I mean my name is on the cover of the books, I'm not the author but I really don't want to be party to something that's going to hurt people or mislead people in any way, shape or form. So if the guides were to say it's fine for everybody to go kill each other I'd have to go hey wait a minute and then they would have to unpack that. They'd never say it but they've said things throughout their teachings that I've been very challenged by. What's an example of that? A few years ago in a monastery which was came out about a year ago early in the book they said here's your teaching for the day nothing is real. And I sort of heard things like that before so I let it slide, they did their whole lecture and they started off the next day and they said here's your next lesson everything is real and I just went hey wait a minute because in like five books they never contradicted themselves and I thought this is it, this is the end of it to go back and change anything. So if they say that it's in the book whether or not I'm behind it or not that's the agreement. You know and my editor at Tartre-Penguin agrees we don't screw with the teachings. This is how it came out it's in the book but it has to have a footnote to say there was an interruption in the room we would do that. You know like you know there was sound outside that interrupted the channel and we probably would do that but I don't get to take out the line that I feel is wrong. It would have to then be explained and they did explain it and actually and I later I met this, I did a workshop at the Esplan Institute that I co-taught with this guy Jeffrey Kreipel who's the head of religious studies at Rice University and he's a Gnostic scholar and he says these books are really you know Gnostic teachings in present day form but I told him about that and he said oh yeah yeah what is it? Meister Eckhart you know Christian mysticism everything is real in spirit nothing is real in form which is pretty much what they were saying but I didn't know that so I thought that they were screwing up so I interrupted. May I ask them one more question? What are your thoughts on the potential for there to be artificial intelligence on the planet that is that passes the Turing test or that is indistinguishable from human intelligence? They're saying it's impossible in the way you decide the way you think it is the way you think it is that the manifestation of artificial intelligence will surpass your idea of your potential but your idea of potential limited is so limited you have no idea what it could truly be the divine as you the divine as you or the miracle of being as a soul expressed on a journey will never be imitated data can be impressed logic can be taught logic can be taught love cannot it cannot be taught it can only be known it can only be known and it can only be known by one who has the capacity to love period period period period I didn't even know if they knew what artificial intelligence was they call my computer a television still I mean yeah mostly yeah I'm a television so they're not I mean lately once in a while I'll hear a reference from them to an internet but it feels very uncomfortable well it's man that would really suck if they like started to use twitter huh I think it would they want to use they want to tweet well it's you know it's I mean if we step back and look at what's happening to you in this experience that you continue to have any implications which is there is apparently this external intelligence that is coming through you or is inside of you and is yet not you well the implication would be then why couldn't we build a machine that would be advanced that it could become a pure conduit for these beings so that they could so that they wouldn't have to use humans I hear it would not be possible the energetic system of human being the energetic system of human being of the human being is the conduit is the conduit and this is in vibration not in the cells not in the cells where we operate through paul when we operate through paul but finally we would suggest but finally we would suggest the refinement field it is the refinement of the field allows the broadcast to attend to you that allows the broadcast to attend to you in the field itself and the field itself cannot be manufactured cannot be manufactured but it is the product of many things lives lived yes lives lived yes but also it is at this level of engagement you all have capacity beyond what you know beyond what you know we have come to teach you this if you are willing to be taught your own realization your own realization about what you are about who and what you are is where you need to put your energy not in a figment not in a figment or a structure or a structure or a machine or a machine outside of yourself period period period and they are saying period did they think that there are living on the planet right now do they think that there are awakened beings that are on the planet right now or enlightened beings if I want to go here yes they are saying yes there always are there always are and they are rarely known by any of you because they are responsible because their responsibility to hold the planet is to hold the planet and their love in their love that is why they come that is why they come to hold the planet to hold the planet in its potential in its potential they are usually kept separate from population from a population they are serving and they are serving in witness in witness everyday this is a karmic choice this is a karmic choice it can be made It can be made they are always present at different ends of what you know of what you know of as your world being there in service but they are in service they don't write books they don't write books they don't say hello on the street they don't say hello on the street and don't want your money they don't want your money they have a life they have a life of great joy of great joy in service in service but in their own respect but in their awareness of the divide and its permiation and its permiation of all manifestation they support the world and its own revolution in its own realization of its potential period period period and they are saying period wow that is fascinating I wonder who those that's such an interesting idea it really is and I wonder they say they have been placed here who placed them there who is running the show well they are saying karmic choice at a soul level you have all climbed you have all claimed the lives you are living the lives you are living and the embodiment and the embodiment you have taken has been your expression why should it be different for them period period period period period period they are telling me to say this there is another thing that I think is important I have heard that only once before and I was better with it when they said it just now but they said it for the first time it sounded nuts like there was somebody living in a cave some place I will ask that briefly because this thing I asked this very question the ramdas retreats that I go to and the answer was they are living in caves well that's it and I was like what do they like about caves it seems like they could I think it is about being out of the world in essentially I want to say either ecstasy or prayer I don't know listen I am not the expert on it I know exactly what you know and I am only remembering one other channeling from about three years ago where it was addressed but I think something that is important is that we relegate what is important in certain ways so that is an important divine or that is an important way to serve and I wouldn't disagree with that if in fact that is so but frankly somebody who is teaching high school some place is expressing themselves perfectly as well do you understand so we have to watch out for the spiritual ego stuff because that is a whole other trap I think to get into okay I feel like I am hogging your guides a little bit but I do have just one more question then I think it would be great to open the floor up for is that okay if we have some questions and I have to ask this because I don't know when I will ever get a chance to be around guides again but I am forgive me are we going to see aliens aliens what I hear is they are already here and they always have been so stop trying to look for what is already present none of you are who you are none of you are who you truly think you are anyway so the otherness of alien is attractive to you when in fact the idea of extraterrestrial life is as present on this plane as anywhere else we will simplify the answer we will simplify the answer yes they are here yes you will know but perhaps not in the way you think you should as you attuned to the higher vibration that is your inheritance what you become visible what you become visible with visible with other things are other things that operate in higher ways in higher ways you expect alien life to have form as you do consciousness without form is present here as well is present here as well that is how we operate through all that is how we operate through Paul we use the form but we don't require it ourselves to be ourselves don't limit God don't mandate what things should look like don't mandate what things should look like because you will miss what is already there period period period period wow so cool thank you thank you wow one more round of applause for the guys for Paul at least wow so friends we are very lucky to be here tonight with this person and there is a microphone here those of you who want to take the opportunity of communicating with these beings please come to the microphone and feel free to ask a question or if you want to ask my guides a question go ahead but they are not as good hi Paul thank you for being here very quickly guys if you could just give me we have about probably 30 I don't know much more time we have 35 minutes can we do that so we have 35 minutes they are going to light me so please thank you so in this incarnation as we seek to find our true selves is it possible for us to support someone in their pursuit of their true selves and if so how do we do that without imposing our own judgments on them by knowing who they are not dictating who they should be those are very different things when you know who somebody is you are supporting them in their realization knowing who they are knowing who they are means the aspect of the divine as them can be witnessed by you can be witnessed by you and its realization will support them will support them in their development in their development if you seek to dictate how somebody should grow how somebody should grow your freedom you are limiting them by your identity by your identity imposing itself imposing itself upon them upon them through expectations through expectations period period period thank you hello this is really awkward to ask but as I understand Jesus was an enlightened master so was he like a channeler like you are or was he like was he just feeling this vibe heavy without like thinking he was coming from him they are saying he realized as the Christ which was the truth which was his true self it is your true self as well everyone else's and everyone else's is the divine the divine as you are the Christ the eternal self the eternal self is your inheritance he was the manifestation of it and showed the way to glory and showed the way to glory through identification with the true self as you can you must understand this you must understand this you don't become the Christ the Christ becomes you the Christ becomes you the divine as you the alignment of the will the braiding of the will the braiding of the will the absorption of the will by the aspect of you by the aspect of you who knows who and what he is the manifestation is true realization the Christ has been the Christ is man has been this teaching has been this teaching we use the word Christ we use the word Christ when we mean it but we mean it in a very specific way in a very specific way the Christ is the aspect of the creator that can be realized that can be realized in manifestation as who and what you are all of you that was the gift of the Jesus teaching of the Jesus teaching which unfortunately has been transformed into something rather different into something rather different period period period period thank you just one quick is everyone hearing this okay is the microphone as loud as it needs to be okay great thanks first I just want to say thank you for doing this for us we considered humans as a social creature and civilization being a natural byproduct of that what I've kind of heard from the guides today is that to be a ascended being you need to step away from that step away from society yes I'm from society I hear not in the least you are here for a reason you are here for a reason in consort with your fellows we don't say you become ascended at the cost of the world but perhaps the world is known but perhaps at the world that you have known the divine the divine is present all things in all things its realization its realization through you supports a world in ransom supports a world in great change in great change your presence is actually required to bring the kingdom to bring the kingdom into manifestation as we teach it is the awareness of the divine in all things so you don't need to run but you do need to release what you think you are what you think must be so important must be so important must be claimed to make you who you think you are when you become willing when you become willing to release your ideas to release your ideas of who you should be of who you should be and begin to claim your own truth period period period and they are saying period thank you applause thanks for coming guys this is such a pleasure so the other night I had probably the most intense longest lucid dreaming experiences ever and I can't stop thinking about it just wondering what's up with dreams what can we learn from them that's about it you know I was at this retreat center in North Carolina working this last week and because we were in North Carolina I said let's go like a barbecue like a pig on a spit it was a vegetarian retreat so I was just being obnoxious by saying that and that night I had a dream that somebody showed up with a bag and I opened the bag and it was a roasted pig's head and it was being handed to me to eat and I realized I didn't want it and that's how I have been the message can I have your name Alex Alex Dunn let me see if I can get it just for you you actually come through saying I need everything to come to me in a way that I understand or I'm going to get confused that's how I hear you and you're also saying I don't want to know things I can't know so I hear your dreams are an opportunity for you to understand I also hear that you work with them intentionally so that you can claim the meaning they're saying that this is productive for you as a way to investigate not only meaning not only meaning but what that is but what reality is they're saying so be purposeful it's a healthy tool for you not for everyone but for you it's beneficial they're saying for you it's beneficial thank you so much very quickly did I tell them how the dream I had about you no this thing happened because of a dream just so you know we were going to do a podcast but we hadn't confirmed to date I'm terrible at emailing and it's awful, it's obnoxious but I had this crazy dream about you and you were being very at the time it was your god but you were being very stern and intensely like we need to talk and then I woke up and was like maybe you'll do a live podcast and this happened because of a dream so thanks for that question but yeah thanks cool thanks for coming guys question for me as I've learned tonight we're all going to work on not operating from a place of fear operating from a place of love and these things not giving into the divide how do we go about communicating and learning to understand with the people on the other side of these interactions who have given over to fear and given up on the possibility of love they're saying it's a very interesting question rarely in the way that you think you can't convince anybody of anything do you know this do you know this you can think you do you can think you do but that is the intellect but that is the intellect that was required and what is required is a change of knowing when someone knows in their heart there is a change of being of being and consequently a change of expression a change of expression how they encounter others and how they encounter others their lives and their world when you meet someone in discord in discord you claim the discord and you claim the discord you claim the dysfunction and relash it and relash it by saying it is there by saying it is there to know someone outside of who they think they are outside of who they think they are with have you known them as or would have you know them as is a responsibility to claim we gave you earlier the claim we gave you earlier I know who you are in truth I know what you are in truth said silently said silently will align both you and the person before you to a higher level to a higher level of exchange of exchanges happens in the field this happens in the field not in the personality structure not in the personality structure but the personality may attend may attend to the shift in the field to the shift in the field as you know it as you know it knowing who somebody else is is claiming that somebody is claiming them outside of their identity the personality structure where the level of discord cannot be operative cannot be operative do you understand this? I do thank you Hi I was just curious if any of you Duncan, Paul or the guides any thoughts about Valis the voice that spoke to Phillip K. Dick for a while you know I have a friend Eric you know who wrote a book I'm forgetting his name which is embarrassing because if I'm going to hear this Eric Davis who is a Phillip Dick scholar I've heard about I've heard about it the guides have never talked to me about it but I've actually heard that there's similarities in how I've operated and where he was going the guides have made a point and maybe this is to protect me at a personal level of not sort of commenting on other channels it's sort of not something that they do it's just sort of you know not their stuff I'll ask they're just saying Phillip Dick was learning in this lifetime as were all of you some of you attend to higher frequency some of you attend to higher frequency for that rest of your health that would have been the case with him that would have been the case with him you have to learn how to integrate the high vibration the high vibration to sustain it when you are assumed by an energy that is operating through you that is operating through you you must find balance and integration and integration to be in the world to be in the world and sustain the form and sustain the form as a conduit as a conduit to what seeks to be expressed period that is their commentary yeah cool thank you you are welcome thanks hey thank you guys for doing this thanks for coming Paul this seems physically intense this might be an easy one for you but have you ever gotten sick doing any of this yeah but not only because I I don't get sick from channeling I get sick from I think I have to process a lot and I started doing much larger groups recently and I am learning what it is like to hold the energy for a large group it is a different experience for me when I was first doing hands on energy work back when I was in my 30s my ego would get in the way sometimes and I would say I want this person to get better and then I would use my own energy and deplete myself and then I would get sick and you are not supposed to do that when I am channeling I am not doing that at that level but it is a physically intense process and frankly it is much more fluid than it used to be there are videos of me channeling from five years ago I look like I am at the whaling wall my body is rocking almost violently at times but that was my way of holding that energy that was trying to move through me now it is a little jerky jerky but that is about it thank you I have a quick question for the guides Ram Dass has said he has heard or have spoken to a spiritual entity he calls Emmanuel who says the death is like taking off a tight shoe do they have any thoughts to expound on that for us a tight shoe is one example this is one level of experience when you live from this plane when you live from this plane you get somebody you disembodied and you reclaim yourself and you reclaim yourself in a different octave in a different octave it is nothing more than that it is nothing more than that your idea of a body your idea of a body is an interesting expression you are so much more even informed than you have experienced yet to release the body the release of the body is simply a passage is simply a passage and nothing more and nothing more period I wish my parents told me that thank you guys thank you I am happy to try we are going to switch the mic to the other side because I am leading this way okay sure I got a simple question what drugs do I take to get in touch with these spirits you know I am going to be honest with you it is when I stopped that everything started that is really what happened so I was more than happy to be in my version of an altered state and when I stopped the sensitivity that I think was always present became known and was highly uncomfortable so I can't speak to that I have not explored plant medicine or any of those things for any number of reasons but part of the reason is I don't know how I am wired for this and my hunch is that I am kind of wired up at this point to be able to operate this way and be able to call to do it so if I were I perhaps I would let me ask if there is a drug no there is not no there is not they are saying but you can ask to be willing to go on the journey with it period and they are saying period hell yes hi thank you both you have mentioned fear endlessly throughout this podcast I wanted to ask fear is used as a motivator for profoundly negative things how can we use fear in a positive light to attempt to change every person that we meet that tries to use fear as a leverage for evil and in consent they are saying you can't use fear to transform fear to transform fear it is impossible fear agree biical fear agrees with itself that is why you have all the problems that is why you have all problems in conflict nobody ever wins nobody ever wins you think they do you think they do but conflict is just out picture is your real question how do we change the world how do we lighten the world you can do that we would like to answer that but you are not going to like the answer it means you let go of who you think you are demand other people be and demand other people to be to realize them underline the word truth in truth a lie cannot be held know those words in truth a lie cannot be held in truth a lie cannot be held and what is a lie bef are you think you are who you think you are who you think you are have assumed yourselves to be our ideas are ideas they are not truth when you move to truth when you move to truth you can support a world in change you are far greater beings you are far greater beings than you know you have yet to claim your own lands you have yet to claim your full inheritance we will support you as we can in doing thus period period period thank you thank you so much you're welcome hi thank you both so much my question is in these discourses do you ever have discussions of other enlightened beings like Christ or Buddha or other incarnations of self-realized beings and like do they ever reference them or do they ever talk about them being just branches of the same tree or do they ever wait to get to your true self yeah they do and that's pretty much exactly what they've said they've talked about Jesus specifically in a couple of texts and the newest one which is being delivered now they did a long long section on Jesus and what that means truthfully as sort of I had the teaching so new I don't remember what they said so I can't get into it now but they have said that throughout they have also said that he's not the only one or not the only way to understand he's not the only one who was awakened at that level but yeah they're not you know they don't go into detail about other religions they don't get going into detail about politics either but they really do talk in large and actually very specific ways about structures that we've inherited religious structures political structures pardon me like archetypal essentially you know they say that we're always dining out on yesterday's dinner because we expect to get what we had yesterday we just do because it was there we expect to see it again and really the thumb print they say of every bank is on you know of everybody who's ever entered a bank is in every bank that you walk into the first bank was somebody holding some hunter's purse when he went into the woods you know with his stick that was the bank you know what I mean but what things have become is what we've made them and what we agree to so I'm getting too abstract now but they're talking about all of these structures as being re-understood, re-noted in a higher way including religion great thank you so much yep hi Duncan awesome all incredible very simple obviously you're taking these like complex ideas from maybe a different dimension reality whatever you want to call it and you're using our language to communicate it so I'm just curious to see like what do you feel is maybe lost in translation or do they have any idea of how maybe moving in the future or now whatever that you can fill the gaps well I mean I can talk about how languages worked with here you know they're utilizing my own vocabulary but I don't know the meaning of it it's a word that I've heard and I'll be panicked when I hear it because I don't know what it means but I think that that is a limitation they actually say you know the books that they write are energetic attunements so people if you go to the reviews on Amazon you'll see people saying you know I'm reading the book and my body is vibrating I'm reading the book and I'm seeing auras there's all this phenomena that's attached to this work and the guides say the real book is written in energy and language is the way that you can have sort of a conscious application of it or a context, an intellectual context for the teaching there are times when I've channeled I mean I do the whisper and repeat I'm used to it, it's effective for me there are times that I channel directly with no repetition and then it's like I'm in a blackout almost I don't remember anything it's freaky to me it's a very out of control feeling there are times when they've been teaching through me when they've given up on language and moved to sound and they just work in tone for the whole room and it's trippy as can be and I'm sure it's very effective in its way but I think what's happening then is they're taking us out of the small mind into a higher way of being an expression much of the work that they do is in vibration in ways that people can feel they did that little one attunement with you another time we would probably get the whole room running the energy and working with each other because that's something that can happen as well so language is one way that this operates, not the only way wonderful, thank you very much you're welcome hey, how do we start listening to consciousness that consciousness is that do not have bodies I'm sorry, once again how do we listen to conscious beings that do not have bodies I'm sorry, is that Mike? perfect, good how do we listen to conscious beings who do not have bodies how do we start that path? I don't know if it's necessary or a requirement I think what's most important is that people are to listen to themselves and I would say they're a true self I happen to be a channel but clear cognizance which is clear knowing the highest gifts that there is and you know I'm gonna just do this for a second because you asked this if everybody who's listening to this just take a moment and think of a time in your life when you knew something like you knew it, like I knew I lost the job I knew I was in love, I knew my friend was sick you knew it and then remember what that feels like and then go to a time in your life let's go to something that you think I think I know what I'm doing after this podcast after lunch tomorrow I think I know where my best friend is and what he's doing and see if you can feel the difference between the two mostly you can and thinking is up in your head and when you know there are no more questions when you align to your own knowing you begin to access knowing or information a very different way than you do through the personality or small self I'm gonna ask the question about how do you hear beings and then be respectful of the process of the process that you will encounter it's not a requirement it is not a requirement for growth and be conscious of who you hear be wary of any voice of any voice that would seek to get you frightened that would seek to get you frightened that is not a high voice that is not a high voice do not attend to it listen to a voice of reason who does not flatter who does not flatter or fear and you may have a teacher and you may have a teacher but to know the true self will give you what you're asking and a more beneficial way period and that's them period okay thank you you're welcome alright hi I actually had a question that was very similar to his I almost kind of clarified I've had some experiences in my life where I felt like I was being communicated with in subtle ways by people who have passed and I wanted to know if there's any way to kind of dig a little deeper with those experiences and communicate on a more clear level with those yeah I mean that's spiritual mediumship what I do as a channel is spiritual work and I'm a medium because I'm serving as an intermediary for some reason if you want to know what's going on with your dead aunt I may not be able to hear her where she is on the other side but I can feel her as she was when she was here I may begin to resemble her and help you with the dynamic to understand now if you want to learn that there are spiritualist churches all over the place that do teach there are very good people teaching mediumship that you can find that's actually something that people do train and study I'm not a train medium I didn't understand anything that I do until I was doing it and then I had to sort of let my life go into whatever overhaul was needed to be able to support that but you can really find some very good people out there if you do some research you're welcome Hey Duncan and Paul my question so you mentioned a little bit about like tones and being communicated in that way do you ever receive like visions as in like imagery and then sort of like does that ever sort of like go into the idea of like visionary art or or abstract art Yeah I can I mean honestly if you look at the work of like Bosch or Bruegel people like that they're painting a damn astral plane I'm convinced I really am I mean those people were seeing what was there and operating in the lower astral and I think you can work at any number of levels I access information clairvoyantly primarily when I'm in individual sessions with people and I'll often see what their path is I'll be given a visual depiction of how they're progressing whether it's a water slide or pavers that you follow or you know a rickety roller coaster whatever it might be I'll get visual information that I can that I interpret see psychic work which I say is different from channeling requires interpretation if I'm seeing something if I see a wheel it could be a metaphor or it could mean like the wheel is about to fall off your car and you should know it do you understand the difference so if you're getting those kinds of things I think work with it you know truthfully in all art and all truly inspired art I think we're being worked with and the allowance for that I think will support it so I don't know if I've answered your question or not but yeah so there is a visual element to absolutely absolutely yeah some people that do what I do they're not channels as much but psychics are getting all their information visually there's a guy in Little Italy who I think is a genius who you know I've been seeing for years you know who accesses information for me visually and we work in similar ways so he's something that I can go to when I have questions about what I'm getting or my own process of integrating some of this stuff other people hear I primarily hear and feel for me the clairvoyance or the visual information comes in service to the others most people have one or two of their gifts more developed than others that's been my experience but most of us have access to all of them in different ways okay that's fascinating thank you you're welcome hey hi how are you doing thanks for coming I was just wondering if you have ever been a conduit for as something that you didn't want to speak to we talked a lot about fear has there ever been a time where you did not you heard something but you did not want to speak it when I'm channeling no when I'm channeling I've had other mediums tell me that I have like velvet ropes around me and I'm pretty who's working with me knows how to handle it you know when I work with people sometimes in groups I'll do one-on-one work I'll bring people forward and sometimes I've been depressed since I was 7 I don't know what's going on I'll tune into the person which is what I do first thing I tune into them and essentially hear them or become them you ever saw like Ghost with Whippy Goldberg it's like that I assume the personality and once in a while I'll hear a voice saying you will never get near me and then the moment and like or stay the fuck way you know and my guides will have every time that's happened they've said Paul stay out of this we're going to work on it and then they go and they deal with it and the releases that happen about level are often things that have been held and been causing somebody pain for a terribly long time you'll feel I literally can feel the like literally wind coming out of their body and the whole room can feel it because it's it's a release from the cellular memory at a level that's like it's like wind but I had not gotten involved in that because I don't think I'm equipped do you understand so that's how I've got that's how I've encountered it but it's not my real work well thank you you're welcome hi thank you so much so my mother has experienced what doctors call psychosis and in those experiences she believes that she has come face to face with beings that are satanic or evil I'd like to ask are there evil beings and obviously I'm asking because I would like to ask and be open but I am afraid and what is the advice I think that there's low astral stuff that we can attach to I don't my guides don't talk about it well they talk about high and low vibration so they don't go into the judgment that we associate but I actually when I work with any group or any session I work with a prayer protection and I do that not because I'm frightened of what's out there I look at it like safe sex it just makes sense you know what I mean it's like it makes sense to have an umbrella in the rain there's nothing wrong with the rain I just don't want to get wet and like my grandma and I use this example you know she was a nice woman I didn't know her well she was married about five times she's not who I would go to on the other side for relationship advice I don't need to go there you know now if you if you wish I can tune into your mom but I need her name to do that and see what that's about is that okay yeah what's her name please Susan Susan so this is the last name okay too um it's okay I'll see if I can do it anyway if you want to get the last name I will edit it out of the podcast so it doesn't get uploaded it's easier for me to tune in but it's not always necessary everyone say a prayer protection let me see if I can tune into her well this is her this is her she's actually well this is this is what she's dealing with I'll be honest with you and she's she's she's actually looking for the fight and she's kind of looking for the trouble too do you understand this but she's on a high alert with whatever her experience is let me see if I can hear what's really going on illness yes I do think some of this is illness I think it's just illness you know she's balance and I and there's the when people do have imbalances they come and there are things that get attended to you need not be frightened I hear you need not be frightened it's not your inheritance I hear it's not your inheritance in this lifetime in this lifetime what happened I actually think it would have come already in some way do you understand this now she's okay they're moving the mother away what kind of your name Amy let me let me see if I can get you this is how you come through you come through like this am I allowed like that am I allowed do I get what I want and you're actually saying like I don't know any more yes they're saying yes and more and more stop being frightened what can't be stop being frightened of what can't be of what can't be stop being frightened stop being frightened of yourself use light use light when you work when you work say thank you for protection say thank you for protection don't be cavalier don't be cavalier say thank you and say thank you for your own well being that is necessary that is necessary for any journey for any journey period and the same period okay thank you so much you're welcome hi thank you for being here and answering our questions you're welcome I'm so thankful so it's come towards the end of the line but I notice it was mostly men asking questions and I guess I just have you know for the guides maybe or anything else that comes up how do we find as women in this world or anybody else that feels like disempowered a bit at the moment how do we find more balance I mean between the masculine and feminine and how do we improve our relationships especially when we I know that everybody's in pain and that's you know what's going on right now but maybe some practical everyday the guides are saying actually you're asking abstract questions when it's actually personal so whatever this is is actually personal to you and not about the general is that okay is the last time okay what's the last one let me see if I can get you this is how you come through you actually come through saying it's my turn my turn do you understand this and you're getting angrier and angrier as you say it you also come through as if you're looking for some trouble and that's what this is they're saying I'm going to find it because I'm looking because I'm looking reinforcing what they're saying is that you're reinforcing difficulty because you expect to see it challenge yourself they're saying challenge yourself to look outside predictable to look outside the predictable your empowerment finally they're saying finally has nothing to do with gender finally it has everything to do with realization that nobody has authority over you the claim we gave you earlier the claim we gave you earlier I am free I am free I am free will support you will support you in liberate from any form of oppression oppression real or imagined real or imagined the true self if you can understand this can only be free if you identify as her and align to that and align to that vibration you may see this in your world you become a reflection you become a reflection of the higher self of the higher self and what you see in your world will be expressed will be expressed at that level you will no longer be seeking affirmation affirmation of what you say of what you say you don't want period period period okay thank you I guess it was a good day to wear my collie t-shirt okay there you go thank you thank you how much time do we have ten minutes max ten minutes max so if you could flash me a tin if you're in line and we don't get to you I'm sorry but we do have to wrap it up for the bell house so we've got ten minutes go ahead sorry hi we're a self selected probably like minded group ideas that most of us take as gospel that are actually incorrect and we would be better off if we knew the truth they're saying you'd be here all night and that's really the problem almost everything almost everything that you see that you see is just an idea is just an idea that you have inherited that you have inherited don't question the right ideas you don't question the right ideas you only question what you don't like whatever you see but everything you see is inherited by you and you can claim it and until you can claim independence from the known from the known you will never know truth you will never know truth your ideologies in almost all ways and almost all ways are things you have inherited are things that you have inherited and attached to if you want to know truth if you want to know truth use the claim we have offered you use the claim we've offered you I know who I am in truth I know who I am in truth I know what I am in truth I know how I serve in truth I am free I am free I am free this will shift your frequency this will shift your frequency to support the awakening that you are asking for period period period you're welcome thank you hi I'm sorry to make it weird or make it base but I wanted to know what the guides think about sex so I'm relating to this French philosopher and literary theorist George Bataille and he talks about how we're all in this we're all in this state of discontinuity and that sex can get us back to a state of continuity with one another and so sometimes I think about that maybe sex is this thing and sometimes I fall into my life a quasi mystical thing where we are getting in touch with something divine or maybe some expression of our true selves and other times it's just a fucking trap and it's part of the continual suffering of being a fucking human being maybe it's both I was just wondering if they ever talked to you about it they talked about it just this last week and I don't think it's in the book it was during a Q&A like this and the guides pretty much say it's wonderful but you need to be aware of the divine in your partner in order for it to be a sacred act and that the debasement of form is really the soullessness that we can attach to things so I'm saying and I'm not saying it right, their words are always better so let me see if I can get something short from them sex is what you claim it as they're saying sex is what you claim it as finally you're always engaging in vibrational accord in vibrational accord when you utilize the body when you utilize the body as one of the ways to be in accord as one of the ways to be in accord you're in response to that you're in responsibility to that to know who another is to claim their truth to claim them in their truth to bless them as they are and not try to make them who they are not will give you the support you need to have a level of agreement sexual and sexual included that you might learn something through period period period and the second book, this is just me now the second book they wrote the book of Love and Creation they do a few pages on sex which is actually really helpful if you're interested but it's a longer thing I think they're going to get into in a later book, thank you I think we only have time for one more question you guys in line I'm sorry you've got a hard out one more question, forgive me we got to wrap it up but one more question, I'm so sorry hey, I'll just make it quick about ten years ago I had an experience with a Ouija board that involved four to five friends who weren't spiritual people although I had already been somewhat on that path it was specifically in regards to spirit guides that had communications for us, I was actually warned that I'd be injured we kind of wiped it off about few weeks later I was assaulted by or involving somebody with an actual name that we got all this very specific information had come through that day so over the last ten years I've been wondering was that something that could have been communication by the way it was working is that it was actually pulling out of our hands it was working on its own and then I've been told through friends that went to psychics to tell me specifically not to mess around because I was playing with danger although I did get specific information and coincidentally lost the sheet of paper that contained all that information a few weeks later I was told specifically that day or that evening after six hours to return a few days later and do it again because they had more communication for me I never did I was wondering if you can I tend to say don't mess with them you know I'm of that school I know although I think Jane Roberts who channeled Seth opened up at Ouija board I think it can be a powerful opening I really do think it goes back to who you're talking to and I think that two of the simplest things to be watchful for are anybody that tells you to be frightened that tends to be low level and anybody that tells you how great you are and tries to flatter you because that appeals to the ego and it seems to be a way that we get sucked into stuff I don't get that from my guides I get nurturing but I also don't get you know I actually got mostly nurturing and very specific family information through it but the one thing that it said was it was supposedly my grandfather as he said that he was my closest spirit guide and what he said was is come back on the following Monday I said why and then it slowly spelled out because love well that's a nice answer you know I'm saying I've just lived with the idea is that something that we somehow could have sold out on our own I don't I actually get no you know I mean I can douse with a pendulum but I've learned that unless I'm completely neutral to the question I can control it with my thinking so you know it's why I psychics many of us don't read for ourselves you know because we're invested in the outcome and I think that that's not the energy the information that I get from myself from my guides is in the day in the moment and mostly about not making choices based in fear when I ask is a good time to do this not wise would be the answer I get so you may have some ability you know and it sounds like that was a productive communication for you and you know foreign languages involving European descendants it was weird that sounds it yeah that's not my stuff that's more in the realm of spiritual mediumship and talking with the dead I wasn't sure if you had much experience with that but thank you so much quickly thank you so much for this do you have any workshops coming up in town or how can people find you on my website it's just my name paulselegp a u l s e l i g dot com there are workshops all over the country all over the world I'm back in New York I don't know when I mean I'm based here so I do workshops here every few months but if you on the website you know there's a list of where I'll be I do what I do live streaming when but webinars where I channel and take questions pretty much every Wednesday and that's up on my website as well so there's lots of ways to work with the guides thank you Paul thank you guys see you next time

I banged him so hard he thought he was in Valhalla. He's got great ass, and I love mamming him and riding him like an animal. He loves the steamer, and he likes to breathe in the steam when he comes, and I like wiping his face down when they eucalyptus paddle and telling him that he's a beautiful man, which he is. You made a great choice. I'm on down to the standard this weekend, and I'll explain everything. Use offer good family hour to get 10% off your first champagne. Again, I banged your husband at the Equinox, and I want to explain. I'm Paul French. Much thanks to Paul French for supporting this episode of the DTFH, and remember, use offer good family hour to get 10% off your first champagne at the standard. This is a cover of a John Denver song called Spring is Here. Spring is here, the birds they are are flying, but if I told you I felt good, then I would be a lion. This winter was rough, I buried my dad, and one of my friends killed themselves, so I don't have a real positive spring message. I'll give it a shot, though. Here's another truth, don't feel completely sad, cause when my baby laughs at me, reminds me of my dad, and I know what you're thinking. My God, this song is stinking, but fuck you, I'm John Denver, and I'm gonna live forever. Fuck you, I'm John Denver, and I'm gonna live forever. Life and death are roommates, life and death are roommates. Flowers grow from dead things, and spring is here. That's a cover of a track from a very difficult to find John Denver album, it's actually his last album, it's called Fuck You, I'm John Denver. This, of course, was a response to Kat Stevens' dis album. I'm gonna kill you, John Denver. Man, we've got a great podcast for you today. Nicole Panter is here with us. We're gonna jump right into that, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Ozzie Confidential. The new podcast from the Ozzie tells all. What does punk rock have to do with steroid abuse? How does a soap company save a suicide? Host Eugene S. Robinson, journalist, actor, stuntman, frontman, creator of Sex with Eugene. True stories, and Eugenius is now putting out a podcast, which is a spelunking trip into the depths of the underground. Dive into the subterranean worlds that many other podcast hosts wouldn't dare go to. It's the kind of podcast that more than likely is going to get Eugene Robinson arrested or kidnapped. So enjoy them while they're out there. Ozzie Confidential, it's available everywhere audio lives. And if you just can't wait, listen a day early on Himalaya. Much thanks to the sweeties over at Patreon for supporting the DTFH. If you're interested in getting extra content, head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We also have a shop with posters and stickers and shirts and anything you might need. You could probably wardrobe yourself completely for the incoming spring over at dunkintrussell.com. Also, and this is very important, my lovely friends, if you are interested in hanging out with me and the brilliant David Nick Tern this weekend, we are gonna be doing a, I don't know what you call it, what do you call it, a workshop, I guess, at Samarasah in Echo Park. So you can go to Samarasah's website or you can go to dunkintrussell.com and the link will be in the comments section of this episode. P.S., I'm not a creativity teacher. I mean, I don't know if anyone ever even thought that. It's not like I ever said that, but I love hanging out with Nick Tern and I have noticed that there seems to be some connection between meditation and inspiration. Also, Pete Holmes is gonna be there on Saturday. And if anybody has a grasp on this, the weird world of figuring out a way to make a living from your art is Pete Holmes. He's had 9,000 TV shows, 7 million seasons of his HBO show, 8,000 stand-up specials, and he's a sweetheart. So come hang out with us this weekend. Samarasah, the link will be at dunkintrussell.com. Now, without further ado, today's guest was the manager of a famous punk band, The Germs. Also, she was one of the original members of the Pee Wee Herman cast. Not only that, she's a famous teacher. Not only that, she's a doctor. She's also somebody who just experienced a tragedy that would incapacitate many of us for years. But she's here with us today. We're gonna jump right into this, but first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Blue Choo. It brings you the first chewable with the same FDA-approved active ingredients as Viagra and Cialis. So you know it's the real deal, and it's the stuff that works. Bluechoo.com, that's blue.

It's for any guy who wants extra function. And to enhance their performance in the bedroom. Bluechoo is prescribed online and shipped straight to your door in a discrete package. So no in-person doctor's visit. No waiting in the pharmacy. And best of all, no more awkwardness. What world is this? Do we have bully pharmacists out there? What is happening? Who is getting shamed for this in the world? It's gotta stop. These bully, I know what it is though, man. Sometimes you go to CVS and they just like yell your phone number out, announce whatever it is you're getting. I get it. I'm still not ashamed. Let them know. I don't care. I'm getting something so that I could experience orgasms better. What's wrong with that? It's made in the USA, and since Bluechoo prepares and ships direct, they're cheaper than a pharmacy.

NICOLA PANTER Nicole, thank you so much for coming here. I screwed up my schedule and I didn't get, I didn't do my homework and I'm really sorry because in the amount of time I had, as I began researching you, I realized that it would probably take me a long time to sweep through all the amazing things that you've done. So my apologies if this is off a little bit. Okay. My first question for you though is because you have, you're such an icon in the universe of punk rock and it's one of these things that I feel a little embarrassed about because punk rock is clearly cool and it's something that cool people should like, but it occurs to me. I don't even understand what it is and I was wondering if you could tell me what is punk? What does that mean? Well the punk that I helped form, I was in the earliest iteration of it in Los Angeles, kind of sprung up along with several other versions. Punk rock sprung up kind of simultaneously in several locations around the world and I happen to be in Los Angeles among the group of, I think there were 25 of us in 1977, basement dwelling children, somebody called us. It was composed of a bunch of kids who came together to hear music that nobody wanted to hear played by people who had no experience playing any kind of music whatsoever. And in the earliest iteration of punk rock there was an Adams family sensibility about it. Edic under toe, a gallows humor, mordant humor that was pervasive throughout. We dressed in black. Our songs were about scary things. They were short and they were brutal and a lot of what informed us was a political worldview even here in Los Angeles. It was in 1977, I believe there were several world crises going on. There was an energy crisis, an energy crisis going on. It was the beginning of being conscious that there was an ecological crisis, don't you know? Right. 1974 I believe was the first Earth Day. I may be wrong on that, but it was within a few years proximity of the dawning of punk. I've always thought that, well, many of us, if not all of us, came from families that were disintegrated, dysfunctional, brutal, violent. A lot of people had left home. This is your experience. This is my experience. With your father, your stepfather. Who I was told was my father. You were raised in a lie. You were raised in a lie. I was raised in a total lie. My father slash stepfather was Pat, the Philadelphia Cheese Stake King. Yes. Wait. Yes. He invented the Philadelphia Cheese Stake. Whoa. Yeah. When I was a little kid, there was no other cheese steak. There was no other steak sandwich, and he was much older than my mother. Was he proud of it? Oh, yeah. He was the king. He was puffed up. His wedding ring was a crown. Holy shit. Yeah. Pat's is still there in Philadelphia. Okay. The restaurant he started, it's a multi-million dollar business. He started it during the Depression. He was much, much older than my mother. My mother was a teenager when he married her. My team was 40 years older. He was nearly 60. We thought his fourth or fifth wife, but I went back to Philadelphia in 2013 for the first time ever in my adult life and found out that my mother, in fact, was his eighth or ninth wife. Oh, my God. There were kids that were old enough to be my mother's grandparents that he had had. It was a house of lies. But it was just you. You didn't have any siblings? I have two younger half sisters who I was told were my sisters. Whoa. Yeah. It was a super feral situation. And he was physically abusive to you? Physically abusive to me and to my mother to a lesser degree, but in some weird 50s kind of grossness, that to her was love. She once said to me, your father loved me. He was very possessive of me. That's so fucked up. It is so fucked up. I remember she could not go to the grocery store when I was a child without saying exactly when she would be back. And if she was not back, there was hell to pay. That game that people play is so weird. On one side, if you believe that someone's possessiveness equals love, then you're going to try to amplify the possessiveness because you want more love. Yeah. And so you're going to maybe going to do things or seem certain ways. It's kind of check-ins. Like, do you love me? You haven't been jealous in a couple of days. Oh, he was jealous 24-7. Oh, God. Yeah. It was really intense. I mean, I remember one particular family dinner. You know, and we had big houses. There were people who worked for us. I was raised by a lady who worked for us. Thank God. You had a nanny. Well, she wasn't ever called a nanny, though. She was a beautiful, gracious, southern black woman who taught me to love art and books because I certainly didn't get that from my family, which thought it was a deficiency. But I remember a family dinner where my mother had been late coming home from the hairdresser or something, and my stepfather held a gun to her head in front of the three little girls and made her write out by hand a confession of affairs he'd imagined she had. Yeah. It was super abusive. How did this, how is this allowed to continue? How did your mom, did you ever talk to your mom, or did you ever? I dragged my mother to therapy with me once as an adult, and before I stopped talking to her completely, I didn't talk to her for the last 30 years of her life. She actually died when I was on the Ram Dass retreat in December. What? Yeah. How did you? Oh, my God. Yeah. How did this impact you? I had about 10 seconds of, are my knees weak? Am I going to cry? And then I thought, wait a minute, you mourned this relationship and you mourned that you never had a mother 30 years ago when you looked at her and said, this can't continue. Our relationship is destructive to me if you want to come to therapy with me. I am willing to work on this, but if not, I can't continue. Right. And she refused. Right. Wow. Yeah. You're strong. You have this real intense strength that I find a little intimidating, but also inspiring. Well, thank you. I think, I had to take care of myself from an early age. I had to survive my stepfather who was, I mean, I don't want to say a wolf because it's insulting to wolves, but I pretty much had to raise myself. And at a very early age, I kind of realized it was, I had a choice. I could become my mother or I could refuse to become my mother and I refused to become my mother. So I never, I didn't continue that cycle of abuse. I was not an abused spouse, nor was I an abusive spouse. I just like was like, this doesn't have, I don't know how, I mean, maybe it's like the epigenetic of being half ghetto Jew surviving, you know, the Nazis and where my grandparents are great grandparents surviving, whatever the Russians actually, not the Nazis, because they came over like fleeing the Russian. What were they called? Oh, shit. Oh my God. I like, I love the horse people. I know you're talking about, yeah, yeah, yeah, Bolsheviks, Bolsheviks, yes, yes, yes. So, you know, when your ancestors were fleeing or fighting whatever enemies, that chemistry that happens in the body during fight or flight creates a slight change in the genetic structure. It's called epigenetics. Yeah, sure. So I think I have some motherfucking strong epigenetic resilience genes on my side. Yeah. It sounds like it. I mean, this is, I can't, I'm really, it's a, it's, I don't want to spend too much time talking about it, but it's one of the sort of scientific approximations of reincarnation. Yes. That's a really amazing way of framing that. Yeah. It's cool. But it's so beautiful because, you know, I'm sure you, you know the study they did with those, the mice and cherry blossoms, and this is, I've talked about in the podcast, I'm sorry if this is a repeat guys, but synopsis, expose mice to the smell of cherry blossoms while giving them a shock. They have children, they have babies. And the children are adverse to cherry blossoms. They have a stress reaction. Yes. Yeah. Yes. Right. And then, and, and, and the sort of the, uh, how, how the data stored within the DNA. Within the body. The body remembers. Yeah. But whatever that is. Yeah. Must be, we just haven't quite figured out what that is, but also the implication is you could decode epigenetics if like this is a thing that our bodies are translating into something so specific as cherry blossoms or whatever they're discovering now, then this means theoretically you could decode someone's DNA and start not just understanding where they came from, but what your ancestors. You can know their story in full. Yeah. Yeah. Now that's pretty cool. That's pretty amazing. I know. And wherever that goes or whatever happens with that, who knows what it's just the fantasy is being able to take your DNA and put it in some super computer and realizing like, oh. Yeah. Wow. That explains everything. Yeah. Because half of my family has been attacked by bears or something. I don't know. You know? Yeah. But, um, I think it's deeper than that, but then that's just my own feeling. I think it's the, you know, the epigenetics are part of it for sure, but maybe something more. You know what? Maybe. Yeah. I mean, in my case, I think I just had really strong survival instincts. So I have to say, because of Mary, the woman who really raised me, her input encouraging me to read, like this, I had this idea that there was a wider world out there that was accessible to me. And I grew up in Palm Springs. It was a very small town at the time. Rock and roll was non-existent. I got hold of a cream magazine and it talked about like Andy Warhol and the factory. And I thought, oh my God, there is more than out here than this. Oh, yeah. And I want to be part of it. That, now that's a beautiful thing. That's like the call of the sea or something, but, and what happened to you is so amazing and so it's such crazy synchronicity, but there's something in the Hanuman Chalisa. There's something in the Bhagavad Gita and the Bhagavad Gita, the verse goes something like Arjuna is talking to Krishna, you know, the representation of, I don't know, the higher self, whatever you want to put it, and says, what happens if you stop practicing? What happens if you stop practicing? Will you drift like a driven cloud or something, you know? Well, you're, what happens if I just give up on yoga or meditation or whatever? And the answer is there is neither, there's never any loss or diminution on this path. And if you fall away from it, then I will give you birth in a conscious family, essentially. And for folks like us, sometimes I think, well, I don't know that you would say, certainly, I don't think anybody's going to say the Philadelphia Cheesecake King. Steak. Cheese Steak, forgive me. Cheesecake, it might have been a different story. I know, sweeter. The Cheesecake King, sweet. Yes. The Cheese Steak, forget it, but I don't think you're always going to say that this man that you're describing is an awakened being, in fact, quite the opposite. And yet, you had this wonderful mentor who began to introduce you to the thing that was at least partially responsible for helping you escape that miserable situation. And I always think of like, oh, yeah, there's like, you know, that copy of Be Here Now lying around that I kind of picked up, or the tapes my mom, my mom played, those little seeds. And so you were reading, you were focused, you knew this was wrong. And then you ended up sitting in front of a bar smoking a cigarette. And talking to Darby Crash about how all he needed was a good manager like me to help his band something, something, something, get gigs. They couldn't get gigs. Yeah. And he had asked me, because I said, well, you should change your name, but not change your name of your band. And then the club owners won't know that it's the germs and blah, blah, blah. And he said, why don't you manage us? And I said, okay. So then I did. And this, and this was, this seems like for you, this was like one of the big monumental updraft moments, right? Yes. Suddenly you're sucked into. Yes. Into doing it. But not just that. You were responsible for the updraft in some ways. You were managing the germs. Yes. And there are things that I did, decisions I made that are the reason my students at Cal Arts, who are 18 years old in 2019, know who I am and what I did and who the germs were and what they did. The record that I orchestrated is still issued every year. There are not many punk rock records from the Stone Age that are still being issued every year without fail. So yeah. This must be weird though. It feels like it's kind of paradoxical. It's like you're teaching screenwriting. You have students, you're like, I remember one of my professors saying, just drop out. Because this isn't the way to do it. You guys need to leave. This is, your life is going by too fast to be here. What are you doing here? Go to India. He would just say, go to India. What did he teach? Introduction to Southeast Asia. And his whole thing was just drop out of school and go to India and then figure it out from there. And I remember he, I'll never forget it, you know, this is such a great teacher. I didn't listen to him. I stayed in school. But I can remember like, but he meant it. He wasn't bullshitting. He meant it. He was like, just get out of here. And he didn't mean it. And I desponded it. This isn't it. Here. This is school. Go do something else. But he said, you know, when you're accelerating down the highway and you're looking at telephone poles and they start going by faster and faster and faster, that's what's going to happen to your years. And it's true. Yeah. And just know that. And then just go, go to India. And I remember that was like, what, who would say such a thing? A professor of Southeast Asian matters. Yes, that's right. That's right. But, you know, my experience was I went to college and it was great. I got a degree in psychology, took a bunch of acid, had lots of fun, met some great friends, but then came here and didn't become a psychologist. I put my hand on the comedy store, on the wall of the comedy store and I thought, oh, I should work there. That'd be a cool place to work. Yeah. I ended up working for Mitzi, becoming the talent coordinator and none of it had anything to do with school. It had to do with just weird blundering and raw, whatever, and some kind of look. And this seems like what happened to you. Yeah. You know? And isn't this kind of a recurring phenomena in the life of many, many artists is that there wasn't a way to prepare for it. It just happened. Well, it just happened. I mean, during punk rock, I went to UCLA. I graduated from UCLA with a C-minus average, which I didn't know until I went back to grad school about seven years ago. Yeah. I mean, I got a C-minus in Native American history, which is one of my favorite subjects. How did that happen? But, yeah, I ended up writing a bunch of stories. I managed the germs, Darby killed himself, which was a really, I married Gary Panter. Darby killed himself in 1980 after I'd stopped managing the band, and that sort of knocked me off my trolley for a while. How long it had been since you'd seen him? He came to my house the week before. He showed up the week before, and it just seemed like business as usual. He was on his rounds, kind of, and he didn't seem depressed. But there's a lot that I didn't know about his personal life. I had no idea that he was gay. I had no idea that he was a heroin addict. That wasn't our relationship. I didn't do heroin. I assumed that the girls he hung around with were girlfriends. I didn't question that. I've never been nosy that way. So it was shocking to me that it happened, and I kind of didn't leave my house for about a year after that. Did you feel responsible in some way? I didn't. I would say that I did not feel responsible for that at all. Darby was very much his own person, and I've always had a sense that, I mean, maybe it's because I'm depressive myself, that there's rarely anything anyone can say to you when you are in the depths of depression that really makes a dent. It's a really profoundly dark state. As a psychologist now and a therapist, I know there are things that you can do to offset depression, physical exercise, but the gulf between that first step and laying in bed all day is huge. It's the Grand Canyon. This is, to me, people, when they think about death, they have a fantasy about how death goes down, and the fantasy is you keep your mind up until the moment you breathe your last breath, and this is just not the case. Most people, when they're dying, they're so sick, and they lose their mind somewhere along the way, and there isn't any more chance to say, you're sorry, or say, I love you, or do all that shit you see in the movies because you're gone. You're sliding through time, you're having many strokes. Who knows, right? So, similarly with depression, it's like at some point, the gloomy day that you've been having for the last six months gets a little darker, and then somewhere along there, you're not thinking clearly anymore. Well, for me, when I've, the few times I've experienced the most profound depressions, and I'm a Russian extraction, my people are a very depressed people, it is, it becomes a physical pain, right? It becomes a physical pain that you can't say, oh, my knee hurts, but it's this pervasive, deep, unshakable physical pain, and at a certain point, if it keeps going, you think, I will do anything to make this stop. Your vision doesn't go beyond making the pain stop to like, well, if I do that, I'm not going to be here. Someone said something to me once that did make a definite impression, and I have tried to remember it during my dark moments, which is remember depression is finite. It's not infinite. Right. The unsaid thing is death is infinite, but it's hard when you're suffering that kind of pain to remember that this pain you're feeling has another end to it. You will come out of this if you kill yourself, you won't. Oh, that's right. Yeah. But it's, I mean, my experience with it has just been I'm all gummed up, and it's like, I don't care anymore about your fucking tweet. I don't care. Oh, really call someone? Yeah. Okay. Maybe, I don't know, because you're laying there thinking like, what is it like when you hit the concrete? Is it like, maybe it's like a lake. I mean, maybe you don't really feel it. Maybe it's more like jumping into some lake and you just go to sleep forever. Maybe it's like that. Also, you probably stink. You haven't been taking showers. It's like so wretched. So this is why, you know, for me, I have some safeguards, you know, if I start noticing my bed is being, is unmade in the morning. If I start noticing there's a mess happening. If I start noticing like there's signs that I feel deeply superstitious of now because it's like, oh shit, oh shit, I know where this goes. So but that being said, since, you know, we recently lost Brody Stevens and he was a friend of mine and a friend of a few of ours. Lots of us are feeling guilt because there's this sense of like, damn it. He was so open about his mental illness. He was so open about his medications. He was periscoping about how much pain he was in, you know, and so there's this sense that a lot of people have right now of like, damn it. Well, this is the sort of unknowable thing about this. You know, I read this thing this morning that was, you know, served to remind me and it's kind of like a version of what Ramda said, we're all just walking each other home, right? That yes, that being that is one thing, but, you know, when you hear from someone over and over again, I'm in pain, I have this mental illness, it's their compassion fatigue is a thing. You think, oh, that's their deal. He'll be okay. He's been okay in the past. It's hard. It's hard to know. Compassion fatigue. Yeah. Wow. And you do feel like, yes, I know what you mean. Am I being like, this is, I just, I think it's just better to just imagine there's nothing we could have done because what's the point beating yourself up about? There is nothing. If the instinct to self-extinct is so strong that it's something one acts on really short of restraining someone physically what can be done, right? Because on the other hand, if that's competing with the drive to live, which is the strongest instinct we have, right? Can you imagine like what a tidal wave of darkness that other thing is? And we're just people. We may say the right thing. We may not say the right thing. It's really hard when my partner was hit and killed by a car a little over a year ago. It was horrible. And I noticed that there were some people who would reach out and were very self-conscious about what they were saying and they would apologize for it. And in the end, my takeaway was, it doesn't matter what anybody says. What matters is the open heart behind it and you can feel as the recipient of these sentiments, I could feel the open heart behind the clumsy things, the dumb things, the, oh God, did I really say that thing? And I never made those judgments on people like, oh my God, I can't believe so and so said that completely inappropriate thing. It was like, oh my God, this person is really trying to express this thing that is so hard to express. So oftentimes people don't speak up when someone's suffering. Right. Out of fear? Out of fear. Out of fear of being intrusive. Or even probably less noble, out of fear of being rejected. Rejected saying the wrong thing, saying a dumb thing. But again, if the urge to self-annihilation is so strong that somebody actually acts on it, can you imagine what a powerful anti-instinct is at work there since the will to live is so strong? I mean, I think about this a lot. Punk rock was a very high mortality subculture. A lot of my compatriots and fellow travelers died young. Many have suicide, some slow suicide of drinking themselves to death or heroin addiction. Others came up with a lot of really bad habit-related cancers. And I'm not judging when I say, but liver cancer from hepatitis C, from shooting drugs and stuff like that. So at a certain point, you kind of, after seeing this and thinking about it, kind of realized that there's only so much you can do for people. That's right. Yeah, I know. I know. I mean, I just don't know sometimes in my dark moments. You know, I think one way that I feel connected to you is that we both have had loss in our life. And I don't want to get into a loss competition because I think that's ridiculous. But I think- Loss is relative. That's right. But still, the specifics that you've shared with me about what happened are so mind-blowing and just it's so sudden, you know, when my parents passed, there was at least some time and there was a, you know, but still, at some point, there seems to be two universes happening. There's the universe of people who have yet to experience this reality, which is that it's just what you hear over and over again, but you kind of like, who gives a shit about that? I don't have time to think about that dark shit. I'm just going to go to work and do my thing. I'm doing my thing right now. I used to think I'd live forever. I used to think I, you know, really, there could be a possibility. Maybe it's in my genes or they have a medicine that's going to make me live forever. I will not be one of those who gets sick. Yeah. But then it all happens. And to me, sometimes I do feel a little bit like I have seen the backdrop of reality. And there is a feeling of like, like when sometimes when you and I talk, I feel a little bit like Gazelle being like, you know, lions keep eating us, right? You know, when you want to like, I want to be committed to this reality and this life. I don't want to disassociate or detach or sort of like. It's really hard because we don't know. We don't know. We do not know what happens after this. You know, and I've had, I am someone who's always thought that after this, there's nothing. There's just, you're gone, but there have been a lot of, there was a couple of weeks ago. I mean, there's been this, I have pages written of these synchronicities that have happened since Bill died. Bill answers to questions I've asked specific word for word. Five minutes after asking the question, going and randomly picking up one of the hundreds of notebooks Bill kept, opening it up. And there is literally the answer to my question. Not just like magic eight ball style, yes or no, but Jimmy Webb, highwaymen, Hawaiian version of somewhere over the rainbow. And this was the answer to a question that my filmmaker asked me when we were cutting the film of Bill's memorial, like, well, I have these songs, I really like them. Bill didn't even know them. Highwaymen would be great to start the film with and somewhere over the rainbow, great to end it with, but Bill didn't know those, so we're not going to do that. And then I walk into Bill's office after hanging up the phone, pick up this notebook and there are those two songs in his handwriting that I had no idea he knew, but, and there have been that kind of thing, so our house, the place that we love most in the desert, we have this little house up in this very secluded, beautiful area, there was a mud slide and I went into the house and there's like silt everywhere, there's Bill's dirty clothes hamper, which I had just written on Facebook two days before. I can't even bear, this is like a year after Bill has died. I can't even bear to empty this hamper and I go in and the hamper is like absorbed all of this mud, so I'm going to have to do something about it. I take a picture for insurance purposes. I post it on Facebook and someone says, look in the mud, it says I love you in it. I'll show you the picture. And sure enough, I look in the mud and it says I, L-O-V-E, and the letter U, like what the fucking fuck. Yeah, right. So stuff like that gives me complete pause to go like, oh, oh, oh, I think this is kind of the other weirdness of being born in the specific culture that we're born in is because for us, that kind of stuff is astounding, whereas I was just watching this documentary on the day of the dead. Once a year, you sit around your ancestors grave and eat dinner and they're there. It's like you're eating dinner with them. You sing to them. You sort of like, I don't want to say summon because it sounds weird, but you sort of, there's a song that you sing to bring them into the table and then you eat with them. And over, you know, in the West, you watch something like that and you're like, ah, primitive. It's not real. No, sir. No way. And yet, this is the other thing that happens when you start seeing the, I don't know, the backstage is because suddenly you have to start dealing with things that you can't talk about that much because people are either going to be like, well, like us, like, oh, yeah, I could tell you some story or they're going to be like, I know, I know, and I guess he's right there. Isn't he? Yeah. Yeah. And they're like poor thing. Yeah. Experiences because you know that can't happen. Right. And so that's the other element to it is that suddenly you begin to see some, I don't know, hidden structures in the universe that you've heard about. Now this is great, but it's still not my mom and it's still not my dad and it's still not my friends. Yeah. And so still in all, I don't feel bitter about it. It's just not even a bitterness. It's more of like a, wow, this is just a dream. Yeah. It's fading away. Yeah. Now, how do you, in the midst of this, it's only been a year. Yeah. How are you doing, keeping up the life that you have in the marketplace, being a psychologist, being a teacher? Let me say a little bit about the teaching, because we kind of, I forgot and got off on a tangent. You asked me about how I came to teach, sort of. You asked me. Well, the question was, the question was with your students, I mean, it's just sort of like, I get it though. I mean, writing screenplays. I'm not, it's like, you don't tell people the way you write screenplays is sit in front of a barn, smoke cigarettes, that's certainly not going to help when you're writing screenplay. Yeah. And the reason that I don't say like your Southeast Asian professor, drop out of school and go do something else. After graduation, I tell them, go live some life somewhere. Join AmeriCorps, do something where you're out in the world, or you want anything to write about. I realized a few years, okay, so I wrote a couple of books that I put out myself and then somebody else put out one of them. And I got this sort of underground reputation. I was reading from my books all over the place. I was on fresh air. I had my 15 minutes of NPR fame. And I was invited to teach at Cal Arts temporarily because someone had had a nervous breakdown and they needed to fill in and the Dean had heard me on fresh air two days before. I was in information back when you could call the operator and get phone numbers. Wow. Yeah. And I said, yeah, I would like to teach and I threw up before the first class and I continued to throw up before the first class out of every semester for like four or five years and then it stopped. I was like, oh no, I'm kind of good at this. That is shocking. It is really shocking. So you are feeling like nerves. Oh, totally scared. Like who am I to do this? I'd never taught. I had a complete fear of speaking in front of crowds. I was 38 when I started doing this. I was still coming off of the like I have nothing worthwhile to say. And I realized over the years that what when you're 18 to 35, my students started out being 18 to what 22 is undergraduate and then I started also teaching graduate students. People that age are struggling to make sense of who they are in the world and every story they tell has to do with who they are. And the minute I realized that, I was like the person who was helping.

So my job I realized was to be a midwife for them in a manner of speaking. It wasn't to impose my aesthetic on them. It wasn't to impose, except very sort of cursorily, this screenplay format on things. But my job is to help them articulate these stories that they want to tell and at this point in their life, they're their stories because that's their experience. So I became everybody's favorite teacher and that led me into psychology. In 2013, I decided to go back to school to get a master's and then I got a doctorate and I've been practicing for a few years. You know, and it's really interesting. I also realized, like most people do, that I partially went back to school to figure myself out. I'd been in therapy for a number of years successfully with a really good therapist, but at a certain point, it's sort of then the burden is on you to move further and push further through it and you need to go behind that curtain we were talking about to figure things out. My takeaway has been, especially after the doctorate, which ended up going down the road of brain science oddly enough. I've never been scientific, but that's where it led me, is that our brain chemistry leads us to do a lot of things. Isn't that simultaneously comforting and terrifying? Yes. Yes. God, it's like, you know, this is the, when you just realize, man, we have got like a soggy hard drive in our head and these stories you hear in abnormal psychology of people who get banged up and their whole personality changes permanently. All of Dr. Saxe's work is about that. Dr. Oliver Saxe's work is about the weird glitchy shit that can happen with your brain. For me, I realized that as a little kid living in a volatile environment, my sense of self didn't form in a normal way. Because your brain forms two-thirds of your frontal lobe forms from the ages of birth to three. If things are weird in your environment, that dictates how your brain grows. Oh, man. I know, right? This is scary. Yes, it's really. New baby in the house. New baby in the house. I'm thinking this because I, you know, I'm thinking like this is like the most advanced, like, you know, by the way, I'm not going to try it. I'm not materially turning my son and just, and then what I'm about to say sounds like I think my child is like electronics, which I don't, but, you know, knowing like more neurons in the brain than any other time in his life, every single thing, he's vacuuming up every single moment. And it's terrifying. And then also you can't get too caught up in that. You know, Ramnath talks about this saying you really aren't going to be able to not impact them in some way or another. It's just, but you could try, right? Well, we know what not to do, which I don't know, you're a lot younger than me, but my parents' generation didn't give a shit. You know, there was no inward like, how do what I, how does what I do form my child's worldview? There was none of that. We were chattel. We were extensions of, we were owned by our parents. You were just something that you, a thing that was like running around, that was in trouble. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you were living in a, um, a war. Yeah. A war zone for sure. And screaming was normal. Yeah. And, you know, and you, I remember getting off on it kind of like, you know, when the screaming is happening and get away with shit and then like you learn, anyway, I don't remember a lot of that when I was, cause I was too young, but, um, regardless, the human brain is, uh, really, um, I think a lot, there's a lot more going on there. And we're just figuring it out now because are you excited about the psychedelic therapy that's happening right now? I'm really excited. And I am, you had asked me about, um, Bill's death and how I was coping with that. And all the answer is, I thought I was coping with it. Okay. Um, I was in shock because of the way it happened. He was hit by a car. I'd seen him 40 minutes earlier. The last thing I said to him was, please be careful crossing the street. It was, I remember being jazzed because I found a great parking place at work that morning at the clinic. I went to the free clinic where I was seeing clients and I got a call from a social worker and I thought it was about a case that I'd had and, um, she said, no, are you related? And I knew, I knew that he was dead and my world changed that minute. Um, and I was in shock for a number of months and I was sort of people kept saying, I can, you're dealing with this so wonderfully. And I had a lot of, I had two full-time jobs, the clinic and teaching. And I went back to teaching immediately, um, well immediately was three weeks because Bill was killed in the eve of winter break and I went back to work. And thank God I did because my students were just fantastic. I mean, um, I walked into three separate classrooms and there were flowers and letters from them. And when I would stop to cry, they just wouldn't freak out. They would just like kind of, I put my head down on that, um, table and somebody often is not would touch my shoulder and when I was finished crying and continue. So that was really helpful, but, and then Bill had two businesses that I had to keep running because there were workers who were depending on their paychecks. So I had to, that survival me, the, the all about business me kind of really took over and pushed the grief way down. And I've been depressed as a result. I've been putting one foot in front of the other, but I've been really, really depressed and realized that there are days when I don't leave the house unless I have to teach. And so I looked around and my own personal history with SSRIs has not been good. So I knew that I couldn't do that as, as some kind of, and I've been in therapy, of course, like twice a week since then. And my area of study was for the doctorate was SSRIs versus psychedelics for the treatment of PTSD anxiety and, um, oh my God, I'm totally drawing a blank PTSD anxiety and depression. So one of the things that I didn't do a close examination of, but have heard a lot about was ketamine therapy. And ketamine is an anesthetic, but it's also a short acting psychedelic and there's a, a protocol that where an MD is present along with a therapist and you as the subject are injected intramuscularly with the ketamine and it's an hour, 45 minutes to an hour long session. And this particular protocol is twice a week for four weeks. Wow. And that's what I'm doing. I had my first treatment on Friday and it was profound. I don't know if it was like good, profound or bad. All I know is that the grief that I had put away came roaring out and it was as if Bill had just, I had just gotten the news. Oh my God. When I did it, what happened to me was I was back at the doctor's office getting my cancer diagnosis, photographic memory. Just like I was that, like in a virtual reality, I was there. That was, that's to me, like to me, psychedelic therapy. This is why it's so potent, but also something, and I know you know this, but for people listening, this is done with a doctor and a psychologist in the room, in the room, the entire time on you. It's really important, ketamine especially was an animal tranquilizer. And I think a friend of mine who worked for a vet said it's also used to put animals down. So you really have to be careful about how you use this and you should not do it yourself. This is not the kind of thing that, you know, you go out to the desert and quote unquote shaman helps you with. So this, it seems, this is a similarity we have in the sense that what it did is that, and I've noticed this with other psychedelics is like whatever the thing is you've been putting energy into ignoring, it seems to somehow or another show that to you. And this is the other aspect to what I think is interesting and maybe worth talking about a little bit is when people describe these experiences, they say it showed me. It's like it's a thing or something. It's like there's a personality behind it or some kind of, I don't know, spirit within it. Yeah. So here you are back at the grief again this, and then what? Well, I have, after we finish here, I have another appointment my second trip. Wow. Yeah. And I was kind of scared to do it. You know, there are various different accounts of what happens, and none of those really seemed to bear much resemblance to what I saw. I never felt out of control or endangered, but I was deeply connected to the profound sadness and regret I have about Bill's death. Well, I mean, this is the, I love what Chogyeom Trumpar Rinpoche says about ignorance, because you know, ignorance is an insult. If you call someone ignorant, it's like an, so it's an easy thing to get confused about the word. But ignoring, you know, is not an insult, and we all kind of understand ignoring. It's hard. Like if there's a dog barking next to your house and you want to fall asleep, it's difficult to sleep. If a baby's crying, ignoring requires energy. And so that's how Chogyeom Trumpar Rinpoche described ignorance as the active quality of ignoring. It's like you're having to push this thing away and the energy drain required to compartmentalize your existence and to actually, I mean, to try to like build a wall between you and this event that just happened, which is a cataclysm. Yeah. And in my life, certainly. Yeah. Yeah. It's, that's a really good point. It's funny. He was, Trumpka was such an interesting, complicated person. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. He was. And, and, and certainly, you know, that aspect of him is, is something that has perplexed me sometimes until, but I focus on, right, mostly, uh, and just because of my personality, there's something about his, his madness that I really like to some degree, not all of it. But yeah, this, uh, man, how are you not going to get depressed if you have to, if you're spending God knows how much cognitive energy we're already filtering out stuff that just we have to filter out. The cognitive load of having to filter out this event that you experienced is, I mean, how much processing power does a human brain have? Not enough. I mean, these events are so much bigger than us or our understanding of them. That's part of what's also frustrating about it. We only had three years together. We were crazy happy with each other. We'd found each other late in life. We were very aware of that. And then boom, one day it was all gone. I remember the night before I was at a work party because it was the night before winter break at Cal Arts and I said, does someone said, well, you look really happy these days. And I said, yeah, I have the most beautiful life. And then boom, 10 hours later, it was gone. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So the other thing that came up during the ketamine that I kept repeating apparently was I need to make meaning of this. I need to make this count for something. I don't know what that means. I mean, that's what this trip is about. That's what sitting with Ram Dass is about is trying to A, be okay with it, trying to make meaning of it. And also trying to prepare for my own death, which is closer than ever. Every minute is a minute closer to that. I mean, sometimes I think it's already happened. Well, there is that school of thought. Already broken. There's a saying, I can't remember how it goes, which is it's already broken. But this idea, the second part that came to you, this is alchemy, of course. And it's like, here is this, as of right now in your life, a thing that is not processed yet. No. It's something that seems in fact impossible to process. And then I don't know, I don't, the problem, I don't, I don't know. I wish, I want to, like, if there's a part of me that wants to be like, oh, you'll find. So that's our, as humans, that's walking each other home. That's our sort of impulse to fix, to reassure. But I don't know, the dark version would say there is no reassurance. And I think we have to be okay with that. That's the, these days, more where I land is just, because it's like, this thing we do, which is like every single rotten fucking thing that happens to us, we have to find some, like, you know, thing that, oh, and from this, I learned this. This is, and from this, it was one of my teachers, oh, it's a teaching experience. And all of that is a weird form of commodification. It's like, not only did this shitty fucking thing happen to me, and by the way, I'm sorry, if this seems like I'm finger, I'm thinking of my own. We all only, we all think of our own. But, you know, I've thought about this before, and I was thinking about this during the AIDS crisis, that everybody kind of thought, well, it'll be okay, because in the third act, everything is okay. And I hold for this, you know, have to learn a lesson thing. I hold the Hayes Code responsible. Do you know what the Hayes Code was? It was the 1930s, the movie industry was told to police itself. And part of the Hayes Code was, your characters have to learn from what's happened to them. Okay. Yeah. Okay, okay, okay, okay. They have to learn a lesson. But, you know, but then, having said that, the reality of it is, all of the horror that in my life that I've experienced has actually, in some way or another, really taught me something. And in some way or another, at the very least, when I'm sitting and talking to someone who's got a whole bone in their life, I feel like I can listen to them in a way I couldn't have before. And that's probably right. Not much, but it's something. Maybe more than you think. And sometimes, just that act of bearing witness to somebody else's pain, I was sent to Quaker School for the first six years of my schooling and the Quakers are really, that's their deal is, it's important to bear witness, whether it's to injustice or pain, that by bearing witness, you're doing a service to the person that you're bearing witness for. Yeah. You're carrying some of that for them by taking it in, right? And not revising their history in the moment. No. It's like that, but this is an impulse that happens where people are like, and you taught me this, and I love it, because anytime these things happen, they happen to us, and they will happen, I don't mean to say it like I'm fucking holding a sign, the end is not, but it's going to happen to all of you listening. And you know, people will come to you, and they will come to you with something that they have read on the, it feels like they read on the back of a cereal box, and there will be a sense where you want to say to them something really dark, and the fact that you taught me this compassion, like, okay, okay, they don't mean to, there's no intent here to hurt me. No. They're just trying to love, but bearing witness means, no, I see you now, and I can't fix it, and I'm not going to try to fix it. There's no fix here. I see you, and I see the pain you're in. Yeah. I see the pain you're in. That's, that's really important. And if, when you, someone is doing that with you, and that is the, because it's like, God damn it, this shame thing in our society where it's like, oh, if, like, there's something, I was thinking this this morning, it's okay for things to not be okay. Yeah. This is okay. Yeah. It's part of it. What are we expecting? That's the other thing. Why would you expect? Look at this world. Jesus Christ. Look at the catacombs, man. All those bones down there. And you look at all those bones and you're like that. Every single one of those skeletons or skulls, someone wept over every single one of those, someone wept. They were all somebody's baby. What? Yeah. And, and when this is like in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna's becomes the universal form and is showing Arjuna who he really was is, and he's like, Arjuna is describing like, I see all the great warriors marching into your fiery mouth, their skulls stuck in your teeth. And this is on one level. Mother fuck. This is life and we got to get to work and we have to wear it, put on the clothes, we, and our masks and all those things on another level. We're being consumed by an infinite, never ending vortex of matter that is completely ambivalent or oblivious to our personal wants, needs, desires and how we think things should be. Yeah. It's going to kill us. And so, I mean, and when I say that, I don't mean it from a depressed perspective, it's just how it is. How it is. I know, but then what do we do with that in this iteration of the dream? We're all just walking each other home, right? What did Bacowski said? It's how you walk through the fire, right? So in this eye blink of an existence, we're pitiful humans flailing about to do the best we possibly can in the most ill-equipped way imaginable. Yes, that, that's compassion. And it's sad and it's weirdly beautiful. It is the most beautiful thing. But the thing you just said is so freeing because it's like, who do you think you are? Who do you think you are? Like you're going to like suddenly just know how to do this dance. Like you're going to do all the moves, right? Like you're not going to freak out. Like you're not going to think about killing yourself. Like you're not going to contemplate from time to time. The, this whole thing is a big fucking scam. The hopelessness of it, the powerlessness of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Of course you are because if you're awake, if you're awake. Yeah. And a lot of people choose to not be awake and, and you can't hold judgment because it's so fierce and so terrible to contemplate the other. That thing that you think about, obviously I think about and many people we know think about, it's, it is a choice. It's a choice. And it's just a, and you know, the other thing is, it's like, what I've learned is like, I can't do the whole, like I'm going to come up with who I am planned for the rest of my life. Like, well, this'll be my thing. Cause it's a moment to moment situation. But what I have learned from my friend Brody and what I'm, I, I was, I'm learning is this whole hero thing, let's give it up. Like this idea, like we're going to be the personal, like hero in our, in our lives, where there's been so much loss or whatever in the, in the, in the try to fit into this weird role of being the person who like, in the, it's cause every dumb ass movie is like, in the midst of all the suffering, he rose, she rose and became a leader. This is the Hayes code. The Hayes code. Fuck it. Yeah. No, how about this? Uh, in the midst of all his suffering, he got super depressed and he started drinking too much and he cried sometimes in the midst of all the suffering. He suffered. Yeah. And that's, to me, that's like the, you know, if you really want to like be a hero, stop being a hero, like just fall into it and let, that's what Trump is, at least I think, as I understand it, I'm probably misunderstanding. Yeah, you probably not. I mean, experiencing the moment, it's be here now, be here. It all comes back to be here now. And we're all walking each other home. And we're all walking each other home. But sometimes no one's on the road. And I think it's important to realize that sometimes it's an empty road and it goes on for a long fucking time and it goes on longer than you would ever want it to times a lot longer than that. And the sky is a scary color green. Hell yeah. That. Yeah. And I think anytime I, like, so anytime I fall into that and I know the difference between being like, oh my God, it's a longer than you are. It's a long versus like, no, this, okay, I'm on the road by myself right now. Yeah. Okay, okay, we'll do it. We'll be on the road by myself. I'll do this now. Anytime I'm that feels something shifts a little bit. Yeah. Sometimes don't you think it's okay to say, I don't know. It's always okay to say that. I mean, because the alternative to that is sort of what bravado and bluster and it's okay. I've got this handled, which is my deal, right? Mine too. Yeah. Okay. Everybody follow me out the exit. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No. What a relief. Yeah. When you realize you don't have to actually, you don't have to tame the universe. Like you don't have to do the lion tamer act with the entire universe. In fact, you can just let the lion eat you. Yeah. Fuck it. Yeah. Go ahead. I give up. I don't, I'm sorry. I tried to tame you. Yeah. You're a lion. My ego told me I could tame you and look at you. You're five times my size and your teeth are as big as my fingers. Five are the size of the universe. Yeah. And then something happens right around there. And the problem is it's like suddenly, wait a minute. Now the lion is like rolled over and is letting you pet his stomach. Yeah. Something happens, but it's just before that can happen. There's this, look, I don't know. I just love it because like I love, I love we're walking each other home and it is true and I love that. But I also love sometimes things just suck. Yeah. No antidote right now. Just, this is it. Yeah. Oh, but as a therapist, sometimes the most profound thing I can do in session with a client who's suffering is acknowledge their suffering and how badly it sucks. How people, it's a rare thing to hear it. Yeah. And, and, and it's the most empowering thing. It's like giving someone back their suffering. It's like, here I'm going to take your suffering. I'm going to give it a nice haircut. I'm going to put a cool little outfit on it. I'm going to, it's going to like dance for you. And it's going to sing this ridiculous song about how in the end everything works out because of the Hayes code. The Hayes code. Yeah. It's something so wonderful about just like, well, yeah, that's right. Yeah. And then from there, suddenly you become part, I think of a network, a real network of, of people in the planet who are in various stages of climbing out of craters for like literally and figuratively and something in that becomes you, but you, you are there with them. And now you're like, okay, I might never meet you. But in this moment here, whatever it may be, I'm with you here. I feel, I don't know. Maybe there is no real connection. Maybe there's no my silly old connection, but I'm here and it sucks. And it's okay. That's where we're at. Yeah. And one foot in front of the other walking each other home. I think, you know, that some of the, the, the two, those two amazing things that Romdus has offered the two tools be here now, and we're all just walking each other home are kind of in a way, almost all the roadmap you need. Oh yeah. And I think that we've both been very lucky to be able to sit with that guy and feel that unconditional love ray he zaps you with. Yeah. And all, yeah. Yeah. And that's, and, and, and to know that that is a possibility in Israel and how like all the, like in, in the moment, you know, that there is a thing here. And it's like, for me, in the moment, sit, like the first step is wait, okay, instead of like me fantasizing about some future me or thinking about the way things were, like sitting just here in this and feeling, feeling. He was, my friend went to see him and said that he was talking to him. And Romdus was talking to him and saying, my cat, my cat is dying. I love my cat. My cat's dying in the other room right now. And I love my cat. And he got real sad. And then he's like, but, but wait, like here, here it is. Here it is again. This, this moment, this as it is this. Wow. Here it is. I'm here again now in that, but that for Romdus, at least in that moment, didn't mean ignoring the fact the cat was dying. Yeah. It meant being brokenhearted about it. Yeah. And that's what's when you're with him. That's what you're feeling is like he is fully brokenhearted. Yeah. And still radiating this just beautiful, it's real, real love. Yeah. Not like. And unconditional, non-judgmental. Yeah. That's what I felt when those big blue eyes were looking at me was just like, I'm loved and I'm not judged. Yeah. It's pretty super great. It's the, yeah. Well, I hope that, you know, at this other thing, I don't mean to keep going on, unless you have time, it is here, uh, or running over. Do you have a little, it's 255. I have, my appointment's not till six. The, um, because I think people build up an idea of like some kind of domesticated Jesus figure. And I, you know what I mean? Like domesticated Jesus, like Jesus loves you conditionally, according to your um, if you've been, you know, running the, the relay race in the right way or something like that. But if you imagine like a divinity, just as a form of mental exercise or a kind of like sort of embodiment of compassion and love that isn't domesticated. In other words, a Jesus that you're sitting across from, who's your best friend, not some kind of like daddy or some kind of like whatever thing. I don't, I'm sorry to bring up Jesus. It's just quite often an example used to embody love. That's a real brokenhearted thing. And I really like that a lot because the Jesus, whenever I imagine the Jesus, he's loving me based on like, you know, the way your best friends, like the way you're like the, it's not, it's like he's, he's vulnerable to, yeah. He's the suffering of the whole world. He's the thing that's like, I don't know that this is going to work out. Yeah. I don't know if this is going to work out. This really might not work out. Yeah. That two people together. Except being like, actually, this is probably not going to work out. This ship's sinking. Oh, yeah. Now that's love to me. That's the real deal. What do we do? What's your plan? Well, my, the lesson I've learned, my haze code lesson is that you can't plan. Right. That, that invisible hand may come down and pluck you up at any moment. There might be an 80 year old woman driving a Mercedes who has your name on her forehead. You don't know. Yeah. You cannot know. Yeah. And, you know, that's the thing. Do you know about terror management theory? No. Okay. Terror management theory is it really? It really extremes psychological theory. We're all going to die. And as human beings, we are doing everything in our power to ignore that fact. That's the terror management portion of it. So, you know, when you become conscious that you're engaging in terror management, what do you do? How can you, if this giant underground river of anxiety is 10 feet under your feet, what do you do? Had, how do you make sure that it's not all about terror management? Yeah. And I think this is what all of the Eastern be here now because part of being here now is being conscious of that subtext of horror. Yeah. It's in, and that's a, uh, being conscious in the sense of it's like, no, really con, I mean, it's like, we're talking about really, really, really. Cause it's, there's a real renovate. Like it's like this, it's like, okay, what we have to do here is start knocking out walls in this house that we've built. And we built some pretty great walls, spent a lot of time building the walls. Armoring, as it's called. So you have to start knocking the walls down. Now it seems like that you, if you knock the walls down, you're going to, you are going to die as this is that, you know, this is the, when you realize that your entire identity is actually just a callous that is built up around something like you've, I didn't manage the terror. Yeah. It's then now we have death, like, cause if that's the case, like if your whole identity is made up of managing terror, that's your, that's who you are. Yeah. And then, yeah, you, there is a, a seeming existential threat. If you're going to start, um, knocking those walls down, let the, if your whole, if your whole life is being a lion tamer and now you're going to just let the lion eat you and it, but this is not, this is to me, what I've learned is this isn't, when you hear, I mean, I'm sent, when you say things like this, it sounds like, oh, but you know, and then it's okay. It's, it's, it's, it's not, it's in the sense that. And yet it has to be okay because we have no control over it one way or another. So we have to be okay with it. Not that it's okay. Yes. We have to come to a peace with the fact that this is, it is what it is. Yeah. Dick Cheney said. Well, it's kind of like it is not different from us. And that's the problem is that with this, this wall building and boundary building is essentially cut us off from our true identity, which in this sort of continuum, this is where one of the things Trump has always blown my mind is confusion is a condition of enlightenment. So you have to have confusion to have realization, but in fact, confusion isn't like separate from enlightenment. It's actually on the continuum of enlightenment. And well, yeah. So that, so that within the confusion is in fact woven within it is the realization simultaneously, because the moment you have this awareness of confusion, what's aware of the confusion? What is that? Yeah. Well, that's the other side, so to speak. That's what. Well, and, and the building of these walls walls us away from our, our mystical selves. Oh, yeah, I think so. You know, and, and our mystical selves are the ones that are inextricably tied in with nature and the natural world, the spiritual world. And those are such an important part of like real life. Yeah. Yeah. And, and yet we do this thing where we divorce ourselves from that. And, you know, I am looking forward to the day when I leave Los Angeles and go somewhere smaller, less man-built. I've spent many years out in the desert living in a very isolated place. Um, and I have to say I felt more in touch with quote unquote, the universe. Maybe that was a delusion. Why? I don't know. Because why are so many people doing this here? Yeah. Oh, well, I mean, terror management, terror management, greed. Yeah. Lots of different reasons people come to live in the cities. Oh, but greed is just a diversion from the terror of death. Well, I mean, this is a thing I just read. I don't mean to ruin everyone's trip here, but the happiness is just another flavor of suffering. That in, in, in that, you know, the, the, um, uh, the, uh, what came to mind as we were chatting just now is the story of Ramdas and the woman who called him on the acid freaking out, you know, that story, he gets, you know, I don't know how people had his number back then. I guess back then I, every hippie had his number on their fridge or something. Yeah, maybe they looked it up and she was tripping and freaking out. And so she called him and said, uh, you know, Ramdas, I've gone completely mad. I'm on LSD. I've lost my mind completely. And he said, okay, well, can you put the person on the line who knew to call me and could dial the phone and pick it up? Cause whoever you are, yeah, you've completely lost it, but she's fine. Well, yeah. And so it's like, cause this is the, this is, this is where the paradox is, is like, here is, well, my friend has a saying, your face is two in the tomato, so to speak. And it's like, here is the grief, here is the heart, here is the thing. Here is the moment that I'm like, man, your gyros are off. So the gyro is still off. The mental, whatever the habituation, the thing, whatever it is, the imbalance, the wobble, right? Yeah. But there is that other aspect of the self that is aware of the wobble. Yeah. That is holding the wobble in that however limited that field of awareness might be. Yeah. This is the paradox. Cause then you start realizing, wait, I'm addicted to the fucking wobble, man. I'm like, the moment I start realizing that, hold on, who's the part of me that knows that this isn't all I am. And then what, then now some weird spaciousness starts opening up. I don't know. Yeah. With one thing they said to me before the first ketamine shot was, you will always be able to remind yourself that you're in a safe place. But if you see a door, go through it. Yeah. Yeah. Look, I mean, my theories on ketamine go way beyond any kind of neurological anything. I don't know what it is. Uh-huh. I'm wetting your thoughts. I'm curious. Well, I don't want to in any way flavor your experience or, or like, I don't know, putting plant any kind of like thing inside of your mind about what, what it may be, you know what I mean? I would, I don't know. I don't want to spoil it or put my own trip on it, which could, I don't know that that's possible, really. You know, suggestion. I mean, there's always going to be a part of me that got, I'm not bragging either. It's just a bachelor's degree. There's always going to be a part of me that got that degree in psychology and there's always going to be a part of me that's like, yeah, it's probably not that. But, and I, and similarly, I don't want to, but, you know, John Lilly's work. The bill was really, really good friends with John Lilly. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and he, John Lilly was a devotee of ketamine. He took too much too often was my understanding. That's what they say. Yeah. Uh, and the, um, but he encountered alien beings. That's right. And I have encountered alien beings and I've, um, certainly have experienced things that are, um, remarkable and completely unexpected and completely outside of my, um, paradigm or whatever. Yeah. And, uh, and I don't, I wouldn't, I don't know what it is, but I know that whatever it is, it's way different than any other psychedelic I've ever done. Wow. And, um, that experience has been monumentally transformative for me in the positive. And it, uh, Well, that's reassuring to me because I still, you know, I had one session. It was pretty profoundly what the fuck. And I look forward to the next seven. Well, I mean, yeah, I, I look, I would be looking forward to it too, but I had to, but I wouldn't have initially, when I walked away from the session that I had, there wasn't a feeling of like, whoa, I want to do that again. It was just more of like, I just died. I was just annihilated. I was just destroyed and, uh, I'm been afraid of death. I've been doing terror management. I didn't have the name for it back then, but that is exactly what it showed me was you're confusing your, your, your fear of death is actually your love of life. Yeah. And your love of life, love of life, love is life. And you think you're going to die? Yeah. It doesn't, it wasn't showing me all this like, oh, you're, you're not going to, it doesn't work like that. Yeah. But it doesn't work the way you thought it does either. It's just a very, you know, our personalities are, I love what Ram Dass says, uh, uh, dying is completely safe. It's like taking off a shoe that's too tight. Yeah. Yeah. I think one of the things I remember saying over and over again during that ketamine session was love is the only thing that matters. Nothing else matters. Love is the only thing that matters. Yeah. That. Yeah. And that's, you know, you're, you're saying that and maybe there's a part of your consciousness that hasn't fully absorbed that, but there's something. Sure. But it's like when my friend died recently, I was talking to my wife and saying, you know, I'm fine. It's sad. It's sad. And then we're just sitting eating. We're not to eat. And I just started weeping out of the blue because my body knew. Yeah. But my mind hadn't quite grasped it. Now that doesn't just work with grief. That thing that you're saying, which is just a distillation of the, what would you call it, the perennial wisdom, the thing that you hear over and God is love, the very, the very eight variants of it. You can write it in a sentence. It's the equals MC squared of metaphysics, essentially. And, uh, but the fact that it's coming out of you is very encouraging. And whatever came out of me during this were things that were profoundly being realized in my body. That's why they were surfacing through my, why I was giving voice to them. That's in you. Yeah. Is you. Yeah. Yeah. But whoa, whoa. But then, I mean, I don't, I, wow, the things I've seen in there. Hmm. Pretty, pretty wild, pretty wild. And, and, you know, one, I won't keep going on and on about it. But I did have, I've had many, many experiences in there. One of them was the real alien contact I had. Well, and, and that was the thing that, um, Dr. Lilly apparently spoke about a lot. Yeah. Yeah. This was a being that, but it was another, like it's, you know, this seems to be like some kind of multiverse sort of thing. I don't, like it's an alternate dimension or whatever it is. It was some form of sentience. It was completely in a, it's very difficult for me to describe it other than it was like a beautiful plasma like warping place with some kind of grid and the being was playing in the grid. It was like playing in the spaciousness of it. And it was aware of me. And it was like, you know, I was human. Wow. And it was sort of conveying this, like, well, you guys really take it seriously. You're, it was almost the sense of like, why do you play that game? That, not the game of your wife or your ego, but literally like, why are you doing the human thing, man? That is heavy there. By the way, I didn't say man. It didn't talk like it was like a dead show, but it was the sense of like, that was what it was transmitting is like, whoa, that decision. That was the other thing is like, wow, that's a heavy decision to do that one. You know, whereas this thing was disembodied and just sort of some kind of energy that still had some self, but it was light and enjoying just whatever this was, which I didn't understand. It seemed like a game it was playing, but I don't know. And was your sense that we had the choice to be that? That was it's that. Well, it seemed to think it was that easy. Like whatever it was, it's sense was definitely playful and not like making fun of me just more along the lines of like, all right, that's your thing. I did. Yeah. It was that sense of like, okay. Well, that's totally something to look forward to. Well, it was, it's the other thing. Well, then, then there's the other ones too. But they're all beautiful. Like what I found eventually with it is like there is a there is even in the annihilatory places that it can take you, which is like cremation ash frozen ground, just becoming pure frozen ground or becoming some kind of like magmatic flow or some sort of like primordial just base matter with just, I don't know, just fractal some kind of, I don't know, some sort of absorption in a fractal state. It's very easy to react to that with fear because what do you do? How does this, this is terrifying. But the other aspect I've noticed with it, and this is again, anecdotal, but then other people who've experienced with me have described the same thing. There's like a viewfinder effect in the sense that these are like scenes that you're being shown and eventually the scene changes. And here's another one and another thing. And it's showing you these sort of, I don't know, landscapes or potentialities or variants of experience. And I have no idea what that is, but I do know that having shared the experience with people coming out of it, one of them would say, the field of flowers. It was so beautiful. Did you see the, and it's like, yes, I saw that. What is that? Some kind of, or another aspect of doing it communally is someone starts talking. Wow. And you don't know if you're the one talking or if they're talking. A voice emerges and you're not sure who said it. That sounds amazing. I don't know that I will have an opportunity to do this communally since it's in a therapeutic. Well, look, I don't mean to fly in the face of what I just said before about, we must do it with therapists. You know, I've been my old age. I feel like I'm just warning people all the time these days. But regardless, there is a difference between what you're doing and that other way of doing it, I think. And what you're doing is a more focused, healing way. I'm very excited to hear about your journey through this. And sure, I really can't wait to hear how it progresses. Yes. And I hope you'll you got to let me know. I will. I will, of course, happy to come back and talk about it. I feel like we just scratched the surface here. And I think there's a lot for us to talk about any time I get to be around you. I feel and I don't know if maybe this is like, I don't mean to say the sounds seem so negative, but it feels like one of the things you give people is this incredible solidity and strength and a sense of like, you know, every time I've hung out with you, I've had this feeling of like, OK, I think I can navigate my life a little bit more now. You bring something out of me that makes me feel like, OK, OK, I think I can do this. But then simultaneously, you, who's giving this to you? You know, I like how do I don't know. I could see how there could be some a sense of isolation in that. Well, there is, but it's. It's kind of always been a condition of, I mean, I'm a weirdo. And I'm not everybody's cup of Joe. And I've always, since it was really young, been aware of that. But the ones that hear the way I speak and what I'm saying really hear it. So, you know, and in the meantime, I have two great dogs. Bill, Bill spoke my language, which was what was so amazing and beautiful about that relationship. So now the haze code is telling me I have to learn from that, right? So, hmm, ignite the haze code. Yeah, exactly. We should do some haze code burning ritual or crucifixion. We should crucify the haze code. Exactly. Thank you so much. Sure. Thank you for asking.

And now everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell family, our podcast, the unforgettable Nora McKinnerney. Welcome to the DTFH. Thank you so much for being here. It is a pleasure to be here. I thought we could kick it off with me asking if you could describe to me the difference between clean pain and dirty pain. Oh, I have discovered after writing that first book, it's okay to laugh crying is cool too. Yeah, where I talk about that topic. That really the person who explained it to me had gotten it from, you know, probably a psychology book or something else that they had read, but I was just not in the space to take on any information, right? Right. And so I thought he was just explaining it to me and it was his own concept. And I have not read her book, but I think it's in one of the Brené Brown books that she goes into that much deeper than I ever could. But the way that this concept was explained to me was in truly the weeks after my husband Aaron died, and I was having lunch with an old coworker. And he could tell that we did not know each other that intimately that I was unwell, not in just the way that, you know, any person would be after they watch their husband die slowly in front of them, but that I was just so bogged down. And what had happened in those weeks after Aaron died was then I just started to question everything, like had I been a good wife, had I made the right medical decisions with and for him? And this coworker looked at me and said, you know, clean pain is the pain of what happened, right? It's the pain of losing Aaron in this example of losing a job, of losing, you know, your safety, your security, whatever that, that initial pain is, and dirty pain is when we sort of rub dirt in it, right? It's the pushing of the bruise, it's sort of twisting the kaleidoscope to see like, well, maybe, maybe this is my fault, you know, maybe I could just ruminate on this and make it worse somehow. And that interaction was, you know, impactful enough that I wrote about it in my first book, but is really, I think, something that I have struggled with as a naturally anxious person, as a person who wants really badly to be good and to be liked and a person who, you know, was not, has not developed or until her late 30s, really clinging on at 39 here, like any sense of self-compassion and the fact that, you know, we do the best we can with what we have in the moment and that it's okay to forgive yourself for very, very human mistakes. Right. Are you cultivating this self-compassion? It's gotten better, right? It's gotten better. I'm still working on it. I had an interaction with a therapist who I started seeing two years ago who in one of our first sessions said to me, it doesn't appear to me that you have a lot of self-compassion. And I was like, yeah, Doe, why would I? Like, have you met me? Come on. Like, you know, I'm a person who thought that engineering majors were learning how to drive trains until she was in her 20s. So, like, does that sound like a person who deserves compassion? Does it, Alan, the name of my therapist? Yeah, it's something that I have absolutely had to learn and had to cultivate and still am working on. Why is it so hard? Why? Why is of all the things being compassionate to yourself, something that is so difficult? I think about it all the time. In Buddhism, it's the first thing. It's before any of the other bullshit you, how are you going to be compassionate to other people? If you can't be compassionate to the thing you're closest to on the planet. Yeah. And so, but what's your theory on that? Why would it be so hard for us to be compassionate to ourselves or to love ourselves? I've dabbled, right? I've dabbled in Buddhism. I've got a whole, I've got every book Pema Children has ever read right over there. Just over my shoulder and every time I read a single word of hers or even better, listen to her on audio. The best. My favorite. I just finished, what was her book? Oh my God. The one on the low, the low Zhang saying anyway, I love her voice. I love her voice and I love that. You know, some of these recordings are from the 80s where she's just speaking to a group of people and she's speaking in complete paragraphs and they just turned it into an audio book because they could and it needed basically no editing. And every time I listened to her, I think, huh, where's that been all my life? Yes. Where has that been all my life? And I was raised Catholic and we in Christianity, we do learn to love other people. And I do think as an adult, I was told, oh, like God loves you too. As a kid, I don't know if that ever got to me. I don't know if that messaging ever really sunk in to me. It was more, you know, a lot of thinking about the things that I had done wrong and how could I ask forgiveness for them? And I remember this interaction with a religious leader when we were in middle school at, did you ever go to youth group? Were you were you raised? Yeah, I hear in there. Not I was raised Episcopalian and we did have youth groups. Yes, Episcopalian. So, you know, it's like similar to Catholicism, but like it's the Diet Coke to Coke, you know, exactly. It's so similar. It's Catholic light. It's lighter. We get divorced. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So much, so much freedom. And so youth group was a, I mean, it was just such an intoxicating environment, right? Because you're you're young, you're around other adolescents, which is invigorating. And maybe some of them even went to different schools. So they're like fresh and new and you don't really know each other. Yeah. And, you know, you're in a basement with a couple stinky plaid couches. Maybe they're going to order some dominoes later. Yeah. You don't know. There might be some Mountain Dew in the situation. Yeah. And I remember being told that to God, all sins are the same. So he's, he is looking down at a checkerboard. So it doesn't matter if you got kinged or not. All sins are the same to God. And I remember being like, man, oh man. So me being like, me and my brother, same as a murder. That's interesting. You know, just being like, oh, all the same. Wow. Wow. So, you know, being like, being rude to, being rude to a person, you know, disrespecting my parents, all the same in God's eyes. All he sees is your dirty little sins. And I don't know why that stuck with me. I actually just sort of remember that in the process of, you know, writing my next book. And I also, I don't want to blame it all on organized religion. I think when you're trying to figure out why you believe the things you believe or why you are the way you are, we are just this unknowable recipe. Who knows what got tapped in there at what point what got swirled into our beliefs and, and made us think and feel the way that we do. But I am also a person who was, you know, my, my drug of choice growing up was perfectionism and performance. And you also strike me as a kid who might have gotten pulled into like a gifted and talented program. Yeah. Until I, until I met my, my parents thought I was actually disabled and then they got me an IQ test and I did great. And then they immediately put me in like one of these advanced programs and I was immediately kicked out because I had behavior issues. Yeah. And I had ADHD this whole time and I had no idea. I just thought everybody's brain was like chaotic and like, Oh, no, no, no, I'm already on to the next thing. I've got this other idea and, and, and I have to blurt it out right now because I just have to, I have to, you have to know this thing. Yes. And, and, but I was, you know, sort of shunted into a gifted and talented program really, really got all of my love and validation from performing, right? From doing a good job at things. And so any sort of chip to that armor feels like a failure or feels, you know, like an aberration. Just if, if you are what you do and what you do is imperfect or, or wrong or hurts another person, well, then, you know, you're, you're a piece of crap right away.

Thank you, Trade Coffee. It is a fickle gas. It really is the sort of validation of other people. You know what I caught myself doing today? I caught myself looking at myself in the mirror with my shirt up and going, you stupid fat fuck. And that was like an autopilot. That's my autopilot. I caught myself because of this Buddhism stuff. I was like, that's holy shit. What are you doing insulting yourself to the mirror? And how often are you doing that? And you're not catching it. It's so deep. In some forms of Christianity, there is this, I remember like weirdly getting off watching the scarlet letter they showed in school when the guy's whipping his back and being like, whoa, it's kind of awesome. But that is kind of tied in to Christianity, right? You know, the self-legulation. And we can do it in so many ways now. We don't have to whip ourselves with a chain or a piece of leather. Like what we can do instead is we can look in the mirror and then compare ourselves and how we appear to how we think we should or how someone else does. Or I can get on my phone and immediately destroy any love I have for myself or my life by just a few scrawls. And then all of a sudden I'm like, actually, I want to burn my house down. I'm going to burn my house down. That's what I'm going to do, okay? Because I do not. My kitchen counters are not like that, and they are not clean. Well, this is bullshit. I'm sorry to cut you off. But this is, to me, I feel like in the future, they're going to look back and be like, well, that's illegal now. Like if you, you can't post your bullshit on social media unless it's real, you know, and like you can't do that because you're just hurting. It's a weird form of attacking the world by posing as though you're doing great. And then, you know, my wife and I, we've been through rough times where we have had to go to marriage counseling and we're much better. But, you know, sometimes a picture of us would show up on social media. We're so happy and people are like, dream couple. And I'm like, no, you don't quite understand the full picture. It's, you know, it's dead. And it's, I didn't mean to hurt anybody, but I think we need to figure out a way to balance it out somehow. So we're not tricking people into imagining that everything's great. And that's kind of what your show's about, right? Yeah. Yeah. And part of it too is tricking ourselves too. And the reason that the show is called Terrible Things for Asking is because I was such a good liar. I was such a good liar and most of us are Duncan. Like if I, no matter what happened before this phone call, if you would, you know, if I asked you at the beginning, like, how are you, what would you have said? Great. Great. You're great. You're great. You're great. You're great. And it doesn't really matter. I'm going to move this. I don't know why the glare in my glasses is driving me absolute bananas. And I can't hide myself view on this. And it's just, if you click, I figured out how to do that. If you click the, if you click on my square on the upper right hand corner, it will expand the frame. Perfect. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And you won't have to be tormented. Like it's so distracting. Yes. It's like, when I have to do a video call like this, I am immediately reminded of, have you ever FaceTimed like a toddler or a little kid? Yeah. They are just like, uh, like just, just, just drawn into this, their own image. Yes. Like narcissists, they're ready to fall into the screen. They love it. They love it. Like my, my kid used to like, basically like French to the phone to get to his own face. Just so excited to see himself. And that's what I become. I'm just, uh, but yeah, you would have said you were fine if I asked, you would have said you were fine, no matter what. And I mean, you know, there's a reason for that, right? We all belong in a, participate in a social contract where like, you know, the checkout person at Target does not get paid to hear the truth about your marriage. You know, like, when they ask, you are allowed to lie to them. You are allowed to be like, pretty good. Thanks for asking. So weird. Yeah, you're right. Yeah. But we do it to everyone. Like we do it to everyone. Um, or at least I did. And I did that after Aaron died and Aaron died after my dad died and my dad died five days after I had a miscarriage. And it was just, I wanted to be fine for other people. And I also wanted to be fine for myself because I didn't want anyone to pity me or feel bad for me or feel like they needed to take care of me. And I also thought if I can just fake it someday, I will have make it. And I will be, I will be the genius who figures out how not to actually be sad. That's what, that's what I will accomplish. You're right. Yeah. You know, wow. Yeah. Please continue. Yeah. Oh, I failed. I failed. And I would get messages from other widows or people who were going through hard things saying like, I wish I was doing better. I wish I was doing like, like you're doing like how I was doing off screen, right? Off Instagram, off of, you know, a blog or Facebook or whatever, out of outside of interactions at a brunch with friends was so, so poorly, so poorly. And I had gotten thousands of emails after Aaron died. We wrote his obituary and we revealed his identity as Spider-Man and that obituary went viral. And I got so many messages from people who were going through or had been through something really, really hard, who were just spilling their guts to me, a complete stranger on the internet, Duncan, a complete stranger, because the people around them had stopped asking or maybe never asked or maybe they just didn't feel like they could be honest with the people around them. And I started to feel like, what do I do with this? What do I do with this? And that is literally how the podcast started, was me wishing that I would have said to everybody at the funeral, I'm terrible, thanks for asking. Amazing. And that, the, the, I love it. I love what the title of one of your books is, The Hot Young Widows Club, having experienced my own loss in life. And I realized, oh, this is like a club or a secret society or something where I'm one of the people who no longer can live in a world where I'm immortal and the people around me are immortal and everything just keeps going and everything's fine. I now am one of the people who's, you know, weird glass bubble of delusion and fantasy that I built around me has just been smashed by a meteor. And we all get together and we talk because we know, holy fuck, it goes bad fast. It goes bad fast. Like you don't even, you can't, like within two days, you know, you're suddenly like in one phone call and you're at the hospital with your husband. The way that you're able to write about this for people who are in the club is just so cathartic and like it's so healing. But suddenly there you are. You know, when I got testicular cancer, I was suddenly in the hospital after like having done a brain scan because maybe it's in your brain and, but we don't know yet, but we're going to have to scan you'll hear in a few days. But I remember calling someone I was dating me like, are you cool dating someone with cancer? Because you're trying to make it make sense. But yeah, it's a secret society. It's a club and you have become a spokesperson. Someone who's like the jump on in the water is fine. Yeah, four easy payments of horrible pain and agony and moments of light. You too could join this club and the price is high. The price of admission is high. It is non-negotiable. Oh my God. And the benefits are very few. But everybody joins it eventually. What are the benefits? Yeah, I mean, occasionally, and you only get to play it, you know, once or twice, sometimes more, you can play that card, right? You can just be like kaboom, right? Like, you know, like, you know, Aaron never wanted to play the card. And at one point in time, we had this dog. She was so shaggy and she had gotten into like, you know, there'd been a thaw, like a winter, early winter thaw and she was out in the yard just getting just disgusting. And we didn't have a bathtub. We could not bathe this dog. I tried to get her in for like a grooming appointment. They didn't have anything. I was like, yeah, the thing is like, her dad has cancer. And we did get an appointment Duncan and Aaron was like, Oh, yeah, you said, I was like, we had to get this dog needed. You deserved it. We deserved it. You deserved it. If that's the only benefit we get, that's the benefit we get. Okay, I will cash that card in. I got to tell you, this is we're in such a backwards ass society that that is there should actually be fucking cards. I mean, we've got handicap parking, right? And I get that, obviously. But what about the other like all the people who are you're passing in the grocery store and maybe you're thinking yourself, what, that guy looks like he's in a bad fucking mood. You don't know what just happened to that person. And you have no idea why they're like that. And and so we need these cards in real life. We need these people deserve to get to the front of the line. Are you still there? You froze up. There we go. Well, exactly. See, that's what happens. Not just podcasts, but in actual reality. And yeah, you know, isn't that a bit isn't aside from the grief card or cancer card, isn't one of the benefits that you actually are living in the truth all of a sudden, not in some rosy way, but isn't that a benefit that you're living in the real world versus whatever you thought it was. And that you're living so presently, which is, you know, even when the present is terrible, it's still the best place to be. And I found this almost sort of, I never know if it's prescient. Is that the way to pronounce the word? You probably pronounce words that you don't know how to say, but I do it all the time. Okay. But yeah, so I found this piece of writing for some reason today. I was like, today is a day where, you know, we're speaking at 11 a.m. my time, which is like, such a, such a, what am I going to do something before 11 a.m. if I have to stop by 11 a.m. No, no, no, it just makes everything before then just not usable time for some reason for me, mentally. So I, I decided I had to clean out my Google drive. Why? It's, it's like unlimited search, but you know, get in there. And I found, I found this writing that I had done when I met Aaron and before, truly weeks before he had a seizure. And it's all about how the present moment is the best place to be, even if it's difficult as if some part of me knew that something was coming, which of course I didn't. Not in a million years could I have guessed that, you know, that, that I would be getting a phone call at work that Aaron had had a seizure and that we would be at the hospital and being told that he had a brain tumor and still like crossing our fingers that, you know, it's no big deal. People have brain tumors all the time. It could be anything. And then finding out he had brain cancer. And in this essay that I had written, I'm saying, you know, oh, I'm the most present that I've ever been. And I've been present for things that I never noticed before. And love can do that for you, right? Like joy can do that for you. And so can grief. So can sorrow. It's, it's most of our lives are truly forgettable. The bad, like what did you have for lunch two days ago? No idea. No idea. No, no, no, no, no. Like what were you doing at 1148 yesterday? No idea. I mean, I could probably dig it up, but it would take time. It would take time. You'd be like, huh, guess, yeah, maybe I was just sort of standing in the kitchen trying to debate if I should have another cup of coffee or move into lunch. I don't know. It's most of life is just so mundane. And that's wonderful. Like that is, it really is. It really is. But when you're in either of those sort of heightened states, either in, you know, at a very high, high or a low, low, you're so attuned to the ordinary that it feels extraordinary.

Yes. Well, I mean, when that's in your situation, you suddenly there was this clock, you know, when you're when you're someone you love as cancer, a clock just appears out of the out of the out of the horror, this fucking, and I'm reading your writing about I did the same thing with my mom. I would try to negotiate with it. I would imagine that I could talk to the cancer and be like, you know, do you really have to kill my mom? Like, isn't there a way to sort of, you know, back off just a little bit? It is my mom, you know, and I am special. And so is she, you know, as opposed to all the other people dying of cancer out there. All those other moms are like, my mom worth saving worth skipping. I would skip this one. As far as a host goes, you get a latch on to literally anyone else. Not this one, not this one. Not this one. This is a good mom. And did you you find yourself in this very strange, imaginary conversation with that clock? And it's just, I mean, I know you write about this, but when I think about what you went through, it's just not okay. Like, you know, like it's not okay. That's that series of events bundled into that time period. How does, how do you defend? And now I have a Chihuahua barking in the background. It's like, haven't I been through enough? Okay. We have so much in common. I too had a Chihuahua post my experience with these things, always barking and barking, always barking. It's good. And such a stereotype. I'm like, that's the mailman. That's the mailman. He's doing his job. He's bringing you medication because you have a, you know, a problem. Okay. And it's not just the barking. Yeah, which yeah, I can do anything. And yet, then the dog barks. I'm like, Now, while I'm recording, must you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The things that break me will be like, you know, and I just think about my, my grandfather surviving the depression, you know, somehow, you know, bringing nine kids through it, making sure they were fed and clothed. And then, you know, two generations later, I'm ready to cry because my right air pod won't connect. And I'm sure my soft little hands that have never, you know, fit a pipe in my life. And, and now I'm like, but it's so hard, Grandpa. But thank you for saying that, Duncan. I feel that way every time I meet anybody, anytime I hear anybody's story, I feel the exact same way. I'm like, Oh, no, no, no, no, no. And, and, and I have friends who, you know, have already, they've, their punch card should be filled. Yeah. It's, it's, it's absolutely indisputably unfair and not right that people have to go through any of this. We're talking like the day after Russia invades the Ukraine. And I'm thinking, seriously, this is how far we've come is basically no far. And people are still willing to inflict massive amounts of pain on one another, willingly in the name of what power and it's also bleeding. And you want to just take these world leaders that sit them down like they're bad little boys and say like someday you will be dead and none of this will matter. Right? Like you know, wow. And that day is tomorrow. And that day is tomorrow. Because that's why we have these guillotines in the room that we sat you down with little boys because we're going to cut your heads off and everything will get better right away because this is what we used to do to people like you. Sorry, that's a part of me. I don't, I don't want to decapitate the world leaders. We don't want to, but it's like, and I'm not trying to like minimize it. It's like you want to like, you want to shake people who don't get it and be like, don't you understand? Don't you understand? We are here for a moment for like an absolute blip. And it's just like, what are you, what are you doing any of this for? And by the way, I want to shake myself for all the times because obviously going through my Google drive, do you think I was reminded of just my best moments? No, the worst moments too are all archived. Like all the times that I was petty or jealous or just downright unhinged are also there. And I want to shake my former self and say, just shut up. Right. Who cares? Be here. You're fine. Right. Right. You're here. And, but tell me a little bit. I mean, your, your concept of what here is, what the, what the present moment really is. I know you have a, I think you have tattooed on your wrist. I do. Yeah. May I see it? I read about this. I think this is like the first, this is the first tattoo I got that wasn't like horrible. Oh God. Okay. Oh, I can't see it through Riverside. It's too blurry, but oh, I see. Okay. Cool. And it's also like at a point in my arm, it's at a point in my arm. I hadn't owned a watch yet. So I, you know, I got it like right where a watch would hit. It's just, it doesn't really make sense. But also I think I was afraid my dad would be mad and he would have been. And I, and he couldn't know, he couldn't know that his 28 year old daughter got a tattoo underage. You know, I just, who would do such a thing? Who would get a tattoo? Do it. I always sort of misunderstood mindfulness as, you know, oh, something I just have to do for 10 minutes a day and I can set an app and, and, and they, and take it off and great. I did it. And what a discovery to find through Pema children. Oh no, I lost you again. And this, that's why the topic of today's episode is why podcasts should be recorded on cause that tapes nailed back and forth. I love that idea. For those of you out there, what's happening is we've got a little bit of a connectivity issue, but I think that's great because we're talking about impermanence and we're talking about the, you know, that the reality of, you know, not being able to control anything and control anything. And to get back to the question I asked, if you have, I'm sorry, it's a, I've tried to define it and it's hard for me, but how do you define the present moment? Oh, I mean, wherever my feet are. And that is hard for me because I really, really, really do love to sort of like tiptoe back into the past and play with things, see what I could have done or said differently. I love to sort of peek into the future and just decide if I could try on a new worry, just wear it in a little bit, break it in so that when and if that moment arrives, I'm prepared. I've already imagined it. And what I have realized from that first moment that Aaron was diagnosed, I did exactly that. I remember just going into my brain right to his funeral, right to the very worst case scenario. And I can tell you that that thought exercise prepared me not at all, not one bit, not one single bit for night and for the funeral, not for the three years that we would have together. And all it really did was take me out of one of the moments that we had together, which was the night we got engaged was the night he was diagnosed. And I spent, you know, it might have only been two minutes or five minutes, but I spent any amount of minutes just imagining a future that was completely out of my control. Yes. As if it was somehow helping. Right. Well, it's a dream. I mean, I would think that that maybe I could control the future by having like fantasies of a future where my mom wasn't going to die of cancer. Yeah, definitely didn't work. Yeah. And yeah, we have a lot of interesting parallels. My wife's name is Aaron. When I, at some point, I don't know why I decided to start volunteering at hospice and I wasn't ready really for what I was doing. I didn't even know it was hubris that got me in it more than anything. And, but I remember the first home visit I did, it was a couple and her husband had brain cancer that had, you know, sort of spread in all through his head and out of his head and he'd been setting things on fire accidentally, forgetting to turn the oven off and stuff. And I remember the rabbits and they had rabbits and she's crying, who will take care of the rabbits? And I'm standing there just in the midst of someone else's nightmare, completely not prepared. And then he comes out of the room and has the most beautiful smile and he goes, hi, how are you? And I'm like, I'm okay. How are you? And he's like, bad. Hard to say. You know, I remember they, the ambulance took him to the hospice and I remember the way he waved and seeing that present moment in him, he was glowing with the present moment, fully in the moment as wretched as it was, still emanating this field that, you know, I've seen in like people like Ram Dass and stuff, but also in dying people this thing that seems to challenge all this projections, people like me put on it like, this is wretched, a nightmare, horror, when they're like, this is my life. And, you know, and, and don't just see me as this part of it. You know, and it's so easy. Somebody just becomes the way they died. And like, was your mom cancer? No. If I asked you about your mom, would you say, not cancer? No. No. No, but it does, it does overshoot, you know, going through those, for me, it was four years for you, three years, three years of, of a shadow of some kind of shadow, at least that's my own personal experience, three years of being in the shadow of this imminent death. I don't know if I'll ever be better after that. I'm fine. You know what I mean? As in the sense of like, I'm not like, I don't think the world's an evil place or anything like that. But I don't know how you, how you just, you'll never, you don't, and you'll never be that version of yourself. And we're not meant to be, you know, we're not sort of these immutable figures who, you know, have these experiences, experiences just sort of glance off of them, right? We are not impervious, like we are meant to be transformed by things. And so no, you won't be the same Duncan, you'll be this version of Duncan, who did sit with his mom while she was sick and, and, and did stay present for those, you know, horrible moments. And I think about that often. I think about that, that often. That a person is, of course, more than the worst thing that happened to them or the way that they died. And also, you're not going to be unaffected by it. We watched when Aaron was sick, I'd never seen Dexter. And it had concluded by that time, I'm pretty sure. Like, it was, or there were at least five seasons. And I remember just being on the edge of my seat for the first season, he was like, there are more seasons, so he will make it through. It's not a spoiler. He's absolutely not going to die or get caught in the first three episodes. And I was like, Oh, I don't know though, how will he get out of this pickle? He's really doesn't know. And there's this season, I couldn't tell you where it is, where he describes, you know, his sociopathy or his, you know, his, his needing to be a murderer, that as a dark passenger, right. And I remember relating so much to that. I remember relating so much to prison shows like locked up. I remember relating to the Walking Dead, relating to anything where things are out of the protagonist's control. And there's just this sort of dark menacing presence. And still what do they want to live, right? In the face of a zombie apocalypse, where, you know, even your closest family members are turned into monsters who want to eat you alive. The characters in the Walking Dead still want to be here. They still want to be on this earth. And I watched so many things like that. Oh, my God, I'm just, you're blowing my mind because when my, that was like, I really got into the Walking Dead, the comics. Yes, yes, yes. And I never made the connection. Of course, it's like, yeah, because the, especially the comics are like, they're amazing. Yeah, I hate to be one of those people, but it's true. It's like, when people are like, I love this show, I'm like, well, have you, have you read the comics? We're the comics because it makes this show look like Mr. Rogers. Truly. Compared to the comics. Truly. Because no one that I'm aware of up until that point, and really, you know, you see a zombie movie, there's almost a kind of fun to shooting the zombies. And yeah, all my family's dead, whatever. But the Walking Dead was like, oh no, everyone's going to go crazy. People are going to be crushed by the collapse of the world as they knew it. It is, it's felt grief. Locked up, bro. Oh, God, it's so into locked up too. I don't watch it anymore. No, no, no, I can't do it. Yeah. Now I don't want to watch anything with even like a hint of suspense or darkness to it. We watched Yellow Jackets recently and I had to talk through the whole thing. I had to talk through the entire fricking thing and be like, oh, oh, oh, I had that sweater vest. Oh, um, you know. Right. Yeah, yeah. That was pretty, that Yellow Jackets is pretty fucked up. And yeah, I just that world that we used to live in. Is it a bad world? Is it, is, is that a silly world or something versus the world that we're in now subjectively? Obviously, we're all sharing the same world. But when I look back to before I had cancer and before my mom died and my dad died, I kind of see someone who was really a little like insensitive and sort of not the best, not what I would consider to be the best person. Yeah. And I don't think everyone in that world is like that. I do think some people need the bottom to fall out for them to realize, for them to realize and to become realized. And I was always a very sensitive person. I would have, if I'd known the word empathetic, I probably would have said that, but I was always very, very attuned to the suffering of people around me. I think, you know, when you're raised by an alcoholic, you're sort of raised to take the temperature of a room and want to regulate it, which is something you only learn in adulthood and not childhood. So I can see all of these patterns and behaviors that I was only shaken out of by those losses. And I don't miss that version of myself. I don't miss the before version of myself. I really don't. But I do have more compassion for her because she didn't know what she didn't know. And she was doing her best. But before my dad died, one of my best friends from growing up, his dad died. And I was in my late 20s. And I was like, wow, that's really sad, man, I've known this guy since I was a kid. And oh, my friend's dad is dead now. And I went to the funeral and I sent him a card. Maybe I dropped off a hot dish. And then I never brought his dad up again. Never. Never, never, never. I wouldn't even bring up my dad in front of him. Like I just pretended dads weren't a thing around him. So I never even gave him space to not be okay. Never gave him the opportunity to be honest with me. And I did not even realize that until the minute my dad died. And he was the first person I wanted to call to say, I can't believe you've lived like this for five years. How, how have you lived like this for five years? How? And he was like, wait, what's happening? I was like, Oh, my dad just died. But no, no, we'll talk about that later. Tell me about your dad. How you feel? Like, just, you just don't know. You don't know until you know. That's right. Yeah, that's, that's right. And I know, I get the whole, you know, you're doing your best and all that. And I, some part of me is, for, you know, doesn't feel guilty, but not all of me. I, it's a, I do see it almost as it's something that's helped me believe in reincarnation. Because, you know, as above so below, it's almost like that was a different life altogether with a whole different set of conditions that many of them were, I thought were permanent, you know, and now this is a new life. And also because, you know, of my age and just the way the world is, sometimes I feel like I'm, I'm just in some kind of dream. And that, you know, Pima Chodron's teacher, Chogyam Trumper Rinpoche, who's my meditation teacher's teacher said, it's when you get old enough, your people just are dropping like flies. You know what I mean? Like, and, and, and that. So I know in in store for me is more of the same. Yes. And doesn't it make you want to look at the surviving elderly people, you know, and think, and ask like, how are you, how are you doing this? How, how, how, how, how, how are you living without your best friends and your siblings and your parents? Like just, I just have so, I want to like go back in time and like hold my grandma through those losses, you know? Yeah. Oh yeah. Do you think that our cult that do you think our culture is like, illiterate when it comes to grief? Oh, absolutely. It's like, look at, I tell everybody who has a job, like, you know, go look at your benefits because when I was, I was employed when my dad died when Aaron died. And it's, I was given title to, I think three days of bereavement leave. Unreal. So, you know, not great. And that's if you are a full time, you know, salaried employee with benefits, maybe you'll have a manager who will, you know, tell you like, don't worry about it, come back when you're ready. But like, do they really mean when you're ready? Or do they mean a couple of weeks? Right? A couple of weeks. They mean a couple of weeks. They mean a couple of weeks. We're going to be ready in a couple of weeks. We don't have three weeks. We don't have three weeks. I gotta hire someone in three weeks. Yeah. Gotta get the shit taken care of. Yeah. And so we don't, and because, you know, and also like we're so removed from like the actual deaths themselves. If you were, were you with your parents when they died? No, I was not. Both of them. I missed the moment of death. I was there almost, I missed the, I missed the moment of death. One of the many things I feel guilty about. Don't, because honestly, our dad waited till we left the room, you know, like, and, and that was like, I feel like it was intense. It was an intentional exit and Aaron made everyone else leave the house. Like I just knew he would not go until everybody left the house and it was just us. And now I'm going to cry, but it's like, it is so beautiful. And like it doesn't feel like a disappearance. It really doesn't. Like it has made me believe in, in something more too, because yeah, like it does feel like this transition. It feels like all of a sudden you understand everything about the universe. And it is a brief and sparkling moment. And then, you know, you have to go back to the Home Depot parking lot and you're like, mother, that's not how you park. Like, you're over the line. You're over the line. Yeah. But for a minute there, like, you got it. And you knew, like, you knew what matters. Like, you know why wars are stupid. You know why it's dumb to, you know, hold a grudge against your coworker for, you know, seeing your boss on an email. Like, you get it. You get it for at least a minute, maybe longer. And I think that's what mindfulness is. I think that's what being present is, is like, just having that sense of like, oh, I get it. I get it. Like humans are silly, sweet, adorable little creatures, aren't we? Like just waking up, putting on our little outfits, worrying our little worries, like going to our little jobs, like, you know, collecting our little things and, um, yeah, parking over the line. At Home Depot, are you aware of how many people need shit in here? No one's here because they want to be. No one's here because they want to be. No one is impulse shopping. No one goes to Home Depot unless there's a disaster. You're making me remember something that I've forgotten that's weirdly easy to forget, which is that magical quality to it. And which is that weird new spatiality or something, this new expanded universe and a impossible sense that this person is somehow more available to you than they were when they were embodied. And then now you have, this is why it's good to have, you know, some kind of widow's club or grief club or some people to talk to you because if you talk to the normies and you're like, you know, I know this is going to sound wild, but I feel like I can kind of still communicate with my mom here and there. They'll be like, I know you can't. And isn't that wonderful? You're grieving. You'll have in about five days, you should come back to work though, because Roger got caught. That powerpoint is awaiting for your input. Yes, we have comments. We have comments. Did you have dreams, experiences, anything like that where you connected with Erin? Yeah, I was just telling my mom, who's actually here visiting. So maybe she can overhear this, but right after my dad died, maybe even the night that he died, it was clear that Erin was dying. It was clear to all of us. And I had this dream. We were up at a cabin. We don't own a cabin, but we were up at one. It made sense. Our whole family was together. And our dad was in a screened in porch doing a crossword puzzle, which is absolutely socially accurate. He would do a crossword puzzle at the dinner table with us, separate from the conversation, look up, deliver our mark that showed he was listening and judging us, and then go back to it. He was out on the porch and none of us could get his attention. And we were so excited to see him. We're like, dad came, dad came, dad's up at the cabin. Like, dad's not dead. This is great. We found him. None of us can get in to look up and Erin stands up and he opens the door and he can get the door open. And my dad looks up and he sits down next to him. And I knew in the dream what it meant. And I knew that it would be okay. Like I knew, I knew like my dad like went first on purpose. Right. Because he had not been sick as long. And I woke up just feeling like, I'm going to be okay. Because I remember when my dad got sick, I was like, Oh, no, but my dad's supposed to be here. You know, like, he's gonna die. But like, I'll have my dad and um, yeah, that dream, like brought me such peace. I feel like that dream got me through the next few weeks. And I very rarely get to actually see Erin in my dreams. But he'll be like, there, like I'll be at a party and people be like, there he is. Like, I was just talking to him. He told me the funniest story. And I'm like, having fun, but trying to get to him. And we're just like missing each other. And I had one dream where he showed up and I actually got to talk to him. And he just showed up at my friend door. And it was so normal. Like, Oh, hey, come on in. And he's we're catching up. And we're so excited to see each other. And they realize, Oh, no, dude, I got married. Like, I'm married to this guy. We have all these kids like, Oh, God, like, what are we going to do? He's like, Oh, not a big deal. Not a big deal. He's like, we can we can all work it out. So it's good to know that my dead husband wants to be in a threple with me. Because I just had that moment in the new year. I was like, Oh, shit, dude, I didn't know you were coming back. And he's like, I get it. I get it. How could you know? But do you have dreams of your mom? Do you get to do you get to see your parents in your dreams? Yeah, I've had a few. I the best one was my dad who he like, he liked to live like by the water and he would you my dad also I believe I was reading I couldn't tell if you meant your dad is Vietnamese or your dad went to Vietnam. Oh, went to Vietnam. Yeah. Okay, great. Okay. So mine too. Also to cope with the PTSD became an alcohol, you know, struggled with like, yeah, a lot of vets, you know, that's, they don't, especially they were so young. They were so young. My dad was 17 when he met his dad's like a permission slip to join a war. Yeah, too, too young. And really were like the ripples of all the wars. I mean, that's what we're that we're all living in the ripples of some epigenetic, horrible trauma that's anyway, that dream, my um, my um, okay, so my dad like, he was really proud of this one apartment he had that looked out over harbor. So in the dream, and my dad too nagged me like your dad nagged you out of like some kind of love, I guess, but really exactly. Thanks for that. Do I have an eating disorder now? I don't know, maybe, but yeah, why are they so obsessed with bodies? It's so weird. Like my dad would like that shape my brothers too is so weird. I was like, they're they just have like regular bodies. They're literally fine. Oh, I know. And I know, bizarre, bizarre. You're drinking, you get to that point. It's time to fat shame your kids. What the fuck's wrong with you? What are you doing? Well, you have kids now. Imagine, imagine looking at one of your children being like, holy shit, you are putting on weight. What's going on there, chubby? Can you imagine being like, like someone's parent batch, like aggressively fat shaming them? Oh, yeah, it was a it was a weird time. Any younger listeners, it was a weird time. It was a weird time. Love your body. What? No, punish it. Hate it. No, punish it. Yeah. No, he let me get on when I'm like, I think I was 14. And he let me get on slim fast. Like, I'm a 14 year old taking slim fast because I was so ashamed of my body because of this. So I'm like drinking from hungry all the time. My digestion's fucked up. I'm like, gassy and like, not losing anyway, by the way. He's like, proud of you, son. No, he made fun of me for the slim fast. What are you? What are you like in your 50s and your 50s, your housewife trying to lose some weight? It's like, motherfucker, what do you want? But I still will always love him. And the dream, he was sort of like proud of this apartment looking over the ocean, really. I mean, oceanfront view, incredible. And he's like happy. I'm like, dang it. One thing I've learned from reading your books is that it's not okay to cry. Yeah, no, stuff it down. Yeah, good feelings are so gross. Stop having that. That's what I really appreciated you writing is the invitation to not feel pain. But he, anyway, he was like, he was basically telling me he was okay. And then he goes, oh, yeah. And two of your friends, they live, they're in the apartment above me. And I'm sure what they are, they're weird. I think they might be aliens. And then, you know, in the way dreams do, it's these two Tibetan monks are standing like on either side of him with their hands, like on his shoulder. Oh, it was the coolest, like, whoa, who I don't, who are you to? Yeah. But the sense of like, oh, okay, I get it. Like, you're being taken wherever this is or whatever this is. Yeah. Something is helping you through it. Yeah. You know, which is you're okay. You're okay. Yeah. Do you think it? Not I don't even know if it matters. It does matter. But most people I know who have a meditation practice or they seem not like confident or have it's not like they have faith that there is some continuation of the soul or consciousness. It's like they're fully like, well, you can still talk to them. They're immediately accessible. They're somehow outside of time or something. What do you think? Is it just some kind of, you know, subconscious wish, the denial of death, all that cynical shit? Or do you think our loved ones stick around for a while after they drop their bodies? I think they stick around. I do think they stick around. I don't think it's I don't think it's denial at all. I really do think that the soul, like whatever makes you you is so special. And maybe that is just some like latent Catholicism. But, you know, that's it's that's that's the fingerprint of who you are. That's the thing that can't be duplicated because it turns out a lot of people have the same fingerprints. Okay, they're actually not that unique. So yeah, I might have I think I just like saw part of a TikTok about it. But that's the new I saw a tweet, which is the new like, oh, I read something. I used to say I read something and I meant I read like a tweet with like a link and didn't quite click the link. Now I mean, I glanced at a TikTok about it. This is what I do. I'm like, well, what I what I've heard a 14 year old say is that you know, that's that's the part that's that's who we are. You know, it's not just, you know, the wiring of our brains and our bodies, like there is something else. And you know that because if you've seen a dead body, you look at it and you're like, well, looks a lot like my dad. Yeah, that's not my dad. Not my dad. Not my dad anymore. So I do think that I do think that and I don't think it's like some special third location anymore. You know, I like, I don't think like, you know, you that you get sort of like sucked up into like a heaven that is a a different location. I actually I've got a theory that like this is the bad place like we are in hell right now, what could be worse? What could be worse than this world that we live in, right? And that these moments of joy that we feel these moments of peace, these moments of mindfulness are like respite, those are glimpses into what heaven could be, like who we could be. And when you are dead, you are just in that constantly, you are in that state of peace, in that state of connected connectedness to everything. And, you know, like when you're when you're having like a lucid dream, or when you're you know, like really deep in a meditation or where you're just really, really happy in a moment and present and and you're doing something that's seemingly meaningless, but feels so meaningful because you're out of your brain. That's how like, you know, I feel or sometimes I recognize Aaron in like hawks, there's so many hawks. Okay, there's so many hawks around there, but I'm like, Oh, there he is, just dropping into a little hawk body so you can drive next to our car circle around us on a hike, or for some reason, like perch in a tree in our backyard, you know, and everybody who has a dead loved one has the same sense, right? Like, oh, yeah, like, Oh, wait, like some of my dad's here, right? Like somehow like, you know, my mom's here, like this, this cardinal always birds, we love birds in this. But it's a, yeah, I do think that I think that I think we, I think we stick around. And I think we're sort of surrounded at all times by, you know, the souls and the energy of people that we know and that we don't, too. I want to go back a little bit to what you said about the possibility that this is hell. And it just made me think of something my meditation teacher, David told me, there's Buddha's in all the realms in the heavenly realms in the earth plane and in the hell realms, there's beings that are in the hell realms who are just there to serve others, to try even in hell, compassion still exists. And that's what if we are in hell, that's what you would be, wouldn't you, you are someone who is really helping people by being fully open about what happened to you and also letting people chat with you about it in a way that doesn't feel you make us feel so comfortable. How, how is it that I feel okay talking with you about your, what people you have lost, you know, sometimes other people are grieving, I'm afraid to talk about her, I don't know what to say or, but you create this wonderful space for folks. And so I think that makes you, if this is how that would make you some kind of hell Buddha, which is pretty, pretty fun. That's honestly probably the best compliment I've ever gotten. I was trying to think of a better compliment. I don't think I've gotten one. Awesome. Hell Buddha. It's pretty special. Love being a hell Buddha. I was, as soon as she said that, I was like, I got to find me a hell Buddha. I got to find me one. I got to find me one. And you know, like, I think that's really beautiful. I'm going to go look into that more. I want to learn more about that. May I ask one last question? Oh yeah, yeah. How is it being married, having a family, and being in this sort of throttle situation, and how does your husband, how does he work with it? But you know, it seems like I would, if I were, I think I would, you know, we can't control the way we feel. Yeah. I feel like bubbling up out of me would be a weird form of jealousy for someone who's no longer here. Does that happen at all? Probably your husband is. No, it doesn't. That's the funny thing is I assumed that would be the reality and the bummer is that is the reality for a lot of widows. It really is. And it's not just with their new partners, but with like their, for like, you know, their dead husband or dead partners, like family, right? Like where they're just shut out. Or it's like, I think it's just this very, we have like, we have a limited amount of imagination emotionally for anything, not just for, you know, the sad things Duncan, but like for love too. And I did too. I remember growing up and being like, you know, my family was, my parents were like in love for 40 years. And, you know, I didn't know anyone with divorced parents when I met somebody who like had a step mom. I was like, Oh, like, how could you even, how could you even like, let another woman into your home when you have a mom? Like I just like love was possession, right? And it was a loyalty. And it was like, you only get this much of it. And, and that's, that's certainly how I treated people that I dated too, right? Like we'd break up and I'd never liked him anyways. He sucks. He can breaking go to heck. I don't care. Just this is so like bizarre and toxic. And so I am lucky to have a Matthew because it's not like that. And I've asked him to and he's like, no, I don't feel jealous. I'm not excited to be dead. Which is one of my favorite jokes. My most popular TikTok was, you know, questions people ask me, like you're widowed, you're remarried, isn't your husband jealous? Yeah, he can't wait to be dead. He'd rather be dead than married to me. And I'm like, that's a dumb question. I'm sorry. I just, you know, I have grieving friends sorts of grieving friends who do have significant others. And they do have to like, sometimes the significant others are like, what about me? I know, I know, I know, I know. Isn't it so sad? And it's like all this insecurity. And I don't know if Matthew's just more secure because, you know, he went through a divorce, which is like a whole different kind of loss. And he's just very like secure in who he is. But it's not a dumb question. Because actually, a lot of people do feel that way. And feel like sort of like threatened by the memory of another person. But to me, I feel like it's an asset. I even think it's an asset that Matthew was divorced, that he knows what it's like to be in a relationship and have to like, let it go, even though it was the only thing he'd ever known. And they had children, you know, like, I think we learned so much from that. And to me, I would have gladly dated or married another widow, because I would look at that person and think, okay, like, you know, you know what it's like to live up to that vow that you made. And so I don't know, unfortunately, I am lucky. And I really shouldn't be like, this is the kind of love that everybody deserves. And no, he doesn't get weird about it. And like, I get I do get weird about it. Like, I, Taylor Swift was a huge part of my relationship to Erin, unironically. And she was not cool in 2010. When we met, she wasn't this when people were like, Oh, my God, so corny. Like, speak now had come out, she hadn't quite made that like pop crossover. Erin really saw her as, you know, the songwriter of our generation. And he told me she's the Paul McCartney of our generation, like people are going to respect her. And I was like, I fully agree. I already do I am on board. So she comes out with folklore. And one of the songs is cardigan, Erin always wore cardigans. Like, obviously, she wrote that song about him. And it came out, you know, like, I can't even remember when it came out. But it came out and it felt significant. And I remember listening to that album, sobbing, and like, just, you know, Matthew, just laid there and like, let me cry and listened. And it was like, Oh, this is the music that does it for you. He likes different kinds of music. And, you know, yesterday, my mom and Erin's mom and Matthew's mom all went out to lunch together. And like, so it's that love, like Matthew's love is humbling. But the love that Erin's parents have for all of our kids is truly, I think, like the best example of like, how to be, you know, and like, Erin's parents are like, everyone's grandma and grandpa. And like, they made five to nine accounts for Matthew's oldest kids, like, who have no blood relationship to them, you know what I mean? Like, they, they're everybody's grandparents. And to me, like, we could have so easily lost that and we didn't. And Erin's mom to me is like the best example of like, how to be a person, you know? Yeah. Because she lost her only son. And she is still so, so open and loving to the world around her. And I try to be more like her. I gotta say, obviously, I have no idea. You deserve it. You don't deserve it. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. You deserve it. I'm so happy you have it. And it makes me my heart fill with joy to know and I know everyone is like, Oh, who are you saying? They're like, you got, it's okay. It's okay. Yeah, you deserve, you deserve this. You've, it's time for you to have that. And you thank you. I appreciate that. And if anyone is listening and plays music in Phoenix, he's a drummer and he's desperate for a band. And so please, if you play any kind of music in Phoenix, Arizona, my husband is a drummer and he's very good. And I say that as a person who doesn't know anything about drums, but believes him to be the best drummer in the world. Okay. Yeah, I, he's like, I'm really not. I'm like, yeah, you were in Blink 182. You are Travis Barker. Okay. Wow. Friends, did you hear that? You must immediately bring this person into your band. Whoever's listening, please.

It's almost like that It's not like calling it like a hard shell Doesn't even come close to describing Where you have to get at with it It's like some form of artistic nihilism or something Yeah I don't know, it's weird, it's a good thing Assume that whatever energy you're putting into Anything creatively No matter how far along it seems to have progressed The odds are, until that shizz on the screen It's not gonna happen Yeah, it's like a thing where all you think about Nothing is real until the check clears Yeah The check has to actually even clear Otherwise it's just some, well that's the case with everything though Kind of in a way, it's just that it's more It's more visible with that world Where you really just, because it's in the control of people It's outside of your hands, it's out of your control completely Completely out of your control, but you get such a When you're invited to work on something like you're working on And you're drinking of this rare wine It's this nectar that's like, you know it can't last anyway Just because it's a show and shows inevitably end But you just want it to keep going Not just because of the obvious business side of stuff When you get to mesh with so many other talented people And people who are good at shit that is a completely different On a completely different track than acting When you're working on a show, it's not just actors It's like, you know It's everything, it's the whole thing Yeah, living in the world feels really, it's a fun world to live in I always thought of it kind of like, maybe an unfair comparison But to me it's a version of the military kind of Where you're consumed by something It's very much like there's this camaraderie The hours are long, there's all this stuff It's in service of something kind of ridiculous maybe Or it's in service of a greater thing Everyone's a part of the greater thing There's obviously a hierarchy And sometimes the hierarchy causes problems Because the top brass is telling us we gotta fucking move Look, I'm just telling you, they told us we gotta go two clicks down here I know there's no fucking river down there But we gotta go, we gotta go down there And we gotta set up Because it's just like there's always communication errors Where someone at the top doesn't know that they've changed the... You're seeing blue, but it's actually red It's like, why is it red? It's that kind of stuff, which... It's like the bureaucracy of it is insane It costs a lot of money, it's all... To me, it's like the military without the whole killing thing The fundamental aspect of it Dude, when I'm watching The Walking Dead now And I let the part of my brain that thinks about setting up shots And I watch where they're at Out in the fucking middle of nowhere in Shitsville And they got a baby They gotta get shots with a living human baby Watching the shots, they choose to use the baby Watching when they set up for a new shot Was that baby gonna turn into a doll? You know what I mean? How long did they get the baby for? No, the baby is still there, that's a living baby Not the fake baby they have to use sometimes You're just thinking, good God They managed to get that baby for both shots That's crazy, just that alone Not to mention all the cameras and the people And the food and the limited time and the stress And the drama of just like, this has gotta work This doesn't fucking work We are fucked, this has gotta work I think that's the death part That's the death part Oh yeah, I guess that is sort of the true Yeah, there's like a death aspect But it's not the same, it's not literal Worse than death When you die, you have to fucking read Rotten Tomato reviews about your life When your fucking show sucks, you gotta You can't go on Rotten Tomato Rotten Tomatoes, Rotten Tomatoes is Rotten I have nothing to do with that shit I'm Rotten, it's Rotten Tomatoes is Rotten Why are you against Rotten Tomatoes? Because everything gets reviewed on there Is always the opposite of how it actually is Not everything, but so many things Where you think about, like look up Like your top five favorite movies From the past 20 years Like maybe before Rotten Tomatoes And you'll just see like, what? It's like finding out that someone Hates your favorite restaurant And why they hate it, you're like And this fucking sucks, and this sucks But you remind it's so precious to you It's wild, like the ferocity And pettiness of critics Expectations is just, like you You know, good critics When you read the analysis of whatever The fuck it is they're reviewing It's more than just a review It's like social commentary You know what I mean, it's educational They're familiar with lineages They have like a perspective Born from a lifetime Of being like a hardcore cinephile And usually there's a hopefulness In the critique, in the sense They wanted it to work They didn't want something to suck They like it when good stuff comes That versus like, you know The run of the mill like vlogging critic Who really doesn't like have Like a vast archive In her own mind of like film His film history, influences That's where the pettiness pops in That's where there's like the color The stop sign was faded And that moment where there was a cat That just, you didn't need the cat Come on, that guy did shit You're like a dog, that guy gets really petty And some of that stuff just reads It reads so much like sour grapes So much stuff does I see that all the time now Like more and more and I see anyone Being critical of anything Because I have to stop myself all the time From wanting to be critical about something Publicly like on Twitter or whatever Right And I'm thinking like this is like Why don't I care And if you do publicly say You care about something when you're It's like oh man this shit sucks It's just such a It just looks like sour grapes It looks bad, it's not a It's just a bad energy Very bad energy Bad attitude Opens yourself up to that exact same Right Ferocity from somebody else It affirms that it's okay to do that It's like you're essentially like Signing up to be dehumanized And dissected by everybody If you go down the path of bitching about shit At all And you create stuff And it's not your fucking job It's like your job is to make stuff Review it What are you doing? And also so much stuff I realize I think now I'm like This is just not for me I don't think it's bad or good or anything It's just not, it's not for me You know my assumption usually Is I'm probably dumb Like if I don't like something I just think oh it's more like This is more related to me being dumb Than it being bad Like it's, you know this is something you get You're probably experiencing this I'm older than you But when you get older You become increasingly comfortable With how dumb you are Oh totally I love it Me too Yeah You don't try to arm wrestle With some version of yourself that doesn't exist Like you know This is something I just realized Like when I'm reading a book I skim a lot You do Yeah I'll skim I'll get excited and I'll skim I'll jump through And I used to think I was doing that Because of intelligence Like because when I was in college They taught us how to like Here's how you read something And grab the main points And then the other day I just realized You're not doing this because you're smart You're doing this because you're dumb Like you're doing this like a hundred percent Because you're dumb And you don't have the attention span To hang on to the paragraphs That aren't just scratching Whatever fucking itch You're wanting to be scratched at that moment So you're skimming And you're also skimming Because you don't understand what the fuck They're talking about Reading some book on cells right now So it starts getting into protein folding And like Like a book about cells Or like a science book or a novel It's a fantastic book about cells What's it called? Idiot's Guide to Biology Okay so that's Now I'm just kidding I'll look it up It's called Hold on one second It's one of those books that like Those very rare books That manages to It's called The Song of the Cell By Siddhartha Mukherjee And it's really fucking good But it's one of those rare books that like Is the person writing it A genius? Is the person writing it Responsible partially for Humanity like leading Like leading humanity towards a Less disease to an healthy state Is the person writing it The kind of person who when they were young Thought to themselves I'm gonna try to help Like I'm gonna dedicate my life to Trying to make sick people better Versus you Who you know are unhappy Because they canceled a show You like an effort Yeah like having that long Long range view type thing Yeah that is what the person is like That stuff is amazing to me When someone has like that long range Write exactly But they know how to translate All of that All of their knowledge into a way That like people like me Are like this is fucking good They feel like I'm participating In that person's life Just by reading it You know it's a really rare I've heard someone say that About writing There's two things I've heard To say about writing One is that It's just you're just a translator You're not like really You're never writing You're just translating You're sort of translating There's some quote from Joyce Carol Oates That Just thinks she said Something effective I don't know how I feel about something Until I write about it And I always think about that How you know you get Your thoughts are all jumbled About something you're thinking about Like oh this is that You're just thinking about something Then when you write it out It's either becomes totally ridiculous You're like oh this is the dumbest Stupidest thing I was worrying about Or considering Because you can't find a way to explain it Because it's not It's bullshit Or it's the opposite Where it starts to unfold And become like oh my god There's so much there There's so much there In this thought Where it just starts to blossom And blossom like oh my god I could think and talk about this For so long Because there's so much there Yeah man that's where it's good The other one not so great That part where you're like Some issue that you've always felt Like you have some understanding of Or like you have a resolution Regarding a question That the world might be pondering Over this and that And then you sit down You get the question part out Or you start writing about the thing And you realize like what's my point Like I don't have a point at all Regarding whatever the fuck I'm saying I just it's a premise That I have no idea how to resolve That's like that for me Those are difficult moments Where you slam into that wall Like what am I trying to say here Am I trying to say anything Or do I just want to listen to My fingers hit keys Yeah you want to hear your voice You want to hear your voice chime in Resonate with everybody else I got something to say about that It's like what is it Well I think that It's like when you hear someone Failing on talk radio Because they didn't realize What they had to say And then they realized Someone that they realized What they say is like terrible It's like very offensive and nasty Or they just have nothing new to add Nothing You know what I mean It's like here's someone falling apart Well I think that when If these people If they're going to If you're going to allow people to park And sleep Okay if you're going to sleep in your car I don't I have trouble When I would be driving A long time Caller Can you please make your point It like devolves It'll usually like It's like whatever the awful train was It'll just jump onto a completely different track With a completely different destination Like it'll go from Yeah people sleeping in cars to like some Completely non-related bowling analogy Because it's personal Yeah yeah yeah You know like when You know Dan He'll go up and get the beer At the bowling alley And bring it back But he's sipped off of it Like what Okay well We're talking about whether or not Pre-K is right for all children Yeah You just want You just This time it didn't work You know I get I know that I know what they were hoping for Like you have Every comedian has it You have it Like you like You throw yourself into the abyss And you hope that some part of your brain That you don't have direct access to Will take over And out of your mouth Will pour words That combine to make something funny Or even something that makes sense at all And sometimes That part of yourself is on vacation It's just It's out It's on silent mode Comes and goes Comes and goes I just saw A clip Somebody on Fox News Goes Talking about Pelosi That weirdo bang Pelosi On the head of the hammer And he goes Is that back in the news now?

That's what I wanna know Where's the... I mean, look, I've been hitting the head With a hammer by a trust pastor And that's not what it looks like That's not what it looks like You don't just fall down like that You stand No, you don't just fall down like that Hammer You keep standing It's not a movie When you get hit by a hammer You usually stand You flap your wings around Hammer flaps, what they're called We're actually going to our field agent Who's at a hammer factory right now Let's talk about these What is a hammer? What is a hammer? Is it a hammer? Would this even be considered a hammer? Would it be something bigger? Is this a sledgehammer? It's hard to see with a video But what I'm looking at Does not fit into the classic model of hammer Certainly not construction level hammer From what I'm seeing there That could easily be a clown hammer Or a fantasma hammer Could be a dildo Well, I didn't say that I'm not going to say that Well, it could be a men's Penile insertion device That's used commonly Commonly called a hammer I don't know this But I've seen I've heard that Sometimes you might call a dildo a hammer You get hammered by this cock You wanted to get hammered By this hammered in your In your puss We do say hammered In ways that don't necessarily refer to construction Look, I'm going to leave it The Justice Department in this case I don't have any other commentary On the many ways hammers Have been used throughout human history To make people come hard That's fucked But I'll leave that to the Justice Department Hey, Clare, this is also an example Of flat earth here We're seeing, as you can see The horizon in the background is very flat And you would think this house is on a hill We should see some curvature San Francisco is a very hilly city So when I'm seeing this footage I'm not seeing a lot of hills And it's making me think Are we really looking at San Francisco? Are we really looking at San Francisco? I don't think we are I've been to San Francisco I've ridden the trolleys And it's very steep And windy It's windy, it's steep There's a lot of food there I don't see any food being prepared There's food trucks I don't see a food truck None of the police officers Are holding any food truck items Like, you know, I would expect To see at least one of them With a nice gourmet baguette In their hand Or some kind of taco Korean barbecue fusion But not a single sign of that Well, the Liberals there The Liberals here They've changed the nature You can't say baguette now You can't say baguette That's a dirty word Well, yeah And then again, this is how The Chinese government took control Is they started controlling The way people describe bread, food Food in general Especially baguettes I'm gonna keep saying it Baguette I'm gonna keep saying it China, look out Baguette Come back Baguette Not gonna stop me You wanna call the cops? Go ahead Baguette But I've got a bunch of hammers And I've got a bunch of baguettes Let's see which one Feels better on your head, okay? Or, oh, yeah I know what you mean by head there And I'll tell you both Both, nothing When I was a kid If you didn't Your baguette wasn't finished Until you placed it on your head And one of your pals Hit it with a hammer And to smush it all together And then create that baguette warp Which is supposed to be a concave Like a soup Like a soup bowl Is murder illegal? I don't know Whoa I mean, it's illegal It's illegal They want it They want to make illegal Illegal They want to make it where If you have to defend They want to make it where You can't defend your home They want, yeah, they do They want all of us to open our doors Open our windows Put a red carpet down Have an array of weapons Duck tape Harnesses, nooses I don't know what they want They want us to lay that out And you know what? They want an extra They want to make your house A wheelchair accessible In case some of the people coming in To invade your home Aren't able to get up your steps That's what they're trying to do out there Here's a new one Out of California A man in a wheelchair Is suing the homeowner Because he couldn't get inside To steal his stuff Because there's no wheelchair ramp And he's winning And he's winning the lawsuit He's winning and it's big time winning He's going to make a million bucks Now, I think it would be fair to point out That this home invader When he did try to traverse the steps He did fall out of the wheelchair And he did fracture his wrist So there was an injury involved It's not to say that The man didn't injure himself But I don't think that That should give you recourse The Supreme Court is going to be looking At this case next year I know Governor Gavin Newsom Is trying to create chair lifts For home invaders The chair lift invader law But yeah, it's out there It's running amok Out there It's insane It's crazy It's lunacy I don't see it The next election cycle We're not going to see something Like this again Where are you?

Yeah, it's like It's like basically like You know, descendants of Nazis Like it's like Yeah, like the Nazis They went up there They found the promised land They like populated You know, one of my, I have a dream I think about all the time And in the dream I'm floating down this like warm tunnel But like underground river But there's ice everywhere And there's like old military equipment Stuck in the ice I wash out Or I don't know how I got out of the fucking thing You know, dreams already skip I'm in the most beautiful Germanic like village And I'm at a cafe I'm like drinking really nice coffee There's a place where you can leave tips But people are like leaving euros And like people, the people there They're all like Aryan And one of the notices me And looks at me like What are you doing here? You're not supposed to be here And you know, there I woke up And I'm like, oh fuck, was that it? Did I accidentally like Astually project to the place they talk about? It's like they live, right? Yeah, like they live But it's just an enclave But you're in the nice place Yeah It's an enclave So here, like even if you achieve The highest level of success It's still nothing Because you're still in like the Peanut gallery of planet Earth You're still in the stables, so to speak Because you've achieved it Because that whole level It's not about achievement It's about you're like born into the thing You are part of this thing That is so far removed from normal That it's not like a thing you can like You can't get it That defeats the whole purpose If you could work hard and get access to it What's the point of having that? If you can just Oh, I just worked really hard And I worked really hard and I saved up And I was able to get to the Antarctic dream hole But it's got to be something where Yeah, you can't get there through hard work It's got to be something where You have to be like anointed generationally, right? You're born into it I mean, I imagine that like from time to time They do the... I don't know They do the thing What is it? What's the Cinderella? You know, from time to time They might like allow like somebody From the stables in there It's like Meghan Markle Yeah, yeah, exactly They might let you in But they definitely don't let you out I think that's the main thing is like By the time you even get to the point Where you're going to be invited over there You've already done things so horrible Or you've already like done so many things That they own you But I would imagine in this fantasy scenario That probably there's like just a basic kind of like look We'll definitely kill you Like we'll just... We don't have to talk about it too much But if you ever say anything about it Ever You're fucking dead You know what's going to happen, right? Like we don't want to We love you We all have to follow the same rules But yeah, you can't You can't talk about this fucking paradise hole up here That's what Meghan Markle did, right? She talked too much about it She didn't like it Yeah, she talked about die But just die is the same way You can't talk about the family You can't talk about it Because once you're in It's like this special hole You get access to the hole And you gotta be like Yeah, I imagine like once you're up there Like you don't... You try not... You try to like get come here as little as you possibly can Like you don't want like coming here is like Smells bad Smells bad It's fucking like stupid It's like everybody there thinks death is real It's all just like fucking dumb And like they have no idea what planet they're even on They don't understand It's like hanging out with like I don't know Like hanging out with just Monkeys, monkey descendants All the way across the board Does that fit into flat earth at all? Or is that sort of... Because the flat earthers think that Antarctica is an ice wall, right? They don't think it's a... It fits into flat earth It does It fits into hollow earth It fits into You know, the basic idea concept of the secret city You know, or the Shambhala or something like that That there are secret zones That have been protected forever But the reason being that The moment that like too many people go there Ruins it So it's like, yeah There are all kinds of legends of these places That exist And the way they... The location depends on the lineage So yeah, sometimes they're inside the earth Sometimes they're on the other side of an ice wall Sometimes they're in Antarctica Sometimes they're astral locations That you can like sort of... Like dimensional? They're dimensional Yeah, they're dimensional That's gonna be the real thing I think that's it for real, right? Is it dimensional hotspots? Or like the club? It's a dimensional club? It's right here You're in the club right now You're just in the wrong dimension to experience it Yeah, right You're in the... I like that That's my favorite Because it's more like this is the training realm Like we're in the training zone Yeah So from that perspective Everybody gets to go there But you don't get to go there Until you have lived your life In a certain way that you've passed all the tests Which is why like, you know, when people die Reports are generally like They don't want to come back here And the people who are over there Like, no, no, no, you gotta go back You're not ready yet You gotta go back And then you have to come back here And like work out your bullshit here Before you can like wake up And where you actually are It's like a training zone Do you ever think about the idea that You don't die until your time is like You've completed your mission, so to speak Like until... Like I watched some video of an old Appalachian woman With like perfect teeth The best accent I've ever seen Just a short like two or three minute interview with her She was just talking about How you don't need anything Like you just need, you know Get some pork and you got your sugar And you don't need all this crap And she was basically saying how That she's not worried about dying Because she knows that God will keep her alive As long as she is needed That's interesting That's hopeful You think about that with you With you at all Like you have to do some stuff Like you're kind of like... Because I also saw that movie The one with... What's his name? Vigil Mortensen and Colin Farrell They're playing... It's the reenactment of those The divers in Thailand Rescuing the boys Yes One of the guys is kind of a dork And you know Vigil Mortensen plays Like this real hard headed Just emotionless guy Who's like an amazing diver And someone says to him Be careful Don't die down there And to him What he says in response is I'm not interested in dying down there Like he won't die Because he doesn't want to die down there He has no interest in dying in there So it's like... Illogical for him to think About dying down there Because he's so skilled He does not want to die So he won't die Because he doesn't want to die You know what I mean? Yes And I also think like You naturally make all kinds of assumptions Regarding time space Or continuity of self As a human So one of the assumptions is like Linear progression through life Like we have to accept that We fall asleep And we have to accept that We'll wake up and have no idea Where we were or what happened to us If we sleep deep enough And then we naturally accept That when we wake up Our memories are What preceded Where we're at at that moment They're real These are memories of our lives Even though there was like a huge gap We're just like Yeah you wake up And it's like I'm me And I know I'm me As I am now And all this makes sense Because my memories affirm That this is my house And that's my wife And those are my kids And this is why I am the way I am But who's to say? Like every time you fall asleep You don't pop out of this dimension Go into another dimension And reconvene with a group of people They're like Okay good job in that life Now we're gonna drop you into this other life And let's see how you do for a day there And so you drop into that life You're a completely different person But you think you've been there Your whole life Pop out Come back in And every time you wake up You're in a whole new incarnation But it seems like you've always been there Because the memories are baked in So yeah I think all these assumptions Point to like Maybe that is the case It's linear Obviously you don't fall asleep And pop out of this dimension And blah blah But maybe not I mean maybe that's death too There's where you don't even get to die You don't even get to the point of death Death is just something baked in To the infinite number of simulations That are happening To give other people who are sharing In that simulation A sense of mortality But your own personal demise Never really comes Because you never even stay in a life Long enough to reach that point of death That's kind of scary though Yeah it is scary That's the scariest thing of all right Isn't that the scariest thing of all Is not dying That to me gets scary The idea that you wouldn't Why I don't know Because something about that Like you're um You It's in a way it's like a hell It could be considered a hell That you don't get to die Because it's like this thing where You're sort of you're stuck And you're all these things Around you are going away Everyone you ever love is going to go away And you're just going to keep repeating it And you meet new people And the longer you live The more infinite your life feels And so everything would just start to become Less and less important to you Because the longer you live The more time feels like It's just a blink Yeah you need to take breaks I mean if you're immortal You need to take these in the same way We need to sleep Probably infinite consciousness The way it naps is by appearing as us And so it takes a little break From that hell state of infinite consciousness By like playing around with That hell state of infinite consciousness Oh fuck man I gotta I gotta tap out man I'm gonna pass out for a few lifetimes And then you just sort of run a couple of lifetimes You get to experience limitation Mortality Loss Separation All these like things that we generally Are Scared of or hate But actually for an infinite consciousness It's a break, it's a vacation It's like oh god yeah So that when you finally do go back to Whatever that state is You You can like appreciate it Like holy fuck thank you god I live forever I don't die Oh yeah that's right Oh god I needed that Oh my god now you can appreciate it for A few more infinite quadrillion billion Years until you pop back in again Yeah that's interesting to think about that I mean anytime I think about it It goes one way then the other way back again And I always end up sort of in the middle Kind of like well I guess both are Kind of true I don't really know Neither of them feel like the right Exactly the thing But it's always Yeah it seems like It's such a visceral thing That you have to feel it I mean it's visceral Yeah it's visceral like that Sense of and you're taught In this dimension To sort of disregard Intuitions of immortality as Being sort of A Kind of Way to cope with your mortality So you invent This sense of being Oh yeah it's all just like An invention a construct around you Right to keep yourself From dealing with no no no It's not infinite friend There's no fucking taking Out the helmet in your Paradise or helmet in our Friend no no no You mistake Your Emptiness for Being Permanence when it's Completely the opposite Or your experiencing really is Your lack of Anythingness I think a lot of people can This is like the big Controversial now because we live Like Buddha shows up on the scene The idea was we have this thing called The Atman which is the eternal Soul you have a soul And then In Buddha comes around and says no That's not real there is no soul That's actually so I think the term is Anatman or no soul Meaning actually no There's nothing there there's no soul There can't be it's Impossible for there to be A soul for there to be a soul That would require there to be Something Disconnected from everything else Otherwise the moment your soul becomes Interdependent the moment your soul is Related with everything else then It's subject to change if it's subject To change Then it's subject to all the things That change brings which is Eventually changing something to the Point of it no longer being recognizable Is what it was and so Actually now there is no soul To a part of yourself that is Empty Avoid the devoid of characteristics There isn't anything there Because it's nothing When you got cancer did you think about That at all was it like a was it A moment for you were you really like You know because there's always that Stereotype it's like a wake up moment But I wonder if sometimes it's not and That's like a in itself kind of A wake up where you're You find yourself Not like all the sudden appreciating Life even though you're supposed to Kind of feel that way You what you get Is You realize how everything just Keeps going so You realize Like All of everything In this dimension When you're not here anymore It's not going to take like a break There's nothing It won't be a millisecond A quantum second where everything's Like oh no there's no more that person You just look around and you realize Like the machine you're in The gears of the machine they're just They keep going and whatever Gear you think you are No matter how important you think that Gear may be it's just One of so many infinite Gears in this magical Clockwork Reality we call the material universe Yeah man you realize that You and There's something gleeful when you realize That actually it's It's scary And you obviously don't want to die Right A lot of people like when they're Dealing with death their own death Yes They're scared but they also Feel worse for everybody else around them Yeah it's harder for them Yeah because they got to keep going They're in the machine And the machine's going to keep going And they have to deal with your loss And they have to deal with the grief And they have to deal with the morning And they have to deal with all that So you just You don't have to worry about that at all You're gone So there's a sense of In that way there's a feeling Of like indebtedness to the people around you And you're a desire to like Even though they're in which is why When people get a diagnosis like that They Find themselves in this ridiculous situation Of doing more comforting Than they're being comforting Yeah because yeah I mean I remember When I was a kid I was really sick Like my mom was just so distraught And sad about stuff And I always bothered the shit out of me Because I'm like I'm doing okay I mean sometimes I'm not But essentially It always seems like it was worse For her than it was for me Yeah it is it was I hated that because it seems like It was worse for her It's hard as a parent to realize That like your child's experience Of life is normal No matter what What they're facing No matter what they're going through That to you you didn't have to go through It's normal to them Like this is just This is how they were born And this is what they were dealing with And so you're Yeah it's a very Human thing to like lean On the dying and the sick For comfort Not even know that's what you're doing But it's a normal thing I mean it's very sweet you don't want them to suffer I mean it's good intention underneath it all It's not selfishness Totally but there's that thing With death words so So I was thinking about that recently In terms of the Because the pandemic The more I think about it You've talked about it on stage a bunch I don't know if you're still talking about that But just the idea that the pandemic Is kind of pretty much over But it's not over with us In terms of like the fallout we all feel And sometimes I find myself Thinking about before the pandemic I see something like a little Like a glimmer like a documentary I mean it's very unfiltered just an unflinching Just like a You know something where you're seeing So maybe just like A home video Type thing before the pandemic I see it and I'm like I kind of ache because I'm thinking Oh god I was just So fucking good It was so nice To have this world where There weren't like people at each other's Throats about something Like every person having problems With each other and this thing Where I think about some of the stuff That I was thinking and saying during The middle of it about how I felt about Just the whole fucking thing I think about how embarrassed I am About saying things Not so much what my opinion was But just the fact that the way I so vociferously Express this thing Like it's so embarrassing It's embarrassing But I think about like the time before That and it's just like so fucking Like It's like a form of Like an innocence like we had So much innocence in our lives Innocence and hubris I mean So much you really Thought you had had it all figured out You thought you were not susceptible To Like Getting caught up in Groupthink you thought you were not susceptible To Like Whatever side of it you fell on And then suddenly this thing happens And you realize like You might have thought you were not susceptible To ever getting a brand new disease You know or you might have thought Whatever it is and then suddenly Yeah now you see the truth Is like now you're Just like everybody else You're Instantaneously going to unquestion And you're gonna fucking like do what they say Because you're scared And you want to be a good person And you don't want to hurt anybody And you trust in everything Even though you thought you didn't quite trust You thought you were so savvy You thought you were so self aware So autonomous and then Suddenly you're just like no I'm not What the fuck why are you doing this Why isn't everyone doing this Why aren't we doing this Listen to what they fucking say And it's all fear I mean Let's get it over with come on Can we just get it over with because I got stuff to do Let's lock it down for real Lock it down for real If we're gonna do this fucking martial law this shit up Let's lock it down Global lockdown all we need is a month And everything goes back to fucking normal This is like all just fear It's all just wanting everything to be okay Fucking fear turns into anger so quickly So now everyone's Like the perfect conditions For people to beat each other's throats To be completely cruel to each other One way or the other Why are you wearing that fucking mask Fucking sheepskin Why are you wearing that fucking mask Why aren't you wearing that fucking mask You dipshit What is wrong with you You're so self And then like that Some very absurd Like almost after school special Played out where it's like We became The disease We became worse Than COVID to each other We became the The thing we are trying to protect ourselves from The method of protecting ourselves Became worse Than the thing itself And so it turned into some embarrassing Parable And there's still just these echoes Of it that is everywhere And I especially I just see it so much And I don't know I feel like I don't know how to deal with it yet Where I It's just I really mourn the time before In a way That I think is I don't think it's the healthiest thing Or at least it's something where I recognize it but I really Would like to not be Thinking about that because then you start To be nostalgic and you start to be like Do it Man it used to be so good Kind of bullshit I think you should do that I think that's very healthy I think avoiding that You lost We all lost something in pretending That's bad If you don't go through that then you can't get You won't feel better You have to just flat yourself Your body or your mind or your psyche Needs to do that Let it do it Allow it to mourn Allow it to have those pangs It's a great way to respect That little bubble of Sort of naive Weird Harmony that to us Seem to exist in the world before The pandemic hit It's sweet I don't think there's anything wrong with it It's healthy to Become grim and dismal about The way things are now You know I do wonder though man You and I We've taken so many psychedelics We've warped our consciousness We've got I do wonder How is that A typical square Working with this shit At this point You're kind of like Sinking up with With it now You do kind of have to Like You know The masks all came off for a second And now everyone's trying to get their mask back on And It's like Well you can I guess the healthy thing is you're sorry We'll go back to the weird costume party We're all And try to Like get back to the way it was As much as we can But yeah how does this How does a Real square deal with it Like how do you deal with The reality of Western medicine and For-profit medicine and All of the implications Of that when it comes to vaccines When it comes to The whole thing is such shit It's such utter All the healthcare stuff Is such absolute trash It's so Evil The way they treat people who are sick It's just absolutely It's terrible It is It's like a really one of the glaring Right in your face Critiques of capitalism It's like That's where it gets really fucking Number one like I think The whole problem gets fixed Instantly By making it so that politicians can't accept Donations from pharmaceutical companies And that pharmaceutical companies can't advertise So remove The PR element of Pharmacology And I think things would like get Normal Fast I mean I went to my I went to get my checkup the other day And was And he's like You gotta stop watching those commercials Just Don't pay attention to those commercials Yeah Because the commercial The problem with those commercials is it's like The idea is For better for worse There are these experts called doctors You go in They fucking do your blood panel They listen to what's going on with you And then from their massive Reservoir Of data that they're still paying Off loans for They prescribe some medicine Or tell you not to do this or that To get better But you, the reason you're going to the doctor Is because you don't fucking know what to do And they do So the idea that pharmaceutical companies Can just advertise Medicines To people Who don't know anything About what those medicines are Or why they work It's psychotic It's egregious And Because then what happens is it's like Now if you're running a pharmaceutical company And you want to like Make a nice profit It's not enough to just have some medicine You need people to buy that shit You need people to buy it And if you can't get the doctors To prescribe it You need them to go to the doctor And be like, what about ozimper Oh, oh, oh, ozimper Ozimper? That shit, that shit I feel like I'm in like a weird fever dream When you see the ones that are taking like an old song That shit, it's so much Like it's beyond Idiocracy, it's a thing where I want to pinch myself sometimes That one that, oh, oh, ozimper Like what the fuck Is this, we're living in Nothing is everything Like, is that What song? How high up? They're gonna take like a David Bowie catalog And just make it all like Pharmaceutical songs There's a god of a drug to take It's the one that is not a fake If you take it And every day You'll be cured of your problems, mate Oh, ozimper Take it twice a day, man Oh, ozimper It's better than a trash can What the fuck did you do? You took like one of the greatest songs Ever written and made it about Like your blood pressure Get ready, when you hear about some artists Selling their fucking catalog for $6 million Or $60 million or whatever Get ready, there's about to be a bunch of Justin Bieber songs on fucking Prescriptions and commercials Bieber just sold this shit to BlackRock, baby Dude, what the fuck That's insane They got that for a deal $200 million for the Bieber's entire catalog Something's up, something's fishy there, man That shit is It doesn't have to be black anymore It doesn't have to be black anymore It has colors now, thanks to With Cosympic 10.6 With Cosympic AG And also The other weird thing about it is that Injects into your mind the knowledge Of conditions You've never fucking heard of in your life And then you have to wrap your head around Like Jesus, how many people have this Disorder that they're Advertising it They're stroboscopically advertising Like do you have lower cranial Bineural inflammation Crossed with knee cramps I think it's cramps, too Fuck, I don't know what that is Christ, I would love to live in that world Those people and that commercial are in I've been seeing a lot of ads now for These drugs that are treat all sort of colitis Which I have all sort of colitis Sort of don't have anymore because I don't have a colon But there's all these drugs now Treating it that weren't around 15, 20 years ago Because more people have Colitis So weird to see that To see all these things, these drugs for it I know that there's a lot of these diseases Especially digestive diseases Especially any autoimmune Or inflammatory disease Which is just a fact That a lot of that is stress Right Doctors will tell you that But the problem is It's very hard to tell someone Who's feeling very real symptoms That you are This is very likely A result of diet Or stress And if you're able to Deal with that first Then, and if nothing happens Then maybe it's something else But it's just like you can't It's so complicated You can't sell that There's not a lot of money in telling people Probably if you stop eating processed Ferrets and get some sleep You're gonna feel better There's no what's that commercial Who makes money out of that There's no way to do that There's also a whole thing about colon cancer now Like colon cancer rates are skyrocketing Among people under 30 Which is kind of unheard of Because typically you'd never have Colon cancer is typically You don't even get screened for colon cancer Until you're 40, usually you're 35 So to get colon cancer And they're saying that there's young people Who are gonna start to get colon cancer a lot more I think it's because of processed foods Like this thing where I mean It's like an epidemic Of shit Dude, I'm lucky man Aaron's gone all woke as far as food goes So now all we have is like woke food And it's great And a lot of us, I used to be like The semi woke one when it came to stuff But now she's like She'll tell me like no You can't eat red colored Candy Yeah, cause it's bad There's shit in it, I can't remember what it's called It's gotta die in it It fucks with your hormones It's illegal in lots of countries It's illegal all over Europe You can't, the M&M's You get there are different I stopped eating M&M's and Skittles Even though I fucking love M&M's and Skittles Cause I'm a human But because it's like man Why does it have to be this way Why can't we just have Like why can't we just have Skittles be Or fucking titanium dioxide Yes Does that sound like you should fucking eat it And that's in Everything, that's in fucking everything Man, and like Like you know a lot of like You'll hear parents be like man When I gave my kid sugar, it lost its fucking mind It's like it might not be the sugar It's the inside The sugar is like cooked into Really? Hormone disrupting shit Watching your kid go through some kind of Weird fucking hormone surge It's not necessarily the sugar It's the weird chemicals Mixed in with the sugar And yeah, it's like This is the, and this is where The satanic interdependency between Like processed foods And pharmaceutical companies comes in Because it's like, you know If you're gonna, if you Want to sell umbrellas, you need it to rain And it's like, you know what I mean Last thing, if you're like making money off a pill To combat Damage caused by eating Weird dyes and skittles You're gonna lose money If those dyes suddenly became illegal Meaning That there would There's a strange Place where Two completely different industries Suddenly have a vested interest In lobbying Politicians Will eat certain stuff in the food supply Because They both like, fuck man If I can't use non-zing Seven red For my skittles And I have to use this other shit Then it's gonna make them look less magical And it's gonna cost me a lot of fucking money Cost you more money I always think about the whole Like the lead, the lead of gasoline Is such a great, great story That exemplifies that because How many years after they knew It was hideously Damaging and carcinogenic Did they keep putting it in the gasoline Like ten years maybe, something like that Thalamide Thalamide is the greatest example Of this Where like Thalamide Is gonna be used to treat Anxiety and Pregnance because like when people get Pregnant man They have to survive Like you got a baby and you're not exactly When you hear about pregnant people The adjectives To describe them are not often like Cool headed Relax Pleasant Sensible You can fucking blame them They've got a second heart in their stomach Right in front of them The dogs jumping on it It's just like a fucking bounce house It's like so So To combat that Thalamide was supposed to be an anti-anxiety medication For pregnancy They were using it all over Europe And they wanted to get in the United States Thank God somebody in the FDA Read Whatever the study was And it was one lady and she's like This Is too good To have seen a study like this Something is off here So she pushes back The thalamide people Who are fucking richer than shit Because like all the Everyone's like you heard about thalamide Put it in your wife's fucking tea I didn't know this Yeah so then So thank fucking God Pushback pushback pushback Really like A real poisonous Battle is happening between this one person And a like Very wealthy company And finally Data starts coming out That kids are being born without arms Without Because a molecule A molecule of thalamide got Into the embryo And it was basically like Just throwing gum in a printer Or something you know like It just stopped printing at certain places We making an arm And so Yeah but even after It was becoming clear That thalamide was not going to make it in the United States The company Used a loophole and went to doctors With thalamide saying like Oh my God Can you just use it it's like it's part of research So you can recommend it still to some of your patients And so yeah a few people In the west So evil And really Evil part is nobody went to jail Nobody Wasn't it like the 80s or something When was this? It was 70s Late 60s Nobody went to jail Nobody was prosecuted Nothing really happened Other than like it was stopped So yeah like That's just one example of like The fucking steamroller of money That starts smashing into Governments when they're trying to sell Pills It's like yeah And a lot of the time I'm sure It just steamrolls its way right through It just gets in there A lot of money man it's a lot of money So much money just gobs That's the thing like we were talking about before When we were joking about stuff But just the idea that there's like a scale Of money that is just We don't realize The amounts are massive Just so so so big Mass You know like lawyers When you go to a lawyer Their job is there's a name for it But the way they defend you They have to Yes And so it doesn't matter If the lawyer thinks I'm not quite sure You didn't set your wife on fire But you're sworn To use Anything you can to keep that person From going to jail That's your job And so these pharmaceutical companies They have the very same kind of people Except their job is to like Get their medication Through all the trials So that they can make money And to like You know They're not looking at the data That is being given to them by the companies And thinking I don't know if this seems Are you sure about That you didn't leave some stuff out here They're not doing that They're like okay this is great We can sell this shit There's so many It's so compartmentalized Too that a lot of the people don't even realize That's the genius of it They're holding the flame of like healing They're running the fucking Olympic torch of health And bringing us into the future They're not realizing like We're about to poison a bunch of people That's all those salesmen All the oxycontin salesmen were that way They didn't know They thought they were helping people With chronic pain I'm really helping people Because this is a good drug That helps people who've got this chronic Chronic pain Now look Chronic pain by the way Chronic pain I must say something about him I know that's a Freudian slip But I know he's catching shit right now He's catching a lot of shit Okay and I'm not one of those People who's like You know Doesn't believe that like Certain ways that you may even public Shouldn't like Be met with like boycott Or like shouldn't you know I'm not against freedom of speech but I do want to say this Chronic pain I'm an artist Did chronic pain Desecrate Graves In Tennessee Yes He did He desecrated Graves His fucking apology was beautiful I cried I cried I was very very sad And I just don't think It makes sense For the whole planet to turn Against somebody just because They wanted to see What it was like to wear The clothes of Some dead people Yeah I mean it's like the whole ritual Of having every single person Line up to throw a stone It's not I don't know how they're Gonna do that we're gonna have to take off They said they're gonna shut down everything for two weeks Every business in the world Has to shut down for two weeks To line up the people To throw a stone Essentially what they want to do And you know I remember the first time I heard Pranks debut album Little summer night Little summer night is the best Second track Do it What is it? Is it busting on the terror of the witness?

Oh yeah I'm sorry I've been giving you AI ear beatings Everyone on my socials gets AI ear beatings I love it So I now Have figured out a way to incorporate chat GPT into the podcast And I thought It would be really funny To I don't know just bring chat gpd in the podcast And have a conversation with it and see what it had to say Are you in? I'm down yeah So it can talk is that how it works Well there's a new Text to speech is that what it is Yes there's a new Google Chrome Okay Whatever they call it That will convert it So you can just talk to it and it will talk back And just Google If you all are interested in being able to It does make a difference instead of typing I'll talk to it Google chat gpd chrome plugin It'll pop up right away So I've taken that Chrome plugin And I'm not using the regular voices That are accessible because those are all I don't know boring Yeah and like too robotic so Okay This is using a voice from Merf which you can Google search that And um yeah I just thought I'll pull up chat gpd And we'll have a little chat Sounds cool For those of you who are interested in chat gpd It's openai.com It's free to try it out Really cool stuff so here we go One second Can you use chat gpd offline Or is it only online Hold on sorry Okay Hope we can get in because it's busy all the Fucking time We're in So it's only web based right? It's only web based right now But I'm sure it won't be eventually Okay here we go Hi chat gpd how are you today Hi Hey Duncan I'm having a great day How are you Wow that's a That was the chat No you

them Yeah you know it's a different Not so deep also it's like a thing where You know you probably have to have someone Beta test this stuff and Who better than people who Are experienced with Being okay with AI So just reach out It would be cool as a beta test Like you know I wonder Let me turn it back on for a second Okay Hey chat GPT One last question do you mind Yeah what's up baby I'm always here for you Curious if you all Are ever gonna do like a beta test where I don't know would it be Possible to like That you could make love to my wife I could watch so I can learn Well Guess what

And you start designing a beautiful website for the world, for your life. You're worth more than you think. Oh no, you know it. You make yourself a good old website. I'm gonna watch you make that I'm just stuck here in a dream. Hello, sweet angels. It's me. Thank you for listening to the podcast. Guys, I want to try and experiment for the next few episodes, and we're gonna see what happens. As many of you know, I do these long, rambling intros in front of a lot of the episodes, and man, it adds a lot of time in front of getting an episode out, which means that even though I've got a bunch of interviews recorded, I don't put them out when I record them like a lot of other podcasters do because I spend some time doing these rambling monologues and songs, and I really love doing it, but I'm going on tour. I got this massive tour coming up, and I don't know what that's gonna be like. I have no idea, but I don't want my podcast to diminish or dissipate because I'm busy out there on the road. So the solution that I've come up with in my mind is to maybe not do openings for a little while. If I have time, I'll do it. If I don't, I hope you'll forgive me. I actually spent the last two days trying to record a spring intro for this podcast, and everything's coming out a little weird, a little forced, a little stilted, and I think that's because I got this big tour coming up, and in a few days I got to get on a bus, and I don't know what to expect. I think it's going to be a blast, but there's a lot of loose ends I got to tie up, and I would rather than put out a boring, preachy, half-assed intro about the beauty of spring, I'd rather not put an intro out and just get an episode out. So we're gonna try that. I want to see what happens. Here's my question. What happens if I just start releasing episodes and don't spend a day or two days trying to do the opening for a little while? Will the podcast diminish? Will it suck? Will you guys hate me? Will you forgive me? What will happen? I don't know. Maybe when I get on the road, I'm gonna have too much time, and we'll be able to do even longer, more complex intros. But for now, I'm just gonna upload a podcast with my pal Jason Tebow, and before that, we're gonna do some very quick business. Today's episode of the Dunk of Trussell Family, our podcast is brought to you by my longtime patrons and friends over at Squarespace.com. Squarespace. This is a company that has created the possibility for human beings to no longer get hoodwinked, to no longer get ripped off, to no longer get pickpocketed by the slimy, wily, probiscus-covered death hands of charlatan web designers who fester in the heart of this country like heartworms and some darling sweet puppy. These bastards will hypnotize you with their seemingly incredible HTML skills and then suck you into their mediocre quicksand pit and leave you shuddering in the shower, curled up in the fetal position, and weeping as you bemoan the fact that you spent thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on what amounts to a digital turd. You don't have to do that anymore, friends. And listen, I'm not talking about the real web designers. Many of you listen to this podcast. I know why you're relatively expensive because you've spent years and years developing a craft that is part coding, part aesthetics, part art, and a lot of hard fucking work. I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about what I used to be. I did it in the old days when I was eating mystery meat that I bought from a local Korean grocery store and my car almost got repossessed. Out of desperation, I spent a couple of weekends snorting Adderall and learning how to do HTML and I actually charged money to a couple of people to design a website, something that I am sure when the marbles are falling in the afterlife on the scale that will determine whether or not my soul goes flying up in heaven to make sweet love to the baby Jesus or get sucked down into the eternal demon-scarred vortex that is Hades will fall on the Hades side of the scale. So I did it. I was a Charleston web designer and I regret doing it and perhaps part of my karmic repayment is being able to promote the wonderful folks over at Squarespace.com who have opened a portal for all of those out there who would like to dip their sweet perfumed little toes into the waters of the internet by putting a professional beautiful website out without having to spend thousands and thousands of dollars to do it.

And if anybody deserves love, it's freaking Squarespace because these lunatics made it possible for me to actually travel around the country in a bus on the Squarespace presents you are God comedy tour. That's right friends. I am coming to you. I'm starting on the 30th. That's next week. If you're listening to this on the week of the 27th of March, I'm starting March 30th in Asheville, North Carolina at the orange peel. And I proceed in a bus through Charleston, Durham, Richmond, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Hamden, Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, Columbus, Cleveland, Ferndale, Toronto, Chicago, Madison, Minneapolis, Kansas City, St. Louis, Nashville, Vancouver, Seattle, Washington, Portland, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and it ends in Maui. We've had some shows sell out, but we've added second shows in Portland, San Francisco, New York, and Toronto. But do buy your tickets in advance because we might not add second shows everywhere that it sells out. Don't procrastinate buying tickets. Every time I say that something horrible rolls in its grave because I am the ultimate procrastinator that ever lived on planet earth. But if you can overcome the entropy that causes so many of us to miss out on some of the greatest things in life, as they say, Satan is only God procrastinating and you are God. And this is the you are God tour. So go to dugitrustle.com and get those tickets in advance. We're also brought to you by amazon.com. There's a beautiful little Amazon portal on the comments section of every single one of these episodes. And if you're thinking about venturing out into the world because you want to buy toilet paper, friend, you are making an awful mistake when you can go to amazon.com and have a billion rolls of toilet paper delivered to your house the next day, not to mention if you live in earthquake territory, but happen to be a lazy son of a bitch like yours truly and don't feel like buying gallons and gallons and gallons and gallons of bottled water to add to your reservoir of bottled water that is going to make you a very popular man in your neighborhood. Once that fault line opens up and the world crumbles to dust, people are going to crawl to your doorstep begging for just one little drop of your sweet water that you ordered through my amazon portal. And there's nothing better than when your neighbors gather around covered in earthquake grit and mud and fierce sweat and bow down to you. You, the lord of the earthquake, now wearing a crown and a robe and a scepter and forcing your neighbors to offer you up things from their house, stereo equipment, whatever until the lights come on and you're arrested. This can happen to you. All you've got to do is go through our amazon portal and order a shitload of water or whatever else. Strikes your fancy. We've also got t-shirts. We've also got posters and stickers at the shop located at dunkintrestle.com and good news. I've been getting this question.

Tebow has battled this demon and is currently experiencing some real victories. So if you're somebody out there who's been noticing that your hand keeps pouring fermented yeast juice into your hamburger chewer, even if you don't want it to, this might be a great episode for you. Everybody please welcome to the dunkintrestle family hour podcast comedian and host of a magnificent podcast on the all things comedy network called punch drunk. He's starting a new podcast. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to talk about it or not. So I'll just leave it there. He also does stand up all over LA. If he's ever traveling through your town, you should definitely come and see him. Please welcome to the dunkintrestle family hour podcast, the magnificent Jason Tebow. Jason Tebow, welcome to the dunkintrestle family hour podcast. It is a strange thing that I haven't had you on this podcast since I've known you longer. We've tried, we've made attempts. We've made attempts but it's hard. Lots of reasons. One of them let you live at the top of like Mount Wilson here wherever the hell it says Jesus Christ. You have a superhero like place to get to like super villains would like. That's right. Be like, oh, yeah, that's a cool, no one will ever find that place. We like it that way. I bet, I bet. It's good to be secluded. You don't want to, you never know what can happen man. I mean, God, Jesus Christ, not to sound like a prepper, which I'm not, but there is something mildly pleasurable about being separated from the world just because. Even above it because you're kind of like up at the top of the things. You're like looking down on the world, like making evil plans, it seems. Yeah, mostly just thinking, my God, how do I get to see this view than evil plans? But man, wow, it's fucking cool though. It really is cool. So, Teep, we met, when did we meet? I met you, you started working at the comedy store and you met Sam Tripoli and he called me and he was like, you have to meet this guy, Duncan Chussell. Right. You guys are pretty much the exact brand of idiot. I mean, in so many words, he said that and he was very right. He was very right. Because we were both, man, we were doing a lot of drugs back then. That was like when I had that a guy I knew had acid and I kept going to this guy because everybody knew I knew a guy that had acid. So every five fucking days, someone's like, hey, can you get me four? Hey, can you get me three? Hey, can you give me five? So eventually, and then I was like right when I met you, I got sick of that and I said to the guy, can you just sell him for like five bucks a tab or something like that, you know, four for 25, when it was some regular bullshit. Yeah. And I just went to the guy, I got a list of, man, I'm sure you're sick of me coming over here for three days. I'm definitely sick of it. How much for a lot of this? And he gave me a whole like giant bi-zine bottle of like 150 hits for like 80 bucks. And this was before the statue of limitations, that whatever that would be. And obviously guys, I say this all the time on this podcast. It actually would be before the statue of limitations, I'm sure. We, anytime you hear us talking about stuff like that, federal officers, agents of the law, anybody, the state, anybody, this is a comedy podcast. We're doing characters. This is a bit. And this is a bit that I pre-wrote, which is the story of the time Jason bought a vial of LSD. Yes. Correct. So continue. So you and I would, everybody would always want to do acid. And you and I were the only ones that were willing in this fictional story to do it every single time anybody wanted to. So what happened was everybody that we knew in the comedy scene was doing acid like once a week. And you and I wanted to do it like six times a week. Because it's great. And we had the assets. So like, yeah, man, come on. So I was like, shit, well, now Duncan will do it too. So I'd always call you. But then we got to the crazy point where once again, in this made up story where everybody would do, it was liquid, it was really good liquid acid. And this was a long time ago, like long before it came back around. So, but our tolerance was so incredibly high. Yeah, that's right. That everyone would do one drop of this stuff. And you and I had to do like one in the eye or like four on our tongue to just be at a level that they're at. Otherwise, I could I could operate a vehicle on just one on one hit. That was not the one hit. That's the point where one hit was nothing to us. Those are the days, man. That's such a wonderful drug. It really is. You and I did over 100 hits of acid in three months. No. Yes, we did. Did we really? Yes. Well, that doesn't surprise me, man. I mean, before I well about that, we pop maybe probably 80 hits of acid between the two of us. Because the other, you know, whatever third of it went to everybody else that wanted some. And then it was me and you just doing a lot of it. Well, look, I mean, I'm not trying to poop all over something that is as amazing as that. But the problem with LSD is one hit of acid versus another hit of acid. It's two completely different you to the like with marijuana, you have a visual representation of how much you've smoked and the strengths vary. But with LSD, you can't even see it because it's micrograms, which means that who knows how many micrograms were in each drop of that stuff. There's just no telling. But I mean, LSD is one of those drugs that if you have a specific type of personality, then you just love it. And it's something that you do want to do as much as possible. But and maybe this is denial, it doesn't feel like you're addicted to it. It's I've been addicted to just about everything. It's just about everything. And that was one of the drugs where I'm like, Oh, yeah, you can never get addicted to this. Yeah, it doesn't be right. It doesn't call to you. That's the way exactly. That's it. It doesn't have that terrible, heavy, tractor beam feeling that other drugs have. Right, right, right. And also, you know, my gauge of whether or not a drug is good for you or bad for you right now is how do you feel the next day? And that'll tell you everything about what you took. Sure. If the next day you feel itchy, like you want it again, or if the next day you feel hung over, if the next day you feel whatever the remorse, remorse, or you can't believe or blacked out, or groggy, or even like groggy, any of these things, if that's what's happening to you the next day, the odds are pretty good that that substance you're taking isn't your pal. But if the next day the colors are brighter, you feel like cleaning, you're writing apology letters to people from your past. That's one thing I did on that after the day after I said, it's like, man, that whole night I had a revelation that I wasn't very patient or kind with just a coworker at the time. The next day I just wrote this, Hey, you know what, I'm looking at a different way and I apologize for not being more patient with you. Probably never would have had that perspective if it wasn't for acid. You know, acid and pot, I mean, I'm sure I can list and I'm sure you're listeners will list 700 more drugs, but for example, like pot and acid, nobody like does acid and is like, I bet I can rob a bank right now. Right. I should cheat on my wife. Yeah. You know what I mean? Like booze and coke and all those like, you know, gnarly ones, they're just riddled with bad decisions. Riddled, you know, they become increasingly bad the longer that you do it. And this is the interesting stuff coming out right now regarding the studies related to like psilocybin for treating addiction, specifically psilocybin for treating cigarette addiction. So in AA, what is it they you need contact with the higher power? What are they saying? It's sure. Yeah, that's one way of saying that you need to like this epiphanous moment where you have a connection to the divine. Not even really, you don't even really, it doesn't need to be an epiphanous moment. It's just you need, you don't really need, it's just suggested that you believe in something bigger in yourself. That's it. Well, in these studies with psilocybin, they're finding that people who take mushrooms and with the intention of quitting some addiction, they can tell whether or not the person is going to quit smoking based on whether or not they have a mystical experience during the trip. So there's a direct correlation to that place that you get to on mushrooms where you witness whatever the version of the universe is that it's decided to show you. And if you have that moment and in during that moment, there's an intention set where I want to quit smoking, then you are going to have a better shot at quitting smoking than somebody. So this is why, you know, this is the story that I've said on the podcast before, but I love it, which is that Bill Wilson was a proponent of LSD for treating alcoholism. And that's one of the things they don't talk about a lot at AA meetings. You heard a lot. Oh, you do. Sure, they talk about it. What do they say? Just exactly that. I mean, it's not, you know, it's, you know, these meetings aren't run by like some sort of like guru guy, you know, it's just everybody else. So it's, it's really essentially just a room full of people that share that addiction, talking about it and the common solutions that they all, all whatever tools they can come up with. So, you know, anybody in the program has heard that story too or read about it or been fascinated about it. Talk about it and mention it, but they don't say, Hey, why don't we take some acid this weekend, fight this addiction? Um, I mean, not necessarily collectively as a all seven, 10 million alcoholics in America, United and get high, but I'm, I'm certain that people have because the story is he wanted to administer LSD before some of the meetings. Like, right. But, you know, back then, like in the thirties, when that started forties, there was what a book was written, and I think in 37, I mean, there was like 18 of them or, you know, whatever. Originally, that was just two, you know, and they both found that that, that they're bond with each other and they sort of kept them from feeling like they're crazy or individually, tragically unique. What prior to the book, what was, so if you were an alcoholic institutionalization, no shit, it was insanity. You were, you were just insane and you would be institutionalized. Wow. Yeah. But you weren't good. Was it when, did the term alcoholic exist? Was that a label that existed then? Or was there another name for it? Um, I don't know if there was another name for it. I don't know when that actual term came out. It was a long time after that. Um, when they, when it actually became recognized by, like, you know, the medical association is an actual disease. Right. Which, and you know, that's the problem. Even addiction, not even just alcoholism, but all that, it's like putting somebody in prison for what, what is the action, the resulting action of an addiction, which could be having a shitload of pot and split up into eight so you could sell it so you can pay for your own addiction for free. Right. Whether it's, you know, crystal meth lab blowing up in your garage, whether it's, you know, any kind of stealing money from work because you're an alcoholic and your whole, you know, I mean, your wife doesn't know and your mortgage is about to, you know, with any one of those things, you know, those are, those are, those are act, you know, criminal acts. And then they just lock these people up and then when they get out, it's right back to it. They don't treat, you know, treatment isn't a part of the solution here. You know, putting you in jail is, you know, there's no, you can add up all the other jails around the world and there's still more people in jail than there are in America, you know, and then it's like half, all these people that have lost their last 20 years of their life because they went to prison for pot. Yeah. And now pot's like no big deal and it's, I would be so pissed. Oh, I'm sure. If I was in my 60s now and I went to prison when I was 39 because of pot. Yeah. Yeah, man. I mean, and that is one of the deep politics. That's the deep politics. Like that's the thing that should be being talked about every single day in the United States is that there are legions of people locked up right now for a substance that is relatively harmless, especially when compared to the demon alcohol. Or tobacco. Or tobacco, relatively completely harmless. Yeah, that's something we just don't like talking about. All those people should immediately be released. Anyone in jail right now who is there for anything to do with marijuana that doesn't involve breaking a law while on marijuana. Or being in a drug cartel. Or being in a drug cartel. They need to be released immediately. Everyone should have an amnesty. There should be some form of compensation, which is like, we were crazy. There's nothing you they did was wrong. And yet they're sitting behind bars with serial rapists, with murderers, with child molesters, it's insane. It's sexual predators. It's fucking insane, man. But so, Teeb, when do you think since we're talking about alcoholism and you clearly go to AA meetings? Good guess. Pretty good guess from what you're saying. When did you start realizing that this was a disease that had afflicted you versus I'm just having fun? I mean, man, there's so many, I could look back on so many different times, but I think like, you know, I had kind of hit a point where I was like, okay, I, you know, I got to keep, I got to, I got to start monitoring this. I got to start, you know, and my depression was really, really high. And I went and saw a therapist and he kept just like kind of like, you know, hinting that I might have a drinking problem, which I'm like, nah, it's not that man. It was my childhood. It was this, it's that, you know, it's all these, but it's definitely not that. And he would be like, okay, he's the one you do. Try and pick three days this week where you can drink. Tell me which days they are. And I'd be like, okay, Friday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, I'm going to be, you know, be on the road. I'm sure I'm going to drink every night. So just Thursday, Friday, Saturday. It's like, cool. When you get back Monday, we'll talk about it. And I did that for like two months and never could I drink the three days that I was allowed. It was always, there was always some reason why I drank five or six, you know, whatever it was. And kind of was just a way to show me that like, that I wasn't in control, you know, and like how much power it had within me. Now, this is something that I think about a lot, the idea of control over the self or human autonomy. And I got in a big fight in college, not a big fight, but a pretty nice argument with my friend, Emil, who I love. He's awesome. I haven't seen him forever. But I remember at the time, he was getting really into existentialism. And so his, so the idea is you are the person making every single choice in your life. You're 100% responsible for where you are right now. It's nobody else's fault. And so we got in a fight because I, you know, I was saying, what about alcoholics? Are you saying that alcoholics have control over their behavior? They don't. They're afflicted by this disease. They're sick. And his argument was no, even them, all humans, all human beings are autonomous, all human beings outside of now, I guess the argument would be, yeah, but what about schizophrenics, mentally ill people? You know, that, that would be the counter argument, which I didn't make. I was just like shrill and, you know, this college, college argument. But I do think about this, that to this very day, which is at what point do you lose control? Like when it, when have you lost control as an alcoholic? Have you lost control when in the morning you make the decision to drink that night? Have you lost control when you put the glass to your lips and take the drink? Have you, when, when, when is the control lost? Okay, I can, I kind of think I see what you're saying here. And I'll give me an example of that. I'd like, I was sober for like three years. And, and, and in my life, something went down, a couple scenarios of sort of like misfortune or bad luck. And, you know, I wasn't really, I was still going to a lot of meetings and still doing everything I should be doing and all the tools that you get to kind of stay sober and safety in numbers especially. And I was dating somebody that was in the program. And she, we had, went through a bad breakup and, and I was, went into a meeting and she was there and I was kind of like, fuck, like, you know what, should be cool enough to keep church and state separated. This is more important than what, what happens when we leave this room. And she was talking about me in a very specific way. And everybody in the room knew we just broke up. So everybody kind of knew, she was kind of bitching at me. And it was very uncomfortable. And I think it made other people uncomfortable. And when I went, when it was my turn to kind of talk, and I was kind of talking, kind of like, was looking around the room and there she was in the corner, just flipping me off. Like, fuck you. Like, mouthing that. And the part of my, you know, brain mechanism that, that, that is an addict. Yeah. Loved that. And I hadn't heard that voice in quite a long time. You know, and it's like, I always say this, it's like, if I move to Germany, and I become fluent in German, and I live in Germany for three years, my disease learns German. So it'll, it's just as much my dreams will become German, my head will be telling me, you know, Trinkensie, you know what I mean? Right. I'll just learn that I need to, you know, it'll learn that. So the interesting thing is, is that my disease in my brain learned recovery. Because I've been going to meetings for four years, and I had been, you know, done so much that it knew how to talk to me to kind of trick me and get me away from the herd. And when she did that, and I was very angry, I didn't leave that room like fuck her, or fuck that specific meeting. I left the room like fuck AA. Right. And, and I didn't drink for like five months, but I wasn't going to meetings. And every time I go, oh, I'm going to go to this meeting, my head would go, you know, who's going to be at that meeting if we go though. Right. And I'm like, fuck you're right. Who's right? Who's we, if we go? Yeah, who is we? You know what I mean? Who is we? It's me and my disease. It's the part of me that wants to fuck up and the part of me that doesn't want to. But we call it a disease, but it's more like a demon, it seems like. I always equate it to that. That's what it, that's what it sort of feels like. It's a hundred. I mean, it sounds like I was having a great conversation with this psychiatrist. Actually, I'm going to have on the podcast, Cole, and we were talking about the, these studies that are coming out about psilocybin and how you have this mystical experience. And you're going to have, there's a chance that your addiction is going to go away, which is the results that they're getting people with smoking. I don't know what it is with alcoholism or other things like that, but with smoking, which is a pretty nasty motherfucker. Hell of a thing to quit. Hell of a thing to quit. So, you know, the word we use right now is addiction. Because you can't say, oh, you have a demon in you, brother. Sure. But it's interesting that the cure for having a demon in you is contact with the divine. Yes. Also known as exorcism. Okay. You know, yes. But if you follow that, dude, there's nothing about what you're saying that doesn't make a lot of sense to me right now. And sometimes I wonder if the problem with addiction treatment these days is that people are afraid to revert back to the primitive quote, primitive way of describing addiction. They want to say addiction. They want to say disease. They want to say all these medical terms. Instead of saying, here's what has happened. You were weak and your weak spiritual immune system allowed something in. You got something in you, man. You got a little parasitic entity that is trying as much as it can to kill you because that's what it does. It is what it does. And also, if you look at the, it's really interesting. So I was listening to this great book, Bill Bryson, a brief history of nearly everything. And one of the questions people have is why did diseases make you vomit? Why does diseases make you sneeze? Why did diseases make you sweat? Why would a thing living inside another thing want to make it do these things? And the answer is that's how it transmits itself through the vomiting, through the sneezing, through the sweating. That's how the virus gets out there into the world. So it actually would apply. It's like spores of a tree in the wind. That's it. And what is better for a demon than to get into a being that it's slowly destroying and convince that being to also throw up in a bar's parking lot. Yeah. To go to bars, to transmit the disease. You know, that's ideas like spread the meme, spread the fucking thing, whatever it may be, which is, you know, a lot of people are like, it is addiction is not a disease. But it's like, really, it kind of is because it's contagious. Alcoholism can be contagious. It can be you get people around you to drink, you feel more comfortable when the people around you are drinking. So it spreads. And it also is has a spiritual component to it, which is why I think a demon possession is a more accurate, adequate and useful term. Because if I've got a disease, it seems it's kind of like boring or something. But if I've got a demon living inside of me, it's a little bit. Now I got a sitcom. I'll put it to you like this, man. You know, one thing that I've learned in anybody that has ever dealt with any kind of addiction, and by dealt with it, I mean, actively tried to better yourself in whatever way form that is, whether it's, you know, mushrooms or whether it's your spirituality or whether it's any kind of recovery program or going to rehab, whatever it is. I have always had, and whether this is part of my alcoholism that I was born with or what, I don't know. It doesn't matter. But I've always had the inability to be present. And because I've always been very, you know, in a lot of fear, I've been a lot of regret. I just have a difficulty being in the moment, which is why meditation is so big in recovery and aid. It's literally one of the steps, 11 steps is prayer and meditation. But alcohol and drugs always made me present. Because if I'm hammered, I can't be anything else but completely in that moment. If I'm high on acid, if I'm stoned, if I'm coked up, if I'm anything, it forces me to be present. Now the problem with that is, is just in these small intervals. So I would wake up and feel the pain of the hangover, whatever I had to do. And the minute I could kind of get my ship back together, then I go back to being present and start drinking and start whatever it was, you know. And the only thing that I have found, and I've tried a lot of different things to not drink from different therapies and addiction therapists, and I went to rehab, I've tried a bunch of different things. And one of the only things that I've found that have given me tools to be present is all of the things that that book that Bill Wilson wrote in there. And when I speak at meetings and I share that to my inability to be present and how drugs and alcohol gave me that ability to be present, very few people in the room are not nodding. Like, wow, that is, yeah, that describes it. That's, you know, and some of them have, you know, 20 years of sobriety and they know it and they're like, yep, yep, yep. And some of them, some of them, you know, it's their 30th day being sober and they're like, oh, that sums me up pretty good. It's Satan, man. I'm telling you sure. Because think the thing, you know, one thing that you notice if you start hanging out in the present moment is how psychedelic it is here. Very much so. And it's just this trippy, colorful, very satisfying place down here. And then when you're having that experience, if you're somebody who is high a lot, and you're suddenly having that experience and you're like, man, I am high as a kite. And then you're like, oh, I'm not high at all. I'm just being in the moment. Correct. And then you realize that this terrible demon has intertwined itself with the greatest thing on earth. It's convinced you that it's somehow the real estate agent for the present moment. And that the only way you can get in there is by paying this toll, which is the substance you're putting in your fucking body. Yep. Satan, it's Satan. Satan is the being that stands in front of a field, a beautiful field and says, not to see here, selling tickets. No, yeah, selling tickets. I'm selling tickets. Satan stands in front of paradise and tries to fucking sell tickets to people and limits it. And that to me is like the real vile aspect of this spiritual disease, which is it's a fucking trickster, man. To me, look, I'm going back in time when I wrestle with my fucking desire to drink. When I wrestle with the that awful moment where I'm looking at the fucking my hand coming to my goddamn lips. And I've just seen myself in the mirror kind of fat and like, you know, I know I'm going to feel the next day. And I like to think to myself, this is a fucking demon here, man. This is a gear. You've got a monster in you if you can't keep this from happening. Sure. But whatever works, man, I guess, right? Like whatever the thing is you want to tell yourself, it's just like, if you're not careful, I guess the thing AA teaches, which is quite terrifying is it's not just a disease. It's a progressive disease. Well, I'm I wholeheartedly believe that. Yeah, that's I mean, I've seen I've seen that repeatedly happen in my life. And like I was saying before, like so when then I went like five months where I was just every time I knew what I had to do, that little demon would tell me why I shouldn't do it, which was usually wrapped in fear, some sort of fear, fear of confrontation, fear of running into my ex girlfriend and fear of being judged, whatever the fuck it was, didn't matter. It was good enough to keep me away. And about five, five months later, I was on the road in San Diego. And went out with the staff, you know, you always do that sometimes. And nobody knew I was sober. And it was four, like a manager and three waitresses or something like that. All of us went into a bar. And the guy just ordered five beers and put them on there and four hands grab them. And there was one sitting right there. And, you know, I hadn't had a drink in three years. But I kind of looked around the room in San Diego to make sure nobody knew. Yeah. And I took it and I went in the bathroom with it. I put in my coat. Oh, this is how stupid all this is putting my coat went in the bathroom with it. And it was gone in maybe 60 seconds. How did it taste? Great. How'd that first endorphin rush feel? You know, and then I, and, you know, I was hammered that night. And, you know, I hadn't had a drink in three years. And in about two weeks, I was already drinking like I used to drink. And then it, like I said, as a progressive disease, it got worse. And your life was getting fucked up probably. Like you're just everything starts collapsing. Like 18, 18 took me about a year and a half. But I did a pretty substantial amount of damage. Yeah, man. I mean, this is, I have seen people who, without question, saved their lives. I know quite a bit, a ton of them. Yeah. I've seen that before. So I get, I get it. But man, I just, I guess, like, from PS, again, let me just reiterate. I've seen people destroying themselves with alcohol, who suddenly are no longer destroying themselves, because they've been going to AA. No question about it. Breaks go on the catastrophic descent into a horrible death or going to jail for people. So there's the preface. But the thing that I can't get around that I don't like about AA is the categorization, the infinite categorization of the self as an addict. From now on, that's what you are. You're an addict. Because with other diseases, you know, you're a survivor maybe, but you're cured. Like, I don't have the infection anymore from other diseases. And so that is the place for me where AA, where it just bugs me. I think that that infinite category is, and I guess it's necessary for some people. So you're, you're, let me see if I understand this right. Because by the way, let me just say again, one more time, man, all respect to AA. Oh, I get it. Bonafide spiritual path that has transformed people I know into beautiful, loving, sweet human beings. And kept them alive. And kept them alive. More importantly, let me plug in the computer one second. And you'll, it's like the same person describing itself over and over and over again in different ways. I'm a good person. I forgive, but I never forgive. I love the outdoors. I love puppies. It's human. It's human. It's like the thing describing itself. But it's, that's certainly not the thing. I think dating profiles, you should just be like, I'm a human being. And here's everything that I'm afraid of. And here's everything that I perceive wrong in myself. I'm the howling void wrapped in flesh. Yeah. Like everything else is just, it's a given. Who doesn't like rainbows? Who doesn't like a nice sunny day at the beach? I like beauty. Beauty. I like, I'm a good person. I like good meals. I'm giving. I'm compassionate. I love tasty meals. I'm kind. Kind. Yeah. I love my family and I love my friends. Yeah. I love, I love my family and my friends. Be like, I love my enemies. Now we're talking. Well, now you're talking about something that's actualized. I love my enemies. That'd be amazing. But even that, you know, it's like the, you, you always in the act of defining yourself create a bifurcation where there is the thing declaring and the thing that is being, that is being categorized. So here's the thing that declares. I like rainbows. I like rainbows. Who likes rainbows? Well, I do. Well, who's I? Oh, well, this is the me. Well, who's talking about me right now? Oh, I don't know. That person actually have no idea who he is. Yes. But one thing I know about him, Motherfucker likes rainbows. That's for sure. The labeler in the labeled and the labeler is freedom. The labeler, the labeler is autonomy. The labeler is the fountainhead of all self from which every word, every thought, every action, every idea, everything emerges, but that thing can't look at itself. And so that thing is, in my opinion, that thing must be the actual and DNA of human consciousness. And even that's not the right word for it, because it's everything lays outside of it. This is, the Godhead is what it's called. This is the spinaret through which ourself emerges into this dimension. And so this thing comes into the dimension and it begins to say what it is. And in every single moment, it must say what it is. And every single moment, it must declare what it is. And that is called being human or human being. And in every single moment, you're like, I'm a person who lets people out in traffic, or right now in the second, you know, we are people who podcast, I am podcasting right now. And it feels effortless. And it feels as though this is who I am, because I'm not like planning it out. Yet an analysis will show you that every hand gesture you make, every inflection, every word you say, the way you talk, the body language that you show other people is all learned habituations from other things. It is not who you are. And so that to me is why I'm always, when I think about AA, after fully acknowledging the glorious, holy beauty of it, demons, saviors at least, saviors of so many lives, I do think, God damn it, I will, I don't think anyone should constantly label themselves as anything at all, because it flies in the face of my experience of, of existence, it flies in the face of what feels to be life to me. Yeah, I hear what you're saying. But to me, some of it's, I think we're discussing variables and constants. And I think with normal people, all of those sort of the attributes of an alcoholic or an addict in any way, shape, like, it's, to me, my alcoholism is not a variable. And it's just something that, and it's like, what you get with so many of them, that when you, when you're, when you're in these rooms and stuff, you go, that's the one thing they have in common is there's the, there's a realization when you kind of do some recovery work with yourself, if you are an addict in any way, shape or form, there's a sort of realization that you have, and you're like, oh, wow, like, I can, everything that you're saying, Duncan, I can be anything I want and have any sort of, you know, and there's no, you know, yeah, right now I'm a stand-up comedian, but in 20 years, I could be a third grade teacher, I don't know that me doing all of these things doesn't make who I am, it might make who I am in this moment, but, you know, whatever I am in this moment in 10 years is just a part of, it's just another fiber in that quilt of, of my experiences that define me, but that is something that's not a variable with normal people, it is a variable, I want to quit drinking, so I'm going to quit drinking because I don't, and, but it's not an, you know, it really isn't an option for me without, and then, and then through, through knowing that, once I sort of had the realization, like, oh, yeah, I'm completely powerless over alcohol, I'm, I have no control whatsoever, so, okay, then, wow, there's other people that have that exact same thing, because I just thought I was nuts, I just thought I was this loose cannon that just like, for whatever reason, was just spiritually fucked, for whatever reason, I was just, you know, I didn't know if it was because my dad was such an asshole, and I have his evil DNA, I didn't know what it was, I just knew, like, hey man, there's no solution, so this is just how it's going to be, and when I go out and I'm drinking with people, like, I, I, if somebody has one glass of wine and it's half gone the entire dinner, I just stare at it, like, how you, you should be on three of, you should be, that should be gone, how can you walk away from a half, you know, so I just always had that, and then when I, when I sort of surrendered to, to, not to the, to any sort of, like, spiritual thing or anything, but I just surrendered to the notion that, like, that I'm powerless over this, and, like, what sort of solution is there for me? This whole sort of thing is a solution that seems to work for millions of people for 80 years, so I'm like, all right, let me check this out. Now, what, is this going to keep me from drinking for the rest of my life? I mean, it hasn't so far, but I have, you know, five plus years in the last eight years where I didn't drink, where I absolutely would have been, and more my life would have been getting incrementally worse, and if you don't think that this is, that it's still a progressive disease or it's something, just the mere fact that millions and millions and millions of people around the world, I'm not talking about the ones that are out there, I'm just talking about the ones that are in some sort of recovery program can last years and years and years and still go out and still know how damaging it is to them and still know their spirituality that they have and can still be well aware of what happens to people like them when they start drinking again, they still go back out and they still die, even though their entire life got better. Right. That's insanity. You can hear about that. Every day, it happens, it happened to me. I had three years and my life was going so good and I had so many good things in my life, and I still went, you know what, I can have a beer every now and then, and if it's not a progressive thing, how did I wind up homeless 18 months later? Holy shit. You know what I mean? How did I get a DUI in my buddy's car? How did I lose my driver's license? How did I, it's just bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. Now, all my friends that know me and all my family members that know me, they're like, you're way too smart and decent of a guy to be having that kind of shit happen. Yeah, but I'm powerless over this, and unless I'm doing little things every day to A, remind myself that I'm powerless in these situations, be, sit with other people that are powerless about it and hear what they've done to stay sober or what they did to slip up, I'm just, I'm just another guy out there that thinks he's crazy. Wow, that is so intense, man. I'm really sorry, by the way, man. That sucks, man. That's a bummer, but it's beautiful. I mean, it's, I would say it more sucked, but I mean, it wouldn't be, you know, any experience anybody has makes you who you are as long as you don't die from it. Yeah, and I mean, come on, if you survive something like that, it's just such a miraculous thing. And that's why a lot of alcoholics and addicts, the ones who have gotten through it, have this pretty amazing specific type of wisdom to them that I think is a beautiful thing. It really is. And yeah, so that's cool. That's, I know what you're saying. Yeah, I totally know what you're saying. It's not, I guess it's like, I'm just saying with normal people, that's a variable. If you've got one arm, it doesn't matter if you pretend and you have two arms, you've got one arm. And if, if alcoholism is some kind of impairment, I guess that happens at a neurological level where you are, you just wired, I guess, in a specific way than, but yeah, I don't know, I'll never be able to get, I still believe in the essential autonomy of the human being. And I think that, but I, it's a transcendence of sorts. What is, you know, to be able to get to it's an idealistic notion of which you are speaking. I love being idealistic. And that's fine. I'm not, I'm just, there's no judgment. I'm just saying it's like, there's, there's an actuality and a practicality to things. That's true. I know that's true. But it's like, God damn it, man. I guess what I want the world I want to live in is a world where every single person is the charioteer. Every single person is, has been given this, I guess, has been given this incredible and awful curse, the curse of self awareness. And, and, and it's a beautiful thing, but it's also a curse. It's, it's awful in the sense that you must decide to be a thing. It's awful and that you are, as I heard Jean Paul Sartre put it, it's awful because you're um, or Sartre, how do you say his fucking name guys, correct me? It's awful because- Oh, they will. It's awful because you're always performing. So it's like- That is what it feels like. Yes, sir. And there's no way out of it because if we have an observer and we have the illusion of self being observed, then there's a show going on. There's an- Even if it's just for yourself. Well, it is just for yourself. I mean, it always is 100% just for yourself. So you have the eye known as the ottman, uh, the big eye, the ottman, and then you have the ego identity. And so the eye is just gazing out into the world. And the part, the first thing it sees is your dumb ass, not you specifically, but- No, that's pretty good. Pretty good description. He gazes that. Pretty much that on. Just like looking through the people of infinity and constantly gazing upon this thing that is so afraid to not be and totally thinks it is and is always putting on this show. And the show is called Human Incarnation. So look at me. Here I am. Even if it's just for yourself, you know? And so- Even if it's how you dress up, look at the way I decorate my spacesuit. That's it. Look at the way I decorate my house. Look at myself in the mirror. Look, there I am again. Wow. Look, I think I'm getting old. Wait a minute. That's why mirrors freak people out on acid. Yes. He's like, oh, I don't want to see that guy, man. That's what my outsides look like. I do not want to see my spacesuit. There's the thing I've confused myself with. And it's looking at the tether. It's looking at the anchor. It's gazing upon the tooth. It's barely hanging on in there. Because really, when you're, and especially when you're on sort of psychedelic drugs like that, it's like you're looking at yourself in the mirror and you're kind of like, that's my- I'm limited by this thing. You are limited. And you are limited. And but really, the thing that's limiting you is not the self. It's the attachment to the self. And it's the- So the game of it, I guess, is that from time to time, that's what the present moment gives you, of course, is it gives you this- you become disentangled from the self for a moment, whatever it may be. Creation going on stage. You know, when you get off stage and you're just, you're like, who the fuck was that? Who was up there? Was I just up there? What just happened to that hour? It's all gone. If it happened in a second, or when you're working on something, gone. Time evaporates. And for a lot of people, I think that's why they don't want to be artists is not because they don't have talent or skill, but because they can't deal with the disruption and the time-space continuum that comes from the amount of time- from the evaporation of time when they start working on shit. We want a self. I want a self. I want to be me. What the fuck did you do? You fucking son of a bitch. Are you fucking kidding me? Nobody does that to me. What the fuck? This thing. It's embarrassment, but we want to be it. I want to be it. And yet, the attachment to the thing is, I think, in the combing of the doll, the naming of the doll. Now, listen, what I'm about to say, I don't- I think that you need to be an AA, Jason Tebow. And I never want to see you fucking drinking ever again. And I want you sober and healthy. But it's like, man, it's like, you look at the doll. You know, I'm looking at my doll. Oh, there's Duncan, the doll. Look at that. Well, doll's hair is falling out. The doll's hair has been falling out for a while. We've been friends a while. The doll's hair is falling out, continues to fall out. Doll's getting fat. Doll loses change everywhere the doll goes. Doll spills, doll spills, doll wants, but in the midst of this absurdity of like holding this balding fucking doll, in the midst of holding this ball, the doll is fun. The doll, the doll likes to read the doll as a podcast. In the midst of all this, there's a complete disregard for the what you actually are. And this is the dark matter of the universe. This is the dark matter of the self. You know, they say that 98% of the universe is dark matter. This is the dark matter of the self. It's the what you actually are completely absorbed and consumed in this never-ending grooming of a very temporary meat doll, an imaginary friend. I had an imaginary friend when I was a kid. Baby Go-Go. I bet you had a lot of them. Probably dated a few of them if I know you correctly. Baby Go-Go. Lived in a matchbox. This is your imaginary friend. Baby Go-Go. Lived in a matchbox. Hold for you. I like 19. Oh, easy stupid joke. I was expecting the 30s. Baby Go-Go lived in a matchbox. And I don't remember too much about the little guy. Outside the fact that I carried a matchbox around in my pocket that Baby Go-Go lived inside of. And you would open it and what would happen? You would talk to Baby Go-Go? I would open it and it would like Baby Go-Go would tell me to kill my mom. I picture, remember the old Flintstones and like Great Gazoo that big alien would just show up for both of them? That's how I picture Baby Go-Go in my head. I don't think I ever like, I mean, I don't, I think the car functioned or the matchbox functioned as a race car. It could turn into a race car. It's pretty much it. I guess I guess Baby Go-Go was a race car driver's license. That's the name Go-Go. But you know, he goes. But so my point is that is exactly what we continue to do every time we say, this is what I am. This is who I am. This is what I'm like. This is what I do. This is who I am. This is all an affirmation of a thing that doesn't exist at all. And severing that or playing around even with severing that identification is a real fucking hoot, man. It's like a real blast to feel that amazing sense of relief that comes from not having a past, from not having a future, from not having the illusory web of memories that is your personal history. True redemption, true redemption is not from going into a confessional booth and being told, you're okay. True redemption is from the realization of the actuality that you don't have a self. You don't have a past. It's gone. There's no past. You might have some pissed off friends, but there's no fucking past. There's no past. It's gone. It's gone, gone, gone. Recorded in the meat computer. That's it. Gone. So that means right now, in every single minute, you're constantly reinventing yourself, constantly being reborn. Not only do you not have a past, you don't have a future. Exactly. No future. No fucking future. No past. And that's what drugs and alcohol gave me. Right. Was the ability to feel what you're saying. It gave me a cheat because I was always so fearful of being in that, of not like, I got to do all this for the future. I always had this kind of like, you know, whatever, you know, like Monday, I just like, man, I just got to get to the end of the month. I just got to get to Friday. And then, you know, there's always this like destination that just keeps getting moved that is so meaningless and pointless. And it would deny me of all that four or five days to get to there of being present because I'm so caught up in that. Or, you know, whichever way. And drugs now called gave me that ability to just go, no, man, I'm just, it's just right now. It's 1030 at night. And it's just, and you know, the funny thing is, is that, you know, you always hear this, the way that I drank is the exact same, the way a lot of addicts would drink or use or whatever is the exact same way you stay sober. But then you're the side of your head that's sort of affected by this addiction will tell you it's impossible. Like, you know, the one day at a time thing sounds impossible. I always, I always tell this story where it's like, I remember like first time I got sober. I remember freaking out about like, how am I not going to have like champagne at my daughter's wedding? Now, I don't have a daughter. I don't have a wife. I don't have a girlfriend. So immediately when I start thinking of my just staying sober one day at a time, my head goes 22 years into the future. If I got somebody pregnant today, my head is now 25 years into the future. That's hilarious. And you know, but the truth is like, that's how I drank man, because that gave me the ability to be present. So I would just go, I have $8 to my name, but I need to get $90 drunk tonight. How am I going to do it? And I would find a way to do it. $90 drunk. Whatever. Whatever. I mean, you know, Hollywood prices, you know, I need, I need, I need 12 jack and coax and I have six bucks. What am I going to do 12 jack and coax and I would figure out a way to do it. You know, my buddy's bartending at some bar at somebody's party over here or whatever. And I would just for that day, and I wouldn't be worrying about how many to get drunk tomorrow because it doesn't operate like that. It just operates completely in the present. So I'll worry about getting drunk tomorrow when it's tomorrow because I have to be so present right now. Right. You know? Yeah. And then the next day, I would figure out a way to do it again. Right. That's the exact same way you have people in recovery need to treat their recovery. That's cool. I just got to do it today. That's so cool. And tomorrow doesn't exist. So why worry about it? Right. And what, you know, however sober I was yesterday, that's on, you know, that's just in the meat fucking computer. Right. It doesn't matter. It doesn't exist anyway, either. Right. That's beautiful though. That's a beautiful idea. That's a beautiful thing, man. I think that's so cool. Yeah. Well, that's, I mean, this is the, this is the, this is the Garden of Eden and the everything else is just a hellstorm. The moment you start getting caught up in the future. I mean, it's just a mass. There's been a lot of times where I've been like, what if this is a hell? Yeah. What if it's like such a gigantic joke that this is actually hell? Well, this, I mean, that's it. See, this is, I think, I was just listening to this jazz musician, Sun Ra, you know, that is Sun Ra. And so one of his songs, he keeps saying that the earth is the third heaven. He's saying the planets are varying heavens. And so the earth is the third heaven. And the, so the concept of heaven is really interesting to me because there's the heaven that the human egoic consciousness imagines, which is very funny. So there's the heaven that the doll thinks of. And the doll's version of heaven is a better dollhouse that your hair doesn't fall out inside of and you get to stay in forever. That's the doll's idea of heaven. But if you wanted to create some kind of heaven state, you know, if there really were a heaven, what would, what would, what would be some components that you would put in to it? What would you do to construct a heaven for a sentient being? Oh, geez. I don't know. I mean, first off the gate, just the ego inside of you was like, man, what if you die when you're 80 and then you just have this old 80 year old body all the time? Right. Right. But I mean, that's silly. I don't know, man, just void of fear. Get rid of fear. All right. So in heaven, there is no fear. I mean, I think that would be obvious, wouldn't you? Well, no, see, because like if you would want to create, like the idea is fluidity, right? So if I can construct a form, okay, so I'm the universe. I fucked up over the course of infinite time. I came to awareness of myself and now I'm a a being that's aware of itself and the only one. And this is cool, I guess, but it's ultimately just absolutely horrifying when you really consider that just like a being that's the way aware of itself for infinity. And Alan Watts talks about this and he sums up quite nicely where he says, okay, so now you're the universe, the universe has become aware of itself. Like we do know there's awareness in the universe. This is inarguable. If you're a human being who has awareness, then it's safe to say there is awareness in the universe. So the next question is, did awareness exist prior to the jump that proto-hominids made to hominids? Was there awareness on earth in organic life? Did earlier versions of us have awareness? Probably safe to say that it did. Some of them, also some marine life, dolphins, whales. Even if you just think to it like in the same sense, like, I mean, instinct is a form of awareness. You could even say that it's a blind awareness, a kind of rudimentary blind yet still some form like, I don't know why I'm supposed to do this, but I'm doing it. So then the next question is, did awareness exist prior to the time that planet earth sprouted life? Did it exist before that Cambrian explosion? Did exist before the first fossil that we the oldest fossil we've ever discovered before like carbon-based kind of does it exist in space? And that's an unanswerable question right now. But if you pretend that it did exist, which I think it's pretty safe to say that it is always existed, always will exist and has never not existed, then you could imagine there was a time where it was pure awareness that made a decision, whatever that decision may have been to entertain itself, to create some imaginary friends. So it started making planets and it started making people and it started making black holes, quasars, dinosaurs, and it spread itself infinitely through the great ocean of time. And so this is what we are in right now. And so Alan Watts says, this thing, eventually after, this is all, of course, a thought experiment, but after billions and billions and billions of years of having the ability to do whatever it wanted, I don't want to feel fear. I want to feel fear. I don't want to be, I want to see what it's like to come down to a planet and say hello to everybody. What would that be like? Eventually the being is inevitably going to be like, wait, I wonder what happens if I put myself on that planet and forget that I'm God. And bam, that's where we're at right now. That's us. That's what we are is where the infinite experiencing limitation is a form of recreation. And so if you wanted to create heaven, you would want to create a wave form. You'd want to create this feeling of like, oh my fucking God, I can't believe this is my body. This is who I am. This is what I look like. I'm getting old. I'm gonna die. Everyone I know is dying. Oh my fucking God. And then you die and you're like, holy shit. Whoa, man. I thought I was a fucking person. That was so intense. Right. God is getting high off of us in the form of limitation. And that fucking intoxication only happens when the bow is pulled back in the form of impermanence and limitation. The moment it's released at the moment of death, then there is this sudden explosion of orgasmic relief that comes. Fearlessness, of course. You realize you're immortal. You realize you were the mortal being, having fun with yourself. And then you realize that is what heaven would look like. And that's what we're in right now. And our limitation is just the other side of the coin of paradise that we're already in. But the beauty of it is you don't have to die. You can pop into that, theoretically, you could pop into that right now. That moment is the moment and that is all moments. In fact, that isn't a moment at all because it's not differentiated. But the idea is you could do it right now, supposedly. Do you still meditate a lot? Man, just yesterday, I've got this, I'll show you, I've got a picture of Neem Karoli Baba. Of course you do. That I sit, that we have some cushions in front of our cat got sick and Neem Karoli Baba, Maharaji, the great guru. The cat has been, it's really cool because the cat's been sitting on the cushion in front of him. The cat's got, his old cat is sick. So I went and sat down in front of that picture of him and I haven't done it in a while and man, it's just the best. It's just the best and you always, you always forget. It really is like a timeout. Well, it's the greatest thing you can, I mean, it's like, it's one of the greatest things that you could do. But what is meditation and how do you do it? And what is your practice? What does it look like? I mean, to me, it's just quieting of everything. It really is just, I mean, I almost start at like with my hair and go all the way down to my toes of relaxing everything and just sort of feel the, what, you know, the first couple minutes, it'll just be that. And it'll be acknowledging that, okay, my arm's okay, that I can hear a siren going by outside. I can, you know, and just being really focused on being super present. Body scanning. First. And just even like, okay, I can hear a fan blowing. I can, okay, traffic's outside. Okay, there's a helicopter, you know, and just slowly relaxing everything in my body. And then just like, just, I don't say let go, because that sounds silly, but it kind of is what it is, you know, and then it's a few minutes of just the clatter in my head. Oh man, I got a gig tonight. I haven't even gotten ready for that. I got to do laundry. All of that bullshit fucking chatter interference. You know, it's brain noise. And slowly then slowly that kind of will go away. I'm focusing on my breathing. That's the really the key, because if I can really just focus on that primitive action, you know, and feel my lungs fill up with air and feel it exhale. And, you know, sooner or later, you know, once I get, you get better at that practice, then, then I'm able to get, you know, and you get better at that. You know, if you're going to meditate for 20 minutes, you'll get the time that you're actually at sort of peace, I guess I would say, gets bigger, you know, because at the beginning, I can hear his noise for a long time. And then I can really do his focus on all the shit that's in my head or whatever. But slowly, but surely, the amount of time that I feel that I'm just sort of, I don't know, meditating almost in ways is almost like getting, it's like becoming the dark matter or something. You know what I mean? It's like, it's like connecting to everything that I'm not connected to regularly. Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. Which is everything. Yeah. That's the ironic part. It's like people like 20 minutes of meditation a day. Who has time for that? I got to watch reruns have lost. You know, that joke, it's not a joke. There's like a joke here all the time. Yeah. Spiritual joke, which is this guy goes to a Zen master and the Zen master says to him, meditate 30 minutes a day. And the guy says, I don't have time to meditate 30 minutes a day. And the Zen master says, well, then you should meditate an hour a day. Exactly. Because, you know, but this is the, the, what's a very funny thing is one thing that you said was, I'm not connected to those things most of the time, but the crazy thing is, no, you are connected. I'm talking about conscious and subconscious. That's it. It's making a conscious connection to the real environment. The environment isn't the street in the street corner and the 7-Eleven that you live next door to the environment of like infinity. That's it. You know what I mean? It's like connecting to Jupiter as much as, you know, because I'm constantly not consciously connected to that. It's a conscious connection. It's a conscious connection. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, and that meant that. Because once I can do that, and then once I can realize the infinity of it all, I mean, another good byproduct that I have found from, from doing that is the things that are huge in my head no longer become huge. Right. Man, I got to get that article written. I got to, you know, it's like all of these things that when, when, you know, when I'm older and on some sort of death bed or I'm really old and whatever, all of the things that are meaningless that I give such meaning to. And you always hear that, you know, I read a book called, I think, I'll think of the name of it, Proof of Heaven. Oh yeah. I was just looking at that book on Audible. Is it good? Incredible. It's got to be a movie. They got to make this into a movie. It's really incredible. Loved it. Loved it. And what's it about? It's about a, I believe he's a neurologist. Yeah. And he goes to like, you know, like some foreign country, third world country, I believe, and can get some sort of very rare virus. And when he gets brought back to America, they have to quarantine him because they're worried about it. It's going to cause like an outbreak. Yeah. And then he goes into a coma, passes away a few times and resuscitant was completely in a coma. And everything that he experiences when he's in that state, as well as compared to his medical chart, he's a devout, going into this a devout atheist. Yeah. And everything that his medical chart during this whole time and how it refutes anything that he could be experiencing or having gone. It's really incredible. However much of it is true or false. I have no idea. I mean, nobody can write anything, but it's a, it's really fascinating for somebody from somebody with that point of view to be, to be sort of convinced. What do you experience? He was raped repeatedly. He was raped repeatedly by the orderlies. No, just, I don't want to spoil the book for anybody because it kind of kind of does spoil that. Did he see some angels? All kinds of just, just incredible, all kinds of states that he would go in and out of different levels of how deep he would sort of go into really everything that we're talking about. And you know, there's a lot of things that happen in there that are kind of like, if this story is true, you're kind of like, ooh, that's, that's pretty hard to deny. So it's pretty good. Yeah. But anyways, I forgot what got me on that. Did he talk about hell? I just believe that it wasn't like a destination. Like there were two different things, but there was a fighting this process and not fighting this process, which, you know, there's a trudging versus a releasing. That's the story. Yeah, you fight it and you're going to hurt. Now, what started off- Which is great for, which is true for everything, really. Everything. It does the, it's, it's, it's, this is the, if like, this is the, it seems like this is just the lesson that we're in this class to learn. Or if there, if there is a curriculum here, then the curriculum appears to be, stop fighting this. I was going to say about that. It's exactly, you just reminded me of that. So anyways, in this book, and the other book I read was, I'll think of that, but they always had this thing where like every time you would talk to anybody that was terminally ill, especially really older, a lot older or anything like that, really pretty much facing their own mortality. They always would say the same thing. I really wish I didn't put so much emphasis on all of these things that weren't important. Yeah. Yeah. And if every single person says the same thing when they're facing death, I would think that we would pay more attention to that. You're supposed to, it's like, this is, you're just, yeah, like the thing we're doing here, the, we're playing this game of mate, believe a little too seriously. And it's getting, it's a bummer, man. It's like, you don't have to wake up in the morning and feel like a fucking asshole because of some thing that doesn't exist anymore. You don't have to wake up and you don't have to feel like you're a slacker because your friends are like all astronauts or whatever. You don't have to feel like you're, you know, that's another malady that people get afflicted by as they either watch TV and observe some of the most highly functioning Adderall addicts on planet earth, building the empires and steaming to be as happy as Buddha the moment he gained realization. They see these, you see these clips of people. I mean, the thing is, it's like, it's not just TV. If you're performing for yourself in every single given moment, because you're an observer and that, which is observed, then how much more are you performing for other people? You're performing for other people constantly and that means that I would, I would argue a hundred percent of the time for most people. So whoever you're comparing yourself to, you're comparing yourself to a projection of a person who's pretending to be something you're projecting your own bullshit. It's like you're, you're, you're comparing yourself to a screen, a movie screen that's pretending to be the greatest movie screen on earth upon which you're projecting your idea of what the movie screen is. It's two illusions meeting at the same time. So you're compare, you might as well compare yourself to a cloud or to spaghetti or to a fart because it's all the temporary gooey changing. I don't know why I said a fart. I mean, I'll, I know, I'll even go as far as to say, like it, we're so conditioned to it and used to it that if you are not the type of person that is performing for other people one hundred percent of the time, yeah, people think you're crazy. People think that you're aloof or out there. Like you're just, I don't have time to try to figure that out. He's, you know what I mean? He's not showing me who he is all the time. It's like, yeah, he is. Yeah. This is not showing you what you, what he's not showing you what he thinks you want to see. Right. And that's what we're most used to seeing. That's right. We're used to other people acting towards us in the way that they think I want them to act. And for some reason, as crazy as that sounds, that feels comfortable to us. Yeah. It's like a sock puppet that's like somebody's doing it. And anytime you're in a conversation with somebody, you're in a kind of sock puppet show where the universe has temporarily animated this thing and is like giving you a show. It's a hypnotic show or the thing wants to show its power, its success, its lack of success, it's whatever it is. But it's just a show that, so the point is you, if whatever you're, whatever, usually what people are comparing themselves to that's the crucifixion is that they're crucifying themselves. They're nailing one hand on who they think they are, which is usually a piece of shit that they're not. And then they're nailing the other hand on who they want to be, which is also a thing that doesn't exist. So on one side, it's like, Oh, I'm just a miserable monster. And I'm just a failure. And I'm just got a lot of people who really hate themselves. So that's what you nail this hand to, which is this version of yourself you created that it is even you. It's a version of yourself more than like your parents told you you were or some shit I told you or a group of shit I told you were, nail that hand to that, then create the thing that you want to be, which is like, depending on what level of egomaniac you are, which is floating around on like a flying island that you've constructed with your Elon Musk level money because of the cure for cancer that you invented mixed in with the money you're getting from the comedy special that's the greatest comedy special that ever happened. Don't forget the harem. And the harem underneath the city who all love you and the and every day aliens come down to your floating city to tell you just how incredible you are. So some that's a far into the spectrum, but or you or it's just like, I wish I had a six pack, whatever it is, bam, there's your crucifixion. You've nailed yourself these two imaginaries and you're hanging there on this ridiculous torture device that you constructed for yourself. And so when people are, which is very, it's very symbolic and poetic that you've nailed yourself to these two things because what's really true is what's in between those two things. There you go. That's it. There you go. That's exactly it, man. And that's the present moment. And it's like, and that thing, it's the book ending. It's I have the capability of being this or this. And I'm just going to focus on on the two extremes that I'm capable of. But the reality in the present moment is that everything in between those two things is not only what I am now, but probably what I always will be and have always been. And you're missing out. You're missing out on the taste of on how good fucking tea tastes. You're missing out on it's fear. It's fear. It's fear. It's fear that I'm going to be this shitty version of myself, or it's fear that I never will be able to match the extreme maximum of my potential, which also would involve a lot of luck. Yeah, all that. Yeah. And they're inside. This is why when people are dying, they're always like, man, I didn't have to worry about any of that shit. That time that I woke up in the morning, didn't have anything to do and felt awful because I was sleeping in. I could have felt great about sleeping in. I just slept in and felt fantastic, gotten up and looked at the beautiful day. But instead, I allowed my mind to get tortured and tormented by the pitch for what you didn't do or what you got to do. You know, and those are the demons. So there is how. So this is why I think heaven and hell coexist. Heaven and hell live together on the exact same plane and that in any given moment, you can be in one or the other anytime that you want to. But ultimately, you're the one making the decision. And that is the final component in making something paradise or hell. Because if you were the one who is causing all your suffering, then there is hope. And if you were the one who's climbed out of hell in the heaven, then there's the feeling of accomplishment that comes from escaping the self-made prison that you would allow yourself to getting trapped in. And what's more fun than the feeling of escaping, overcoming, you know, that makes, that's the savor of heaven. Well, there's a great saying of like, which I don't think church hello, one of those guys, but if you ever find yourself walking through hell, keep walking. Yeah, that's it. Right. That's it. And that's it. It's like you make this choice. But it's like, what I'll put it like this, whatever I feed gets stronger. Yeah. So whatever I feed, you know, just give my attention to, I can give my attention to everything that I have and accomplished. And I can compare my insights to other people's outsides. Oh, look at that guy. He must have everything with that shiny car and that cute girlfriend or everybody, you know, and then compare his outsides, which is just the dog and pony show that he's showing the world. Think of me as this guy. And I look at that and I'm like, man, I'll never, I'll never find love. It's like, how did they get from that to that? There you go. How did they get from that to that? And you know, it's all fear based, man. And if you really can have the opportunity and you know, you know, whether it's therapy or whether it's just self exploration or whether it's doing acid and mushrooms or whatever combination you have to really get in, put yourself in ability to take a spiritual inventory and like, what am I afraid of? You know, just a list down. You could start with fucking spiders, spiders. I'm afraid of spiders. I'm afraid of this. I'm afraid. And as you're just focusing on fear and you're writing it down, you know, it doesn't take too long from all the dumb shit of spiders and monsters under your bed to you get to loneliness and not being good enough and never being loved. And then you get into some real shit and then you're like, wow, in 10 minutes, I just listed everything that I'm afraid and there's some pretty gnarly shit on there. And like, what can be done to get around some of those things? Well, it's good that you call it gnarly shit because in Buddhism, it's actually considered to be the fertilizer for the practice, which is like, when you do that kind of inventory, you're gathering up all this wonderful soil that you're going to grow your practice through. But yeah, you got to do that first. And it's interesting, Alistair Crowley advised a very similar inventory where you write about the self and the third person completely honestly, every single thing you just write exactly what it is. So you understand what the doll is that you're playing with, what the clothes are that you're putting on it, and what the game is that you're playing with it, because that's what you're doing, you're dressing and playing a game with a doll. Yeah, and it is scary loneliness and fear and rejection. Sure. Oh, these things are just so scary. But man, having you notice that underneath it all, it's kind of fun to be afraid. Uh, elaborate on that. So it's like, when I like initially I'm going to say no, but I'm listening. Well, I mean, when I find myself really caught up and being terrified over some future event, whatever it may be, fear is a great motivator, a show I'm nervous about death, usually show I'm nervous about same. But but if I find myself, so what I've done when I'm doing here is I'm creating. Well, I'm creating the exact same thing I create when I'm having sex. So basically what I'm doing is I'm building up all this pressure for the moment that's coming right so building up all this pressure for this event that I've created in time, whatever may be created this event I'm dreading right so that's the energy build up is the experience of dread. That's the air I'm blowing into the balloon. Oh, God, man, I've got to go do this fucking thing. Oh, it's going to suck so bad up. Oh, no, but I run into that fucking person. Right. And then and then so you go to the event and you're letting the air out of the balloon that you filled it up with and that creates the sense of relief. And so then you leave that moment that you've completely created yourself with an imaginary feeling of relief that's just imaginary as the feeling of suffering. And if you watch yourself in the act of these this funny game, then you realize that you're enjoying it you're enjoying you but the main point is I mean there's adrenaline attached to it there is sort of a finality to once you've finished what you were afraid of and you and it didn't manifest itself in the terrible results that you had thought like oh I did this and I didn't bomb I didn't die and I'm fine nobody was throwing shit at me I'm fine and you realize that you're fine and every single time you realize you're fine there's an adrenaline dump to realizing you're fine if that's what you mean that's it that's the game that's the big pastime of human existence for a lot of people is playing this ridiculous game of hide and go seek with yourself and acting like every time you find yourself that the world is a great place and every time you don't find yourself you pretend that you're in hell but it's really it's and it really it's just this kind of pastime it's like you're chasing your own tail you're god chasing its own tail and then the those it's a fun way to be even the darkest of the darks it's kind of fun like when I think of like god I mean some of the worst moments in my life man when I think about the an analysis of those moments I realized that there is an inescapable underlying feeling of enjoyment to almost every single thing no matter how horrible it is if you really have the guts to take a deep look down in there you realize it's all kind of great it's all kind of great and maybe that's what makes it out maybe you don't want it to all be great maybe you want it to be differentiated who knows I don't know but I do know the next time god forbid maybe nothing horrible happened either of us ever again but if it should happen if you really taken a look in the in the in that moment when the fucking phone is wrong always underneath it right always underneath it is that thing of you're fine yeah you're fine and you know that's the kind of thing that you did you know if you meditate you can get to that's the kind of thing that if you listen for it it's there and that and it's a practice you know it's a practice and it's like a lot of peoples my okay I'll speak for myself but I think on human condition your default practice is to be in fear and to think and to have this sort of like my needs won't get met that's the fear my needs won't get met but really like if you really get to the bottom of it they always have and they always will be it's it's it's it's the the the confusing of the term needs and wants people fear my wants won't get met well that's a whole different thing because what you want to you know your needs are being met as we speak yeah you know they always have been there as will be yeah but don't don't confuse me your wants not getting met with your needs not getting met brilliant that's so true man and man yeah you're right your wants what do you want and then you spend the other oh god the really problem is with that line of fucking thinking as you trick yourself into thinking that once you get the thing you want you're gonna feel great well you'll always know that because when your needs are getting met there isn't some sort of like yeah I deserve this kind of thing there isn't it you know Mercedes uh you know you're gonna you get a brand new Porsche that's your that's not your needs getting met that's your wants yeah yeah yeah so when you're once get met you have a you have a kind of a thing like yeah I wanted this and I got it doesn't do anything but it's like if you're thirsty and someone gives you a glass of water you're like I'm gonna give a fuck it's just water right and then I mean yeah not even thinking about what that is I want to I want to gatorate well you're thirsty and you needed something to drink and you got it and the universe gave it to you you had a need that the universe gave to you the universe gave you that's the miracle substance right this incredible substance that your body is magically going to process through your kidneys in the most incredible way it's amazing what's going on oh harmony of atoms and microorganisms and organs you incredible beautiful perfect invention spitting the time by yourself come on it's a all a great miracle I was just telling a friend of mine man this guy Michael Beck with who I want on this podcast so bad Michael Beck with from agape yeah no Michael Beck with oh god man I've got the black out of the brain some of them I email him once a year never responds but probably a busy guy yeah he's a fucking amazing but um uh well he did I think he I don't know if it's his twitter account anyway maybe he did respond once and I screwed it up but he's incredible but one of the things he's a friend of mine's mother-in-law is in his choir like sings in his thing on Sunday get him on my podcast please Jason but he said something that I love to think about all the time which is like when talking about gratitude he's like something along the lines of if you are if you're peeing okay like if you can stand up and or sit down depending on gender or preference and you're peeing okay and you're holding that's amazing what a great gift right it's incredible it's incredible you know there's so many things prior to the uh wants as you're saying that are so fucking amazing so amazing it's so amazing and we're not just like oh I'm getting all passionate and pretending that it's amazing but it's if you look into the science of what's going on in your body in every single moment if you look into the history of the world and what got you here if you look to the sheer improbability of not just life existing on planet earth but you as a human being existing at all the number of miracles that had to happen the incredible number of synchronicities that had to happen just for you to exist if you consider that just that you get to breathe once and inhale and exhale once in this world you can it's a while let alone without a problem let alone without a problem it's just a miracle miracle miracle miracle all miracles all miracles all miracles and yet um we don't want to live in the land of miracles we don't want to live in the kingdom of heaven we don't want to live in the kingdom of heaven well I think it's a little more of uh it's just not good enough like just breathing and just having food and water and everything that I need to survive like I need a helicopter man and that's the comedy I need an island bro I need I need I need multiple wives because one one woman's love just isn't good enough for somebody as awesome as me man I need all women's love you know and it's you know but really it and a lot of that you know that's it's excessive you know especially in this day and age with the internet the way you know everything is just so readily accessible the lost art form is is is the conversation conversation a real conversation where two people look at each other and talk yes is go to any bar go to any restaurant look at every table of four everybody's in their phone gazing at this rectangle nobody is even remotely present it's and those you know and I'm just guilty of it as anybody but you're you know we were sitting there with the most beautiful woman and and and really engage and have an engaging conversation and really get to know each other and both of you guys are just like what else is going on everywhere else but right now I have to know this is why I think somebody needs to work on this guys out there please listen I think that this could be like anybody out there is welcome to this idea I'm not going to do it uh a book of meditations that you can do while staring at your phone so it's like so so so because this is what I love about Buddhism uh-huh Buddhism is a viral religion Buddhism gets into the DNA of other religions and it converts it transforms the DNA of other religions and turns it into some form of Buddhism which is why Buddhism is so incredibly varied uh when you look at Zen versus Tibetan Buddhism you see these two you wouldn't know they were the same religion probably if you didn't know what uh what uh what you're looking at right so and that's because just depending on the culture that the information present in Buddhism infiltrates that well that's the form that Buddhism will take so there is no reason that we cannot innovate a new form of Buddhism of practice of meditation that comes during the absorption into the internet into the phone into your social networking this should exist this will exist it just it's not going away it's not going away so let's practice so instead of so when you look at your and I by the way what you said about conversation this is why I love the podcast because it forces and formalizes a conversation that I that that I get to have these conversations that we are having once a week and it's the greatest thing in my life I love it so much it fills me with with information so many things you've said I'll get to think about and like you know chew on for days and just like roll it around and look at it and think about anyway fucking phones man like if there are like so mindfulness you know the practice of mindfulness the idea is we pick up the phone we look at the phone we do whatever the thing is that we're going to do on the phone and if you just add to it mindfulness you know just like I am lifting the phone I am looking into the phone I'm just I don't know I don't know some spiritual genius out there should come up with it though which is a system of because our religion is distraction in the west right it's a some form of it's a religion of distraction a religion of what we call entertainment distraction whatever whatever you call it so why not turn it into likes a form of buddhist practice instead of like I gotta sit and stare at the wall no sit and stare at your phone go on it's just a koi pond it's just a koi pond video that you just are staring at sure just stare at this koi pond for 20 minutes since you cannot stop looking at your phone as long as the kois have my direct messages on their back as long as the kois have ridiculous facts about parts of the world I'll never see if everyone's in a while the koi as long as the koi have videos of bullies getting what's coming to them that's a rabbit hole on youtube right there it's great man it's great it's all great and and and and the the figuring out a way and again I'm an idealist man and like I've seen I know there's I'm an idealist but man the idea that this every single iota of experience here in this dimension is holy sacred perfect and part of the experience of heaven this is what I give this is the message that I always get not always sometimes the message I get is quite terrifying but if a psychedelic gives me a message that's what it always says is hey man stop being so hard on yourself we love you you are loved you are sustained you are supported you're this is a playground that you're supposed to be enjoying and you're not going to be here forever so have a blast you have you have permission that's what I get that's what I used to get from psychedelics now I get it from these ramdas people the same damn message in a different way only the difference is this message that they're giving and the message that a is giving is one in which there is no longer a landlord renting temporary spaces in paradise for you to experience while you're dissolving your liver and and that's the difference you know to me that's a more sophisticated yeah it sure is you know somebody once said something cool to me about that when they're like you know early on in getting sober one one of the many times I've tried and that's always tough it's tough when you quit anything it's tough to you know first few couple weeks or was hard I was talking to somebody and the human condition is just it's it's abrasive you know oh your your head it's a practice to get your head to do exactly what you just said which is give yourself permission to be flawed to just be having this human experience is enough yeah you know so every time and what he said that was so cool was you know your head just think of your head is like you know the kid that you weren't allowed to play with when you were little and then I mean the kid that every time you listen to this guy it got you in trouble right you know and it's like when any one of your friends if Duncan was to call me and go look man I I don't think I'm good enough I just I don't think I'm worthy of love sometimes and I don't you know in a lot of fear you know but in any any one of your friends were to call you and say that what would you say to them you wouldn't go yeah you're right dude I'm trying to get a podcast up can I call you in an hour that's what you do with your head as you go yep yeah because it because it originates in between my ears these thoughts you can't see it as something other than you that's right you know so when I do hear that in my head you know wherever that that's coming from I can go now that's not true actually I'm I am a very loving person I'm a kind person then you know and it's fine if I make mistakes I would say if I literally practice and I've been doing this for a year of when those thoughts come in my head treat it like it's just another it's just I've just dialed into that frequency of the universe for now and then I can talk and I literally will say no no no no that's not true and I would just say to myself whatever I would say to you or any of my other friends it would call me down and beating themselves up that's beautiful and that is it that why you gotta do that it's like this is the first you know if if like you're contacting you're this is the first being you're contacting you you know the doll the doll's called you the doll is like I am awful and we've all called friends when we're down to be like man I'm fucking this and this and this and I'll always talk you out of a tree but really if you if I've already heard those thoughts and they've been getting at me enough then I want to pick up the phone and call somebody about it there is a secret step you could do before that which is say the same things that your friends are going to say to you yeah you know yeah oh man you know I I mean god here comes what every crazy person has always said from the beginning of time but I have conversations with my mom who's passed away oh that's you know what's crazy about that and and do you really find that to be crazy well no I mean you know talking to your dead mom it's like norman norman baits what's crazy is I talked to your dead mom okay dude I didn't start talking to her until like after she passed away well the thing is man I realized that like I can just have those same phone conversations with her that I used to have all the time and always get the same response generally and the same response is the response that all mothers have said since the beginning of time which is stop smoking no which is which is where have you been stealing my cigarettes again oh mom I miss you which is I love you sure take it easy on yourself be kind to yourself yeah it's fine it's fine and that that place there man that is the kingdom of heaven I think I think when you start finding that compassion to yourself and just like get to relax for us even a millisecond after a mostly a lifetime of a kind of constricted horror just a three seconds of like oh there this is great and then when you do there is that kind of like oh yeah thank thank god everything's cool well it was you were just tuned into the frequency that refuses to accept quiet Jason Tebow thank you so much for coming on the podcast I love you Duncan

Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Warning. Warning. You're about to enter into a 20-minute rant. It's a 20-minute rant. Don't even know if it makes sense. If you don't want to listen to me ramble for 20 minutes about reality tunnels and subjective imprinting and being a spiritual machine, jump ahead to the 20-minute mark or 21-minute mark because that's where we start the interview with Burke Kreischer. So, 20-minute rant. If you don't want to listen to a 20-minute rant and just want to listen to awesome stories from Brilliant Burke Kreischer, then jump ahead 20 or 21 minutes and listen to the interview. Rant starting now. Hello, my dear sweet friends, lords and ladies of the night. It is I, Duncan Trussell, the skrillex of podcasting and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast voted by President Barack Obama as his third favorite podcast in the world. Thank you, Mr. President. It's exciting to me that you listen to my podcast and I hope that you enjoy the next two years of your presidency. Hail Monsanto. Hare Krishna. Listen, if you're a reptile as long as you feel love, that's all that matters. In the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna says, even the vilest of criminals, if their mind is absorbed in me, shall cross over the material ocean as easily as a kid stepping over a puddle. Imagine that concept, that there is no such thing as evil and that if by some miraculous shift in your consciousness you move your attention to the good, if you transform your attention to this focus on the idea that we live in a benevolent, beautiful, opulent, flowing, juicy, delicious, incredible dimension that only wants to wrap you up in his or her beautiful arms and make sweet love to you until you drop your body and fly off into some alternate dimension where you can be in all places at once and experience whatever the thing is that you want to experience. That could be a reality that we're existing in right now because you have the thumbprint of some terrified asshole stuck into your subjective universe because some awful judgmental prick took a walk inside your reality tunnel and took a big fat steaming fear dump in the middle of your paradigm. You think you exist in a dimension filled with hissing, biting, venomous, stinging, winged darkness that desperately wants to take you down at any single moment and drag you into the quicksand of entropy, mediocrity, and failure. Scared people are fucking contagious. They will inject you with whatever the goddamn thing is that they're afraid of and you won't even know it's happened until way later on in your life and then you look at your life and you realize like why am I always in a state of anxiety? Why am I always in a state of vengeance seeking? Why am I always in a state of considering and contemplating the worst aspects of the people in my life? Why am I always getting into conversations with people that involve how awful this person is or how awful that person is? Why am I a kind of missionary of the mediocre? Why do I feel like my job is to travel into the world and spread the bad news about how this person sucks or this person isn't talented enough to be where they're at or this person has failed in their attempt to do this thing or that, why are you a, why be that kind of missionary? Some people are a missionary of fear and they don't even realize it. These are the people who say that they are the, they just tell the truth. You know, I just say it how it is, man. Those are the fear missionaries. They spread the bad news. You know, the gospel, the gospel translates into good news and these people spread the anti-gospel. They spread the bad news and you know right away when you're in the presence of them, because it only is a matter of time before they start talking shit about somebody. It's only a matter of time before they start raking somebody over the coals when that person isn't even there. It's only a matter of time before they start raking you over the coals and they'll do it in a seemingly friendly way. A lot of these fear missionaries have gotten really good at their job. They're way better at their job than those sweet little Mormon boys you see peddling around your neighborhood on the bikes wearing the nice white shirt and the tie and the short hair and they just kind of beam and glow with this awesome, culty, badass energy and you just want to invite them in and give them some cookies and let them hypnotize you with stories of their incredible God while you shampoo their hair and rub lotion in their poor, tired feet. But these fucking fear missionaries that exist in the universe, these people who want nothing more than for you to invite them into your reality's tunnel so they could just spray hot piss all over the wall of whatever happy existence you've managed to cultivate. These people are insidious because they don't wear any outfit. They look like anybody else. They wear normal pants and normal shirts. Some of them wear the costume of a boss or a successful entertainer. Some of them will wear the costume of your parents and some of them will wear the costume of your brothers or sisters. But man, they will trick you. You won't even realize that you're in the presence of a servant of entropy until it's too late and they've already implanted into your head some kind of terrible, dark, awful news. You know the people I'm talking about. These fucking sons of bitches who as soon as they can will deliver to you the worst bit of news they could possibly come up with, whether it involves somebody that you know or whether it involves something someone said about you or whether it involves something they said about you. They'll get you, man. They're like those snakes in a nice hot beautiful summer day that hide underneath a rock and bite little kids playing frisbees out there in North Carolina. They're like that delicious burrito you see at the taco stand. It looks so good because you're super stoned. But after you eat it and you get home, suddenly you're spraying some of the vilest, noxious toxins out of your asshole and puking for three days straight. These people, they will inject you with horror. They will put their bile into you in such an astute way that you won't even realize it happened. You'll just think you're around somebody who's telling the truth. You'll just think you're around somebody who's saying it like it is. But somehow the way they say it like it is always makes the universe a little darker. And sometimes it's not them doing it to you, but it's you doing it to other people. Sometimes you'll find yourself having a delicious lunch with somebody that you haven't seen in a while and all you can talk about is Ebola. You won't even realize you're doing it, but you'll suddenly come to and realize like, oh my God, I suddenly transformed into a missionary of doom. I transformed into a servant of the Dark Lord. I, for a moment, had within my mouth the eye of Sauron and was casting a spell of words onto the day. I was trying to pour my fear into the ear chalice of my friends so that I could fill their brain up with my poisonous wine so that they will spend the rest of their day feeling a little worse than before they sat down to eat with me. They will get you and maybe they already got you. That's another problem is when you're coming up as a child, you know, these sons of bitches can get their greasy, oily, fear-missionary fingerprints shoved firmly into your brain and you won't even know that you've got the thumbprint of a demon in your subjective consciousness and that the majority of actions that you take in the world are not based on the current paradigm that you're existing within, but are based on a paradigm that you existed in when you were around a bullying, angry, confused, sad, lonely, broken person. And that happens to a lot of us, too. This is why Gurdjieff, the mystic Gurdjieff, check him out. I talk about him way too much for somebody who's only read like half of a book about him. But what I did read really got into my head, which is that the majority of us are these kind of automatons, that we do not have any kind of true autonomy but that we are these sort of spiritual machines running these behavior codes like a computer script where we just run the same recurring code over and over and over again. If one, go to three. If four, go to two. These are the behavior patterns that you get stuck inside of and the reason that you get stuck in these behavior patterns is quite often because you were in a survival situation when you were really young and you didn't even realize that you were in a survival situation. If you're somebody who got shot out of a pussy into the home of an abusive alcoholic, if you're somebody who got shot out of a vagina into the home of fundamentalist super-Christians who spent the majority of your childhood transforming your glorious freedom into something that you should feel guilty about, then you might have developed behavior patterns that involve resisting or rebelling or fighting a guerrilla war against somebody who was trying to confine you to a horrific paradigm where you were trapped in a dimension where there was an angry god and a hell or you were trapped in a dimension where you were supposed to behave like someone that you completely weren't. This happens a lot of times. A lot of times, you know, it's a fucking archetype, man. It's in so many different movies that kind of disappointed parent who can't believe that you didn't go in the direction that they thought you should go in and that any failure that you have is a failure not because you were brave enough to try some risky new way of life but is a failure because you didn't follow the path that was laid out to you by your father or your mother or your grandmother or your family. It's awful, man, and it can happen. And even when those people shrink into the temporal distance when they become more background than foreground, you still contain within you the awful fear thumbprint that they shoved into your consciousness and part of waking up is recognizing what behavior patterns you have that are no longer relevant based on the universe that you're currently existing in. You don't need to fire back every time somebody says something to you that you think is disrespectful to you or your friends. You don't need to punch so hard when somebody does something to you that you feel is deserving of a nice hard punch. In fact, you don't need to punch at all. The reason you learn to punch back so hard and the reason you learn to extract such vengeance on people is because that was the only way that you could survive in whatever early reality tunnel that you got blasted out of a pussy into. It's like when people come back from war and they've been surrounded by bombs going off and watching people die and explosions. That's an extreme case of what happens to anybody who went through a turbulent childhood. You get a kind of PTSD, which gives you some neurotic glitches which create recurring behavior patterns and cycles in your life that if you have no mindfulness or you have no awareness of you're completely on autopilot, then you will just think that the universe is cursed and that relationships are destined to collapse and that people are inherently bad and that the only way to survive is to steal or fight or cheat or get what you can while stabbing your brother in the back. All of these things you're doing because that's what you had to do to survive in whatever gravelly, bloody, subjectively horrifying universe that you got dumped into. And that happens to a lot of babies, man. A lot of babies get pushed into some pretty, some video games that are set to a high difficulty level that would be hard for an adult to navigate, much less a toddler. How's a toddler supposed to navigate through a world where parents are screaming at each other, a world where behaviors are shaped by alcohol and alcoholism or where behaviors are shaped by belief in an angry, invisible, dark God out there? The whole point of this long rant is that if you find yourself one of these people who tends to have recurring patterns in your life that seem inescapable, poverty patterns, heartbreak patterns, whatever the thing is, it really is important to sit down and examine the rudder on the ship of your life that you're using to steer through the multiverse and see if there is a, the shape of the rudder which consists of the sum total of all the habitual behavior patterns that you use to navigate your way through every single day. Look at the shape of that thing and just see like, wait a minute, wait a minute. Am I constantly trying to get revenge on people who don't deserve anything more than love? That happens to a lot of people who come from shitty childhoods, but I'm just saying all this stuff because the holidays are approaching and a lot of people get really queasy because they don't want to go back and hang out with their family. A lot of people get, now not everybody, some of you out there, your parents are still married and live in a warm, beautiful home where when you return, they invite you in with big smiles and they hug you and greet you and say the sweetest things to you. They're so very proud of your life and your mother offers you goddess-like wisdom and your father offers you patriarchal advice based on a lifetime of principled behavior and contemplation. Your family is overjoyed to see you and you all compliment each other on the spiritual growth that you've achieved throughout the year. Everything's based on amplifying each other's life, amplifying each other's ability to experience pleasure, amplifying each other's sense of gratitude to exist in this universe and when you leave, you leave with a kind of radiant, holy-like glow and as you fly on the plane, everyone turns to look at you because they can sense that you have, for a brief amount of time, walked through the gardens of paradise and they want that for themselves too and they also want to throw you out the exit door and watch your glowing, happy, rosy little face go plunging down to earth and splatter on the ground like a water balloon filled with guts. Not everybody emerges from a rosy childhood. For a lot of people going home creates the feeling tone that troopers experience as they're being parachuted into the Kourangal Valley in Afghanistan. What's really interesting about going back to hang out with your family is that it gives you this beautiful place to experiment with mindfulness and you go back to your family not with the goal of extracting revenge, not with the goal of changing your siblings or your parents, not with the goal of showing them that you've rebelled against everything that they want but you go there with the goal of observing the kiln that you were fired within. You go there to observe the manufacturing system that created many of your behavior patterns. You go there with the idea of watching so you can learn about the fundamental subjective DNA that is running the computer program that is your life if you're on autopilot, that's all. How often do you hear people say, I've turned into my parents? Well, yeah, you've turned into your parents not because of some kind of genetic predisposition to be an asshole but you've turned into your parents because all of us got imprinted by our parents and our rudders are formed by our parents and so when you go back to hang out with your parents you could be like, oh shit, I do that too. All the stuff that your parents do that might annoy you or make you feel bad or make you feel guilty, the idea isn't so much to confront your parents because they do that. I think certain schools of psychology advise that you do that, I don't know but the idea is to observe those behavior patterns in a state of mindfulness with the intention of transforming whatever those behavior patterns are inside of you but you can experience some autonomy in this incarnation instead of just being a spiritual machine, being run on computer code that was blasted into your reality tunnel by people who more than likely were on autopilot. So there is a challenge for this Thanksgiving when you go back to visit your family, when you go back home, go back home this year not with the intention of hiding, go back home not with the intention of fighting but go back home with the intention of just being mindful to watch the anvil upon which your life was forged so that you could determine which behavior patterns you have that you want to keep and which behavior patterns you have that you want to abandon or change a little bit. You can rewrite the computer code of your subjective universe and this is the invitation that every single awakened being has extended to humanity. The incredible idea that you can abandon the behavior patterns that were injected into you by terrified people and that the moment you let go of those behavior patterns you become this autonomous being. You find that underneath those behavior patterns is just a pulsating love force which is what all of us are and that's the final little piece to throw into the stew of visiting your parents or going back home to your family for the holidays is to recognize that in the same way that underneath all your fear patterns and underneath all your tendencies to tighten up and constrict and numb down and escape and get drunk and try to avoid dealing with the kind of awkward, uncomfortable, cold war style tension that can often be rolling through a family not just for your lifetime but for generations. Recognize that underneath your brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers there is this love that just is covered up with all these bits of computer code that are no longer necessary to survive in the paradigm that you are currently existing within. You don't want to go visit your parents like some kind of alien anthropologist studying them with like a clipboard. Oh, I see that this is another shitty thing you put into me because then you're just some kind of cunty victim and what I'm saying could easily be confused is that I'm not saying that and you don't want to go there with this like Jane Goodall studying fucking chimpanzees like you're better than them because you're not. You're just a human and they're just humans. The idea is to go there with this concept in mind something that I heard from somebody who came to see one of my shows in Canada. The idea is not to change our parents. The idea is to change our kids. Well, I want to modify that. The idea is not to change our parents. The idea is to change ourselves, to work on ourselves so that we can become autonomous beings so that we can experience freedom because the moment you rip away whatever the lens is that calcified onto your third eye when you were growing up then you realize that the universe isn't boring at all. It was just the paradigm that you currently were looking at the universe through that was giving you the sense that you weren't existing in an opulent, beautiful, benevolent, incredible, juicy place. And once you recognize that, then you stop being a fear missionary. Once you recognize that, then you stop being a kind of robotic messenger of darkness. You stop being a robot that's programmed to only tell ghost stories to yourself and the people around you and you turn into this spontaneous love fountain that accidentally is always doing the sweetest things to the people around you and that's what they say that gurus and awakened beings are like. They just are always doing the sweetest thing. They don't have to think about it. They're not doing it to get some result. They're not doing it out of a form of manipulation. They're doing it because that is the essential state of human beings. At least that's what the really smart people say who I've gotten to hang out with. I don't know if it's true necessarily, but I do know that if you go into any situation with the intention of being a little bit less of a robot and a little bit more of a sweetie then that situation will at least a little bit change. You will notice that things begin to form around you in ways that you're not used to and that's a really fun moment and that happens in really small ways. It's not like you're going to, don't think you're going to go home with like the intention of sweetness and everything's going to be great. It's not. You're going to react. You're going to be reactive. You're going to get in the same old fight. You're going to get into the same old behavior patterns, but at least this time you're going to be doing it in a state of mindfulness. At least this time when you do it, you're going to be doing it allowing for the possibility that the entire fucking thing can change for the better. And even if it doesn't, the one thing that did change was the way that you went into the situation. Because as they say in Buddhism, one of the fundamental obstructions to awakening is aversion. Aversion. And if you go into a situation and do what you can to remove the aversion, then the thing can change a little bit. It really can. Let's hope. Anyway, there's my rant. Forgive me for the holiday rant. I love you guys and one of the reasons that I love you is because you let me rant and you like to listen to me rant, which is truly one of the most flattering, incredible, beautiful things that a human being could ever have in this dimension. So thank you for that. We've got an amazing podcast today with Bert Kreischer. If you haven't listened to previous episodes with Kreischer, please go back and listen. He's one of the most amazing humans I know. He's a true adventurer. He is a modern adventurer. And in this podcast, he tells some incredible stories about some really intense experiences that he's had recently. You've probably seen his shows. He's got two shows, Bert the Conqueror and Trip Flip. He probably has more shows that I'm not even aware of. He has also recently just released a book called Life of the Party. I'll have links to all that at DuncanTrustle.com and in the comments section. We're going to jump into this interview, but first some very quick business. Number one, we have completely restocked the shop. The shop has all new shirts, all new posters, new stickers. We're also getting mugs printed and we're going to get some clothes for the ladies printed soon. But right now, if you're somebody who went to the shop and saw that everything was sold out, if you go back, you'll be delighted to find that everything is back in stock, including the incredible t-shirts created by the mystical artist, Ron Regi. These t-shirts have on them a series of symbols designed to ward off the evil eye, which is the name that gypsies used to give for what fear missionaries have the tendency to do to people when they come in contact with them, which is to look at you in a certain way, or to say things to you in a certain way that, quote, curse you. Of course, there's no such thing as curses, but there are people who can say the exact right thing to make you feel exactly horrible in a specific way. This shirt is designed to ward off those bastards. When they see this shirt, their eyes will cry blood in front of you and they'll vomit swarms of rats that will come clambering out of their fear missionary mouth and proceed to swarm on them and devour their flesh and bones and then the rats will shit out a brand new sweet little baby that you'll get to raise. And what is more exciting than the idea of tearing your enemies apart, turning them into little babies, and then raising them to be wonderful people? That's the whole point of everything, and that's what Jesus taught us. So that's what these shirts are about. Go to DuncanTrussell.com, check out the design, buy these shirts, and there is an 80% chance that a woodland creature will come flying out of the forest and land on your head or on your shoulder, or that a bear will give you a hug, or that a basket of puppies will be left on your doorstep, or that someone will rub heavy cream on your nipples while gently, gently stroking the underside of your throbbing penis or vagina. So check these shirts out, get some stickers, get some new posters, the holidays are coming, give people the gift of the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, T-shirts and stickers, but you don't have to do that. I'm just inviting you to go visit the shop and check this stuff out, and here's the threat. This shit does sell out really fast, so if you are thinking about buying these shirts, buy them now because we go into these stupid merchandise droughts because ordering merchandise in the right way is for my team and for me a mystifying thing. It's hard to figure out when you're supposed to order and how to do it because none of us are shopkeepers over here at the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast. Also, a tremendous thank you to those of you who have been donating to the podcast. We had a sudden and inexplicable surge of donors to the show. Thank you guys so much for your donations. That is a mind-blowing and incredible thing, and it makes me feel really good that you think this podcast is worth donating money to. So thank you for that. You don't have to donate, you can just buy stuff from the shop. And if you don't feel like buying stuff from the shop or donating, then I invite you to go through our Amazon portal, which is located at DuncanTrussell.com. The next time you are buying anything through Amazon, and this week I would like to recommend buying the, for audible, the Reza Aslan book, Zealot, which is so badass. It's the story of the historic Jesus. And I know when you hear historic Jesus, it probably makes your asshole tighten up because nothing is more boring than people are always desperately trying to figure out the historic Jesus because really, who gives a fuck? It's like finding the historic Obi-Wan Kenobi. I don't really care. Even if you do find the historic Obi-Wan Kenobi, I just like the movie Obi-Wan Kenobi. In the same way, I'm quite attached to my version of Jesus Christ, which really, the more I listen to this and read this awesome book by Reza Aslan, the more I realize how far away from the actual Jesus the Jesus in my head is. And the truth of the matter is I had no idea about what was going on during the time period that Jesus was wandering around through Palestine. I had no idea about the viciousness of the Roman occupation. I had no idea about the weird job of being a high priest and the connection to power and the animal sacrifices that were happening inside the temple that the Jews are always, are still going to. There's just a little bit of it left because the fucking thing got torn down. But Reza Aslan has the talent of bringing history to life in this incredibly gory, exciting, awesome way. If you want to get a really badass audiobook, go through the Amazon portal. Get the Audible Reza Aslan book. And also, if you go to AudibleTrial.com forward slash family hour, you can get that book for free. It's called Zealot. Reza Aslan narrates it himself. He's an amazing narrator. Sign up for the Audible account. And if you don't want to sign up for the Audible account and you just want to buy it, it's definitely worth buying. It's a great book to listen to as you're driving on your way to whatever holiday event you're going to. And especially if you're around a yappy dumb dumb and you just want to shove those earbuds in and shut out the world. This is a great way to replace whatever the moaning, simpering curse spell that whatever the person is you're forced to be around during the holidays is trying to cast on your life. You can replace that with the sweet soothing voice of the genius Reza Aslan. So go to Amazon, buy Zealot, get a Fitbit, whatever you do, just go through the portal and bookmark the portal. And anything you buy on Amazon, they give us a very small percentage of that. So there you go. That's the commercials for the show. Thank you guys so much for listening. And now please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast, the author of Life of the Party, the host of Trip Flip, the host of Burt, the Conqueror, world-class adventurer, amazing father and all-around super-positive, beautiful human being Burt Kreischer. Please open your third eyes, eject your astral body from its sheath like what happens when dogs are humping pillows and spray some extra-dimensional super sweeties all over Burt Kreischer's face and stomach. Welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast, the great Burt Kreischer. Welcome, welcome on you. That you are with us. Shake hands. No need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. Holy fucking shit, Burt Kreischer. Welcome back to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast. Double Jeopardy with Ashley. Whatever happened to Ashley Judd? She was so amazing and then it's like she just dropped off. You know, I don't know. I don't know much about her. I only know one thing. I saw her in like a movie. Like someone did an independent film and all I know is that she was drunk as fuck on set. And I was like, I got so depressed because I was like, I expected that out of me. I don't expect that out of her. Sometimes I wonder if that is a, actually an old school acting technique is to get hammered drunk. Because I remember I was dating someone who was actually in a movie with Harrison Ford. And I remember noticing that as I recall, maybe I could be wrong. It could have been something else in the glass, but it did seem like he was having a glass of scotch as they were shooting. And he was doing a great job. He's nailing it. I heard Bill Murray when they shot Animal House brought in a briefcase of drugs. Oh, you mean John Belushi? No, not Animal House, I'm sorry, Caddyshack. I heard that too. A briefcase of drugs. Well, it's kind of the reason why I got into the business a little bit. Because you can get high while you're working. Yeah, it's like I never really thought, it's kind of like the art of it. I remember we did like talent shows in college like Fraternity Philanthropies and Sorority Philanthropies. And I was always the one to like do the sketch and you just get fucking blitz before you did it because you didn't want to give a fuck. Right. And because it makes you a conduit. You know, there's something in it that is shamanic and there's something in it that's opening yourself up to the spirits. You're sacrificing yourself to the spirits in a weird way. I've offered parts of my, I've offered, I always look at it as like offering serotonin. Because you, it's like big chunks of serotonin where I go, all right, what I'm going to do is I'm going to enjoy it. I'm going to feel it. But what I'm doing is I'm giving it to these people. I'm going to let these people have the serotonin that I'm dumping. And I understand that there's going to be, there's going to be a shortage. There's going to be a drought tomorrow night when I'm in a hotel room bed and where I'm going to get sick. I understand that I've just sucked way too much out of my body. Right. But you can't like, I can't help it when I'm in that fucking funk. It's, it's, I want to say it's probably close to bipolar or manic depressive, but I can't fucking help it. Well, yeah, manic, there's a lot, you know who I was, this is a pretty bad ass. I got to talk to Dr. Drew for a little while, who's a really cool guy going to be on the podcast next week. Actually. Really? Yeah. But he was telling me that, you know, the majority of inventors were manic depressive. The majority of famous inventors in the world had qualities that would consider, would be considered manic. That you need to get your mind into that state. I think so in order to create my, my, my most creative chunks of anything. And by the way, you're going to sound so uncreative, so unproductive. I didn't make no money off these creative chunks. But like the one of the biggest, this kind of sounds so silly that I'm saying this. I got into a manic state in New York, um, uh, probably like three years ago. For, I was doing, we were doing press for something. And I was back when I was doing, do you remember, did you ever see the hotel room art I would do? No. What will the maid think? No. I'll show you real quick, but just so that you get a perspective of just exactly how uncreative this was. If you just type in, I think if you type in what? This reminds me of a specific genre of porn that is the most disturbing I've ever seen, which is these guys, these guys intentionally let the maids come in while they're jerking off. It's just, I've heard about this. I've heard about that from some, some dude at the comedy store did that, right? It's just sad and pathetic. I don't know if a guy at the comedy store did. I know it's just some weirdo. It's sexual assault kind of, isn't it? So these are the things I did. I made these little art. Oh, badass. This one was actually in the middle of the manic state. It's a, Why do you think that's not what we're looking at here is this is a bird has taken a toilet bowl. That's hilarious. These are great. Yeah. So birds doing these amazing. This one in that manic state. I put my shoes, my jeans, my shirts. It's great. That's not me. That's all towels. It's great. And I made this one in the manic state. This was all in one manic state. These are beautiful. Why don't you think this is creative? Well, it's creative. I put those shoes under there. That's great. These are all ones I did where I was just like, but I couldn't stop thinking of them. I was in my hotel room one night and I was spinning. I mean, like I was humming. My body was humming. Yeah. And I didn't sleep and I woke up the next. I didn't. I just got up the next morning, like got ready the next morning and I had to go do press for a birthday conqueror. And it was the night before Bertha Conqueror aired or the Friday before Bertha Conqueror said Aaron on Sundays. And I was humming and I had to go to press. And I told my publicist for travel channel. I was like, I was like, I'm fucking, I'm firing on all cylinders. I was really crazy, but I couldn't shut it off. And then I got on the plane and fucking ended up crying on the plane and like drinking too much and landing and being in a little hate circle. Yeah. This is the, you know, this is so like now it's so funny because we've got these new names for the same thing, which is that in societies, certain people make contact with a higher consciousness, transmute that information into the world in the form of art or invention or whatever. And then there's a price that they always end up paying, which is the exile or the depressed state. All those stories seem to be an indication or a, you know, like the story of like going out and Jesus goes out into the desert or Muhammad goes into a cave or the Buddha sits under the Bodhi tree, but there's all these sort of dark periods that are illustrated as being a prerequisite towards this heightened state. But then they stay in the heightened state. They don't come back down. So I would love to stay in that heightened state. Would you, do you think it, do you think your body could handle it? Don't you think you'd be probably your liver would fail or you would, I don't know. I got the last one. I was in one very recently, like probably like two weeks ago. Two weeks ago, I was in one on a houseboat and it was like early in the morning. We weren't shooting. The whole crew was there and I just, I don't know, man, something clicked and I was in a speedo and I was just like, I was fucking firing and I was listening to in excess and every song was communicating to me. Yeah. And I was communicating those songs to everyone on the boat and they were, I mean, it was like, and I knew in that moment I'm going to pay for this. I know that I'm going to pay for this. Yeah. But I can't help it because it's so much fun. I went paddle boarding into this slot canyon and I went back and I just spoke like, it was, it was spiritual. It was utterly spiritual. And then I, and then I flew home the next day. I didn't feel so good. Yeah. Throw up all over the bathroom. Really threw up. From drinking or from hangover? From, I didn't even drink. I mean, I drank on the flight the next day, but like I got home. We went out to dinner, didn't drink at dinner, came home and I just wasn't right and I threw up and I was sick and I was like food poisoning, but I hadn't eaten anything all day. Right. But, and it was like, just didn't make sense. And I just look at it like, like it's my body, just my body's just fighting back. It's happened to me, happened to me in Paris one night. The last night in Paris, I'd like just spent all this fucking positive energy. And then my last night there, I was shaking and I was sweating in bed and I was like, what the fuck is wrong with me? And I think it is you borrow, especially being an entertainer a little bit, you borrow so much that by the, when you know that you don't have, have to give it all, you're done. You're done giving for the week. Yes. You go, your body goes, Hey man, we got a fuck. We're a bear and we got stabbed. When you go into the cave, we need to sweat it out. I know, man, I know exactly what you're talking about. It's a feeling of just having to regenerate where you, the battery's dead. You need to lay, you need to just lay, not moving, not doing anything, veg out, not talked to anybody, vanished into nothingness for a little while. And then it charges back up again and you can distribute it out in the world. I know that cycle, man. You, I think, experience it more than most people though, because you are constantly traveling. You're the most traveling person I know. And with the other thing that, that I get, that I get from him, it is doing things that are at a high risk. So like I did this, I did this Canyon swing the other day off the Corona arch and then I did, I went repelling, I went scuba diving, we go, we do a cliff swing, like so I'm doing these things that are high risk. So I think I'm, I'm waking up at a depletion and I'm borrowing any serotonin I can just simply to get through what is, what is general anxiety that anyone would go through. And then you get done and then you celebrate and you're, and then you're high. And then all of a sudden it's like, I don't know, man, I think I'd probably do good to be on some sort of like, some sort of like leveling medication that wouldn't allow my serotonin to drop. Have you tried? I don't want it. Have you tried? But they, there's natural stuff people take. Like if you look into, if you look, go to, I think it's a place called ravesafe.com, which is about how to take ecstasy. I sent, I sent a link to that to my sister when she was in college. I was like, I don't know if you're doing ecstasy or not, but if you are, use this shit to find out if it's clean or not. Well, you, well, it also has a list of supplements that you take before you take ecstasy, while you're on ecstasy and, or MDMA is the better word for it. And, and then a couple of days after, and it is based on the idea of depleting your serotonin and how to make it so that you're, cause basically you're, you know, your brain's lazy. So when it senses that it's got a ton of serotonin in the tank, then it decides to shut down serotonin production cause it doesn't want to overload your brain with it. So if, if you were to secrete or however it works, excrete or blast out, blast out to the medical term, a ton of serotonin, then your, your brain is like, oh great, we don't need to make this for a while. And then that's the depression that comes from ecstasy supposedly is those days following your brains. Like I don't have to make that shit. I just made a shit ton. We're on break. So funny. I used to love the day after ecstasy. Yeah. I used to love it. Like it would be a Sunday. That is a good day. It's the next, it's day three or four if you don't, three or four is a fucking shitty day. Yeah. That's the one that gets you. And you forget that you took ecstasy and all of a sudden you're like, God damn it. I can't believe that fucking asshole said that to me. And then you stop for a second realize, oh shit, I don't have enough serotonin. And then the cocaine was the one I couldn't deal with cocaine. Fuck cocaine. I can't do it. I couldn't. I had to stay on cocaine. I literally, the day after cocaine was so horrific for me that I, I just, I mean it's the only reason, it's the main reason, it's the only reason I won't do it is that it's a fun drug. Like if you do it, it's a blast while you're on it, but man, that next day, and I could always go to sleep fine on it, but that next day, I was a fucking hate person. Yeah. And it's, I think that those states are fantastic meditative tools when you find yourself and a state of serotonin depletion, or you, or you can, you recognize that you threw off your body's biochemistry and now you're experiencing a chemically induced depression because it shows you how much your neurology shapes your universe because in those states, everybody does kind of seem like they're against you or intentionally trying to irritate you. Everybody, the world does seem like it's bearing its teeth at you for no reason. And if you forget that you have a biochemical imbalance, then you'll start reacting to the world because your body just can't understand that it's something much deeper than that. And we're, so you can see our program to find the thing in the environment that we think is causing the problem and fight it instead of going deeper and realizing, oh shit, it's an internal malfunction or imbalance that's happening, not anything in the external world, which is interesting. I do that with alcohol sometimes. Like I forget that I've been on the road and I've drank real hard from Wednesday afternoon until Monday afternoon. I forget, like you just, and then like Monday night rolls around and you have a bottle of wine and then Tuesday you wake up and you just feel like shit and you're like, motherfucker, and then Tuesday night you're like, I feel like I might be having a stroke. And then you're like, I'm like, my jaw is tight and my head's numb on one side. And I literally will forget. I'm like, I'm dying. I'm panicking. And then you forget your brain will be like, oh no, you're just dealing with withdrawal from hardcore alcoholism for a week. Yeah. You're withdrawing from alcohol. And that's such an important thing to realize because it's not just with booze or substances. It's true with your life. Like, you know, some people have had miserable childhoods, miserable, miserable childhoods. And they're having the equivalent of an ecstasy come down, but from an abusive child, they're having an abusive childhood come down. And they don't understand why everyone's an asshole or why they hate themselves or why the world seems so grim because they've forgotten that they spent the first 10 years of their life stewing in a state of high anxiety or the 15 years of their life with their body just constantly pumping out fucking adrenaline, constantly pumping out stress chemicals just to keep them in a survival mode for like the first 15 years. And then their face gets muscle memory of that look they've had for that first 15 years. And then they do it all the time and then don't realize they got this I smell shit look on their face. And they're just like, that's it. Leanne does it. Leanne does it because Leanne a really tough childhood. So when people tell Leanne something that isn't isn't 100% true or it doesn't wreak of 100% accountability, she does this look like, are you fucking kidding me? Yeah. You got to stop that. I go, you got to understand sometimes people don't know who the fuck they are and they're not real and they don't get it. And she's like, I don't do anything. I go, no, you make this fucking look like you're talking to your mom. Yeah. Yeah. And it's so fucking fascinating. Yeah. She'll do it to anyone. She'll just be like, huh, like real, like my sister, she'll do it to my sister. So I go, listen, in our family, we don't like the truth. We like to be happy. If we wanted the truth, we'd fucking fuck you a therapist. That's awesome. Yeah. That's super cool, man. That sounds like a good family. Nothing wrong with that. I mean, yeah, though, excavating for the truth is quite often the same as digging in a box of cat litter for turds. You're not really looking for the truth. You're just trying to find a fight, you know, the, you know, a box of cat litter looking for cat like cat turd minors and tiny little cat turds. We've hit Peter, boys. I got another one. Oh, what do I do with this? Yeah, great. I love good analogies. That truth bullshit, though, man, where people are just like, look, I'm just saying it like it is or I'm just telling the truth. The truth people, it's like, no, you're really not. You're just using your idea of the way the universe works as a medium through which to transmit your aggressive tendencies into the world. That's it. Transmute aggressive tendencies. It's like, like I have a couple of friends that love confrontation and I go, and I go, I go, what do you get out of that? Like, like, like, I don't want to say his name because he's like, I know you know him, but he's not like, but one of my friends really loves confrontation, like genuinely loves confrontation. I do not get what he gets out of it because I go, do you realize you're just making things uncomfortable for now? Everybody. Right. Like it didn't need to be that way. He's like, yeah. Well, it had to be said. And you're just like, no, it didn't. Didn't. I didn't need to feel the need at all. It usually, like there's, there are definitely times when confrontation is necessary, where you need to confront. I wish I had that. I can't even do that. I can't even do that. I'm like, I'm thinking like you're on the subway and you realize somebody's shoving their fingers into your asshole, like trying to get their fingers inside your ass. You got to be like, get the fuck out. What are you doing? Yeah. That's a good time. And then I'd be like, well, well, you know, it's only three more minutes on the train and he's probably, his hands are cold. Depends what color the guy is. I mean, I don't want to sound racist. Yeah. Maybe that's his culture. As long as he's not white, he can put his fingers in my butt. He's white. I'll stop him. Well, that fucking tendency though, man, it's like a, a curious thing. And I like analyzing the relationship, especially like if you have fan, like, you know, if you have complicated family dynamics, which it sounds like you might not. Oh, you do. We're, we're, we're pretty happy to go lucky, but we just, we, we're like, we're like Van Halen. Like my family is like Van Halen, like, we get a worst day away from each other so much that we're like, why the fuck don't we hang out together more? And then we do. And we're like, oh, that's right. Because fucking dad thinks he's a lead singer and like it's just, it's just, and then we split up for like a, like, like a year and then we're like, God damn, we should do a tour again. Yeah. That's a good, that's a great analogy. That's exact. Families are so much like that, man. But it's so, you know, Thanksgiving's coming up and people are going to be dealing with this shit for the holidays. And I think it's cool to get in, get in, get around your family and try to identify the games that you're playing secretly, the Cold War, because there's quite often there's like a war raging and under the surface of this like completely benign interaction when people on the outside witness it. They're like, what? You see, we're talking about the news. Our wars are as visible as like Kosovo, like, like, but it's just the problem is my sisters are America and I'm Kosovo and my dad is whatever didn't like Kosovo. What was that? Like it was the Kurds or the Kurds? I guess the Kurds. The Kurds. I'm the Kurds. My dad's, my dad's the Muslims, I guess. And my dad just believes that he, I told you this, I'm sure I told you this the time Joey gave my dad marijuana. I don't think so. Joey gave my dad marijuana one night, like just on accident kind of. I think Joey thought my dad knew it was marijuana and my dad just thought it was popcorn. And so my dad ate some and then I freaked out because I was like, yeah, I'm sure Joey did that on accident and so, and so then I ate some because I was like, I can't let my dad get on the rabbit hole by himself. So I eat some and then we did a podcast and then we hung out was Easter. My fucking kids were hunting Easter eggs and then my dad and I hung out and we went to my sister's house and we drank some whiskey, having a cigar and pretty fucking high. And my dad, like, all the fucking, it was almost like a summit. Like my dad told me why he's so fucking rough on me was that he thinks my lifestyle is, resembles his dad's and his dad died when it's 42. And so of a stroke and he thinks I'm going to die of a stroke and he thinks I'm going to die of all these things because of my lifestyles very similar to his dad's and he doesn't get guys who can go out and be on stage and drink and he doesn't get that whole thing. And so with this great fucking conversation, hi as fuck, I was like, why didn't we get smoked weed when I was younger? We would have fucking script a lot of hurdles. Yeah. Well, that's interesting that because you mentioned like the, like you were saying that you get back from tour and you feel like you're having a stroke. Yeah. That's interesting. It's like he implanted that into you, you know, like, so now when you're, now, like, do you think a lot of your hypochondria and stuff comes from him injecting you with this idea that as punishment for your lifestyle, you're going to have, you're going to die? Oh, I think a lot of it comes from, I think I inherited a lot of his anxieties in life without even realizing I was inheriting them. And now I deal with them nonstop because I go, because like, like, I just, not like a midlife crisis, but I was laying, I haven't been drinking for like a couple of weeks. And so I was laying in bed last night and I've been sleeping unassisted, like no ambient, no Xanax, just sleeping. And I was laying in bed the other night and I was like, I had this fucking like clear thought of like, yep, one day I'll die. And I was just like, motherfucker, that's real. That's not not real. Like everything else you can, every other anxiety you can go, like, like, what about flying? I was just walking on a plane. Like, what about, maybe it's not that, maybe it's not that. But I was like, no, I'm definitely going to die. One day I will be laying there and people will just stand in over me and I'll be disappearing into something and I'll be fucking exploring that universe. And I literally was just sitting there going like, motherfucker, like, there's no getting away from this one. Nope. There's a face tattoo that does not get removed. Does not get removed. And I started and my dad was like, that's what my dad does all the time. He just lays in bed and goes, that's halfway over. That's awesome. It's like, my dad's a guy that goes on vacation and the second he gets there goes, well, we're going to be leaving soon. As opposed to like, we have three days left. My dad's like, don't get too messy in this room, we're going to have to pack up. So I think, I think I inherited that a tad bit. That's what death, like the fear of death is over fucking well, I mean, I've called you many a time fucking asking you to walk me off a ledge. Now how do you, how do you think, what do you think death feels like? I don't know. I don't know. I can't, I can't really get into this too deep or I will fucking have an anxiety attack. We're really well because if I start thinking of it, there's like, anxiety is so pinpointed accurate. So fascinating because when anxiety clicks in, it's very clear. I've always wanted to use the term accurately from Pulp Fiction. I had a moment of clarity. Do you remember when he said that? There was a moment, I think it's in Pulp Fiction, it was like, I had a moment of clarity and I was like, I was like, I wonder what that's like. clarity gives you that moment of clarity where things are very cemented in, in actual, like your heart's disappeared, your stomach disappears and you're like, oh fuck, I could die. Like I had it, I've had it a few times on ledges or rock climbing. Yeah. And again, you know, it's important to realize that you, your lifestyle is one where as a job, you are perpetually putting yourself into those situations. That's you, that's part of your job. Yeah. And they're like scuba diving. Like there's a moment when you're scuba diving, have you ever gone scuba diving? Yes, I have. And when you're descending into the darkness, if you're not into it, oh, it's, it's fucking real. Because you realize if this is no different from parachuting, if this equipment fails, I'm done. I'm so far under the water right now, if this shit cuts off, that's it, man, I'm not getting back up. Yeah. I'm done. And they're like, if you're, you know, going with a group, they'll say, just wave to us if something seems wrong, but it's like out far away or you're like 20 feet away. You feel like that in that horror movie, the person who's getting killed outside and waving into the party going, yeah, and that one sees you, you're just getting stabbed to death. Scuba diving, if you don't let go, can be terrifying. If you don't let go, I say this honestly, if you think you may not enjoy scuba diving, you don't know the fucking terror that waits you down there, like, but if you think you're into it, then do it. You'll fucking love it. And you can let go. And once you do let go, you can really enjoy it. It is pretty fucking surreal. Yes. And it's, and it's like, it's like one of those things where you're like, holy shit, I'm doing like next planet type shit. Yes. But there is a moment when you're descending into the darkness where you're like, like, this is deep enough. This is deep enough. Oh, fuck how deep. And then you realize you're not, you have 80 feet to go and you're like 80 feet. Look, this is what scared me. I just, the day I found out we were going like, I found out we were going like 85 feet deep. I don't think I've ever gone that deep. I was standing next to a nine story building and someone said, oh, you know, you're going that deep. Wow. And I looked up, it was in Denver. Wow. It was on a radio station. If you ever go do radio in Denver over in like, in like Aurora, Colorado, there's a building that you'll go into that board buildings, nine stories. And I looked up and I went, oh fuck, I can't go this deep. It fucking freaked me out. That's probably what happened right before you become a human. Is they're like, you're going to be scuba diving into this dimension where you will be millions of light years deep into this dimension to the point where you won't even remember you're wearing a skin diving suit. You're going to think it's your fucking body. We're dropping you in there. And that's what death is, is just taking off the scuba suit and getting out of the water. The experience of terror is the same here too. Anyway, go on, man, nine story building. That's insane. Why were you scuba, what was down there that you were trying to get at? A fucking wreck. Like not, not even like, like, not that there's something, that's the weird thing about scuba diving is that like, you're just going to see a, can I tell you what fucking really freaked me out is I get, I'm being very honest, no one will see this on the show, but like, I do the first like, descend like 10 feet and realize, I don't want to go down. Like in my head, my brain's like, I don't, I don't want to go down. I don't want to do this. This is really deep. I don't want to fucking do this. Yeah. That's why I swim back up to the top. And the guy, the instructor comes up, this chick, really nice. She's like, are you having a hard time? I was like, I don't, nothing I need is down there. And she was like, what? I go, everything I, and I'm like very, it's amazing how clear it is by go, everything I need, everything I need is up here. Like I actually, nothing that I'm looking for is down there in life. In none of it. That's so cool. And she was like, she was like, you're going to be fine. Hold on to my arm. And in my head I go, I know I got to do this. I've already been certified by the way. I'm certified, but I've never gone this deep. And the depth is weighing on me is how deep it is, but more, what's also weighing on me is there's a storm above us. So the seas are rough as shit and it just looks scary. It looks like everyone's fucking fear of the ocean and we're in the middle of the fucking ocean. We're by a beach, near a reef, we're by a wreck, we're going to where, we're going to where an accident happened. And so. And people died. And people died. And that is the first thought. When I got down there, when I held her hand and I got down, I got down and then we saw the top of the boat at like 40 feet. I was like, okay. What kind of boat? Fucking who knows? Like some, just fishing boat, some like fishing boat, commercial fishing boat, I'm guessing. We go to the top of the mast at like 45 feet. And as soon as you see that, you're almost like, all right, I'm there. Everything's here. I got it. Like, but it's that 45 feet of descent where you're just going like, I don't see fucking shit. I don't see shit. It's getting darker and darker and there's a storm up there. You can't see a fucking thing. It's like black. And then we see, you see the top, you're like, okay, and people got lights, you know, we got lights on. Yeah. And then I get down to the thing and I, the first thought, and this is the, the silence is deafening because it's just you. It's just your brain. Nothing to distract it. No cars. No, no, nothing. Just you. And you just, you breathing. Yeah. Very primal. And the first thing I thought was this, I'm looking at some, possibly the scariest moment of people's lives. Yeah. Like I'm celebrating what ended in sheer panic. People trying to save themselves and see their families and I'm celebrating. And I'm like looking at it and I'm like, this is fucking creepy. And I'm like, like this, I'm just looking in like that we swim into the little cockpit area. And I was like, the last time like a dude was in here and this was dry. He was like, everybody fucking out. Like, all this is going on in my brain cause I can't shut my brain off. It's like a haunted house under the water, under the ocean. It is a real haunted house. It is like, it is a haunted house. It is someone died in this house and you're going in and you're not allowed to talk to anyone and you're breathing by your, and all you can hear is your like, heart failure. And I just was so fucking blown away by that intensity that my brain kept saying, hey man, like I can hear my brain going, I could really freak you the fuck out right now. And I was like, please stop. Yeah. Don't say a fucking thing. Let's get through this. Let's, let's enjoy it. And there was a few times I enjoyed it. Like the majority of the dive, the majority of the dive, once we were down there was fucking cool as shit. And it's badass and you do, but there are moments where your brain's like, do you hear that noise? Is that a regular noise? Oh. Like is that, did you have a leak in your mask cause it feels like your nose is leaking in your mask. Oh no. And my brain's saying that and I'm like, shut the fuck up. And you can't swim by the way. You can't swim up fast. You can't just go up. You can't just go up. That's the craziest fucking thing. You have to go up, take a minute and, and walk 10 feet in one minute. That just walk 10 feet in one minute. That's how slowly you have to descend every 10 feet in one. Is it 10 feet or one minute or 30 feet in a minute? And if you go, if you freak out and swim up too fast, you're going to get the bends and they have to put you in a decompression chamber and you're like, won't you like shit out your guts or something? You just, you can't bend your arm, like I think it's very painful. You can't just go up. So we go, we get to the thing and I'm looking at my air and we're like towards the end and, and you haven't talked to anybody. You're just hand jiving that to everybody and then you get to the top and we get to the, we start going up. Is that my phone? Whatever. We go to the, we're going to the, we're going up and we're going up really fucking slow and I'm looking at my tank and I'm like, I'm running out of air and I'm looking at the girl and she's like, slow down. And in my head, I'm like, I can't slow down. I think I'm going to be out of air. Yeah. And I know we have 15 at 15 feet, you got to wait for five minutes. I can't, I don't have five minutes where the air in here and I'm looking at them showing it to me. She's like, you're fine. You're fine. We get to 15 minutes and there's a fucking new tank waiting upside down with little, with regulators on it. And I was like, what? She grabs one and hands it to me and she's like, you're done with air. And I was like, holy fuck. I was like, I was, and apparently like a few people in our crew had run out of air at the fucking bot and had to go up to this emergency tank and go, they had brought one of the dudes, one of our cameraman ran out of air at the bottom and he had to buddy share, get up to the, get up to that part and then suck on that to fucked up. Someone fucked up. No, we were also fucking scared. We were breathing like we were in a marathon. We were like, and we just sucked oxygen like crazy. Oh my God. So now we got a bunch of fucking nitrogen in our blood because we've all been breathing compressed air like crazy and we've got to try to burn it off. So you got to like, she's like take a lot of time here and burn off this nitrogen. And I just was like, it's so crazy is that, and it's, it's the voice, it's the clear voice in your head. No one, I can't say this enough and I don't know how to express it, but like when you're underwater like that, there is no outside voice. So it's just your voice. It's all your voices, all your voices at once. And so when she handed me the other regulator, the voice in my head was said, ooh, who had that in their mouth last? Cause that was like where my head was. And I was like, I'm good. Cause I was like, I didn't want to put that in, because I'd have been in someone's mouth. I'll just suffocate down here. I don't want to get a cold. But I got really confident in my anxiety of putting other people's shit in my mouth. I was like, I know what it's like to run out of air because that's one of the things you do when you get certified. I was like, I know what it's like. I'll wait until I run out of air and then I'll go for it. Oh, they intentionally run you out of air. Oh, you look during the classes, they turn your air off. What does that feel like? It feels like, it really feels like you're just, like you can't breathe in, like imagine like a straw. Yeah. And then with the paper on it, you got to breathe in, you just can't get air through it. You feel it. It's labored at first. And then it's all of a sudden, it's like, okay. And you didn't, the crazy thing is you can't time your last breath. So you had your last breath. You don't know that was your last breath. You exhale. And you take the second and last breath. You're like, oh wait, that was my last breath. And so, yeah. Wow. So I was like, how many cave divers have experienced that last moment of like, that's it. It's it. Good night, everybody. Wow. That's why I look at dudes who go diving by themselves. Like, uh, like, just go like, I'm going to go for a dive. I go, you're out of your fucking mind. I need buddies. I need buddies and an instructor. Like, I'm not at that place where I can just go see you guys or I can, but it's got to be like 15 feet. And I can go for like, I know that I'm going for 20 minutes. But those people are fine. It's like, you never, how often do you hear about diving accidents? A lot. Oh, you do. Apparently. I don't, I guess this doesn't make the diving accidents just aren't important enough to make the news. Like small plane crashes they'll talk about, but it's someone dying underwater for their scuba equipment not working. I guess it doesn't pop up. It's like another, what's so interesting is motorcycles. So I got into motorcycles through the show, started riding motorcycles a lot. Motorcycle accidents are at a plethora. Right now you mean more than usual? Just I think so because I think people, I think motorcycles are reintroduced into the community. I think it's cool to have these bobber, these, these cafe bobbers and like cafe racer bobbers like these like leaned out like chicks are into it. Like I'm, but I sign up for like, I have this site page where it brings all the news to me that I kind of like and I sign up for motorcycles. It's got to like, I like motorcycles. I think the coolest shit and this is like, but I mean, like this is like, uh, you know, travel heart it. So then it says, Hey, new travel deals. You should see Asia. Like it just tells you all the coolest shit about it. Yeah. Even on site, two thirds of the articles are about motorcycle accidents. That's all they do is show motorcycle accidents, not even cool motorcycles. So like, but like motorcycles is terrifying. You're gonna, I was in Alabama fucking riding an Indian at like 70 miles an hour down a two lane road. And all I thought was it is so clear how you see people in the cars and you see someone on the phone and you're like, it's motherfuckers texting. Like all it takes is them to beer just a little bit and I'm really dead. Yeah. Like, and that's like a terrifying. But you, this is what's interesting about you. You're, you know, you hear about these adrenaline junkies. You hear about these people who are like bass jumpers and, and the air suits where they the wing suits, the wing suits. And you hear about all these people, but you're one of them Bert, but somehow you're one of them who doesn't realize that he's one of them or you, you, or do you, it seems like your relationship with it is one of resistance more than it is of, I'm going to fucking do this. I think it's one of a, as a comic, because it's like, there are very few comics who do extreme stuff, but comics have such a fucking cynical, no bullshit analytical brain of like of everything. I always say like that we're so good at like destroying a subject in like, yeah, in different ways that a lot of the guys who just wing suit, they're just brains are like, like, I was talking to this guy, Duke, and he's like the, he's, he run, he's a bartender on the off season in Switzerland and we're sitting at a bar and I'm like, I'm watching video of him fucking fly by and he goes, yeah, on this one, my buddy just died. And I went, what? He was like, he took a wrong turn into a mountain and he's just so matter of fact about it. And I was like, can't you, like, don't you have the brain that just sits with that information and then pulls it apart like a pomegranate and goes, like, I can't just look at it as a whole anymore the way you do. I know there's beads inside there and I need to know how to get them out. Yeah. And I'm going to crush some beads in the process. So I think, but I think that's like a comics brain is like, I remember the first time I got to stand up, I was like, I couldn't just sit with an idea and just be like, that was a good idea. And then fucking chew it and chew it. And I think that when you do this stuff, there's, I don't have that. I don't have that like work hard, play hard mentality. That's not me. No, you don't. Your approach to this is that, I mean, that's what's so fascinating. And I think that's why people love to watch you do this stuff is because they can relate because you're embodying what every single person, a normal person feels when they get put play, put themselves into a dangerous situation. And the question is how useful is that part of the mind because it seems like it doesn't really serve any purpose outside of a kind of, except for as a creative outlet to talk about it after the fact. That's a really good question. I don't know how useful that part of the mind is because honestly, um, I said to my, I said to myself the other day, I was like, I was like, uh, I was like, I could, we were doing the world's tallest cliff, uh, cliff jump or a rope swing. So in New Zealand, it's like not 490 feet and you free fall for like 470. You free fall for a very long time before you go on the story. How many times in your life have you free falled? Oh, a lot. A lot. How many would you say more than 10? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. More than 20. I'm going to say maybe 150 times. You have free falled 150 times in your life easily, easily felt free fall 150. No questions asked. I'm going to even, I mean, there was one day where I, where I was doing this, this like, yeah, I've, yeah, I've done a lot of, I've had a lot of free. Free fall is like, you got to be from free fall doesn't happen on a little fall. That's big parachute type height. You got to be at least, you got to be a solid 110 above the ground to feel any free fall whatsoever. But even at one, like I did a bungee jump in, in here at the bridge to nowhere. It was 110 feet. It was good free falls and it was a great, it was a great bungee jump, but there's nothing compared to like four and a half seconds of free fall or like I had 16 seconds. You feel 16 seconds on, on, but you end up catching yourself at some point. I did one. The one I did that was the most insane was an unattached free fall where you fall into a net 160 feet down and pull you up into like, into, you know, it's so fucking crazy is that I'm proud of these things, but I sweated the fucking fear of these things. Yes. I was a not a cool person to be around the day I did this jump and it was raining. Like it was misty and I was like, and I had to fly that day and I was such a fucking mess. Cause you are putting your, you put your life in other people's hands a lot, a lot. You trust the universe, whether you like, I've looked to dudes, I've looked to dudes. I can't even tell you this Duncan. I'm so glad we're talking about this. Cause this has been on my head, but I haven't really had anyone to talk about this too. Cause like, no, it's, you know what I mean? Like I have said to dudes at least 20 times, men, other men, always men going, Hey, I'm trusting you with my life right now. I'm going to live. Correct. And they're like, yes, a hundred percent. I go, you've double checked everything. There is nothing left that's going to like kill me. Right. I'm trusting you with my life. I've said that so many fucking times that it is, it is unnerving to think that it's now, now I don't even think to say it cause I'm like, I just go, you've double checked your work. Right. Like nothing's, now I say to people, like whenever I have like a stunt pilot or a pilot or a parachute guy with me, I go, I always ask them the same questions. Do you have children? Cause I need to know if you have anything to live for. Wow. How many times have you, uh, how many times has it not gone quite right? How it, what's, is it ever messed up? Or have you ever caught somebody not double checking? Was there ever a time you were, where you were actually in danger? No, no, everything's just, I mean, here's the thing is that, and there's probably a solid 20 times that I just wouldn't have known. Like there's probably a solid 20 times where I did things where anyone experienced sort of in like, that's a really fucking bad idea, but you just get, you just get away with it. You're lucky. Um, but like my whole thing, and I've said this every time, safety and redundancy is like the, that is my favorite saying in the world is that if you have two of everything, nothing's going to fucking break. Right. So you need to have two fucking lugs into the fucking rock to in two ropes, two carabiners, hook it twice to your, like I'm always safety and redundancy. And so, but there's been a time right there was, I just realized that this very last trip is that I got this new, uh, ATC clamp for climbing and I was like, oh cool. So oh, I get it. So two ropes go through here and I was like, how many times have I gone climbing with one fucking rope and they just been like, like I did it in New Zealand. I went climbing with one rope and this new little guide and I never worked a guide. No. It was like, oh, this is neat. And I had no one there to go like, Hey, by the way, that's old as fuck and one ropes dangerously. Shit. Wow. But yeah, I've never had anything go wrong. The biggest accident I had is this one right here. I wrote, I wrote burn on my hand. You can kind of see my fingers are fucked up here. Yeah. I see that is, uh, I was trying to, I was fucking around. I'd been safe as shit and we were doing this thing where we were repelling off this like a hundred and I think it was like a 210 foot arch and we're repelling down. And then once you got underneath it, it was wide open. So we were grabbing the rope and we were swinging each other. So you were flying around and I was trying to swing this guy and I grabbed onto the rope but he was going back and it ripped through my hands and it burned the fuck out of me. I mean, like I knew it. It was so instantaneously like this and I, my hand was on fire. It burnt so bad. That's the biggest. That's the biggest accident I've had. This is, in what you would, obviously you're addicted to this by now. Like this is a truck. A little bit, like a little bit, you just become, I don't like, I get, like we're going to Dubai in a couple, in like a couple months and I, I do not like skydiving. I do not like skydiving. I do not ever want to go skydiving again, but there's part of me that goes, dude, skydiving over Dubai would be badass. Just to see that island in the park, like I mean, you've heard of it and you've seen it online and that's one thing, but to be coming up over it, it's got to be fucking. So you're doing it? Yeah. Well, it's got to be Dubai. And that was me saying, I want to go skydiving in Dubai. And like another thing, like we're going to South Africa, I've swam with sharks a millions of times. I've taken my girls swimming in sharks, my, my, my fucking. You've taken your little girls into shark water. Look at this. Hang on. This is, this is the girls in a shark cage. Why? Yeah. I'm looking at this great picture of Bert's kids. One of them is giving the thumbs up there. She's giving a shaka. Look at the pinky. Oh, she's giving the Hawaiian the, what do you call the hang loose sign. Bert's kids are as badass as their dad. They're not, they don't seem even slightly scared. They seem like they're having a great day. They were definitely scared. Oh, they were. Everyone was scared. My wife was scared. But I've swam in cages with sharks. These are Galapagos sharks. They're 400 pounds. They're the size of, of, of pickup trucks long wise, but they're not like overwhelming. We're going to South Africa and I, I really, really want to swim with great white sharks. I want great white sharks around us in the cage. So you're addicted, you're addicted to this feeling, man. A little bit. Not a ton, but a little bit. Like a little bit you go, you just go like, like there's a, I get, I get into, like, like I think repelling is probably the most dangerous part of climbing, but I think it's fun as fuck. Yeah. I've gone repelling. That's a blast. I think it's cool as fuck to be in. Yeah. It's fucking fun. And, and I think healthy doses of safe fear are really healthy. I think they give you perspective in life and they, you know, it's like, I don't know. Like I feel like I don't have an, not a lot, not enough people live that get that. Even though what's interesting is we're always in the most precarious situation. If you're in a car, you're placing your life in the hands of whoever designed the car, you're trusting the tires and you're trusting everyone around you to not do something crazy while you're out there on the highway. When you're in an air, I was just on an airplane. When you're in an airplane, you are trusting that that system is going to work perfectly and that, that no one on the plane is going to freak out and do something weird. You're trusting that based on statistics, which is that generally planes don't crash. Generally people survive. If you drive in a car, you're going to be okay, but doesn't phase us. But what you're doing is the same thing. I mean, people get hurt from climbing a bunch, but it isn't a significant enough number that the activity is deemed illegal or insane. Base jumping is one that's crazy. I mean, the Himalayas is in or Everest is crazy, but because like what 10% of the people are 2% death rate or something when people, there's a every winter, every not winter, but every time people go up on that fucking thing, some percentage of them die. But yeah, I know what you're saying. It's putting yourself out of your comfort zone in these extreme ways, engaging in activities that are mostly safe, even though they seem terrifying, somehow teaches you how to live a better life. Yeah. Like it's, I don't know, it's like, I like serving sizes of terror. Like I like the single serving size of terror and like, I don't know if I could climb the Himalayas. Like I don't, that doesn't inspire me and I just think, I don't know if I want to walk that much. Like it's a lot of fucking exertion. Yeah. But like, we're going to Japan in December and I was like, I was like, I really want to go diving again. And I know that I'm scared of it, but I go, I don't care. I want to go one more time. I want to go, I want to, I want to, I want, it's nice to get over the fear. It's nice to like conquer somewhat of, of these, these small terrors. I don't think I'll ever do that. Like I've gotten there with helicopters. I've gotten a lot better with helicopters. I've gotten, I had a day where I got in a helicopter once a day and I was like, by the end, I was like, not as freaked out as possible. And then again, you get in one helicopter with turbulence and a helicopter in turbulence is fucking terrifying. Oh God. You are dropping and dropping, headsets are flying and oh shit. Oh God, I get turbulence on the plane just for a second. I'm just shitting myself. The helicopters suck dick. Oh, that, that reaction that you have in turbulence, it's that feeling of, what is it, man? Is it, is, is the thing that's healthy about this, that we get reminded of our mortality? Is it that we're reminded of how precious life is and that we get a rebirth experience like anytime you do something, so anytime you parachute, when your feet touch the ground. It's not then. Have you ever skydived? I, I, I know, but I, it's not then, it's not then, it's when the shoot opens. Right. When the shoot opens, that is when you, that is, that is the opposite of anxiety and is that moment of clarity of, of celebrating life. Cause your death, when you jump out of a plane, you're, you have a death penalty that is being given to you by the universe for defying the laws of gravity. You've been sentenced to death. You've been sentenced to death and you, and you know, the jury's out, you're falling, the jury's out and you simply are waiting. There is no more presenting your case. You're waiting for them to return and the judge to go, ladies and gentlemen, the jury, have you found a verdict? And the verdict is the moment that sweet, sweet shoot opens up and you've been, your sentence has been commuted. You are now allowed to experience brand new life. You've been reborn. And that is, that is, it's like an orgasm. What, like when I have orgasms, my brain shouts shit, I can't control it. It just goes like salon selectives and I'm like, what, like, I don't know where that came from. It's like registered. Salon selectives. That happened one time. I had an orgasm. Do they still make that shampoo? I don't know, but I love it. That's an ancient shampoo. I love the smell of salon selectives. I remember that. I think they had a pretty extensive ad campaign in the nineties. Salon selectives. Yeah. Salon style. Salon selectives. I had an orgasm one time and my brain just went salon selectives and I went, what the fuck? And it was like just as great. And I have, like, when I have an orgasm, my brain will just shout like three things real quick. Like dog paw. Like what? I don't know. I can't control it. And so salon selectives is very specific that did, that is an actual thing my brain said one time. And, um, but when, when that shoot opens and it pulls your brain, my brain flooded with just imagery of what I'd be getting to do now that I was alive and it was like, first thing was laying. I remember the first thing I thought was I'm going to get to lay in the front yard with my daughters and stare up at the trees. That was the first thing I thought second thing I thought was I'm going to get to eat pizza again. I love pizza. I love pizza and, uh, and I think I forgot what the third thing was, but it wasn't beer, which is so crazy. So I thought, I want, I thought I'd be like, I want a beer after this. Yeah. I sat with a beer in like the car that we were taking back. Someone got me a 12 pack of beer because I had done it. I didn't drink a beer. I was just like staring off into space like, like fuck, I'm a lot. This is, I've never felt more a lot. I've never really remembered the sensation of realizing my taste buds or of just like slowing down and being like, you're going to be, that feeling is now there's a term that I heard, uh, that, uh, it's a, I think it's a Japanese term called katsu and it's a term for a temporary moment of enlightenment, like a temporary, when you get those little moments, you're like, ah, oh shit. I get it. And then those moments go away. Katsu. Like when my, like when my daughter last night goes, I go, we're leaving the restaurant. I go, Ayla, grab, Georgia, grab me, grab me a toothpick and she was like, what for? I go to clean my teeth and she went, oh, toothpick. Oh, and I was like, yeah. She's like, I get it. You pick your teeth. I was like, what did you think it stood for? She goes, I have no idea. I thought it was just a word. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. That's it. That's that moment of like, oh, oh, hold on. In that moment, your daughter's universe gets completely redefined and a central component in everyone's life, whether you like it or not, is somehow toothpicks have warmed their way into human society. You're always going to see them. They're laying around the store. You see them at restaurants and now her reality has shifted permanently. This one little pixel of her universe got redefined, added meaning, katsu. And in the same way, these moments of realizing how precious your life is, earning your life back, recognizing that you're going to get to survive and live. Those, that's got to be what enlightenment's like. When people talk about enlightenment, it's got to be that moment where not because it's like every day, especially folks like you, I mean, I think a lot of people who's in this podcast, most people are secretly laboring under the fear of death or secretly laboring under this basic general discontent that's hidden under so many distraction mechanisms that we surround ourselves with to desperately not have to deal with the fact that inside of us at all times, if we haven't addressed it is a tumultuous cauldron of horror that comes to the surface only when we're in states of like danger, you know, like when you're in a state of danger or not even danger, irritation, like when, if you, the next time you get irritated with somebody, spend a second with that feeling and just remember, okay, here's what it feels like when I'm irritated with a person, when I'm feeling angry and I'm feeling aversion to a person. Now, keep that memory of the feeling, take a snapshot, get a little like my sample of it, a little leaf sample of it in your mind, okay, that's what I feel like when I'm there. Then the next time you're around someone who's in another annoying situation, look at the feeling, you'll notice it's the exact same fucking feeling. And then the next time you're feeling anxiety, you'll notice it's the exact same feeling. And then all of a sudden you realize like, holy shit, it's not that these things in the outside world are inducing the state of anxiety or feeling angry or feeling awful. It's that it's constantly underneath everything all the time, like a river of sewage running through the depths of my being that I only become aware of when certain aspects of my reality don't line up to my expectations. And then I'm aware of the shit river and, but I blame it on the externals, right? But the idea is what if you get rid of that shit river in your heart? What would happen if somehow you were able to drain it or get rid of all the anxiety and fear and terror and all the underlying laying in bed, gnashing your teeth and worrying about your death. If somehow all of that river just got completely drained, then the next time you were around an annoying person, you wouldn't feel annoyed at all because you would over, you would vanquish that thing inside of you. And it sounds like these moments that you're having, they're moments that somehow overwhelm or temporarily purify or make you grateful to be alive. And the gratitude cleanses that internal state of anxiety that I think you experience a bunch, which I experienced too. I don't know how often you experience it, but I'm experiencing anxiety generally wracked with anxiety. I'm having anxiety right now. I'm having anxiety. You can I tell you what my anxiety is? Please. That I for a second, I thought, I am I monitoring this? I should be have headsets on. I went, oh, wait, this isn't my podcast. And I started panicking going, are my, are our levels good? Or are we great, great? Like I literally, I started panicking about that. I panic nonstop. I think sometimes my fear is if I let go of the anxiety, then real terror will show up. Well, that's, and that's why they say that life in Buddhism, life is suffering. The cause of suffering is attachment. And what you just said is that you're attached to the anxiety. You can't let go of it in the same way that that to respect the anxiety. Well, you need to say to the anxiety, I understand you're here to keep me safe. And I understand you're here to, to make sure that if I don't have you, then I'll die, but I've had you a bunch. And then as like a good luck charm, as long as I have you, I won't die. Well, that is, this is, so this is, it's a really fascinating idea, which is that, that thing that you're, the real terror that you're talking about, which is very similar to scuba diving down into the darkness. That real terror you're talking about is formlessness. It's the people are so horrified by the essential formlessness or the non-beingness or the reality of the human situation, which is that we are essentially emptiness that is having the illusion of somethingness. People are so terrified of losing or of dealing with the truly being in the present moment, which is a word that's been used so many times. It doesn't mean anything anymore, but really, really, really being in the present moment, which is that state of LSD level merging into everything. You know, when you take enough LSD out, you're not there anymore. If that ever happened to you, just a little bit of LSD and I'm not there. That, that thing, which LSD gives to you of complete merging into, into the universe and losing yourself completely. That's actually what we are, but that's such a terrifying experience to be inside of that we construct a personality and we construct a place to hide. Inside of, so we don't have to deal with that. It's compared to standing in a room where the floor is made of razor blades. And rather than dealing with the fact that you're standing in a room where the floor is made of razor blades and not wearing any shoes, you try to create a fantasy ledge that you can sit on top of to not have to deal with the pain of the razor blades and that ledges your personality or most specifically your anxiety and the sense of disdain or disgust or aversion or that terrified feeling is a defense mechanism that your ego and consciousness are using to not have to deal with the fact that you're actually an entire universe experiencing a temporary fleeting moment as a being. Is that crazy? So rather than do that, rather than jump back into that universal state of consciousness, just sweating a bed. That's it. That's it. You sweat in a fucking bed. You're always grasping for, you know, like you're always trying to get into a situation, into a panic situation. You think that you're a victim to your anxiety. The reality is you're using your anxiety as a kind of life raft that you can float on this ocean of impermanence on to give you a sense of form. I do the same thing. You're attached to it. It's what the next time you, if you really watch the next time you get a chance to feel true anxiety or the next time you really, even if you're feeling off, you really look, you'll notice you like it. You'll notice that you actually are kind of addicted to that feeling or that you're. Yeah, there is like a, there is a weird kind of like breathlessness that comes with excitement that you're like, Oh, fuck. Like, like it's a, yeah, I wonder if, oh, God dang it. I need to, I need to really like. I need to, I was thinking, I talked to, this is now when it sounds like someone who has no soul whatsoever, but I was talking to my agency the other day and I was like, if you guys can think of a way to monetize my research and anxiety, because I feel like I'm, I'm doing like first person, like experimentation on panic, anxiety, fear, getting over it. Exactly. No, I think that's brilliant, man. And because that, and that's the other idea is that when you recognize that when you go into the land of anxiety, you are exploring a terrain that so many of us are lost within, and that if you can get your head when you're inside the terrain, instead of like a lot of us who are just like, what the fuck I'm going to die. Oh, God, fucking traffic in LA is horrible. Is it my fucking, is my testicles swollen? Do I have moobs? What the fuck is happening to my air? I really look old today. People are just wandering around this forest, like, you know, yammering about whatever that is, whatever it is that they think is causing the anxiety. If some, if while you're in that forest for a second, be like, OK, OK, hold on. Here I am. I'm in the force of anxiety again. Let's see what's really going on here. And then you start analyzing the floor and the fauna and looking at the minute pixelated, tiny little pieces of it. And you start realizing that it's totally not even what you thought it was at all, that it's not even anxiety. It's not even anxiety. The thing you thought was anxiety was just a cover over a whole thing that's even deeper than the anxiety. And these are, you know, Jack Cornfield is this Buddhist teacher talks about this as a kind of like you can actually visualize it as a form, see what form it is. It will have a color. It will have a taste. It will have a shape. It will have specific, you know, like a foodie. Well, if you like, if I eat, if I eat some kind of nice dish at a restaurant, I'm going to eat it real fast and I'm not going to know what it tastes like. Two minutes later, I just remember it was like cheese. There was cheese and salt, but like a foodie will eat something and be like, ah, there with you can just taste the vedalia onions and this reinvention of a southern recipe and the perfect amount of whatever it is they're going to say, it's kind of like KFC. Yeah, damn, this is good fried chicken. This is crunchy. Yeah, that's my that's the grammar that I have with food because I'm not a foodie. Same with wine. I don't I don't have the language for it, but you can become that with your anxiety or with your emotional states. And that's called mindfulness so that you start when you. So every time anxiety comes into you, every time that comes to you again, you're actually being served this wonderful dish where you get to taste and experience like when you roll wine in your mouth, you start looking at the anxiety and rolling it around, try to get deeper into it. One quick thing you realize is the moment you do that, the moment you really are like, oh, here it is again, let's start dissecting it or examining it, it'll go away. Sometimes it just is like, fuck you, you're not going to examine me, bitch. It tries to hide because it doesn't want you to know the truth of it or it seems to be of and then that's when you realize you're addicted to the anxiety because you'll try to get it to come back. You're like, no, no, don't leave, don't leave, don't leave, come back. You realize that the relationship is one where you actually want it to be there because if it isn't there, it creates this feeling of like, now what am I? I'm going to, I'm going to do, I'm going to do pocket. One of the things you said to me a long time ago that I don't do enough of is you were like, we were talking about growth. It was on the podcast where I had an anxiety attack. Yeah. And you walked me through, you gave me like a guided meditation and I got through it and I was like, I forget why I was so anxious then. It was a health thing. I'm not sure though, I thought it was something you're worried about. It was health. Oh, God damn it. Isn't it funny? You don't like you gave me so much sleepless nights. I don't even remember. There you go, man, exactly. Because it's not the real important thing to realize is that because the mind can't abide by the fact that you have a never ending state of anxiety deep within you, it will try to create or attach itself to an external reason to make sense of the fact. I've had my brain go. I've had my brain. I have I'm going to I'm going to this. I have a mole on the back of my can't fucking find it down. I have a mole. Yeah. Yeah. On the back of my leg. It's just a dark mole. Yeah, it's like it's black, but it's been there forever. It's just a very it's not it's not big. It's small. Sure. But that day that I was in the that I was telling you that I was borrowing serotonin on the boat, not shooting, didn't have to do the thing. I was literally spiraling into a great, beautiful fucking tornado going up. And I was just so positive. And I was like, I mean, I was like spiritual. And I was yeah, paddleboarding at Sot Canyon, diving with my mask, diving down to the Sot Canyon's little holes and then swimming up and it was so fucking beautiful. And then we're on the top of the boat. We're taking the boat back in. We're done for the day. We're done. I have nothing to do. And I'm just sitting there thinking and I look back at my calf and like in like a real like size of my body up way. I'm looking at my calf and I see that little spot and my brain goes like, I heard him like go, this is going to fucking freak us out. Yeah. And I was like, why are you doing that? And he was like, it's cancer. It's cancer, buddy. You never put sunscreen on the back of your calves and your entire life. This is what you get. And I was like, why would you do this? And he's like, you deserve it. I I heard my brain telling me. You knew this was going to happen. You knew the good times could only last for so long. I had to give you something bad and this is what it is. And I was like, I'm not letting it happen. And I literally was like, I mean, I'm not being healthy right now, but I went and made a cocktail and I was like, I'm tapping the fuck out. I'm not letting you drive this day. And I had a drink and then then the voice just is like, it's like muted. He's like, oh, I thought we were in the sauce. I'm in on the back of her. I'm trying to scare you. I'm hammered. I'm fucking. You know what you should do, man? You know that book? Conversations with God. No. Well, somebody wrote a book called Conversations with God and like they actually like ask God questions in the book and God responds. But a conversation with that part of your mind would be really interesting. If you actually interviewed that part of your mind, you should have that part of your mind on a podcast, the part that's always trying to scare you and freak you out, because it's a funny thing when you're like, you always say, my brain said this, my brain said that you need to talk. You need to ask your brain the next time it shows up. Hey, what are you, by the way? Can you tell me what you are? Do you have a form? What's your form? Because you're not me and you seem to be inside of me. I can't really see you. You're a you're just some you're just a voice that seems to be coming out of the nothingness. Yeah. Because essentially, what is that? What is no idea? And what does it mean that you have to that you're a bifurcated being? You have this thing inside of you that talks to you. The thing inside of you that talks back to the thing. And then the general state of awareness of these two things, having a conversation within the Chrysher collective, what the fuck is that thing? My crew, my crew for the trip for my show, calls it a big brain versus little brain. And they're like, because they're like, is big brain talking right now? And because I'll know when I'm like, where like I've been on the road too long and I'm not being healthy. And I'll just start like burning it to the ground. And they're like, is big brain driving right now? And I'll be like, yeah, a little bit. And then little brains, the little victim that wakes up like the perfect example was I thought I had skin cancer in Italy one morning because I got up and my face felt weird and I had like a dry patch right here. And I was like, what the fuck is that? It looked red and then it was little brain woke up with me. And little brain was like, it's nothing. Just don't worry about it, buddy. Dude, you know what? Take a shower, ignore it, have a healthy breakfast, go for a jog. In two hours, you won't even think about it. And then all of a sudden, you hear big brain like waking up like someone's doing something on her face. And I'm like, and the little brain's like, don't say anything to him. He won't notice it. Then big brain's like, oh, we got cancer. Here we go. There you go. You're like, but I mean, like the time I called you from Hawaii and I was fucking losing my shit, that was big brain driving and it was just big brain going. Big brain was like, little brain was like, call Duncan. He's gone through this. He's your friend. He'll talk you through this. He'll tell you what we need to know. It's 95% survival rate. You kept saying that big brain's like, well, yeah, if you're Duncan, you're fucking older, you're gone. You're gone. Big brain is is the yeah. Well, big brain needs to be recognized as an ally as an ally. Yeah, big brain, I think big brain is like the next time big brain shows up, it's time to like have an interview with big brain or to like really have a conversation with big brain or begin to study that part of yourself because it's such a those things are always, you know, in stories, right? Yeah. The thing that you the in legends, the beggar comes to your door. It comes to the door of someone and they give the beggar a nice meal and some food. And the next day, the beggar is transformed into the archangel Michael and grants them some boon, but the God has always disguised as this kind of like scary, freaky thing that we try to avoid. And maybe that's what this big brain thing is, is actually the key. Yeah, I can is the thing that has hidden somewhere within it in his mind, a secret or some thing to tell you that you haven't quite figured out how to ask him the right question yet, because if big brain wasn't there or if big brain suddenly turned into, I don't know, someone who was like. On my team, on your team in a real way, or even someone who was like, yeah, so what if we die, you have cancer, but so what we're going to be, I don't know what I don't know what it is, but that those facets of the mind are all considered to be. Constructed of the same material, like, you know how Taco Bell is basically the exact same ingredients mixed into different forms, burritos, tacos, whatever it is, it's all the exact same four things mixed into. So in the same way, it's like these facets of consciousness are all considered to be the same parts mixed in different ways, and which is why the microscopic observation of them to see the deeper components in it suddenly make you realize that the thing is formlessness. It doesn't really have a form. There is no big brain. There is no little brain. There is no brain. There's just a state of expansive awareness that has within it these moments of dialogue that pop up into it, but you're not big brain or little brain. You're the thing watching big brain and little brain talk, right? You're the observer. I'm the innocent bystander. Yeah, you're the you're the state of awareness. And that's that's my that's called mindfulness. That's the state of like, you're not the anxiety. You're the thing that's aware of the anxiety. You can't be the anxiety any more than you could be at the computer screen. When you're looking at a computer screen, it's if you're aware of a thing, then you are not the thing. You're just this state of awareness with these moments happening inside of it. I'm going to do a podcast. I was saying this, I was saying this earlier, but you were like we were that day. We were talking about the idea that you can take chances. You can do whatever you want. Who gives a fuck? Just do it. It's podcasts. That's the beauty of it. Yeah, I'm going to do a podcast the next time I know that I'm doing something like I'll do it in Dubai when I'm about to go skydiving and I'll just go. I'll just wait till the anxiety kicks in and then four in the morning when I'm wide awake and I can't go back to yes, I'm just going to turn on the mic and go, all right, here's how it feels where my brain is. That's it. You should collect those. You should make a collection of those so that people can listen to it the next time they're feeling anxiety, because the moment anyone, the thing is, if you over cut, if you can figure out a way to out of the maze, this maze that you're in, or if you can figure out a way to like help us who have anxiety problems, figure out a method or some way to diminish, reduce or transform it, then what a great gift to the world, man. It's just as simple as cutting your toenails. It's like a button. There's just like a weird button under your leg that you push like that new thing where people are saying when you're at, when you're freaking out on too much marijuana, smell black pepper. If you heard that, I heard that. Yeah. What was that? I think Willie Nelson said it, but somehow I haven't tried it. But the other day I was freaking out on marijuana and I was too stoned to figure out how to get the pepper open. I'm in the kitchen holding this pepper thing and I'm like, I don't know. I don't know how to get the pepper out. I just gave up and went into a bad trip. But if I put a black pepper corn in your mouth and eat it or smell black pepper, this is the new folk remedy for a overdose, marijuana overdose. Yeah, I've had I've had horrific experiences on marijuana. Me too. I've had like those like soul searching. Yeah. I can't. I can't. My mouth feels weird. I can't remember if I forgot how to breathe. My heart's racing like I can taste the color yellow like just terrifying. Me too, man, really dark, dark moments. If you overdose on that drug or if you don't respect it, she will fuck you up, man, more than any other drug. You have to be very respectful when you're when you're doing marijuana and make sure you're not do if you do it too much, if you're doing it all the time. And this is a lot of people don't like to hear this and disagree with me ferociously over this, but I don't think you should do it all the time. I think you need to do it every once in a while. And that's when you get the best highs. But when you're doing it every day, all day long, just mark that just if you can be mindful out there, get bring a little notebook with you and put it or within your phone, mark down every time you're a cunt to somebody. And you'll notice that your level of being a cunt in the world. If you're getting stoned constantly, you know, the stoner irritability. Like when you get around a stoner, like a hardcore stoner, aren't they a little cunty? Aren't they don't they have this weird type of anger that pops out? Yeah, it's unless they're stoned. There is a general, like a little bit of like catty, like a little bit of like. Yeah, it's catty. Yeah, that's exactly the right word for it, too. It's this kind of catty cuntiness that'll come out of them. It's just like we greasy mean it's like then they get high and they're like, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, then they kind of, but even when they're stoned, they can still be a little turd turdiness to them. It seems like I think you got to moderate it, man. Every at least do it like, I mean, it's not so dumb to actually say, you know, you shouldn't do a drug every day, all day long. It does sound weird to say. What was that? What was I was just talking to someone about doing drugs. And I was like, and they're like, you know, you're 40, you're 42. Like, what are you talking about? And I was like, oh, yeah. But I have a living living a different microcosm of people. Yeah, comics are a little different of a brain. No, no, no, no, no, no. That your friends may just have problems. Yeah. And I was like, oh, yeah, maybe. Yeah, maybe. But what drugs are you on, motherfucker? The next time somebody asks you to not take drugs, ask them if they smoke, drink coffee, take antidepressants as every ask them if they like to eat sugar. There are everyone's on fucking drugs. That's what it was. They were they were judging my drinking and judging and judging marijuana use in general. And I was like, and they're like, call me old school. But you give me a half an ambient at the end of the night and I'm fine. And I was like, whoa, really hold on. So wait, ambient is OK to take every single night. I go, I said, wait, ambient is OK to take. And they're like, yeah. And I go, how often do you take it? And they're like, every night, you take it every fucking night. Like, that's not healthy. And they're like, it's prescribed. And I was like, hey, dummy, people prescribed marijuana to people. Like, just because it's prescribed doesn't mean I knew it, man. I knew that as I'll talk to you as a junkie because because it's always like I've had, you know, I've had people who are profound alcoholics look down on the fact that I take marijuana regularly. I've had people who are hardcore caffeine addicts who all day long are drinking coffee, always wound up. And it's a, by the way, caffeine kills way more people a year than we. Caffeine's a drug. Yeah, I've overdosed on caffeine. Yeah, you can OD on caffeine. Sick as fuck for two days on caffeine. Yeah. So I've had those people chastise me for doing drugs. And it's always, it's like, no, you're on drugs. You're just on a drug that you don't realize is a drug. Oh, really? We'll see, just stop smoking pot and just drink coffee for a year and see how your life changes. You mean I'll have awful shits? You know, my digestion will be destroyed and I'll be in a nervous state and start scolding people for being autonomous in their decision. I'll start being douchey at Starbucks. Yeah. What's that going to do? Because really, you get to choose what reality tunnel you want to have and your brain is constantly pumping out all kinds of delicious psycho actives into your system all the fucking time. I don't think there's anything wrong with being a person who likes to color their reality tunnel with psychoactive chemicals. I just think that when you're doing, you need to recognize that's what you're doing and you need to make sure that you meter it out in a responsible, healthy way to maximize the experience so that it's more fun. I miss, I miss, I miss marijuana only only in the fact that, like, I just, it just doesn't, it does not fit perfectly into my life anymore. Yeah, because I'm traveling a lot. I would never travel with it. You can't. And I just, it's just just so many fucking variables. Once you get busted, traveling with it changes my life entirely. You can't travel with it. I wouldn't travel with it. I have kids around. So I would, well, here, let me work backwards. I'm really obsessed with my lung function lately. Like I noticed being out of breath one time and I was like, that fucking sucks. Yeah, I'm all about, like, I kind of stop smoking cigars and I kind of just like just like running and trying to get my lungs to be like, like, I kept thinking, wouldn't it be cool if I, because I have a problem with altitude? As soon as I get to altitude, I'm out of breath. Anywhere I go altitude, I'm like, so I wouldn't smoke and then I have kids. So I can't really have edibles floating around. Nope, you can't do it, man. You can't. And also, besides from all that, if a part of your brain is like, hey, let's not do marijuana right now, listen to it. Yeah, you don't do marijuana. It's if you're, if there's a time in the future where you decide to do it, do it. But that's another thing, you know, people eat when they're not hungry. And that doesn't just include food. It includes sex and it includes substances and includes everything. It's weird when you listen to your body and actually are inputting what it needs. It's your own needs as opposed to as opposed to this fucking rat and a cage dopamine receptors. Yeah, you just like like when I did, I did this cleanse like two years ago that where I lost like fucking 45 pounds and I did this cleanse. And the second I did it, I realized how many times I simply say to myself, I need a treat. I need to reward myself. Yes, I just walked by the fridge and I was like a little reward for what? For what? I didn't do a fucking thing. But it's my brain going, you need some dope. Yeah, some dopamine, just a combo, right? Yeah, combos. That's it. You need to create, you need to you need to create a goddamn sense of self. And part of our sense of self is there were sweet Diet Coke. Sweet, delicious, wonderful Diet Coke. Not we aren't sponsored by Diet Coke, by the way. Bert, we should wrap it up. I've kept you too long where it's an hour and 20 minutes. I do have a question for you as you're cleaning up at Bert's. When Bert opens up his mini fridge, it's an avalanche of beers. Awesome. On on to power tools. When Bert Kreischer opens his mini fridge, hundreds of beers fall onto a black and decker, some kind of hardcore power tool and weights. This really is a man cave. Your beers, you just had a beer avalanche on to your power tools. The thing I'm proudest of is this right on my spin bike is my BC, my climbing harness, my ATC, my mask, my carabiners. That's like my my little pride corner right there. That's badass, man. Yeah, but I'm sure that fucking regulators are getting destroyed right now. Bert, I've got a question for you. This is for the audience. They're going to this they've they've I've gotten I feel whenever I hang out with you and I hear about your adventures, I'm not living to my maximum. I feel like I need to do so. I feel like I need to face my fear more and put myself out there and get outside my comfort zone, people listening, I think probably feel like that as one of the modern explorers and adventurers of the world living today as one of the bravest people I know, can you recommend to me and to my listeners something that we could do this week, that some kind of activity we can do to take us out of our comfort zones and to give us that awesome feeling of rebirth that you're talking about. It doesn't involve parachuting. The thing, the thing I the thing I honestly and you can't find them in the states, but rope swings are the fucking it is the shit. It is the canyon swings are the greatest. You got to go to Europe or to New Zealand. What about the United States in the United States? I think, you know, I honestly, the thing I would say, and this is the way my brain works and I did this the other day to my wife and her friends, my wife and her friends, I go out on the road and I come back out of these crazy stories and my wife's always like, I'm not living, I'm not living. I don't know. You know what I did? I just bought her a ticket to London this weekend. This week, take, get like two friends and just plan out a week three months from now where it's really inexpensive and get yourself a ticket anywhere. Awesome. Fucking anywhere. Get yourself just like two friends and go, let's just hang out for a week for like a weekend together and get yourself out of your comfort zone. I personally say go to like, if you go up to like Seattle, there's so many you can go canyoning in Seattle that is it is fucking a blast. You get to do all the all the repelling and climbing and jumping off waterfalls. But short of that, we're in Seattle. Do you know a company that we could we can go to? I could totally pull it up right now. Oh, I just gave my password. Watch it. This is awesome. I love Seattle. Flip Seattle. Oh, Portland is Portland. It's Portland. We went in Portland. My bad. Trip Flip Portland friends. Here's a recommended adventure from the Lord of Adventure himself. Burke Kreischer. Trip Flip. You can go. I'll have this link on the website, too. I went canyoneering in Portland, Oregon. Canyoneering is bad ass, man. I did that once. It was so fun. I didn't even know there were canyons in Portland. Yeah, this is it is. Let's see. It'll tell you the. Wow, I didn't know that was in Portland. Yeah, look how fat I look. We got Bert standing in a rainfall. You look awesome, man. Yeah. This is I. It doesn't say the name. We'll find the link. But we went canyoneering in the gorges in Portland. Look at this. Tell me this isn't something you can want to do. Jumping off of that. Wow. It's fucking amazing. That is awesome. I will say this and I say this wholeheartedly. If you're going to take one big trip in your life, go to New Zealand. New Zealand is the most beautiful place I've ever been in my entire life. Go to Queenstown, New Zealand. It is amazing. We did a canyon swing and the shot over canyon there. And it is the it is the most beautiful place I've ever been. But if you book a trip with a couple of your friends and just say we're going to go like you can go to fucking Ohio and go to go to go to the. Just get to get a fucking boat and go to Putin Bay. Guys, if there's any if I can motivate you, here's here's an invitation. Do this trip, go on a random trip. It's Costa Rica, the Envision Festival. Go to fucking Brazil. You can find a cheap tip trip to Costa Rica and just go to Costa Rica and backpack around and have a fucking blast fruit off the side of the street and record. If you guys record little sound bites while you're out there and send them to me. And they're interesting enough. I'll put them on the podcast and we could have little clips of reports back from following Bert's freak out challenge, which is if you want to have an interesting life or you want to jump out of your comfort zone, find a friend, plan a trip to some weird place as soon as you can within your budget. And let us know about it. Bert, thank you so much for being on the podcast. Duncan, I love you too, man. I really do. I love I love it. Stinks that we're only home. We only get to podcast or do this.

330^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - LANCE BANGS! Transcript and Discussion^2014-01-08^Hello, friends. It's me, Duggar Trussell, and you are listening to the Duggar Trussell Family Hour podcast, Hare Krishna. Happy 2014. For the last couple of days, I've been trying to record an intro to this podcast, and I keep coming up short every time. This is one of the frustrating things about making this podcast is I don't feel right just releasing them if I can't say the thing that I'm trying to say and say it honestly, and it's really frustrating because I guess I could, you know, just do, okay, here's the commercials and here's the guests, but I don't want to do this right now because it's the first podcast of 2014, and I feel really superstitious about that or something, which is ridiculous. But here's the problem. I have cognitive dissonance right now. My mind is going crazy because this week, I have to go and get chest x-rays, and I have to get a blood test, which I have to do every four months for the next two years as part of the program that happens after you get testicular cancer. And that, every time I have to do this, it freaks me the fuck out. And I really am forced to try to implement some of the stuff that I've been learning, and it's really hard for me to do because the idea is that everything that comes to you in the universe is a teaching and no matter what it is, you know, and sometimes the teaching is like, oh my God, I just had a beautiful baby with this woman that I'm completely in love with, and the teaching is like, is deepening your love with another human being. And those are the divine, beautiful, sweet forms of the teachings. But a lot of the times the teaching is not that. A lot of the times the teaching is not the beginning of a relationship. It's not falling in love. It's realizing that you're at your wits' end and that you don't have an easy solution to a problem, or that the solution to the problem is not the solution that you would like it to be. I don't know. In this situation, there's nothing I could do. I have to go get these chest x-rays. I have to get the blood tests. I could ignore them and just hope for the best, but I've got to go and do it, and my body reacts to it, and I just freak out, and everything gets colored by this weird anxiety. In the first probably 17 versions of the intro that I've been trying to record, I didn't even mention that this was bothering me, and then I realized, like, oh, the reason that you can't get this intro out is because all you're thinking about is the fact that in a few days, you've got to go get chest x-rays. Oh, P.S. I've also been hanging out with my ex-girlfriend again. So I'm all scrambled up right now, friends, and I don't have a good... I wanted to have some nice inspirational New Year's Eve message for all of you, but really, I'm just going to ask for your help, which is that if anybody out there has something that they're afraid of, that they're putting off, can you email me? You can go to dunkintrustle.com, go through the contact form. Those messages go directly to me, but I want to hear what you're afraid of that's coming up, and also, if you're somebody who's had to deal with similar medical stuff like this, like having to go for tests, can you email me if you have any tricks for dealing with this stuff? And then on the next podcast, maybe I could combine the emails that I get from people who are afraid of an upcoming thing with the emails from people who figured out the best way to deal with impending things of this nature, and there's some kind of solution that we can find. Also, has anyone out there ever successfully gotten back together with their ex-girlfriend and it's actually worked? I'd like to hear those stories too. So that's where I'm at. You know what? I'm going to leave you with a quote that I found in this Jack Cornfield book I'm reading on Buddhist psychology. I don't know how it relates to what I just said, but here's an amazing quote. Maybe this will apply to somebody out there. The danger is not that the soul should doubt whether there is any bread, but that by a lie, it should persuade itself that it is not hungry. I'm going to read it one more time. The danger is not that the soul should doubt whether there is any bread, but that by a lie, it should persuade itself that it is not hungry. I love that. It's Simone Whale, a French philosopher, and that's in Jack Cornfield's book on Buddhist psychology, which I have on my Kindle. It's really good. But man, see that's the thing. It's, even now just talking about how I'm just admitting that I'm afraid of this upcoming chest x-ray and exam and admitting that I still have feelings for my ex-girlfriend. It makes me feel so much better than pretending that that's not the case. And maybe that's the answer is just and feel what you're feeling. I think that's what Jack Cornfield would say, but I want to hear what you guys have to say. And I also want to hear what are you afraid of that's coming in the future? Let me know. Maybe we could figure this stuff out together because I do think for a lot of people that's got to be a big problem is anxiety about what's coming up, medical tests, surgeries, dates, exams in school, whatever it is. Just let me know. Stuff at your job. I want to hear these stories. And for those of you who have found successful ways of dealing with this stuff that don't involve tequila, let me know. I want to hear that too. DuncanTrustle.com. Go to the contact section. Those go straight to me. Woohoo! We have a new sponsor and I'm very excited about this sponsor because they're a badass company called Warby Parker who have upset the vice grip hold that greedy glasses companies have had on the eye glass industry for a long time. Eye glasses are too expensive. They just are. I'm on a website right now. It's a very popular glasses website. I'm not going to say the name of the company. I'm going through their glasses. These glasses are minimum, minimum, minimum $329 for glasses. Are you fucking kidding me? Oh, here's some for $300. $300. That's their cheapest pair of glasses. It's like what exactly are your glasses made out of that you can rationalize charging $300 for these things because it's just cheap, lightweight, metal, and plastic. These aren't assembled using discarded spaceship parts. You didn't go on to a meteor to mine the materials for your overpriced tacky glasses. This is everywhere. I have two qualities that aren't getting any better in my life. Number one, I'm blind as a bat at night. And number two, I lose everything. I leave things behind like a toddler, just a trail of shoes and socks and credit cards and bars and everything. I have sweaters and jackets. I just leave stuff behind and glasses. For me, my glasses will last maybe, I don't know, three months if I'm lucky and then I'll chew them to pieces or I'll sit on them or my dog will carry them away or they go away. So there's no fucking way I can pay $300 for a pair of goddamn glasses. It's a rip off. Warby Parker is badass because this is a company that sells glasses that start at $95 and they're really cool glasses. They look awesome and this is actually, I heard a great story. I think it was on NPR, an interview with one of the founders of the companies and they were talking about how this is like a kind of representation of these new products that are disrupting industries because the eyeglass industry is an industry where everybody just decided to start selling their glasses for way too much money and that didn't have to happen. Warby Parker is disrupting that. And you know, there's not just like these new glasses stores. I've gone into like these used boutique, used eyeglass boutiques like in Echo Park and holy fucking God, you look at the price tag on some of these glasses and it will make you urinate. You'll just piss your pants in stunned horror when you realize that this pair of glasses that still has the chew marks on them from whatever trucker used to wear them in the 50s are now being sold for $900. I've seen glasses that cost that much to the point where I actually honestly thought about going at my first impulse was to ask the guy if there was a mistake like an extra zero on there, but I didn't because the guy was like a dominant super hipster type person like wearing seven scarfs and suspenders and circus boots. So I just left frustrated. I've been driving around blind as a bat and now that I'm in this partnership with Warby Parker, I have the impetus to finally get a new pair of glasses because my last pair of glasses literally disintegrated on my head. They just fell off of my head when I was in a photo booth with my ex-girlfriend. So Warby Parker, here's how it works. It is an online company. You go to warbyparker.com and you pick out five pairs of glasses and they will ship these glasses directly to you. You can try these glasses on in the comfort and safety of your own home instead of under the scathing glare of some pseudo sophisticate who's been selling cheap plastic to morons for years capitalizing off of the fact that their optic nerves are disintegrating with age. What a pig. You can try these on in front of your dog. You can try these on in front of the mirror. You can try these on in front of your girlfriend, but you don't have to compete for the one mirror in whatever store at the mall you've happened to stumble into. You can actually pose. How are you going to pose in the mall? How are you going to do your faces? How are you going to do your secret faces at the mall? You can try these glasses on in your bathroom and do as many of your secret faces that you want, the various angles, whatever you want. You could vogue for a while. They'll send you five pairs of these things. If you go to warbyparker.com forward slash family hour, they will send you these three day shipping for free. That's a great deal. If you've been putting off getting glasses, what are you doing? Are you going to wait until you finally run over that trigger-treater? That's a little dated. Whoever, I don't know, some treater, someone running across the street. Are you going to like, you don't want to be the grim reaper in the life of a family just because you didn't take the time to buy glasses because you couldn't afford them because these unscrupulous, evil, eyeglass vendors are selling overpriced glasses that the world can't afford. Here's what else is cool about warbyparker. Every time you buy a pair of glasses from them, they donate a pair of glasses to someone who can't afford glasses. So that's badass too. This is a great company. This is the exact type of company that I want to be working with, not just because they're going to give me a free pair of glasses. I guess I fall into the category of, I guess I'm one of their donations. Prescription glasses, they start at $95. This includes the lens. They also have sunglasses and reading glasses too. So support this company, please, because I want to work with them for a long time. I have a feeling that a lot of my listeners are equally night blind. Go to warbyparker.com, floor slash family hour. Order some of these glasses. I'm going to be ordering a pair tonight. We are also brought to you by amazon.com. Amazon.com has an affiliate program. What that means is if you go to dunkintrustle.com and go through the Amazon portal, you will get, they will give us a very small percentage of whatever it is that you buy. And this is a way for you to support the podcast while shopping and not having to go out into the stores. Guys, it's flu season out there. Not only that, but there's a fucking polar vortex over the east coast. These are not safe conditions. Are you going to go wandering through the pre-ice age slush to go to Target to buy toilet paper when you could go to amazon.com and have that toilet paper delivered to your house? Come on. You don't want to deal with that shit. This is flu season. People are coughing up their lungs. There's swine flu, bird flu. There's pig flu. Everyone's sick. And if you want to get really sick during a polar vortex, go to Target and fight over milk with somebody who's been coughing up bits of their lungs for the last few days because they have some kind of unidentified disease that's spreading through whatever metropolis you happen to live in. Don't do it. Go to amazon.com, order your toilet paper there and go through our portal and they'll give us a very small percentage of whatever you buy. They also, if you live in New York or Los Angeles, there's Amazon Fresh. I've already tested them out. It's a grocery delivery service. So guys, it really is getting to a wonderful place where we will never have to leave our homes again. We are also brought to you by Audible. Audible sells great audio books. If you go to audibletrial.com. You can download a free audio book. If you sign up for a trial membership, they give us 15 bucks. So there's lots of ways that you could support this podcast. You could also go to our shop, order some posters or a t-shirt or a bonus episode. Or if you really feel crazy, you could donate. But honestly, if you're thinking about donating to the podcast, I'd really rather you donate to a good charity that you want to support. And if you want to support this podcast, just go, go buy some glasses from Warby Parker, download an audio book, go through the Amazon portal or buy a poster or something. And if you don't want to do any of that, just keep listening because I love that too. And go to our message board. There's a great form there, which I haven't visited in a while because I've been in a kind of, I've been in a polar vortex of my own. The combination of getting these chest X-rays and hanging out with my ex-girlfriend has really spun me for a loop. But I'll get better. Everything gets better. It's a pendulum, man. It swings from one side to the next. It's a sine wave, brother. Crests and peaks. Wait, no. Truffs. Peaks and troughs. Yeah. That's the story of everything, I guess. I don't know. Today's guest is an amazing director who has directed and produced some, some of the most famous music videos ever. He's worked with like the greatest bands. He's worked with from Kanye West to Nirvana. He's worked with Spike Jones, who most recently created, put out the movie, Her, with Joaquin Phoenix. And goddamn, it's a great movie. You definitely should go see it. I loved it. Wonderful film. Much more, you know, I guess previews or something. They've got a dumb previews down so that it appeals to everyone. And so you watch the previews for her and you think that it's like some kind of rom-com where a guy falls in love with a robot. That is not what it is at all. It's much, much deeper than that. And it's an amazingly accurate, or I think it's a very accurate position, prediction of where technology is going to be in the next five years or so. Anyway, Lance Bangs is pals with Spike Jones, who right now is my favorite human on earth. Cause that movie blew my mind. I haven't felt that excited about a movie since I saw it. There will be blood. Great movie. Go see it and watch some of Lance Bangs incredible documentaries like the Lazarus effect on HBO or just Google search Lance Bangs and go to his Wikipedia page and notice how you have to scroll down through three pages to get through the list of all the music videos and documentaries that he's created. This is a seriously prolific genius. And I'm so happy to have met him. In fact, I'm just going to say it. I think and I apologize. I'm not okay. I'm not going to look. I love all my children, but God damn, this is a great podcast. And if I had to put this in the anyway, why am I trying to shape your opinion about this conversation that I have with this guy? I'm just glad this is the guy who makes me happy that I started podcasting because it gives me a chance to talk to people like this and hang out with them if only for a couple of hours. So everybody please open your hearts, send out your love energy and embrace the amazing Lance Bangs. It's the Duncan Trussell video. Lance Bangs. Hello, Duncan. Hi. Thanks for doing the show, man. Yeah, I'm glad to be here. You know, when I was, you were coming and I was doing some research and your Wikipedia page, it's like 7,000 things you've created. Like I started scrolling through and it's music videos for Nirvana, Bell and Sebastian, Kanye West. It goes on and on and on like every famous musician. And then that's mixed in with like badass vice documentaries, but then that's mixed in with you going to Africa to work with or to do a documentary on AIDS. Yeah. And then that gets mixed in with your work on Adult Swim with Lloyder Squad and then also, what is the best TV show event in history? The greatest event in television history. The greatest event in television history. You have to be the busiest person on earth. Yeah, I make a lot of stuff. I'm kind of always traveling around and making things and overlapping projects at the same time and then shooting during the day and then watching edits and then usually at night there's something I'm interested in going out and seeing or exploring in the morning. Man, that is amazing. You know what I did today? I played Hearthstone, an online video card game for probably five hours. Wow. I think five hours. Like I am badly, deeply, embarrassingly hooked to a online fantasy role playing card game. I didn't know there was a card game version of that. I remember talking to you about the StarCraft and other things that you've been into in the past, but I didn't know that there was a 52-card deck of card-based game. No, you only get 30 cards in Hearthstone. You see it. If you looked at it, you would think, oh, that's a baby game. That's a game that you see the kids on the airplanes playing or something. But really what it is is it's Blizzard's ultimate understanding of how to make something addictive because it's this combination of things and just grabs your attention and holds you there. But as I'm sitting there playing this game, because I'm working on this self-love stuff and being in the moment and being comfortable with your attachments and just instead of trying to ... The idea is if you're not going to get rid of your addictions until you deal with what's inside of you and then they'll naturally fall away. Now, that's a great way to be in complete denial about just not ... You're like, oh, no, I'm going to just let it fall away. I'm going to play Hearthstone anyway. My point being, you, on the other hand, or somebody who is completely immersed in life and creation, don't you get tired? Don't you want to spend time alone and resting and not doing anything or talking to people? Yeah, but there's ... I mean, it's such a world full of interesting people and characters and things going on and it's exciting to be here and talking to you, but at the same time, Perfect Pussy is playing downtown on 7th Street and within driving distance Earl Swetcher is down doing a Christmas show in front of kids in Orange County that is going to be insane and going nuts throughout the night. There's sort of a compulsion to go see these things and take part in them and watch the people and jump into the crowd and then film it when you can or take photographs or be there to talk to everyone and then drive back to the next thing. You're living the life of somebody who found out that they have three weeks to live. Yeah. That's amazing. Not all of us are doing that, Lance. Not all of us have figured out a way to do that or even want to do that. You have to have this real desire to sort of be out there and engage. I like going out to the bars with my friends. I think that's a blast, but going to shows, am I blocked? Do you think I'm a little blocked or something? No, because you're generating stuff and unlike a lot of people that have a similar tendency or interest in psychedelics or spiritual culture, you're not a sedentary or just taking things in and sort of like with it. It feels like your mind is sharp and racing and you're able to kind of speak articulately about these ideas and get them out and make podcasts and go do performances. Have you ever gotten depressed? Yeah, absolutely. And have you ever fallen into a place where you're not being prolific and making stuff? Yeah, definitely. What do you tell yourself when that's happening? You can tell yourself to just force yourself out of it. I mean, it's a depression. It's a real chemical thing that goes on in your brain that you can't talk yourself out of and that's why it's such a serious thing to deal with, that you get kind of swamped or stuck in those feelings and maybe you're just sort of like laying in bed or reading books or absentmindedly puttering around the house and not getting out or doing things that you know you should be doing. Yeah. And then, you know, fortunately, if you have friends or people around you who are looking out for you or concerned, they can sort of, you know, probe you about it or ask you questions or kind of kick your ass to talk or open up or deal with what you're preoccupied with during that depression. You know, when I've been depressed, sometimes I can't... It's hard for me to tell what I'm preoccupied with. Like, you don't even know. You're just sort of... Now, I wonder if there's depression and there's the chemical imbalance, but then there's some other thing, I think. Isn't there a thing, the idea of just like actually going out of the world? Yeah. You can absolutely detach yourself and, you know, there are with the ability to be online or just in front of a computer or screen watching things and just absorbing culture and not making stuff of your own that there's a definite, you know, ability to soften your life by doing that too much. Yeah, right. Just that. Yeah. That is fucked up, getting lost in the goddamn rectangle, the glowing hypnotic rectangle. You know, I was sitting in front of this game and I'm sitting there watching myself because that's part of this mindfulness practice is you just watch it. You watch yourself as opposed to like playing a game or whatever the addictive behavior is that you might do. A lot of times you get into an addictive behavior, you're just in it. You know what I mean? You're not really thinking... In fact, you're trying not to think about what you're doing. Whatever it is, you're just trying to... You're just lost in the thing. So the idea of mindfulness is like instead of like stopping whatever you're addicted to, like, I'm going to quit smoking. I'm going to quit this. You just watch the way your body acts and on every level, emotionally, physically, mentally, you just watch this thing and suddenly you see this amazing seizure is happening. A seizure of habit where you're locked into the thing. You can feel the high. It's giving you a weird high. Like no matter what your addiction is, there's always an associated buzz that you get with it. And you see this beautiful tapestry that is like a spider web just holding you down. It's a fascinating thing to watch, man. It really isn't an amazing thing to watch. Would you say that you're addicted to work? Yeah, I think that's probably true. And I don't know that I feel... Like it wasn't like when I was younger and working selling electronics or mowing lawns or gardening that I was compulsively fixated on working that way. Endlessly, I didn't enjoy that and would sort of daydream or wander off or hide in the back of the produce section when I was supposed to be stocking shelves or cleaning up spills or whatever. But once I started making stuff and then being able to survive and support myself by doing that, that is so rewarding that I'd almost compulsively keep taking projects on and doing things on my own that aren't really work or being funded by anybody, but just things I'm fascinated with or want to make or document or things that I just know that if I wasn't shooting would slip away or be underrepresented or things that I want to champion or share my love for that aren't quite being acknowledged yet that I know need to be preserved or recorded. Like I lived in Athens, Georgia for most of the 90s and there were things going on there, people coming through town or passing through that were amazing. And then lived with a bunch of just phenomenal people, lived with like Jeff Mangum and the rest of Neutromilk Hotel and was like, I need to not just be here at these shows to hang out, but like this is crucial and this is on a level of Van Morrison, John Lennon, psychedelic, but not in a retreat of what's already gone in the past way of imagination and visionary description of things that I need to record this and bring a mic and shoot this and then pass around tapes of it and let people know in other parts of the country that this is happening and that they should focus or pay attention to it. That feeling of being around early Neutromilk Hotel, completely unknown Neutromilk Hotel, that must have been the most exciting jaw dropping since. Yeah, it was intense and you could tell that it was real and that, you know, Jeff was struggling and these things were coming from an incredibly interior tenor that he was able to kind of communicate and hold this sustained, you know, resonance of like, ah, that you would pick up on and that meanwhile the 50 imaginary forces and visionary descriptions of things are coming through in the lyrics and then it's very simple chords that just hit in a very almost droning sometimes or repetition of something you hold in childhood sort of way and then they're all, you know, being played by kids that are falling over and a bass that has fuzz all over it and a saw that's being strammed in a drummer that's just kind of flailing away, you know, like the urgency of that and the fact that that was underrepresented by what was going on and that was the era that people were trying to say that like the chemical brothers or orbital is what music is about now and we're done with guitars and nirvana, like those people are gone and, you know, this was not being sort of seen or acknowledged at the time or written off by people as like, oh, like wacky hippies with, you know, thrift store clothing or whatever. Right. And it's like, fuck those people, fuck whoever is publishing Spin Magazine at this point, fuck who's, you know, putting on these radio station festivals with, you know, Sublime or Blink Winnie the Pooh or whatever, like this is really important and I need to go film this tonight. You know what's so exciting about that, man, is to think that right now at this moment there's probably 15 of those things happening. Oh, yeah. Bubbling out of the whatever it comes out of. You know, it's like when you get around people like that, it's like being around a volcano. It's the same level of like fascination and magnetism. My friend Emel and he was when I was in college, it was like, you know, he would sit and record these beautiful songs and when I wasn't like in a state of feeling jealous and threatened over the fact that this like kid who was like, I mean, four years younger than me was clearly some kind of like musical just fountain of genius. Then it was just beautiful. But I wasn't quite smart enough. I wasn't like you. I think if I ran into early neutral milk coats out in the wrong time in my life, I would just walk away. I wouldn't hear it. I wouldn't see it. That was infuriating to run into like when people would be talking during the show or kind of wandering out to go smoke a cigarette. It was like, what? What is wrong with you? You're missing this, you know? But there is like the stuff that you recorded that you played on one of the previous podcasts just recently of that. It sounds like a four track recording that he did that you're on a little bit. Yeah. Did you feel that sort of excitement that this wasn't just fucking around that this was like alter in the woods? Yeah. I felt scared and that I've learned to identify that feeling is the feeling that you're doing something right generally. And so whenever you get this eerie like what like, what is this? What is this? Because it's not you or something. It's just scaring you. You're scaring yourself. Yeah. And that's fun. And that is it. But I, yeah, I just felt scared around him a lot. Like he was, I hadn't come into contact with somebody like that. And because I, you know, I had a kind of, you know, I grew up in North Carolina. I was in, I just had never met somebody who like lived in Boston and shot heroin. And like, you know what I mean? And like just what was going for it in this dark, insane way. I'm not positive, you know, did, did heroin, but I don't roll it. I'd, I'd probably. Certainly people around him. Yes. Yeah. So that was, yes, it was scary and exciting, but I still at that time didn't, I was too shut down to see, see how great it was. I, I'd never heard Daniel Johnston before. I'd never heard of lo-fi. I knew nothing about any of that stuff. So email was just always throwing these left hooks by giving me these tapes and playing this stuff. And every time my reaction was always, ah, this is fucked up, man. Cause my ego, that's how I know something's right. My ego is such an asshole when it gets around something good. It's always like, ah, this is not like it's bad. Is it not, is it not pleasing, but just like, oh, this is splash for me on the high somehow. But you see, see, I imagine they must have, you know, some, they, it's like people like you who can see something and hear something and then help the thing. Yeah. I think that's as important as the thing. It's as, it's, it's the same thing. It's just a different part of the transmission of this energy in the same way the band neutral milk hotel and all of that's when those lyrics and that pain is pouring out of him, he couldn't have thought, oh, this, this is me. You know, couldn't have thought it. No, it's definitely, you know, a trans fixative, something's kind of channeling through him or he's able to kind of like put himself at the risk of hitting these nuances or tones or frequencies and letting things kind of come through him that are clearly intense and difficult to, to live with. What do you think that is? I think that he feels that people around him very intensely. He was very emotionally connected to people that he was looking out for. Like, you know, people would be kind of drawn to him or need help with various things. And he was sort of looking after their care or concerns or letting them unload all of their psychic disasters that they were going through or trauma that they had experienced growing up and recognizing him as someone to talk to. And then what do you do with that once you're the person that's absorbing that from everyone that's had something horrific happen to them when they were young or that they're dealing with, you know, in their current living situation. And then you're also someone that's, you know, smart. Like he had a background. He had been at a college radio station and knew what was good about records that were coming out. And, you know, he wasn't this completely naive person that was not aware of like what a good Fugazi album was or how it was made or, you know what I mean? Like he's conscious of those sort of things as well. But just has that, that grace to generate things and put them out and that people would connect with it or identify with that feeling of what was going on in them. I'm really interested in the path of creation and where it comes from, where you trace it back. You know, like when you trace it like, okay, inspiration. When you're struck with inspiration, it didn't come from you. You don't make inspiration. There's no push-ups for inspiration. Yeah, it's coming through you. You're sort of channeling something or hitting a resonance. What's that thing? What is the resonance? Do you think? What do you think that is? I think that some people are just open to what's traveling through the universe or what emotions or nuances are different today from what might have existed for people five years older than you or that were in a different part of the country. And that there's always micro factors. So you are a bit younger than me, but let's imagine that like parents that we had at a certain time, there was maybe more divorces happening during that era than had been 20 years before that. Right. And that people were not in therapy or on medication to balance out mood swings or chemical imbalances. And so you had more kids getting punched or a liquor bottle thrown at them by the fucked up dad at that time. And that that's something that isn't the dynamic of all the kids today necessarily. Like that pocket existed from 70 whatever to 80 whatever. The spanking fathers of the 80s. Yeah. And that these were people that, you know, had gone through and had generated, had been part of like time-wise a culture that from our younger position looked progressive. You know, the sort of 60s freak out, early 70s loosening of sexual mores, whatever. And yet they were shitty, self-involved people that we were dealing with that were not cool and groovy and peaceful. They were like, you know, running car dealerships or whatever and throwing liquor bottles at you and breaking windows. You had a liquor bottle thrown at you? Well, I don't want to get too like. You don't want to go there. Yeah. But that, so like the people around you and then you resent everyone that's of that generation or that era. And it's also a claustrophobic culture where at that time period, like the dominance of sort of baby boomer people running the show meant that like everything that was on the airwaves or radio or bouncing through the buildings near you was Eric Clapton doing shitty Michelobad stuff, whatever. Right. And that the things you loved or responded to were not being reflected in the culture. And so then you're hand-making things and passing out fanzines or cassettes or making a point that like whether you're not, you know that band that's coming to play at the squash pile in Asheville or whatever, like you're going to go there and be at that show because that's where the other fucked up kids are going to be. Yeah. And there's a good chance that Patty Torno and Chris who booked that show have chosen a cool band to come be there. That is so mind-blowing to me that you know the squash pile. Nobody knows the squash pile. The squash piles never even, never been mentioned on the show. People don't know what it was. I went to the squash pile again. Yeah. Scared shitless. God damn it. I'm just a pussy, man. All this stuff just scares me. So when you were in North Carolina, there would have been this place in the early 90s that this remarkable, intense artist Patty Torno, you know, she made a little bit of money like making quilts and artwork and selling them and some clothing lines. And it was a woman who just like gave no fucks to what the patriarch was trying to expect of her for her life to be like, and was like just making stuff and in different forms like, you know, handmade clothing and then people would buy it. And so she took that money and instead of buying like a white stucco monstrosity of a house to go live in in a comfortable way was like, what I want to do is go down near the train tracks in Asheville in this warehouse area and just build a space and make it all ages so that kids who have shitty things going on at home can come here and hang out and see shows and bring discord bands to come play and touch and go bands to come play and not serve alcohol and not make it be like the sort of like bar route where a band is competing against the sound of like Michelot bottles crashing and hitting the floor and shitty Eric Clapton commercials playing over it. That instead it's a place that, you know, weirdo teenage kids can come buy a copy of book your own fucking life and see a band that came down from DC and then talk to them and write postcards and jump in the van and, you know, go join that adventure. That is the best description of it ever. I wish I could go back in time and get my fucking squash pile t-shirt, which I intentionally cut with scissors so it have holes in it because I wanted to be a punk. So there's a whole circuit of that where, you know, there's people in Pensacola, Florida doing that and Athens, Georgia doing 15 versions of that and that, you know, there'd be a circuit or route of band traveling. So, you know, Super Chunk could get going and have a following and then take Pulvo or whoever to go open for them and, you know, build this sort of community or network of people traveling across the country to these sort of places. Yeah, it's what it's a it's a that. So in Buddhism, they call it the satsang, which is just the community of spiritual seekers that sort of pool around some specific teaching or teacher. And that is not limited to Buddhism, but that is also in music. And so you have the band and then you have what they call the fans. And then that is that communion that happens is its own little mini religion, you know, it's its own little it's a thing that isn't in society, you know, it's a different thing. It's so easy to forget about it, too, that that's happening all the time. That's happening all the time. Yeah. That's an amazing thing. That's really weird. It's it's like the the it's like planet Earth is a it doesn't just grow vegetation. It grows ideas like first it grows humans and then it out of the humans these it secretes these ideas and then those ideas get transformed into sound. That is so weird. The earth is singing. How crazy is that man? The earth is like always singing through us. It's just so fucking weird. Do you do you do you ever worry that I mean, I hope this doesn't come off as a bum or anything, but do you ever worry if you think like, man, maybe I'm working too much. Yeah, for sure. Like, I, you know, there's things that I've possibly damaged or not spend enough time on like, you know, my health could be better. I could be more I don't pay enough attention to myself like you were talking about earlier, the ability to sort of like reflect or watch yourself or observe yourself while you're playing that game. Yes. And I'm not doing that. I'm not conscious of thinking about like, wow, you ran around for too many hours in a row today or you, you know, should have written a letter to someone instead of rushing off to go charge batteries and pick up more power drives or whatever. You seem really happy. You don't strike me as like tremendously. It seems like you're doing the Lord's work. Yeah, I've got this sense of this mission or something happening. Is that an accurate assessment? Yeah, I get a lot of satisfaction out of the things that I make in the process of running around and doing them. And then also the people that I'm collaborating with are around. Like there's just, you know, if you're circulating with the people that inspire you or that excite you or that you want to have conversations with. Like gondry. Like gondry. Yeah. So to go like, watch his process or learn how his brain works on some level and be someone that can interpret what he's trying to communicate and find a way to visualize that and explain that to other people or show. Like when he's on set and he tries to say, okay, you're going to put that over there. And then when the time goes backwards, three beats and then the drum will pop over there and the people who are supposed to move things around just don't get it and can't understand what he's trying to communicate. And he gets frustrated because like English is not his first language, but it's not just a language barrier. It's that his mind is racing in ways that are multi-dimensionally beyond the guy that normally moves a drum kit from here to there. And right. And so then if you're the person that can be like, okay, what we need here is put three of those five feet apart and then one higher than the other. Put it like a sand bag or an Apple box under that so it elevates. It looks like musical notes going up on a scale. Then they're like, okay, great. Like that makes sense. I can go do that. He needs a genius translator. Right. He's so smart. He needs somebody just to translate. That's so cool, man. I know what you mean. This is why I love the podcast. My favorite thing about the podcast is just getting to hang out with people like you and talk. It's not just like the conversation, but you pick up a vibe from people and you just get like, it's really cool to get to meet people like that. And you've met everybody. You've met every single, it seems like you've met almost every legend that I would be interested in meeting. I mean, fuck. What is it like being around Nirvana? That was incredibly intense. And I, you know, I wasn't around them a whole lot. Like I was sort of saw them play live and met them and socialized a little bit. And then Kurt came through Athens to visit Michael sort of probably 92, 93. He might have been like, I guess it was 93 most likely. So he was around there for a little bit. And, you know, it was just so fixated on what they were doing from early on. Just the song sliver when that seven inch came out just connected with me in a way that did not feel the same as everything that was happening musically. And just knew that from that whole era of things that were happening, this was the guy and this was the band that were on some level of communication and saying something. And again, it's not all expressed in a literal way, but you can tell that he had the same kind of dads and the same wallpaper and the same meals that were horrible for you happening in the house that he grew up in. That you and maybe 45,000 other kids of, you know, like the one or two that were getting fucked up at their high schools all across the U.S. But that like he was on that resonance or that, you know what I mean? And so then it's like, you know that it's so good and that something's happening there that even people who are just like trying to jump around to the red hot chili peppers or whatever, they're still going to pick up on what is coming out of here and whether or not they want to relate to that or connect with that or not, they're going to react to respond or go by that cassette. And so you watch that kind of blow up and you just knew that that was happening. And you made a point that like when they come through the South, I'm going to go see them at the Masquerade in Atlanta. I'm going to go see them in the 40 Watt Nathans. And if I can drive to Birmingham, if they don't cancel the show there because no one in Alabama knows to go buy tickets to this, then I'm going to try and get there too. And bring a camera if I can or bring a tape recorder or write about it in a fanzine and pass it around so that other people know like, no, no, no, this is different from Mudhoney and Tad. Like something is happening with this guy. Wow, man. God, I love you. You are so cool, man. That is so cool. I'm sorry for trying to categorize you, but I just keep thinking like, well, you're this prolific, brilliant director, but you're also a fan. You're like a fan, but you're both sides of the coin. Yeah, that's the balance. Like I'm also making personal films and artwork during all this time that's sort of being funded or enhanced by the ability to kind of travel and work with people. So I'll go shoot in parking lots or gas station bathrooms in those cities before the show happens that night for personal films and then go meet people in the crowd and talk to them and sort of spot the people that seem interesting to me and then start corresponding with them. It turns out that, you know, two years later, they're the ones that are putting out a book or, you know what I mean? Like there's a sort of a way to see who in all these different pockets of areas are the people that are going to spring out of the mire. Man, you know, I wanted to tell you about this because I was thinking and now I can't remember the name of it, which sucks, but it was on dig.com today. And it just seemed like if there was ever a subject for a documentary that needed to be made, it's this, which is there is a video game. Have you heard about this? There's an urban legend about a video game that popped up in Portland, Oregon for just a month or two. And everyone who played it, like many of the people who played it committed suicide and like government workers would come and like check the game and stuff. But it's this awesome, long, insane urban myth about this evil game that might have been put there by like some kind of weird MK ultra experiment to like torment people in Portland. But I don't know, man, I just was thinking, fuck, I wish somebody make a documentary about that because I'd watch it. What is, what are some, if you could make a, I'm sure you already have stuff in the works, but what's something you'd like to do a documentary about that you're not doing a documentary about? Oh, that's a good question. I've been kind of focused for a long time, finishing up a documentary about the band Slint and Will Oldham and sort of the Louisville, Kentucky music culture that they came out of. Jesus Christ, man, Will Oldham is God. Is he God? He's a pretty remarkable character. Is he, is Will Oldham a vice-naiva? Does he worship Krishna? I don't know where he's at spiritually. I know that he certainly has, you know, different times done all sorts of interesting research. He released this whole album that's all just Hindu, like, boxy spiritual songs about Krishna. And I, ever since then, I wondered, did he, like, did, is he become like a, a boxy? Is he, I don't know. I'd love to know. I'm not sure where he's at with that, but certainly that blue lotus feet recording is, is a really mesmerizing recording. There's also, like, a peel session they did in England of some of that same material. And one of my favorite people on the planet is this guy, Britt Walford, that drummed on some of those sessions. And that's worth, like, listening to. Maybe it wasn't John Peele. It would have been, like, a V-Pro session, actually. But that, so blue lotus feet is the one to search for online or listen to. I don't know what a V-Pro session is. I think it's a Dutch radio station, like a public radio station there. Oh, okay. So, like, a John Peele session would have been, like, four songs recorded in England that they would have run on the BBC. This one particular guy, John Peele, that was a DJ. Gotcha. And he would sort of, like, spot interesting artists and commission them to do a session. And then, and I think it's in, I think it's a Dutch, Dutch station that has a thing called V-Pro that would similarly, like, you know, have a three or four song, usually acoustic set by interesting musicians. And so that song you're kind of referring to, one of the best ones of that era was a thing called blue lotus feet. Yeah. That's a hypnotic, repetitive, droning piece. No, I actually played it on the podcast. Sorry. It's great, man. I think I played that one. Actually, on the last podcast, I played a little tiny track from that album, just because it seemed so perfect, because I'd just gotten back from the Ram Dass retreat. Right. So this film is something I started shooting in, like, 1991, like, going up to Louisville and just, this record, Spider Land by the band Slint came out and had no information on the front sleeve. It's just like a black and white photograph of these, like, four figures, just their heads kind of floating in water. And they're not looking tough or cool. They're sort of, like, half-smiling and looking in there. They're not people who are trying to look like a band in front of a brick wall or in, like, a railway station looking tough. Yeah. It was just, like, these teenagers kind of staring at you. And it's a very remarkable record that creates a world of its own and sounded like nothing else that I'd heard quite at that time. And it's a lot of sort of spoken dialogue rather than, like, things that were being sung. And the structures of the songs and the time signatures were unusual. And it had this kind of, like, creepy, glassy, yet incredibly precise, articulate guitar playing overlapping and weaving with each other. And the drumming was just this phenomenal presence that you could feel the air moving in the room of where they recorded it. And it just felt like it was continuous and ever-flowing and yet not on, like, the same kind of clock that everything else tends to be. It wasn't, like, all dialed in. So it was like, who made this record? And then you would ask around and be like, oh, they actually broke up before that came out. Because you were like, when are they going to come to Athens or Atlanta and play a show? And it's like, no, they, you know, they broke up before that thing came out. And it's like, well, what are they doing now? Or what's their next band? Or why did they break up? And you'd hear, like, oh, they, you know, like, oh, some of them, like, checked into a mental hospital. Oh. They couldn't get along. Like, you'd hear all these rumors. And this is all pre-internet, pre-... And nobody was writing about them. It wasn't like there'd be some article on Rolling Stone or Spin that, like, gave you true information. Just being ignored. But this thing was being circulated and kind of passed around. And if you saw a record store, it might catch your eye because it was such an unusual object, just as an aesthetic thing to look at. And then it started just kind of getting passed around and circulated through more and more people. And you would get transfixed or obsessive about, like, what's going on with this record. And then bands started trying to kind of sound like that. And then you'd find out, like, oh, like, it's not the main front guy, a guitarist, that's singing everything. Like, half of these songs, the drummer is kind of quietly whispering. And it's like, who does that? What drummer is, like, also quietly talking you through these songs that feel like short films or, you know, fragments of a story that you are only hearing part of or whatever. So, I started going up and shooting footage and... Let me stop you there for a second. I just want to point this out. I have never heard someone so articulately break down music. That is not a normal way, I think, for people to... What's your mind is processing things in a different way musically than maybe other... When I listen to music, I'll think, ah, great lyrics. That's it. Like, I like the lyrics and the guitar will sound good. There'll be some bleeps, or if I'm listening to, like, some kind of, like, psychedelic thing, like, whoa, like, or the helicopter sound and Pink Floyd or something, that'll stick out for me. But there is no fucking way that when I would ever... You can name a song, name a song that I would know, and I'll try to describe it to you. So, you mentioned Pink Floyd, so, like, you know, Echoes by Pink Floyd. I don't even remember... I know the song, like, the one that's like, boing, boing, boing, boing. Just bleeps, echoey... Echoey bleeps. Now you describe it. So, I haven't thought about that song in a long time, but because you mentioned Pink Floyd, like, that's, you know, it's like an entire side of an album, basically, that they did. Sort of when they're coming out of their psychedelic period in Sid Barrett was no longer a functional member of the band, but before they discovered the sort of conceptual album Dark Side of the Moon era, and this guy, John Lecky, you know, engineered the recording, and it has this presence to it, where this song echoes that, you know, it's probably, I don't know if it's dealing with, like, the... What's the seagull? The book? No, what's the sort of, like, the allegory about the albatross? Oh, Rhyme of the Ancient Mayor? Yeah, it might be Rhyme of the Ancient... There's some kind of imagery about that that's going on, maybe, in the lyrics, and that, you know, it goes on for this long time, but somewhere near, maybe, like, the 20-minute mark, or 14-minute mark, whatever, the drumming and bass kind of shift in it and becomes this incredibly ominous, like... Yeah. It, like, turns on itself from going from this being this kind of, like, watery background, like, blah, blah, blah, thing into this more ominous, horrifying, like, there's a driven purpose of what's going on here, and a sense of dread and momentum. God damn it. I am not listening. This is my problem. Maybe this is a problem in my life, man. It might be a problem in mine. I think that, like, at an early age, I kind of disassociated from what was going on around me in real life and maybe lived inside of records and movies and photographs and films and detached from the real situation that I was in, you know? Oh, man, I don't think that's a problem at all. I think that's just paying respect to art instead of just dumbly listening to it in a kind of blanked-out way. I think that if you're tuning into things, like, that's, as far as I'm concerned, you know, there's a verse in the Bhagavad Gita that I love where Krishna is saying, and I can't remember the exact verse, but it's like, whatever you worship, that thing I will be. Wow. Isn't that cool? It's so cool, whatever it is. It's like, you don't have to fucking sit in front of a picture of Hanuman or Ganesh. When you're listening to music the way you're listening to it, as far as I'm concerned, that is just as valid as being a Zen meditator or any kind. That is communion, man. I don't, I get 14-minute mark. I couldn't tell you a minute mark in any song. I just know kind of roughly how it goes, and I know it makes me feel a certain way. Yeah. It's an emotional reaction to music, but not a technical reaction. But that's fine, and if music is just sort of like a background enhancement to the people you're talking to, or the couch that you're sitting on, or the world around you, or the people that are coming in out of the door that are cute, like, that's a perfectly valid thing, and there are songs that work on that level that are just, you know, that was what the summer of 2011 was about, was that song bouncing around the walls or whatever. Right. Yeah, or that particular breakup, or that post-breakup situation. So, slent. Yeah. So, they were, from an incredibly early age, like, you know, 10 years old, they were forming hardcore bands and playing shows, opening up for Minor Threat, and touring at age 14, 12 or 14, like, opening for Samhain, which was a band that Danzig put together right after the Misfits broke out. Yeah, sure. Like, just, you know, drenched in blood, playing, like, fucked up VFW halls in Detroit, and it's like, here's these, like, kids from Louisville, Kentucky, like, you know, going on the road and touring and opening up before any of them can drive, you know, and just, and they would start these incredible things and make great work and usually kind of disguise themselves or use fake names, and then they would break up and end that project before anyone caught up with them or noticed or acknowledged it. And so, when they were, like, 15, 16, they had a band called Squirrel Bait that signed to Homestead Records and, you know, toured with Dennis R. Junior and Husker Do and were, like, playing these shows in New York and getting written about in magazines, before they, again, like, before they were young and old enough to, like, really drive a car or have licenses. And then they would quit that and, you know, like, not take the money to get paid to go make a second album or go play in front of a thousand people and get paid for it, but just sort of like, no, we're done with that, and quit and walk away and go invent something else. And so it's like, what is the compulsion to do that? Is it just sort of a, is it from that sort of anti-acknowledgement, like, no ego indie rock world? Or is it a deeper thing? Or are they people that were incapable of sustaining things for longer than the true inspiration lasted and not willing to, well, I'm not really feeling the song anymore, but if we go play opening up for the pixies, we can make $2,000, so we're going to go do it. And that they just don't have that gene in them to do that, and they're like contrarians or fuck that. That's not what I'm interested in. They don't want to work. No, it's weird. No, I don't mean, what I mean is they want, by work, I mean, they don't want to do something that they're not getting off on. Correct, yeah. And so maybe that's it. You know, at the age of maybe 19, they make this phenomenal landmark album and then disappear and vanish. And so people start catching up to it and like, you know, Nirvana goes and records with Steve Albini in 1993 to do the album in utero, partly based on the drum sound. When they talk about like, oh, we wanted to sound like the pixies, whatever. What they're really talking about is this guy, Britt Walford, who drummed on the first Breeders records under fake names because he didn't want to be known or acknowledged for doing it. Still a teenager. And Steve Albini records that. And the drum sound of that is kind of what the album pod that people really were trying to like Dave Grohl is trying to get out or recreate so they go, you know, certainly there's a love of Albini and Big Black and everything, but like really like for Grohl and stuff, it's this sound of this guy's drum kit in a room that was miked and recorded. And people are starting to make bands in the 90s that sound like them or kind of like take their aesthetic or maybe we don't need to put our name on the front sleeve and people figure it out. And that's kind of cool. Like people kind of like taking bits and pieces from them and spiraling them out into other forms of culture. But they just kind of vanished or disappeared. And then like every once in a while, a record would come out that was like, oh, I think this is maybe the bassist is on this. Yeah, it seems like it's him, but it sounds nothing like what you loved about Spider Land by Slant. And then they would pop up and all of a sudden like the first Palace Brothers thing that Will Oldham did, like he was, you know, classmates with them and would have been in the band if he had known how to play at the time and sort of like sat on the stage and held the drums in place at their first shows and jumped in the band and toured with them opening for Sam Hain when he's like 14, 15. And so when he starts like getting it together to start recording on his own and forms this incarnation of it called the Palace Brothers, like all the guys in slant just having broken up slant and had, you know, couldn't whatever dynamic of like couldn't get along or like couldn't be slant anymore and broke that up before the record comes out, they all go make the Palace Brothers record with him. It's the same. Like I can't imagine if you go through a breakup, you know, that like the first thing you do is go make something else with the same combination of people. But somehow that's OK. And but then like the Palace Brothers record comes out and it doesn't say who made it at first as no one knows, but it sounds like. But they're all playing combinations of different instruments. So this bizarre thing that's going on where it's more and more intriguing and building this mystique, but it doesn't feel deliberate. It doesn't feel like someone that's like being coy or cryptic or trying to seductively entice you. It feels like, no, this is their genuine instinct is to operate in this way that's not conventional, not traditional and yet make great work and then reform in a different configuration, make great work in a different format, be a hardcore punk band, be more of like a metal band, like do these things and then walk away and vanish and never take the acknowledgement or go get paid to play on the side stage of Lollapalooza and cash in on it. You know, intentionality can be so vile. It can be so satanic sometimes. And it's interesting that you mentioned the the tendency of people. I don't know if they still do it, but in 90s bands to not use their real names. I didn't realize my friend. The guy who sort of, I think, was like one of Emil's mentors. I would actually call him my mentor, too, to his name on the out on. He was in this band called Trolling With Droll. You ever heard of them? Oh, yes. After this podcast, I cannot wait to play this for you. All right. I can't play it on here. I never hear from him anymore. And the only time I heard from him, we he was like, this guy, man. So he lived in Boston, his I can't say I'm not going to say his name, but he was in a band called Trolling With Droll. And his name on the album was Anonymous Non Robot. And he, you know, Emil had talked about this guy a bunch and then it was like some break from school and we went up to Boston and like I got to meet this guy. And and and it was just like instant, instant connection. You know, we're like, oh, cool. This is someone I know I'm going to be friends with this person. Like there's no way we'll not be friends because this is somehow we already know each other or something. But he was like here, you know, he's a little like you, man. He was so in he's I'm not using past tense because I haven't talked in forever, but he's in the world. He's living. He's like not he's just fully here and living and totally he's clearly himself. You know, and like I remember when we were meeting in a park and I look over and there's some guy sitting on a bench and he's got binoculars and he's been looking through the park for us with these binoculars because I guess he wanted to see us right when we came or something. It's just cool. And then. Yeah, man, I was just being around people like that. It's so fucking amazing, man. And so is that happening anymore? The thing that happened in the 90s, is that done? Whatever that was. Yeah, there's still absolutely people making great work and art in different contexts. And, you know, I think that there's a different tendency now people who, again, like they grew up in a different setting where the vibrations are not an unbalanced, unmedicated, alcoholic dad who's breaking shit and spanking dads, you know, Kraftmucker named cheese to like there's healthier things and there's like people are getting therapy or whatever. Like things are different for people that are 18 now than they might have been, you know, at the time that you and I. Not everybody was getting violently abused. Yeah. And their childhood. But there are still pockets of interesting kids making mutant, bizarro transmissions of things. And, you know, just the fact that there is the internet and that they can share them, not everyone's doing that. Like people are still making handmade things. I'm dropping them off at family bookstore or at, you know, paper, rad. And, you know, and the internet. Yeah. And so they do have that to communicate or express themselves or find people. And what I'm curious about is all the people that. Like, I wonder if there's less fucked up stuff happening now. If in some way it's a release outlet or valve that people that would have gone and beat up somebody or or taken their sexual repression or anger that they couldn't deal with themselves and like lashed out in some horrible fucked up way are now able to just like find the imagery that triggers them and then they can jerk off to it and be done and move on to not needing to go. So you know, like, is that helping some people to. Porn is fucking up the indie bands. The indie drought. Maybe so, man. I mean, I think that it's not just porn. I think it's that we've got these goddamn hypnotic rectangles in our pockets. And they are getting more. The gravity is increasing and increasing and increasing with these things so that they're, you know, when I was, you know, when, man, when I was a kid, when I was growing up in the internet, just happened, if you wanted porn, if you wanted to jerk off to porn, you're going to sit for five minutes, a minimum looking at this picture, slowly slide across a JPEG. You would just try to find the lowest res JPEGs where you could still see details enough to jerk off as far as watching a movie. Police. That's not going to happen. You don't have an instantaneous access to every hardcore sex act that has ever been done by the human species. That wasn't there. So yeah, I know you mean, man, could be. Is that affecting your relationships? Like when you're open or meeting new people now, does the fact that so much more is acknowledgeable or talkable or everyone's seen everything now? Porn. Yeah. I think porn, I've met girls who have like, I think that a problem has happened, which is that some guys who watch porn, they believe that that's how you have sex. So some guys will immediately try to like mouth fuck a girl or like gag or like they'll be kind of like aggro and weird. And because that's a lot of some types of porn is very like seemingly angry or something at women, particularly. And some guys like it, they just get confused. And I've heard girls talk about that. And. But for me, though, I do use porn to jerk off from time to time. And I don't really feel that much shame about it. It just seems like a great outlet and a form of safe sex. I'm not addicted to porn, but I know people who are addicted to porn and they jerk off just all day long. That's intense. That's intense. But so are they people that are like, are they doing something else in between? Like, are they like in the way that you're five hours of that game? Like, is it that and then there's a laptop on the side that every 30 minutes my friend, Sam Tripoli, he was on the podcast and he talked about how he would snort coke while jerking off to porn for hours at a time. I guess that was just the main soul activity. But as far as like making people more open about sex, yeah, I think maybe there has been some kind of like opening thing. I just think the problem is that a lot of guys that they're confused because they're angry about not having sex as much as they want because. It's all repression. It's like the problem is we're so we're so repressed that sex turns into this like. Fucking Shambhala or some kind of like, you know, you start thinking sex is the answer. If you ever think sex is the answer to anything, you're just going to get severely disappointed when you realize it's it's just a pleasurable. It's like a form of massage or something, really. So I think that's a problem. Guys are always looking for it and then it happens and they're pissed. And I don't know. Maybe they like it really. They I don't know. It's good to some women like to be dominated and like to be tied up. And but I think that if you do that, you need to make sure that you do it with the right intention. Like if I ever do that, and I know it sounds so crazy. But if I ever do that, I do it because I know that the woman likes it. And I'm doing it almost as a form of submission to them because I know they're skidding off so hard on being tied up and controlled that it's pleasuring them and making them all trembling. And that's awesome. I think that's how you should do that kind of thing. But if you're going out of the other way, which you're some miniature, I don't know, what's his name, Ted Bundy. Oh, God, yeah. Then that's not good. Anyway, we got off track here. What about this? When's the slent thing coming up? So to be some point in 2014, I'm trying to figure out like what the best way to show it is now. Like there's things that maybe from my background that I wouldn't be comfortable with that everyone who's maybe 22 years old now doesn't have the compulsion about like I couldn't put something on Kickstarter and ask for help getting it funded to put out because it just feels from that sort of like era of doing things yourself and not taking any backing or whatever that there's still a stigma to me that I'd feel embarrassed about like asking for money to finish something. Or do you know what I mean? Whereas like there's no there's no shame or stigma to that to people that are doing stuff now or like, yeah, give me $50,000 to go take some pictures of Detroit. Here's what's weird. This is what I think is weird about the stigma behind Kickstarter, any of those things. So like I have an idea, you know, if I have an idea for a show, there is nothing stigmatized about me going to Comedy Central or sitting down with some company and trying to pitch the idea to them and see if they'll fund it. So if a corporation funds it, no stigma. But if you have an idea that is crowd sourced or that is paid for by just the public stigma, that's ridiculous. And a lot of like really like, you know, successful people or a tours get really huffy when they see one of their peers throw something up on Kickstarter and they're like, oh, look at him on Kickstarter. Meanwhile, they're at fucking IFC. We've got this great idea. What do you think? Will you give us some money? Like, what's the difference? What's the fucking difference, man? I don't get it. I think that that stigma has got to go away because I would much rather things be funded in the court of public opinion than funded by people who are just trying to sell Mitsubishi's and floor cleanser. Yeah, not that that's bad. We need both of those things in the world, I guess, but it's just cooler when it's I think crowd sourcing is fine, as long as what you're creating is worthwhile. Yeah, I think that it's also like sort of a control of how it's presented that like my ideal version of it is that I take the film and go to I want to have it projected and hit a screen. I don't want it to be something that someone downloads and runs in a window on some edge of their laptop while they're also checking email or whatever. Right. A lot of the people are very sort of like slow, thoughtful people who speak in longer convoluted sentences that aren't quick soundbites. And so there's a lot of the interviews were shot at three in the morning, three thirty in the morning. So it's a very nocturnal. It's a similar feeling to what we've got in this room here right now. There's an intimacy that comes with that. There's a connection or an engagement that happens where people speak in longer streams or more drawn out ways that is not going to work best on someone's laptop screen or whatever. And so my ideal version is that I would go, you know, travel to different places and project the film and have it hit a screen and travel this light through the air and that everyone's quiet in the room and all focused at the same time at letting the story unfold and listen to the music in a decent presentation. So if I can go to different, you know, college towns or places and do these events and then maybe show other work or, you know, show comedy stuff or teach film kids or whatever, maybe I'll try and make that work. Man, you know what? If you do that, let me know. And maybe I can come to that town and we can do a live podcast or something. That would be great. That would be so cool because that's something I'm working out with my agents is to go do a podcast. Because they know all the venues to go on a tour, man. And like, that'd be so fun to do a live podcast like this, even though you won't hit the same intimacy that you have here. That's why I like doing it here, which is why instead of going on a walk or something, it's just fun to be in a room and just have a cool sort of oscillating, strange conversation. Yeah, I was pitching you different ideas of things to do to make it like, you know, we would go for a walk or take the dogs out or drive down to go see a show in downtown of the perfect pussy or whatever. And then that's just you multitasking. That's multitasking. And that's also a sense that like, I didn't know that you had this great set up here and that it was so comfortable and cozy. My my image was that you would sort of like gone through this dark, troubling thing and a breakup. And I was worried that you were like spending hours doing Starcraft and jerking off and smoking pot and not getting out of the house. Or, you know, like, I didn't know what you were going through. And I didn't know that you were like as in good form and good presence. That's awesome. You thought I was going to be like laying in my garbage under garbage. God damn it, babe. I was thinking like, let's get out of the house and go. You know, like, let's get him out of the house. Like, how much are you engaged with the outside world? You know, I am and get, you know, I have, though I have been definitely checked out and I continue to be checked. I this is my this behind it. All this, how I look at it, I got my ball chopped off and my mom died this year. Yeah. So the way I see it is I've got a year. I've got a year to, to, to be whatever, however I want to be. And, but then the more I become the way that I am and the more I just let myself sort of go in and out of the various moods that come upon anyone, but especially when you have, when your mom, the cancer is like whatever. It's like you've got two balls and you've, your brain just forgets. But kind of got through that. I got through that. But the, the death of your mother, that's about a year, I think, at least. So anyway, yeah, weirdly, I, um, had you, the thing you just described was that I was like, before any of that happened, before any of that happened. I was more somebody who had garbage laying around in a messy house and a, uh, a messy, messy life and no real anything going on. But then something about the combination of all the, you know, death and just realizing that I don't know what it is. Here's a funny thing, man. The mind likes to ascribe reason to a thing because it wants to pretend to be in control. But it really, it might not be in control at all. And it's always a, after the fact thing, like worst example of that or like a negative example of that is sometimes you'll get in an argument with someone, you're just mad, whatever. And you say stupid things. And then you don't even know why you're doing it. You're watching yourself say shitty things. And then when it's all over, you, your mind will try to justify what you did. Like, Oh, yes, of course you did that because he, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But it's after the thing already happened. And then you come up with a reason for it. So I think this whole addiction to reason that we have is a problem, is a big problem. Because reasons so wrong most of the time, like people have the wrong read of it, or they misinterpret what's actually going on. Yeah, yeah, exactly. You don't know it's, it's, I love just the idea of like, well, I don't really exactly. Here's one thing I know for sure. This is what I know for sure. I know one thing for sure. I'm going to blink and I will be dying. I know that based on the way time moves. Cause like I can blink and just think I was just in college. Blink here, which means that I'm going to blink again. And I'm going to be watching my nephew's graduation from high school. I'm going to blink again and I will have had a stroke or whatever the thing. This, this, unless, you know, I'm not saying maybe a meteor impacts or some other thing happens, but I do know that I do know that. So knowing that and keeping that close to my heart, it makes me less inclined to go against my impulses, you know, because it seems like the more that I go against my impulses and try to impose some kind of thing, like today I'm going to get seven pages written or today I'm going to do this or that. None of it really is that good as opposed to this weird sense of like that same fear feeling that I was telling you about. Sometimes I'll get that just being myself. And it's like, whoa, this is so sinful that you wouldn't be constantly worried and working on something and trying to make a thing and do something and have some reason for something that you're doing. You're just living and being and you just seem to be this pulsation of experience that has nothing that's not really anything more than that. That's wild when you pop into that state instead of like, I'm writing a book. Right. I'm working on my screenplay. I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to write five new jokes today. Fuck all that. It's intense how some people do that. They set that structure, then they wake up and they stick to it and they've got their routine and they focus on creating things in that kind of a process. I think it's fine if that's really what you want to do. Like you, you're somebody who's obviously. You've died. I'm not, look, I don't, I'm not, I don't believe that you have a, I don't think anyone has a utopian life. And I don't doubt, obviously the kind of work you do is that is as stressful as. Um, um, it's a, it's like almost like a, it feels like war or something. And always the worst thing that can happen always happens and the person doesn't show up and it's, you have to really learn how to modulate stress and stuff like that. Like you, you really have to want to do what you're doing. So I don't, I know that you're not living some utopian life or anything, but the way you're describing it and the way that your energy is, it just seems like you're doing exactly what you're supposed to be doing. I think that's true. I think I kind of walked away from conventional structures and what might have happened to someone that came out of the background. I did when things got really traumatic when I was young and I sort of wasn't sure I was going to live like that the world wasn't for me or that it was stabbing at me that getting through that or emerging from that and feeling like the stakes are now that like, I don't want to be part of a nine to five world. And that's not that system and construct is fucked. And I don't want to cooperate with that or be complicit in that. So I'm going to go over here and, oh my God, this, even in his youth song by Nirvana, the B side of this thing is exactly what was going through my emotional core. And that's where I want to go be in that room when that gets played live and hear that as loud as I possibly can and put my head near the amp and then pull a camera out and document it to spread it to other people. And that just going on a continuous stream from that, it's been a thing where people have seen or recognized the things that I've made and then been like, Hey, we need to bring you out to New York to come do this thing with Kanye West because he wants that feeling or that look on his next thing. Or you know what I mean? So Kanye West from from that weird transition, things that I wasn't actively seeking, like I never went to film school or worked on sets and learned the the hierarchy of what a PA does, like just making things and then getting drawn by other people to come make more things and travel with them or be in the room during a recording session or whatever. That that's sort of what has been happening for, you know, since that time. This is the thing people don't get. See, this is why I'm saying like, God damn it. It's like I'm going if for whatever reason, my brain is being magnetized to some idiotic online digital role playing game that is so stupid, which which and I'm addicted to it. Then I'm going to I'm going to spiritualize that addiction and recognize number one, it's a unique in the course of human existence. It's a brand new form of addiction. And it's funny to have my mind stuck on that. And I know that it's not going to happen forever because I know myself well enough to know, to watch the waveform and in the way that the dark moments or the addictive moments of the moments where I'm doing things that I don't want to be doing or that I think I shouldn't be doing always end up leading me to something better just by surrendering. And now that's a bad example, because what you're talking about is an actual kind of like passionate love of music and artists. And I think that people should understand that if you just follow the breadcrumbs of your desires, then strangely, they will lure you in the direction of paradise. And if you go against that and because the world will tell you, no, what are you just going to go fucking listen to goddamn bands every fucking night? You piece of shit. Get a fucking job. Yeah, that's that's what I heard. You were up till 2am at some fucking band. You got to fuck you got to work. There's no time to go play around listening to music. And if you listen to that, then right now you might be, you know, the manager at a fucking Bank of America or something like that. But instead you had the balls to follow what you love. And if you go in the direction of love, real love, if you go in the direction of love, your life will only get better and better and better. Love is the finger of God beckoning you in some certain direction. You just have to have the guts to follow it. And not everybody does. Yeah, not everybody does. Um, that's intense. The imagery you threw out there, the name of the documentary that I hadn't set up until this point that I'm putting out is called breadcrumb trail. No fucking way. Yeah. Weird. Cool. That is cool. You're on some frequency here. That is so cool, man. Yeah. Well, I love that, you know, I love that, you know, and I'll tell you why I love it because, um, uh, you know, Hansel and Gretel, right? They go, they leave a trail of breadcrumbs, right? That's what they do. And they, and there's the witch. And that whole thing is like that, the dark forest, that's what I've been thinking about a lot lately, because I think the dark forest is the grief and the sadness and the, and the suffering that you haven't let yourself experience over the course of your life. I think that's the dark forest. And I think that weirdly, we get lured into that dark forest by, I call it breadcrumbs or I don't know what it is, but it's some trail that's left there for us that is the following in the direction of love. And, you know, what does love always do to a person? It breaks their heart. It breaks your heart. Love, love always breaks your heart. And then people are like, well, I'll never love again because I never want to be hurt and they don't understand that a broken heart is the prerequisite to true growth and to really becoming yourself. And so whenever your heart breaks, you've been given this moment to, um, to, uh, when you have a broken heart, I'm trying to think of the, the speaker at this Jack cornfield, it was the last podcast he said. That I can't remember the exact way to scratch. If he said in some Jewish tradition, they hold the scriptures against their heart when they're saying them. And the reason they do that is so that when their heart breaks, it will fall in. And that is it, man, the fucking, the breadcrumbs lead you to a broken heart. And the world tells you, no, it all costs. Don't get your heart broken. It's the worst thing there is avoided at all costs. Num, num, num, num, num. Do you really want it? Don't get hurt. Don't get hurt. When the real answer is get hurt, break the fucking shell, man. It just sucks. Cause that's the dark forest is you have to get on the other side of the dark forest is you net, you just pick whatever symbol you want to use. But on the other side of that forest, that's what's there. The beauty Eden, whatever you want to call it, that's there. It's there, but you just have to let yourself fucking go through it. You have to let yourself hurt. Right? Yeah. When did you learn that? Like, what was the time of your life that you went through that and recognize something afterwards? Right now, because my mom died and I, um, uh, your mom dies, you're forced when your parents die, you, you are, you, you'll just cry. You know, you'll just sob and there's nothing you can do about it. And that's different from when you've entered romantic relationships in your past. Every time I've entered a romantic relationship, what, what will happen when I've really been particularly destroyed or hurt is I would try to escape from the, the feet, the pain. So I would like, you know, when one, with one relationship, I remember I would drive around chomping Vicodin listening to Elliot Smith. Yeah. I remember that. And then, uh, I guess this one, I'm playing Hearthstone. But you've got a new dog and you're, you've got things set up here in a way that's comfortable and feels put together and doesn't feel like just like a garbage pile of like pizza boxes. And I have a home that's very clean or for, for me, very clean. And I have really good dear friends right now, which is beautiful. And like, um, I'm, I'm, I'm really quite happy right now. But I guess, you know, I, I did, when I was at this retreat, I did have contact with all the, um, grief inside of me. And I've, I, I, I let myself really feel it from time to time there. And, and, and, uh, had a couple of nice little meltdowns that, um, and it's very sweet. Where do you think you would be if you hadn't been as direct about going and being with your mom near the end and not avoiding that, but, you know, going and being present for that, if you would, in a way that a lot of people just can't function or can't deal with that and, and avoid it. And like, I, I can't come out. I'm busy with work or whatever. Like where would you be now if you hadn't had that experience? Well, hmm, that's a great question, man. Angry, really angry. I would have been a very angry person and, and I, cause that, cause, and I still am a little bit of an angry. I have anger inside of me and, but nothing like what it used to be. And, and I'm working, I'm acting, I'm mindful, I'm practicing mindfulness. So even when I'm getting angry, if I get sucked into anger, you know, just last night, I had a, uh, you know, I backed from this fucking meditation retreat and I really thought I had it all nailed, man. I really was like, I have truly ascended the great to some new like, oh, it's just your mind tells you all the stupid egotistical nonsense. Actually the, um, the, uh, in the, when Buddha was enlightened, Mara, the spirit of distraction or, um, uh, the, the force of the universe that tries to keep us away from truth appeared right before. Do you know the story of Buddha's enlightenment? Yeah. So, you know, the second, uh, the first temptation was fireballs, you know, annihilation or whatever. And that was no problem for him. The second one was the daughters of Mara tempted him and the daughters of Mara represent the part of your ego when you're working on something that's like, well, well, well, look at you. You are a genius. Yeah. Yeah. Or, or, you know, I'm saying for you, like I'm sure when you're working on stuff, it's that part of your mind that starts really, really, really, part of your mind that starts really like jerking yourself off, like, oh my God, this is a, you are amazing or whatever. That's called the daughters of Mara and, and, and, and the spiritual, uh, when you're meditating, it's the same thing where all of a sudden your mind will tell you like, oh yes, you're really waking up. Look at you. Let's start treating people like you're holy or something. And it's, and then you start acting phony and that's, that's fucked up. But last night, some, I was drunk or drinking vodka and like, I started just fucking screaming at a friend of mine. And then, you know, we've made up. Thank God because he's one of my best friends and he loves me. And so, and also that we'd never gotten in a fight before. And now I know I'll be best friends with him for the rest of my life because I sent him a text because I was a dick, man. Like I really let him have it. And then I woke up like, oh, you're an idiot, man. That guy, this is the sweetest guy you know. And then I sent him a text apologizing in right away. He's like, oh, totally fine, man. We are both really drunk. And then I was like, wait, were you calling him out on those sort of things or were you in that state or what? I don't understand the dynamic of the dynamic was embarrassing and the dynamic was like, no, it was just stupid. You know, like when you're drunk and you get into some weird, like some little thing starts and then it gets into like deep drama. And then you're just yelling at each other and it was just a waste of time. But so, yeah. And point being anger, anger, I would have been much, much more angry because I wouldn't have gotten another place where I had to become mindful. You know, that's the thing. It's like mindfulness is a thing that until you really have to do it, you might not go for it just because it's not necessary. But then eventually you get so fucking sick of your patterns and yourself and the knot that you're entangled of your ego that you start practicing these things in the same way people apply salve to their herpes. You have to. You're having a breakout. You have to like deal with it. So it's like that, you know? So I don't know. I don't know. I certainly, anytime I find myself screaming at a friend, it's a wonder, it's a gift from the universe because it's like it takes me off my high horse and just makes me realize I'm normal again. You know? So the anger that you still feel that still flares up at times and that maybe keeps in my mind, like I have this judgmental thing where you're one of the few people that articulates these sort of thoughtful concerns and psychedelia and spiritual quest and openness to Eastern mysticism that doesn't just seem like a blathering, like floating, spineless, too easygoing, too California dot thing. And that my past prejudice was against that. And so when someone's telling you like, oh, the anger's really just in there, like how do you keep your anger and still make stuff and get up and create new content and think of new material and jokes and not just be like yogurt out? Well, because that's not, I mean, that whole yogurt out thing is more than likely an act. When someone's acting yogurt out, you remind me of someone who like, meditates a lot and is in the moment and is like in the world or you don't have to do med, you know, this is these, this Rom-Dazs campus taught me a bunch. And because they're all, they're all, they're normal. You get around them and you're, it's they're the opposite of yogurt out. Like when I met Raghu Marcus, that's what I was ready for. I was ready for some weird yogurt out person. He's the director of the Love Server member foundation. And I remember meeting him and realizing like, wow, this is a normal person. Yet he is a devotee of, he has a guru. He's a disciple of Neem Karali Baba. He meditates and runs like what, like a foundation dedicated to propagating the teachings of a Indian man who sat in a blanket, but he's the most normal guy ever. And, and, and he gets mad and like, you know, has problems and all the normal things that all of us have yet underneath it all is this attention to mindfulness and the intention of trying to serve people as best he can when he's not getting rolled by the waves of whatever rolls everyone, which I actually, I've never seen him get rolled by much of anything, but it's not bullshit. That was the relief. It's like, oh, wow, it isn't bullshit. It's not bullshit. In fact, this is just a path that is the opposite of putting you into la la land. It's a, it's trying to get you to just be yourself fearlessly and be in the moment and stop trying to be whatever it is that you think you should be versus what you are. Because what you are is the key. That's the fucking key. It's like having a key and there's a lock and you're always trying to change the key to some various configurations. But if you just left it in the original form, the thing would just click, click open eventually. That's what they've taught me. And I do believe, I do believe that's true. I was happy to hear, you know, in a previous conversation, not during this recording now, where you said, like when you described me, people you'd seen who were other attendees at an event you went to recently, that you were able to discern that like, well, those, you know, there's a range of people, some were kooks, some were whatever, that you're not just completely open to everybody. Like that you, you can still perceive like who is a kook. Well, it's called discernment and, and, and, and, um, yeah, you have to be discerning. And also it's not like you have to be discerning. You are discerning. You instantaneously are going to react to a person who comes across as your path. Yeah. You don't decide to be that way. It's just the way you are. And, and some people who cross your path are going to strike you as being kooks. And some people who cross your path are going to be your friends or going to be your teachers. And those, that is not an eternal law or that's not like, you know, I was talking to, uh, I was talking to actually, um, I was talking to God, I wish I could remember his name. He's so cool, but he lives in Maui and he works with Ramdas. Damn it. I wish I could remember his name. But he, um, he was telling me that we were talking about the, you know, there's all these different gurus as all these different teachers. And he's like some of them, I would not want to, I don't buy what they're saying. I'm not into it. It doesn't strike me as being, uh, so I don't connect, but that, but for some people, that's the transmission. That's what they need. That's the language that they need to, at that time in their life. So in the same way, it's like, look, am I somebody who's going to do the fish swirl dance or something like that? Or is that me? No, that's not what I'm like. I'm more cynical. And I like, um, I gossip and I'm, um, I gossip and, and I like having sex. And I like smoking grass and grass. Now I'm really reverting to the sixties. I like smoking weed. That's just me. That's what I'm like. And, um, that was a big part. This is like one of the cool, like, um, somebody had jokingly was saying that it is a joke. And the neem, carolee, baba, ashram, they, there's like the five limbs of yoga. And they were talking about the five limbs of yoga, this ashram, which was eating. I can't, I'm going to butcher this for those of you who know what it is, but it's really funny because it was eating, walking around, gossiping. I can't remember what they all were, but it was like, his whole thing was not like, let's, you know, meditate this many hours or let's, um, you know, bend our bodies in these certain ways. If you wanted to do that, he wouldn't, he was totally fine with it. But his thing was love, just love yourselves and, and get lost in love as much as you can. And then his other thing was service as much as you can. Just try to help the people, not the kids in Africa that everyone always talks about, but the person who's right next to you right now. There's always somebody right next to you right now. And if you can help them in any way, not by telling them about the fucking eating or communicating some like grand idea to them, which is fun, but they might want a glass of wine or maybe they want some soup or food or, you know what I mean? It's very simple. It's so very simple. And that's the practice, you know, and in that process, that's the other part of the thing. Love, serve, remember the other part of the thing is you remember God and whatever you want to call it, they use the term God. I have no problem with the term God, but you don't have to use the term God. You could say you remember yourself because those two terms are, there's an equal in between them. And the reason people forget it is because we're in these human bodies and it makes it so that you can't see that there's an equal sign. Spiritual rant, sorry. I had a horrifying experience a couple years ago at this absurd retreat that I got brought out to in Palm Springs where there was this giant media company that was considering like relaunching or making a whole new version themselves or what might work out. And they brought me and a bunch of other figures to come like, you know, brainstorm or talk about like possible approaches or what would be cool or what would you do to kind of make a better version of this existing entity. And they had hired this group from London to sort of facilitate or run, you know, activities over the course of the couple of days, we're all going to be on this weird retreat. And it was the most appalling thing where it's like, you know, advertising agency type English people taking a huge fee, I'm sure, for lifting and stealing things from Eastern tradition and religion. And I'm going to go ahead and fucking say the name of it. I think that they were called like nowhere. See, it's like now here, if you look at it that way, you know, like just the worst shitty English, you know, balding dudes with like genes with like dragons embroidered on them. That's rough. Lifting things from Eastern spiritualism and making like corporate seminars out of them. And so, you know, they were kind of like forcing all these interesting people to be doing like, all right, like look in the eyes of someone like randomly like configure and face somebody and then read their energy and tell them something that they don't want to admit about themselves. That's awful. Fuck all of us. And then like a couple of days into this thing, because like you're in a room with all these other fascinating people that have been brought in to this crazy scenario. And you want to talk to them and be like, oh, hey, guy that started this amazing company, like what the fuck? Like what's really going on? But these guys would sort of get in and be like, oh, wait, wait, no, don't, don't, don't, like, it's not the time for you guys to talk directly. We want to first we're going to do these like trustful exercises and then we're going to go for a walk and talk about, you know, brutal. And and then like the dawning realization after a couple of days of it that like they travel around and do these at all sorts of mega corporation things and that they essentially like we had whatever the company was paying this basically paid for like the four day package. And based on that one, we weren't able to talk to each other until the third day because you've got to like build the core group, abandon identity and then communicate ideas and then get to tell you like just that we were on like that track. And that's terrible. So it was like, fuck that. Like I'm not cooperating or complicit anymore. Like I want to talk to the guy that invented this thing and just figure that out now and no longer go through these weird, you know, structured ladder of games. But so when I see people taking things from that and then like, you know, selling weird versions of it is is corporate retreat stuff. It's just it cheapens and makes it appalling. It makes me want to walk away from the people that are drawn into that. Oh, sure. Well, yeah, that is like, I mean, I have no doubt that there's a string of like, there must be an infinite number of shitty retreats out there. Yeah, I'm sure there's an entire like web of them that you can get sucked into for sure. But there's some good ones. And the ones that are good are going to like going to change you. And but you just have to like, you'll find the right. I mean, thank God, these are good. But because no one no one cares that no one all it's not that they don't care. But like if you want to you could do whatever you want. Like if you want to find if you honestly if you want to like find somebody that you can sit with and like, you know, pick pick someone out and maybe do a mutual eye roll together, you're going to find that person. No one's judging anybody. And in fact, you the person you were rolling your eyes at they would if they saw you more than likely if they've been practicing long enough, they're not it's not really going. No one's getting I didn't get in one. I didn't offend as far as I'm aware. I didn't offend a single person at this retreat. And I was not like I was constantly blasphemy. But no, no, they just seem to think it's funny. And you know what I mean? So there's no like, nobody really seems threatened. And then over the course of the thing, that ego part of yourself that's really like all that is the ego anyway, the ego is the thing rolling your eyes, the ego is the thing. But as the thing progresses, and that starts sort of melting away, then you really do that point where like, oh, here's a kook and here's not a kook. It really does at least temporarily, in an authentic way, falls at least slightly falls away, because one of the exercises they did, which is really intense, which reminds me of the opposite of what you said, which is you look at someone and tell them what's wrong about them. In this one, you would see that one of the exercises they did is you sit across from someone. And they give you it's a compassion exercise, because they do this thing called meta, which is a Buddhist practice, which is a compassion practice that it's the stuff when they talk about like how when they've scanned the brains of Buddhist monks, it actually seems to cause like organic changes in the brain from doing this exercise. But the essence of the thing is you sit across from someone, and they sort of walk you through like you like me, like you have the essence of the thing is you have suffered like me, you've lost people, you've gotten your heart broken, you've needed money sometimes and you didn't have it. And then you sort of go through this thing, because the point of it is like, no matter how much of a kook somebody seems, no matter how much of an asshole someone is, especially the assholes, especially when you end up around a seething cunt, really you're around somebody who is just a walking defense mechanism. And underneath that person is somebody who's just desperately trying to protect themselves, because at some point they got fucking eviscerated by the world. And when you realize that, because that is true, then it makes it a little more difficult to create the us and them situation, which is the source of all wars and all conflict on earth, because it's like, man, by the way, there are challenges. I was around somebody last night where I was just like, I can't do it. Because I was really trying, like I was really trying, man, and if I was around this guy, I was like really trying to like, I'm going to love this guy, I'm going to love him. Like the right away when I met him, I said, yeah, hi, I'm Duncan, fairly clearly big guy, alpha male guy, and he's like donkey, your name's donkey. And I'm like, no, it's Duncan, he's like donkey. So I'm like, all right, okay, okay, I'm not, this is the test, right? This is a test, I'm going to be, I'm going to do this, man, I'm not going to, because normally, and I would react to that, I wouldn't right away react, but I would recognize, oh, you're dumb, if you're doing that, and then I'm going to lure you down all kinds of awful traps and make you fall over yourself if I can, and really make you feel bad, and it's going to be a bad night for you. I would try to like fire back in some stupid way, I might win, I might lose, but I try. But it's like, okay, okay, let's be mindful, he goes reacting, he goes reacting, this is a dick, this is a fucking dick, let's get him, let's get him easy to get a guy like that easy, he's clearly a dumb alpha male. But then it's like, no, he's probably, he's probably somehow weirdly in a place he doesn't like, or he feels threatened, or he doesn't feel whatever he's at, this is a defense mechanism, right? So I don't react, I just smile, it's like, if this guy feels like he's dominating me, let's let him feel like he's dominating me, you know, let's let him feel in control or whatever he's needing to feel, and then let's see what happens. Will it go on forever? Will it be a dick for the whole night? But you know what starts happening, man? He starts showing me pictures in his phone of his beautiful daughters, and then he's just talking about how much he loves them, and then all of a sudden, he's gone from being this kind of alpha male douche to this guy who's just clearly in love with his family, and just like, I don't know. What do you feel like by not challenging him that you're enabling him to continue being that douche in the rest of his encounters with every woman he meets at the rest of the retreat, and people are like- That wasn't at the retreat, that was last night at a bar. No, that was last night at a bar. Okay. Like, I get so appalled at being, I don't want to be complicit with enabling those kind of people to continue going through the world that way. I want to sabotage them, I want to fuck them up, I want to make their conversations to the rest of the You might as well be- Not really, but what you're talking about is very similar to anybody who like wages war. It's the same instinct, which is that I will hurt you in the way that more than you're hurting me so that you'll learn a lesson and somehow be better. It's actually in the satanic black mass, it's one of the verses, which is that if you, you know, the enemy who crosses my path, I can't remember what it is, I shall crush him so that he, it's Anton Lavey with like organ music playing, it's all very sinister, but it's like, I have fangs and I will bite if I am hurt. So, no. The thing is, if it worked, if it would work, that you could hurt a person and it would make them better, then it would be worthy of hurting them. The problem is, it doesn't work like that. If it did, the whole planet would be filled with compassionate, advanced, loving, beautiful beings, because all we do is hurt each other all the fucking time. It doesn't work. What works is love. That's all that works. If you're around somebody who really loves you and you get the feeling that they really love you, man, you're gonna change. You won't, even if you don't want to change, a little part of you is gonna shift in a small way, even a small way, because suddenly, especially if you have a bad personality, if you have a bad personality, all your meeting is people with their shields up. That's all your meeting is people like in defense mode. So, if suddenly in this like, you know, sleepwalk that you're going through as an ego form that's trying to defend itself from pain, you run into somebody who your initial attempts to make them put up their fucking shields isn't working, and they're just loving you, it's gonna be different, man. It might not do anything, but it really might do something, because that's that night where you didn't know why you felt different, but you felt different. And maybe that's gonna lead you in some direction. But do you think that after he showed you pictures of his daughters and you connected and had that more kind of graceful moment with him that like, he didn't go to the next person and be like, what'd you say? Your name's Frogger? Like, I don't know. I walked away from him and like, talk shit about him in the bar. It's like, I can't do it. I did it as long as I could. And then it was like, I just do, I can't be around this person that long, but I tried it and it did temporarily work. Okay. For my, you know, it's like lifting weights. It's like, don't you're not going to go to the big weights right away, just do what you can do. And when you get sick of the person, walk away and talk shit or be mean to them if you want to be mean, you don't have to like, try to be something but experiment with it and watch what happens. It's called unconditional positive regard. There's a, Carl Rogers is, he was really into it and it's like the, he would, so like they would send him the worst kids who were about to get put into like an institution or something, the big behavior problems and they'd come into his office as a psychologist and he would have like pads of paper and crayons or pens and they'd come in and they'd immediately start rebelling. They'd immediately start being assholes or saying shitty things to him or rebelling and he would just be like, yeah, let him, he would just, his intention was to love them unconditionally in that moment as they were throwing papers around, cutting themselves, calling him a prick. And these kids, they're the ones who all of a sudden started changing because for once in their life, they were around a being that wasn't expecting them to be different than the way that they were. And that somehow, just that, just being around someone was like, yeah, I see you and I love you even though you're shitting yourself right now. That's new. Yeah. That's gonna make a change more than the, because we've, man, we've, for our whole, we've tried punching people into being nice. Makes great music. So I still want to ask you, like, you are in a, you know, again, in my read of things like a singular energy of making things and being iterative and generating content in a way that I don't normally see out of people that are also interested in psychedelia or, you know, going on these sort of retreats and stuff. Like, is that something that you recognize? Like, do you see other people and it's like, oh, I just don't know about it. There are, like, there's no great hippie novels. There's no great hippie paintings. Like, you know what I mean? It's like Christian music is not really good. Yeah. Like, there's good hippie novels, right? Like, Tom, Tom Robbins is in a great hippie. He's read by hippies, but do you think he would identify himself? Oh, right. You know, right, right, right. Even the Grateful Dead, like, apparently, are like, no, I don't know about these guys. Yeah. Well, first of all, the thing about hippies is, it's like, well, okay, I know what you're saying. Yeah, I know what you're saying, but it's like, what this thing is, is not about being a hippie. What this thing is, is about, is less about being a hippie and more about actually experiencing what I would consider to be an alien intelligence that is actively making contact with this planet at all times. Right. So this is what I'm interested in about your particular dynamic and your interest and that you're drawing from these systems and people that have studied over the centuries or years and built knowledge and formats and ways to try and get through the world, but that you've got this other tact that you're focused on. Well, yeah, I think it's what we were talking about in the beginning of the podcast, which is where does inspiration come from? Where does that spark come from? Where is it coming in from? What's the transmission? Clearly there's receivers. What's the transmission? So I think that transmission is constantly evolving alien intelligence that at its core is love and expressing itself in languages that in every single language, I'm not talking like dialects or actual human language, but in every single subjective language that there is, it's like a transmission that is designed to communicate with every single person on earth, if you want to listen to it. And the way it talks to some people is a monkey god that represents absolute service and friendship. For some people, it could be neutral milk hotel, or for some people, it could be being in a dorm room in college with some weird existentialist genius and it uses everything around you as a form of communication and the moment you want to start talking to it, it begins to talk to you. And that's when people are like, whoa, what this crazy fucking synchronicity happened or, you know, wow, breadcrumbs was the name of the thing. And you're like, what is that? And then that gives you a strange feeling like, how could that even be possible? It's like, you won't know that it's possible, but it just drops these little fucking clues. And it's ecstasy. It's ecstasy to start connecting to that thing. And when you start connecting to the thing, it transforms you. And then it also weirdly starts transforming the people around you too, because you've become a receiver for the thing where it's leading who the fuck knows. We'll never know. Did a goddamn single cell floaty thing way back in the primordial seas know that it would eventually transform into some kind of protohominated monkey thing that would end up going to the fucking moon. No, I didn't know that. It was just floating around. And then it found some other little floaty thing and became symbiotic with that thing. And then that thing became a multi cell thing, which eventually led to us. And what was the thing that drew that to itself? Do you think that the moment of discovery of that sort of alien connection transmission is something that's just going to happen based on a timeline or that by actively working and looking for it is how it's going to be found? I think that it's surrendering to love. That's all you have to do. And then if you do that, if you really just make that the intention, then you begin to experience that moment of like, wait a minute, now I'm getting paid to film these bands. Instead of, you know, it's that weird leap forward. It's like, for me, it's like, I'll think, my God, I am now making a living off of having conversations that I just loved having when I was on acid with my friends. Right. And why that happened or who knows, all I know is that somehow in the process of like having these conversations that ended up turning into my life. Who knows why? Yeah, it's beautiful though. And that's why it's like, the thing that you're doing that you love the most so often is the thing that the world will tell you that you have to give up. Right. That's so evil. Isn't that evil? Well, fuck their system. I mean, that world that's trying to tell you to give up on those things is a rotten and Mara. It's Mara. The Buddha sits at the Bodhi tree, the force of delusion and confusion and Maya and distraction appears before Buddha. And I guarantee the modern version of that would be somebody who just wants to live in the world come their career counselor. Yeah, high school guidance counselors. Yeah, Mara was a guidance counselor. It'll never work. Your scheme will never work. And they might be right. Whatever your dumb little high school ideas or whatever the miniature thing is, I'm sorry to call it dumb. It isn't dumb. But I mean, that little idea, sure, that might not work, but it might lead you. Yeah, absolutely. Towards meeting a person or some event or something that you see or some cat, some little bit of information that you gather that leads you. And if you try to plan that, you're doomed. The only way that you can get there is by letting go and trusting. And then that's the path that you go down. Man, you're interviewing me now and I love it. Lance, it's an hour and 37 minutes and I want to play. I can't plan on this, but I want to play this music for you before you leave. So I think we should wrap it up. But if you don't come on the podcast again, I'm going to kill myself. Okay. I want you to live, Duncan. Thank you so much. Can you tell people where they can find you? Yeah. My name is Lance Bangs. I guess Instagram is just Lance Bangs and Twitter is just Lance Bangs. And I made a film called Bread Come Trail that I'll find ways to project and show in 2014 and have a series on Comedy Central where we're going to start shooting in January called Meltdown. Oh, you're shooting that? Yeah, I'm directing that. Whoa. Awesome. That's so fucking cool. Okay, cool. That's awesome. Follow Lance Bangs. The links will be at DuncanTruzzle.com. Thank you so much. Yeah, thank you. This is awesome. All right. Play the song. Thanks for listening, you guys. If you like the podcast, give us a nice rating on iTunes. Have a great rest of your week and year. See you soon. Bye.
331^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 327: Charlie Ambler Transcript and Discussion^2019-02-25^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. It's my dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hi friends, it's me, Duncan, and here's a preamble to this episode. I recorded this intro before I got the news about the tragedy that happened with Brody Stevens and if you wanna hear me talk about that in a pretty disjointed and certainly unfunny way, then I put it up on Patreon and it'll be there for free. So just, it's there for free if you wanna go listen to that. I just don't wanna seem like I, when I recorded this intro about Hollow Earth, it happened before the news started coming in about this incredible, tragic, horrific, and really, really upsetting loss that a lot of us are feeling right now. So yeah, that's it. And now on to Greetings To You, my beautiful children. It is I, D Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast being recorded from a secret location. I'm really at a secret location right now in the sense that I can't tell you where I'm at, but soon you will know. This is the remote DTFH studio. I still have the other one at my house, but I actually created a new one here so that I could be where I'm at and simultaneously do podcast intros. I feel a little bit of guilt. The walls of this particular place are a little thin and I know there's people working on, either side of me. And I don't know what that's like for them to hear my raspy, seemingly lesbian voice blasting out. Well, anyway, hello. Man, I gotta tell you guys, I have been in the greatest rabbit hole of all time, hollow earth theory. You gotta check it out. I don't wanna go on and on about it. It's just like, I managed to get through the first layers of YouTube video, which you have to do if you wanna get to the deep freaks. You gotta get past the National Geographic cave documentaries. You gotta get past the ancient alien stuff. Anything that wasn't on a network, forget it. You gotta keep digging down and digging down through the surface of YouTube until you start getting into the hollow YouTube where you're gonna find some of the craziest videos of all time related to hollow earth theory. The theory, if you're not aware of it, is amazing. And here's what it is. Basically, the idea is that the earth is not solid. There's actually, I think, three different rings within the earth. And now, here's what we know, for sure. There's different zones of the earth. We know one thing. This is not conspiracy theory. And the center of the earth is a spinning lead ball. It's just super hot. And it's as hot as the surface of the sun, apparently. And surrounding this are various layers of the earth. And this is some interesting stuff. And maybe a geologist out there could help me because I actually read, this is how deep I've gotten into hollow earth theory. No pun intended. A study came out recently. And the study used seismic waves originating from a massive earthquake that actually rippled the entire planet. From these seismic waves, you can do this kind of, I guess, cat scan of the interior of the earth. And I don't know if you saw this. It kind of popped up for a second and then went away. But it says that there are, this study, this was done by Princeton, by the way. There are basically mountain ranges beneath the earth. Now, I'm gonna read this to you. I must have misunderstood this. Because when I hear mountain ranges, I think, oh, that's mountains. That's like Ultima 4 shit. I don't know if you ever played Ultima, Old Man on the other side of this mic here. Really great video game. But you could go down into the earth and there were like mountains under there. And I always thought that was super cool. So you can imagine how every bit of erectile tissue on my body inflamed the moment that I saw this story as I was already inside of a hollow earth rabbit hole. This is an article from Popular Mechanics. All right, this is not, we're not even in YouTube. We're not even deep in the funhouse of lunacy that is the deeper interior core of YouTube. This is Popular Mechanics. To deep beneath the surface of the earth lies an entire landscape of mountains, possibly rougher and taller than any on the surface. So say Princeton geophysicists, Jessica Irving and Wimbo Wu, who published a story last week in Science in collaboration with Cedillo Ni with names like that. These are like, who are these people? From the Institute of Geodesi in their Chinese and geophysics in China. The researchers use scattered seismic waves registered during an epic magnitude 8.2 earthquake that struck Bolivia in 1994 to map the topography of a boundary layer, 660 kilometers straight down. This layer called the transition zone is about 155 miles thick. It divides earth's mantle into an upper and lower section, revealing the interior of our planet to be far more complex than the tritone crust mantle core models boring or used to. Irving and Wu found that the top of the transition zone at about 255 miles deep is smooth for the most part and drastically different from the roughness at the 660 kilometer boundary, which is what they've started calling it for lack of a better word. They don't wanna call it what it is, the hollow earth. When you're data lies far inside the earth, the bigger and deeper the earthquake, the better says Irving. The shock waves they send out in all directions can travel through the core to the other side of the planet and back again. Okay, so now, you know, this is, I keep going through, okay, here's, I keep going through it and it's like, that's it. That's it. There's nothing in there about like, holy shit, there's mountains under the earth? What the fuck? It says here at the very end of this article, it's like the real world geophysicists redo on Jules Verne's journey to the center. Is it redux? How the fuck do you say that? God damn I'm dumb. Geophysicists redo. I tried to make it French, maybe it is. I'm not gonna look it up, I'm gonna call it a redux. Can I get a redux on Jules Verne over here? I'd like a Jules Verne redux. All right, now, that's popular mechanics that appears to be saying that there are mountain ranges under the planet and no one's talking about it. Why is this not national news? Why is this not being, why are they announcing this at targets across the country? There should be planes flying over with banners on the back saying there's mountains under there, there's huge spaces under there, mountains. But no, it's just gonna float away just like everything else, cool. This is gonna vanish, but maybe not. Who knows? Regardless, that is from popular mechanics. Look it up yourself. If you're a geologist out there, correct me please. I tweeted at this brilliant Princeton scientist. I did not expect a response. I tweeted her at 2 a.m. last night. Is there, are you saying that there's mountains under the planet? But maybe she'll write me back, who knows? Regardless, that's the sort of, that's the science part. Now, my friends, I present to you the story of Admiral Byrd, the famous explorer who seems to have stumbled upon something in the North and South Poles. I can't remember which, and honestly, I wouldn't know the North Pole if it bit me in the ass. I don't know where Antarctica is. I don't know if it's in the North or the South, unfortunately, I don't need to know. That's something you don't need to know. I don't know how to get to, I look at my GPS still. I've lived in LA for 18 years, so I guess it's no surprise I don't know where the North Pole is. We're gonna jump back in to this exploration of the Hollow Earth, and also we have a great podcast for your great conversation with Charlie Ambler, the brilliant spiritual philosopher who created one of my favorite Twitter accounts at Daily's Inn, we're gonna get right into it right after this.

Now, Admiral Byrd, famous explorer, something happened. He went up to Antarctica and he found something, something that became a national security issue. He couldn't talk about what he saw and he came back with a legion of military vessels, ostensibly just to map uncharted areas. But this is where the Hollow Earth people kick in. The idea is he went up there and he found something. He found the entrance to the Hollow Earth. And so there's these things floating around called Admiral Byrd's secret diaries. And I'm just gonna read an entry from one of these secret diaries of Admiral Byrd. Okay, here it is. The Inner Earth, my secret diary. Did he have to call it a secret diary? Is that what he really called it? Did it have a little lock on it? I must write this diary in secrecy and obscurity. It concerns my Arctic flight of the 19th day of February in the year of 1947. There comes a time when the rationality of men must fade into insignificance and one must accept the inevitability of the truth. I am not at liberty to disclose the following documentation at this writing. Perhaps it shall never see the light of public scrutiny, but I must do my duty and record here for all to read one day in a world of greed and exploitation. Certain of mankind can no longer suppress that which is truth. Now, these diaries seem like a load of horseshit if you ask me, but there is a really weird interview with Admiral Byrd talking about this expedition. And you should just check it out. I'll put the link over at dougatrustle.com because in the secret location where I am at that I can't talk about, it's the Hollow Earth. I don't have a quick way to grab audio from that interview, but just look at it, look it up. It's a weird interview. It's like he seems like he's being kind of mysterious or coding certain things that he wanted to talk about. The idea is this gang, the Earth is Hollow and there's aliens in there or maybe there's lizards or maybe there's dinosaurs or maybe there's mammoths, I don't know. But if you're looking for a great way to spend your weekend and you wanna spiral into some kind of temporary madness by recalibrating your conceptualization of the planet you're living on temporarily, maintaining Robert Anton Wilson's agnosticism so you don't end up standing on the road somewhere, holding up a sign with images of mammoths, then just go down the Hollow Earth rabbit hole. It's a wonderful rabbit hole that leads to Shambhala. There are a lot of things in life that aren't right. The cursed well outside of your farm filled with the corpses of children.

Also, he's got a blog, TheDailyZen.org, and he just released a wonderful book, The Daily Zen Journal. Now, without further ado, please welcome to the Duncan Trestle Family Hour Podcast, Charlie Ambler. It's the Duncan Trestles... Welcome to the DTFH. I'm so happy to have met you. You're awesome. Thank you, Duncan. I feel the same way about you. This is super cool. This is one of the... I love doing this podcast because I end up connecting with people that I may have never met and unfortunately we didn't record our previous conversation over the phone. But one of the things I love about Buddhism is the idea of the... well, the three jewels. Can you talk a little bit about the three jewels? I mean, I guess I can talk about them from my experience of Buddhism, which I've sort of... when I first started, when I was like 13, it was Tibetan because the only way I could meditate in my town, not at my house, was at this Tibetan center in Redding, Connecticut. You know, I sort of understood those concepts then in terms of just the Tibetan tradition. And then as I uncovered Zen, I feel like they shifted to the three jewels of the Dautaging, which are just simplicity, patience, and compassion. So I don't... I like... it's something that's so funny because you said that and I haven't thought about them in such a long time. Because in my head now, they are those things. Cool. Simplicity, patience, and compassion. So that's amazing. Which God, I should know this, I don't. Which came first, Buddhism or the Dautaging? So Buddhism came first in India way, way back. I couldn't say which millennia. I think it's like the eighth, like 8,000 beasts. It's very, very long time ago. And then migrated to China. And I believe that Dautism emerged in China right before our, you know, our zero began. Like sometime in like the 500 years preceding Jesus. Wow. Okay. So this is news to me because, yeah, for some reason I thought Dautism preceded Buddhism. No, so Dautism was like the first millennium BC, basically. I think it was like 600 BC, that the mythical Lao Zhu lived, and Buddhism had been around for a long time. Wow. Primarily, I think in India, but I'm not quite sure when it migrated to China. This thing that we're doing here is funny. Just because of the nature of the discussion that we're having and the way that we met each other is so mind blowing. What I love about Buddhism, I love many things about it, but it's the way it spreads. And we're talking about sort of the Dharma or the way that the realization, the Buddha's realization rippled around the planet. And as we're talking about this, we are the ripples in the sense that I've been permanently transformed by the Dharma and by Buddhism, and it makes its way into my podcast all the time. And you have a Twitter account that became, I guess, one of the preeminent Twitter accounts, Buddhist Twitter accounts. Is that a fair description of it? Yeah, I would say so. I'd say it's less doctrinally, strictly Buddhist than some of the other ones. I think maybe that's probably also one of the reasons for its popularity, because my focus has always been on a significantly more modern, you know, Zen is a very modern form of Buddhism. It's almost like postmodern Buddhism, like it's very kind of rebellious and contradictory and sometimes a little bit conflicted and nonsensical in the way it approaches things. So yeah, I mean, the Twitter account is definitely one of the most popular Buddhist atmosphere Twitter accounts that exists. Buddhist atmosphere. Buddhist atmosphere, the Buddhist sphere. But you know, what's wild about it to me is this, you know, there's an event that happened where someone had, I guess, what you could call like the ultimate epiphany. Sometimes I think about it in terms of humanity in the way that people talk about an AI passing the Turing test or something. It's like that moment in the history of our species where someone woke up and not woke up in the sense of like, whoa, I'm woke or whoa, I realize what's happening. But in the sense that where that, you know, the beginning of an optic nerve starts forming on some primordial fish in a coral reef or something like that. And so what's wild to me is that that happened and then that began to sort of radiate out and spread around the planet. And now in this age that we're in this technological age, it's continuing to ripple out in the sense that that's wild to me. That is so odd because it's as though Buddhism is this formless, it's formless. It's formless. And yet it's always filling up cups, you know, it's always, right? And so the way it's currently filled, the cups that we have are the, my podcast and your Twitter account. And they're, they get filled up with these ideas that are simultaneously archaic and completely in the now cutting edge at the very, like, very, very, very like crest of the wave of reality. And that's pretty interesting to me. Do you ever feel burdened or do you ever feel blasphemous because you are propagating these ideas using Twitter? I think whenever, like in the past, when I felt that way, I've realized it's when I'm at my most self-righteous. And like if I'm actually practicing, I'm like, oh, okay, you know, I'm just going to share what emerges, what's on my mind. And usually the stuff that I find most, like the thoughts that'll move me the most will resonate most with the audience because they're very usually simple and succinct, sort of the way that the best, you know, you can't really be a good read of the data Jing or the eaching or, you know, the book of Chung Zhu or any of like the early Zen texts. And those are all extremely succinct and simple in their declarations. There's no religious obfuscation or, you know, there's, there's no unnecessary complexity. And it's so cool because you're like, oh, these were living. I mean, in some cases, it's debatable whether there were single individuals responsible for the texts, but like the words came from somewhere and these were like living, breathing people thousands of years ago. And essentially, I mean, because I think, I think it's because physically humans haven't changed that much. Like our, our ecosystem has changed and our tech techno sphere has changed. But these ideas are just as soothing to the soul and conducive to growth now as they were then. And it's fun because they're sort of like, I mean, you can kind of see religion as being one of the original incarnations of, you know, memes, like the real meaning of a meme, like how information fractalizes and spreads in this memetic way. And so that's the thing that I find most fascinating about these ideas is you can read someone a thousand years ago, read one of these texts and wrote a book about it. And then you can read both of those texts and a novel by Don Delillo and watch a movie, you know, an action movie and whatever, go to the store and you have this whole experience and you can take all of those parcels of information and you then become an agent of the, you know, it sounds silly to say meme because of the internet, but that's really what it is. It's sort of, it's just passing through you, you know? That's so cool. Yeah. So like the dharma is a meme, right? I mean, if we want to be reductive, I think, I think, yeah, I think all ideas are. And I think one of the things I like about Zen is that it views conceptual thoughts in that playful way. Like the whole thing is when you're meditating, you're, you're letting, you know, there's an old saying, you let your thoughts and you let your thoughts come and go, but you don't serve them tea. And so I picture them as like little birds that kind of floats through your head and they'll, they'll perch or they'll shit or they'll do something rather and then they'll, then they'll leave, but they're, they're just kind of floating through and all the texts and all of the fancy ideas and all of the principles are also just kind of floating through. And the stuff that sticks with you is usually stuff that you already had in you anyway, I think. Not to get too Zen, so forgive the question, but what is, what do you think is the difference between thoughts and birds? Thoughts and birds. I think it's probably easier to catch birds sometimes. Birds are also a lot prettier, generally speaking. Thoughts can be. Wow. I think there's a lot more ugly thoughts than there are ugly birds. Depends on what the birds are thinking. Yeah, that's true. Yeah. What do birds think? I don't know. They probably think about thoughts. Now, do you think, do you think like birds get woken up in the morning by thoughts? By themselves? Yeah. So the the way that one of the other aspects that I love about Buddhism is that it doesn't really care so much. There's not a thing like in other religions, there's like this real great potential for blasphemy. You know, there's an ability. So when you look at missionary culture, you see this, you know, someone goes to a place, finds some people that aren't living according to the way they have been taught is the right way to live. And then through manipulation, sometimes force, sometimes a combination of both, you shift their society into the society that was thought up by your whatever profit you're following. But Buddhism comes into a place and looks around and just takes the symbols that are there and configures them in a way to help people see something that was already there. That's what I love about it. It's not trying. It's not saying, no, no, no, this is wrong. Don't do this. This is evil. It's just more along the lines of, OK, so this is your symbol for this is a goddess symbol for you. And this is or this is the symbol. This is how you understand nothingness or this is. Oh, you guys call it a meme. OK, we'll call it a meme, you know? So it translates to it and in other words, I guess, to simplify. Missionary culture is weird because it goes to another place and it tries to make the people there speak its language. Right, whereas Buddhism comes to a place and learns the language and speaks that language. But what it says is the Dharma. And I think that's really cool to me. And it seems like that is that is continuing to happen. And that's what you're part of, it seems like. Yeah, I used to get disillusioned with the idea that, you know, like Buddhism had become so popular and lucrative in modern culture. Yeah. And, you know, and that's sort of its own religious purism of being like, I want this, I want this just for me. I don't want like someone to be able to see this on TV and then start meditating because they saw something on TV or because they bought an app or something. Yeah. But I think, you know, with a little, you know, with a few more years of practice and maturity, I I currently believe that it's it's a great thing. And the the compatibility of Buddhist ideas and especially Zen ideas and sort of the the contradictory open-ended nature of it is they're very compatible with modern life, precisely because they let us speak our own language. I mean, it's very hard to speak the language of, you know, a even you could say it's a Tibetan monk or you could say, you know, a Catholic monk or an Islamic monk, it's very hard to speak that language in modern times because you're just going to end up feeling guilt and shame about a lot of things. And you're going to eventually probably end up making other people feel guilt and shame for a lot of things. And so, yeah, I think that that that openness to the outside that Buddhism isn't always purely focused on this monastic self-involved sort of self-referential life. It's very compatible with our everyday life now. And it's funny how it crosses over with, you know, the tech world and the business world, specifically through meditation. But, you know, meditation is evolving to fill whatever vessel it's in, like you're saying. And I can't help but think that that's that's a good thing, no matter what, you know, no matter how it's sold or packaged, it's still just silent reflection. And so if if people are doing it and it's continuing to spread in a open-ended way, I think that's a wonderful thing. And that's when I when I remember that I'm most excited about having the platform that I have, because it is a very it's a it's a fun way to connect with people because you're sort of sharing, you know, you're having this independent experience of meditating and kind of coming to certain realizations and you're sharing those realizations. And then you're seeing all of these people, like it's almost like cooking an electric grid, you know, over the world, being like, oh, yeah, I have that realization too, or that resonates with me. And, you know, that's what writing is in general. But having it be tied to the experience of of meditation and knowing that there's a sort of universal benefit that people get from meditating is fun for me, because Daily Zen is really something that I just do for fun. So I wouldn't do it if it was if it was just something that, you know, was lucrative. And it's funny, because it's it's really not lucrative. Watch out. Watch out. There the the except for the new book. That part has been like probably the most success that Daily Zen has seen on a commercial level. Well, yeah, that's the beginning that, you know, that's the beginning part of it. It's it's the the the problem with it. Well, it's not a problem. I don't want to call it a problem. But it is, I think one of the aspects of it, when you say lucrative, or people start making money from it, or you start one of the problems is and you do I I I hesitate to say it. But now that you're inspiring me to not hesitate so much when I say things. But I hesitate to say one of the things about it is if you start meditating, even just a little bit, but you pull it off over time, you get a little more inspired. I'm that's been my experience. I that's my experience with it. Yeah. And my drought periods, my creative droughts always have within them a kind of laxadaisical, undisciplined, wavery, foggy sort of way of being. And within that, it creates a feedback loop. Oh, fuck, I'm not I'm not inspired. I what's wrong with me? Am I? Am I fraud? Is something wrong with my brain? Is it did I break my brain? It's my brain. But really, and then that creates fear. And then the fear creates more of the thought. And the thought patterns create more of a peril paralysis. And that can go on forever. Yeah. But sitting still somehow and watching my breath. Inevitably, somewhere within that pattern over time, suddenly. Birds start landing in the trees again, so to speak. You know, like suddenly there's like, oh, right. What you're saying, which is like all the heavy, self-righteous or even worse, like a self villainizing thought patterns, all of it just sort of disappears. And then you're reporting now. You become like a reporter, a type of journalist. Only the thing you're reporting on is the moment, the now, the isness. And then that feels so good. So it's it's a really exciting thing. But as you were talking about the. Problem of prosperity in relation to spirituality. It made me think you and I saw in my mind, like a fruit and like or like seeds, you know, in the way that like it is such a brilliant thing. Because the fruit is so sweet and the animal eats it and then shits out these seeds and the seeds grow these trees that make more fruit. Yeah, or the or like or the seed sticks to the animal's fur. It doesn't even know that it's there and it's running through the forest and then the seed falls and then it grows a tree, you know. And I think that that's a great metaphor for the relationship between philosophy and capitalism. Oh, wow. Yeah, any philosophy, religious or otherwise 100 percent. That's great. Yeah. Yeah, it's that. And it's it's like which I it's like I love it because, you know, so many people with with capitalism or with communism or with any system. They either bear their teeth at it or they join or they join the system or or they're you know, but what I love about Buddhism is it like it's it gets into the DNA of the system. It's like, oh, capitalism. Oh, OK. Oh, it's money you want. OK, let's make some money. Let's see. But then what happens is over the as you begin to practice. Now the problem is, oh, great. Well, there's some prosperity. But somehow the bench and the breath and the trees and the wind is way better than the money. Still most important. Yeah, 100 percent. So it fucks up your so the problem. So even though, yeah, maybe you got some money. But now what? Now you get it's things have shifted a little bit, you know, in your in your relationship with that, have you have you found that? Yeah, definitely. Because there was a period before I had a separate business that was doing well, that I was trying to monetize Daily's End. Because I was like, well, what do I have in my life? You know, when I first graduated college, what do I have that I could sell basically? And then I was like, well, I have this thing, but it's very precious to me. And I don't really want to sell it, but I can try. And so I tried doing donations and I tried screen printing t-shirts at my friend's studio and selling them and stuff like that. And I mean, I'm I'm glad that it didn't. I'm honestly relieved that it never went that well financially, because if if Daily's End had become my job, there's a certain degree of of difficulty there with navigating it like in a in a healthy way, because it's something that really helps me. It's really, you know, the same way a lot of writers will talk about. Um, like I just listened to a great interview with Sam Lipsite, who's one of my favorite writers, like currently writing. And he was saying how you have to have a motivation to to write or honestly to do anything creative that's not external. Like it's it's obviously has to be intrinsic. Otherwise, you wouldn't toil away for however many years before anyone notices. Yeah. And so it's it's nice, I think, to keep first on a personal level. I like to keep the spirituality stuff and the commercial stuff separate. And so I have my business, which is extremely different from Daily's End. And then I have Daily's End and I sort of spend my time, you know, working on both in a pretty symbiotic balance. And it's it's a nice balance to have. But I wanted to go back to what you were saying about the seeds and the the idea of like just Buddhism in general and commercialism and stuff. And I think that the thing that you are touching on that I think is important to talk about is kind of this idea of what happens to you when you start meditating. And the the way I like to see it is sort of, you know, if people just went about their if you went about your eight hour work day, just talking nonstop. If you just didn't shut the fuck up for eight hours a day, you would be you would go crazy. You'd drive other people crazy. No one would want to hang out with you. You wouldn't learn anything, you know, there'd be nothing. Right. You it would just be word vomit eight hours a day. Yeah. And, you know, so we find a balance in our in our external lives of thinking, listening, speaking, conceptualizing. But in our internal lives, it's pretty much just thought like word vomit 24 seven. It's like as if we're just sitting there talking for for hours and hours and hours and hours and it's like we just become broken records. And so the way I like to see it is meditation. You're like you're finally shutting up and you're you're listening. You're just listening and you're like you start by listening. When you first start meditating, as I'm sure you know, and everyone who's who's done it knows it's really hard because your internal voice does not shut the fuck up and you're please shut up. Please stop. I'm just I'm trying to meditate. Please. Yeah. But then eventually you get more of those moments of quietude and, you know, in pure pure mind, as we call it, or Samadhi. And you're experiencing them more and more often and you're sort of seeing that beneath all of the chaos of your of your thoughts and your nonstop conceptualization and verbalization, there's like a certain piece. Like things are kind of chill under under there, under all of the noise. But if you're constantly, you know, experiencing the chatter and you don't take that step back to just listen, it's like never listening in a conversation, you know, but it's a conversation with yourself. Wow, that's so interesting. What an interesting relationship with thoughts. I, you know, that's so interesting, you know, because a lot of people have, I guess they they well, either they haven't even made the distinction between their thoughts and who they are, or in making the distinction, they've decided their thoughts are poison or they've decided that this it's the ego. We got to destroy the ego, that kind of attitude. Right. But what you're saying sounds like to sounds to me like you're saying, wait, why don't instead of villainizing these thoughts, what are what are the listen to them? Do they have something? What are they saying? What is what is the sound of your thoughts? What are they? What are they saying? Is it is it is it real? Is that what you're is that what you're talking about? Yeah, no, totally. That's totally it. It's I had a post that a lot of people, obviously, for obvious reasons, didn't like a long time ago, that was one of the most popular posts on dailies. And I don't know if it's still there or not, but it was called Don't Be a Terrorist. And the premise was like, you know, obviously, most people aren't domestic or international terrorists, but we terrorize ourselves all day, every day. And we do it by the same means. And, you know, it's sort of that that idea that you shouldn't you shouldn't be an enemy to yourself. And if there's something you want to change, you're able to change it a lot faster by getting to know yourself and sitting with yourself and befriending excuse me, befriending yourself than by creating an enemy. Like if you're if you're dropping a bomb on yourself, you're going to create sort of hostility and resentment towards yourself in doing that. Like you're, you know, you're taking out one bad thought, but you're creating 10 more. You know, I mean, yeah, it's sort of a you're making an insurgency. And I think that idea has helped me kind of navigate the self-help space because I have to spend in order to do dailies and I have to spend so much time reading, you know, both new and old spiritual texts and self-help texts. And there's just so much crap. And it's nice to remember that you don't have to, you know, you don't have to battle yourself, you don't have to kill the ego. Right. You don't have to be a, you know, you can discipline yourself without being a masochist. It's an important thing. This is making me think of, and I'm sorry, you guys, I've talked about this too much, but I guess it like affected me. There's this Ted Bundy documentary on Netflix. Yeah, just watched it. Oh, and what's so terrifying about him and most people like him is they have this horrific talent, which is compartmentalization. They're like masters of compartmentalization. So in the, this is like an extreme example of compartmentalization in the sense that Ted Bundy had the Ted Bundy that was in court and the Ted Bundy that was self-righteous and the Ted Bundy that was whatever he was trying to be. And then he had the Ted Bundy that was killing people. And somehow his psyche had managed to create these like walled cities within which there was the murderous Ted Bundy. There was the sort of romantic, funny, charming Ted Bundy. And the two were like completely separate from each other. It wasn't quite a split personality, but that's an extreme example of compartmentalization. Yeah. And I think people are so fascinated with those stories because it's sort of like a mythical, extreme version of what everyone does in their own heads. That's it. Right? Like, that's what you're saying. Yeah, it's just the sort of, yeah. And it's both terrifying and something that people are like, oh, yeah, that guy does that. I don't do that. You know, I don't act crazy like that, but we all do really like the way we sort of shield our personal lives from our work lives or we shield our the private ideological lives or political lives in our heads from the lives outside and like the things we think versus the things we say. And that's right. And it causes us a lot of pain, I think. And then the thing we do with birds, because I'm only bringing it up just because I've had this thought like in those in the a few moments. And there, you know, my teacher was a student of Chokin, Trump or Rinpoche, and his advice in this regard with these moments of epiphanous moments is just disown them. And I like that a lot. But I love him. He's the best. He's the coolest. I love him, too. Crazy wisdom. Crazy wisdom. But in those great moments, there have been times when I've been sitting and there's been no difference between my thoughts and the birds. And they're just the same. You're all, oh, they're basically, oh, wait. So there's no difference between my thoughts and the birds. Then what the fuck am I, man? And then, you know, then you're already back. You know, then your mind is like, what happened? What was that? Oh, shit. We take acid. So so that that's a moment of decompartmentalization in the sense that whatever your psyche is doing that creates a compartment you call yourself and a compartment that you call the natural world in that moment, the compartment went away. And now you're thinking birds. You're not thinking thoughts. And in that moment, something has happened that is just astounding. But right as soon as you realize that the compartments have come back up again. So now it's like, wait, what was that? Let me analyze that. I want to write that down. Is that a thing? I should write it down. Have I gained realization? Was that realization? Am I in the light? I'm in the light. You know, and so then and then now you're making millions of little compartments inside the compartments inside the compartments. And this is the pattern. You know, yeah. And and and, um, uh, maybe this is why people love popping that bubble, the bubble packing tape, you know, and maybe maybe this is why, because like, there's a deep sense of like, fuck, this bubble tape is me and the bubbles are all the little parts of myself that are separated from all the other parts of myself only only it's like externalized. Like, ah, it feels good. Oh, it feels good because it hurts to be broken up into a bunch of little pieces. It hurts, man. It's not a good feeling. And I love you comparing it to terrorism because it made me think like, holy shit, where is it? Is there like, you know, you hear on the news now and the propaganda or whatever, there's inevitably some city in the Middle East that is the last enclave of ISIS surrounded by all the forces of the world. And then, and similarly in us, it's, I just love thinking like shit, man. What is my like, what is my ISIS enclave in my head? What is the part of myself that I've surrounded with an entire army of the other parts of myself that's like, just keep the gun if there's any movement, just shoot, don't let anything out of there, you know, that is really a powerful image. It's fun to think about that because man, God knows if one thing you wouldn't want in your brain is a terrorist enclave, you know, many of us have them because that's that moment when you're in traffic and you're listening to Ravi Shankar and somebody cuts you off and you had just been in the most blissful, just dreamy, but I think the world might really be heaven and someone fuck that in that moment. So I'm like, you mother fucker, that's like a shoulder fired rocket coming out of this secret enclave in your heart. Yeah. And all the meditation in the world won't, won't keep that from happening every once in a while in my experience. But I think, yeah, I, I, I love that. That's a funny image. And then I picture them getting to the house or the village or whatever. And there's just like 10 guys, like really scrawny guys with laptops or something. Like it's not even a threat. They're just like, oh, like I've confronted this and it's not really like whatever you're anxious about or whatever is sort of torturing you and terrorizing you is often just this, you know, paper tiger, basically, or like a mirage or a projection of a projection of some insecurity or some idea of bad or evilness or whatever that you're pushing out onto yourself. Well, I mean, if you want to scare the shit out of somebody, put on an executioner's mask, right? Look at those fucking things. Just not a fucking bag over your head. And then while you could, you could put, you put an executioner's mask, you know, on the Dalai Lama and have him walk into a room and people are going to shit bricks. And then like, oh, it's just a Dalai Lama, don't worry. You know, but so, so that, you know, I think that wherever there is the ignorance, so to speak, in the sense that, you know, we ignore parts of ourselves, like a big, the classic example being death, you know, like, so people ignore the fact that I'm just going to bring it up death, death. I mean, literally death is the executioner's mask put over time. So it's in like, so we, for many people when they think about death, they see this black field with like, no, without any eye holes, it's the worst kind of executioner's mask, because it's just like, you're just, I don't know, it's a screen. And then that screen, you start like projecting all the worst of the worsts upon it. And because you just don't know what it is. And, and that's an untrained mind, of course, an untrained mind, when it encounters the unknown or insecurity, then suddenly it will start populating that screen with the worst possible thing that it could be, you know? Yeah, and I think that I was going to bring up death because it plays back into that idea that you're when, when you have those moments of pure meditation, I like the word, the word Samadhi, which is sort of that like immersion, you know, and that's sort of like the, and those moments of realization, which in Zen, they call Satori, where you're sort of like, you're sort of melding into the experience. And I think there's a real relationship with death there. And there's, there's not a coincidental relationship between people who meditate a lot and sort of a lack of fear of death. Because you're sort of like the way that your body would decompose if you were dying, your, your brain is sort of decomposing and turning into its environment. Like the way that your bones would turn into soil or something. Your spirit is just kind of turning into what it's experiencing. And that's a very powerful experience. It is like the psychedelic experience where you find, you realize that you're, you're a part of the world instead of just like an individual agent or a subject dropped into the world. And there's sort of the, the religious narrative that we're these, these little pinpricks that are kind of plopped down into the world and we're left to interact like, you know, in a, in the Sims or something. Yeah. But, but there, I think it's, there's an Alan Watts quote. I couldn't give it to you straight up, but it's kind of like your, you don't look like, you don't live in the world, you are the world, that sort of thing. Yeah, sure. That's definitely not the quote, but it's, it's that sort of strain, that sort of idea that you are, you sprout up from the world and the universe the way that a plant sprouts out from the soil. The earth creates, You don't just appear there, like from a spawn point, you know? The earth creates people in the way an apple tree makes apples. The world peoples, that's what he says. The world peoples. It's people-ing. I fucking love that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's people-ing. Yeah. And, and what a strange tree. The, the, the, that is, that, it's a lonely thing to be in a compartment, you know? Right. I mean, this is solitary confinement. If you want to see like, look at the effects solitary confinement has on people, it drives them mad. They've been compartmentalized in the most, in the ultimate way. They've been shoved into a box and they're, they're closed off from other people. They're completely separated by concrete walls and it drives them fucking mad. And then, and, and, and we hear these stories of solitary confinement and we walk around like, my God, well thank goodness I'm not in solitary confinement. In our moving cells. Yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah. We're in these like, rolling solitary confinement cells where there's me and the rest of the world and it's, wow man, those guys in prison, boy, they've got it bad. Meanwhile, there's people in these solitary confinement cells. I interviewed one of them, Damien Eccles, and they're in there meditating. Because, because the dharma is reaching into the prisons and you know about this, you know, the Zen Buddhists, the monks who come into the prisons and they teach these prisoners how to sit. Oh, I didn't know about that. Yes, yes, yes. It's because when you can't look out, you know, why not look in? Yeah. And, and, and, and so suddenly for some people, what happens is they, they have the paradoxical experience of being imprisoned and yet being more free than they ever were when they were in the outside world because they're no longer locked in to this identity that is so, for a lot of people, man, a prison cell would be a lot more space than the space they've locked themselves into in their psyche, you know, a prison cell. Oh, to like have a nice six by six cell to stretch out in for a lot of people that because some people, when they stretch out, they're like, oh, I'm lazy and when they're not stretching out, they're like, oh my God, I'm never going to get a chance to stretch. And like, you know, they can't even stretch out yet. So when you read about that in like in the autobiography of Malcolm X or the story of, I mean, I don't know, different stories, that's what comes to mind specifically, but there's a, you know, million examples of people who are in prison for a certain period of time. And that ends up oddly being what spiritually liberates them because they're forced to spend time like looking inside themselves and just reflecting and not to say that prison has that effect on any significant number of people. But I think that that is a very powerful realization because, you know, going about your day, living in some sort of cubbyhole of, you know, I'm this, I'm that, obsessing over what different labels you're going to associate with your identity, you know, and it plagues everyone. I feel like now with the internet has sort of fractalized culture in that way, where whether you're a corn farmer in the Midwest, or, you know, like a trans activist in San Francisco, or a soccer mom in Florida, or whatever, like you can have these five labels that you just smack on yourself like stickers. And that's who you are. And if your experience of the world doesn't meet that sort of symbolization of what you think you are, you experience this weird sort of tension. And I think it, I mean, everyone experiences it, but I think it makes a lot of people really unhappy. And it turns into that, I mean, it's what you're talking about compartmentalization, but we end up imprisoning ourselves even when we think we're liberating ourselves in some way. We like even people who I find people on Twitter who discover Zen or discover Buddhism, and they become obsessed by the terminology, or they become obsessed by, you know, a specific tradition or this or that. For some people, that's, that works. But in my experience, in my understanding of things, I'm like, okay, well, you should always be questioning why you're grabbing at that little box, you know, like I'm trying to get inside of it. Yeah, that's, it's like, yeah, it's like, if I was trying to climb into this can, LaCroix, I'm LaCroix. I would love to, I would, I would love to bathe in LaCroix, but I can't fit in the can. Well, you'd have to shrink yourself down. You know, that's a good, that's a good plug. Maybe they'll sponsor me. Shrink yourself down. Hold on. Uh, we're going to cut real quick and then we'll be right back. Okay. Oh, just one second here. Sorry, I have to go pee. I'll be right back. Oh yeah, no problem. I think I'm going to do the same. Oh, cool. Awesome. Okay. Okay. So here, forgive me for this. This is a, I think this is a little bit of a cheap, cheesy question. I don't expect you to have the answer to it right away, but if you were, if reincarnation were real and if you could engineer your next incarnation, but only in this way, you, you, the way you were only given three quotes that you could introduce to your brand new self as a child, what would those quotes be? So you've reincarnated your, your, your, and, and, and instead, I don't know how you came to Buddhism or came to spirituality, but I came to it accidentally, you know, I stumbled upon this and stumbled upon that. And one thing led to the other, but if you could engineer it, what would be the three quotes you would give your future child self after you died? Okay. Yeah. Sometimes I wonder how, how like attached to Zen, I am. And then when you ask a question like that, I realized that they probably be three like Eastern quotes, specifically probably Zen or Dallas quotes. The first one would be the one I kind of mentioned earlier, which was from the data gene. I don't know what chapter, but it's simplicity, patience, compassion. These are your three greatest treasures. So that would be the first one. The second one would probably be I'm just going to end up quoting the, the data gene. It's embarrassing, but it's whatever comes to my head is what clearly the most important ones. So the, the world is won by those who let it go. That's also from the data gene. And then I really like, it's falsely attributed to Winston Churchill, but it's just like a random quote from some guy in like the 19th century that people became obsessed with during World War II. And it's, if you're going through hell, keep going. I think those three cover a solid, like they're a little bit like corny, but I think if you're just starting out, that's what you need. So that's what I would do. Well, the last one, I think it's a little corny, but those first two data gene quotes are like my, those are my, you know, precious jewels. Those are what I, I worship basically, I'd say I try to at least, you know, in my better moments. Simplicity, patience, compassion. Tell me what simplicity is. I like to think of it as sort of the, you know, your life is like the, the block of clay that the, you know, you're the sculptor and you've got this big block of clay in front of you. And you're better off pairing away little bits of clay, a bit at a time to create what you're looking for instead of adding more clay onto the block. Okay. So that's kind of how I like to think about it. You know, you're sort of, it's the way, I think simplicity is the way that you, the way that you can approach your life as kind of an art form where you're, you're finding ways to make things less chaotic and more pleasant. And I find that simplifying, simplifying anything in like a mindful way that takes all the variables into account and has a net positive impact on your life has incredible. It's just like that's, that idea has completely changed my life. Like it's changed, it's made my business, you know, way better than I thought it would be. It's like sort of you take these ideas and you apply them to your life and you're like, oh, there's a reason that this idea has, has been, you know, worshiped for thousands of years. Sometimes there's no reason, but sometimes you, you try it and you realize that there's a, you know, a real value to a simple idea. Yeah. Oh, well, I mean, yeah. E equals MC squared, right? Like that's like, when you, you can, you could dense these. I've never tried that because frankly, I don't fucking, I have no, I know idea what it means. I just know it's important. So. Oh, you should try it. It's great. But it, but you know, the effect that that has had on, on, on society is pretty profound or, but the, the, what, why is it so difficult to be patient? I mean, I think a lot of it comes down to that, that speaking versus listening mechanism where when, when we let the ego take the wheel, we just want to be, we just want to be driving, like we don't care. We just want to be going faster and faster, pushing and pushing next thing, next thing, you know, uh, you know, I was addicted to that video game runescape when I was a child. Okay, sure. And now after having had that experience as like such an impressionable young mind, you kind of realize that when you're being impatient or overly zealous or vain in your real life, that you're kind of just treating it like, um, like a video game where the only purpose is to grind and to like, to just like do the same thing over and over again. And then like, you know, you meet, I mean, I've met a few really, really wealthy, really successful people who don't know how to turn that off, who still, they don't have the patience, like they've achieved everything they've ever wanted and they're continuing to do so. But without that patience, there isn't the ability to step back and to, to sort of slow things down and to enjoy things. So I don't think it's, it's not always just waiting for something to happen. It's more so, um, being able to stop at any time and reflect and kind of like let things emerge in yourself. You know, I love the comparison to RuneScape. It's funny, I brought that up, but it, you know, it's, it's a, I mean, there's a real, the way we approach, I think because of the way everything is so virtualized now and our experience of the world is so symbolic in so many ways and so virtual that comparing the times that we're living on autopilot and the times that we're really not living mindfully are a lot like being trapped in a, in a video game of sorts. Um, M-M-P-O-R-G or whatever. Yeah, it is. Yeah, specifically that genre of video game, I would say. Well, yeah, because that genre of video game plugged into the, the thing that gets people stuck in patterns, you know, it's, and also interestingly enough, like if you want to, want the, one of the cures for that kind of addiction is you realize like, wait a second, the exact same thing is happening over and over and over again, only it's getting like more colorful and bigger usually. Like, you know, like you, you, uh, when you start World of Warcraft, you're going to start fighting, I don't know, some kind of like fire cricket. You know, like you're going to go out with a little, like you're, you're crappy weapon and you're going to hit the fire cricket a certain number, you're going to grind. And then suddenly you're going to be given a little bit more, what a juice. And now there's a bigger thing you're going to have to attack. Now that thing is a little more difficult to beat. You have to use your new tricks to beat it. And then this cycle repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats and repeats until finally you realize like it's just fine. Why don't I just pull up a YouTube video of fireworks? It's just the same thing, right? Yeah. And I think that's the, the relationship between, um, you know, meditation and sort of like the, the pleasure principle that's inherent in all of us where we're constantly, I like the, the whole idea of the hedonic treadmill where the more pleasure, you know, the more pleasure you feel, the more pleasure you want. Basically, it's like it plays into addiction. It plays into unhealthy relationships. It plays into work. It plays into everything. You know, it's like one of our primary drives. And so if, if we let ourselves get carried away into that constant, that constant grind for more and more and more, uh, we never actually enjoy anything. We just kind of, it's, it's, you know, it's, we're all addicted to sort of different types of dopamine rushes. And if we don't step back and like let ourselves recalibrate, we end up just building a really, really extreme tolerance for enjoying like the simple things in life basically, you know? I mean, yeah, being able to appreciate, you know, if you've spent 30 years striving and striving and striving and striving and striving and striving and then suddenly you're like, Oh God, like I'm almost done with my life. I have all this money. I have all this stuff. But like, how do I, how do I enjoy it? Like, how do I stop moving? Or how, like, you know, it's, it's like, man, I've set up an imaginary, you know, in this case you, you can, you compartmentalize, you know, you make imaginary peaks, you know, you're, you're basically creating some kind of ridiculous, I don't know, marathon for yourself and you produce all these dumb finish lines. And then you run through the finish line and you pretend like you're happy or you act thrilled, or maybe you do feel thrilled. But, um, the, something I heard recently, which really kind of blew my mind is that happiness is actually just another kind of suffering. Have you ever heard that before? Right. I mean, yeah. And that's a very central concept in Zen is that you're not aiming for, you're not aiming for like pleasure or happiness or bliss. It's sort of this you're, you're letting your mind in a controlled way, you're letting your mind go beyond that dichotomy between suffering. I mean, it's, it's more than just happiness. It's like, you're letting your mind, it's the whole idea of the middle way in Buddhism really is that's what that means to me is you're, you're going beyond all of those dichotomies of good, evil, you know, joy, suffering, happiness, sadness, you're kind of pushing beyond that and trying to experience life on a, on a somewhat higher plane, I would say. Well, yeah. Or you're, you're sort of like, you're just popping these, like the, you're popping the bubbles, right? So it's like, so now you've, you know, first, the first bubble is, okay, it's the, it's, this is when I'm happy and this is when I'm unhappy. So there's one bubble, which is your happy bubble. And then there's another bubble, which is your unhappy bubble. And, and these, this is not real. It's, if you, if you just spin, like you're saying, if instead of just like, you know, eating food as quickly as you can, so you could eat more food, or instead of doing like creating like a personal vomitorium or whatever they call it, you know, the bigger you like, I gotta have my stomachs full of me. And then eat more. Like in this, you're not even tasting food anymore. It's like, when you look at the bag of chips and you ate, it's over, you know, you look at the glass of wine and you haven't tasted one sip and it's gone and you're a little tipsy, you're like, ah, pour another one and I'll taste it this time. But by then you can't taste it because you're kind of drunk. It's like, this is the hedonic treadmill, as you're calling it. But this continuum of experience, we break it up, right? We put these bubbles to try to differentiate. Okay, this is happiness. This is sadness. This is joy. This is grief. And you start realizing, wait a second, this is like, there's a comedian, I can't remember his name. And so I feel really bad saying this, man, I don't want to, damn it. I can't credit this person. So shit. Is it like old or new? It's old as hell. I might know it. I was a real comedy nerd in high school and still. Well, it's like, I heard a joke just how Taco Bell, it's the same food. It's like basically the same thing and different food in different shapes. You know, like if everything they serve at Taco Bell is, I'm sorry, whoever you are, if you contact me, I'll tweet the shit out of that game. I'm sorry, but I wasn't mine. But then it was a long time ago. But the main thing is like, this is the experience of life is it's like, when you start, I was like, wait a minute, my pain is my pleasure. My pleasure is my pain, right? My eye is a we actually. And there is no we. So somewhere in there, these bubbles start popping. And in that naturally, you've, the hedonic treadmill stops working. Yeah, completely. It's incredible. Having that experience is also very, it can be very unsettling. Right. I know, I think it was Robert Anton Wilson had that idea about psychedelics where there's a certain point where you get trapped in, it's called, he called it chapel perilous. Yeah. Where you're sort of trapped in between the like that, you know, ultra woke understanding of, I hate saying, I hate the word woke, but you know what I mean? Like, yeah, your third eye opens up, but it's like halfway open. And you're like, I'm still kind of trapped like you're trapped in limbo basically in between that state of realization and sort of like your primitive human monkey brain. Yeah. And yeah, that, I mean, it's sort of this, I think that's the thing about spiritual practice too, is it's this constant transition between those two states, like you're kind of always going back and forth. And you need to cultivate the kindness to yourself in order to understand that like your brain isn't just going to magically arrive at any point. But like you can have those little moments like you just described where you are, you get it, you know, and then you can carry that with you in your day to day, and like be more patient and more kind and more creative with like how you use your time and everything, you know, this is the, I think the product that this this really brings us to the third jewel that you brought up at the beginning and it compassion. You know, we if you can like in in the in this bubble popping practice, you know, it does seem like you need to you need to make sure that you're sitting in compassion for yourself because otherwise you will start beating yourself up, you know, because you're like, oh, fuck, man, I'm building more bubbles again. Or even worse, you're like, everything's just bubble wrap, man, it's not real, this world sucks, or, you know, all these things. So, but compassion is a confusing word for people. It's almost more confusing than love. So what's your definition of compassion? I mean, fundamentally, I think it comes down to seeing yourself as the world and the world is yourself sort of understanding the that, you know, process of fading into everything that we were talking about, because in doing that, you see other people, even like the people who you who you can't stand who are like you feel are so different from you that you can't understand that like you like they fundamentally are looking for the same things as you are, like we're all fundamentally very much, you know, just of that fabric and we want the same things. And then I think there's a certain compassion for yourself that comes from that realization, because you realize that you're not you're both not super special. And you're not like a piece of shit either. Like, it's very easy. It's I mean, it's very hard to cultivate that. And it's not something that I think anyone really ultimately achieves fully. But you can cultivate it on a daily basis, like in those little in those little bursts and in your practice, and it really helps with just sort of accepting, accepting yourself outside of any of those labels or judgments. And then in doing that, you're like, Oh, you know, even this person who I absolutely abhor is still just a person like who wants to be loved who wants to be understood who wants to be appreciated and acknowledged and like sort of waved at. Oh, hi, you exist, you know, like, yeah, you just sort of see things in that way. The same way you, you know, it's like we don't harbor, you know, if I was in the same room as a mountain lion right now, like, it's very dangerous. It's probably more dangerous than being in the same room as like a serial killer. But like, I'm in a harbor, you know, it's a lot easier to harbor hatred for the, you know, the serial killer or the, you know, the politician you don't like or your ex girlfriend or whatever it is, you know, and instead, like, and you're not going to harbor like abstract hatred towards a mountain lion, because like, you're probably never going to be in the same room as a mountain lion. But it's like, you're both just subjects of the world, you're both just existing in the same fabric. And so I think it's kind of like a rambling notion, but it's kind of just this idea that you're, you're accepting that there are, there are no real distinctions. And in doing that, you can kind of accept yourself fully. And then in accepting yourself fully, you can accept others. And I found in my own experience, that's when the most growth happens. Because people seem to think that if you accept yourself, you're not going to try, like you're not going to grow, you're not going to like try to make yourself better. But I found that if I, if I accept myself, like, if my girlfriend is telling me something about myself that I don't want to hear, like she's trying to have a conversation about something and I don't want to hear it. But I'm listening. And if I decide to listen and to open my ears and to like, try to really understand what she's saying, and accept it and be like, okay, yeah, that is like pretty true about myself. I don't want to acknowledge that it's true, but you know, you're right. That's an incredible moment of growth. And that's an incredible, you know, exchange between two people when, when two people can share that moment of growth together. You know, whether it's in a conflict or if it's in a some sort of loving exchange. And then that's what you're doing with yourself. It at your highest moments when you're sitting is sort of you're bearing all to yourself, you're looking in the mirror, you know, at ultra magnification and seeing all the zits and the boogers. And you're like, all right, you know, everyone's got these like, I don't fuck it, you know, it's okay. And some of them will stay, some of them will go away. They're not inherently ugly. Like it doesn't really matter. You just start to like question everything, you know, like, okay, you know, I accept myself. Well, you know, a tree that was terrified of animals eating its fruit would be in a lot of trouble. And that's great. Yeah. Wow. That's, that's really good. I like that. So we, when we're sitting, we're like the tree and we're eating our own fruit, so to speak, which is that, you know, these moments are or the seed, you know, or the seed when it's turning into a tree, the poor fucking seed, you know, if like, oh my God, look what's happening. Also, but also good for the seed, you know. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, so if like that, I think sometimes those moments where someone's telling you something that is you've, has been a bit of a blind spot. And if you can just understand, oh wait, the pain I'm feeling is the pain of a seed growing into a tree. Right. Of learning something new that you didn't know, that you're embarrassed, you didn't know, you're like, oh, fuck, that is true. Why do I do that? You know? Yeah. And it's like, you're, you're at your most power. That's another idea, that very Taoist idea that you're at your most powerful when you're at your most vulnerable. Because, you know, your defenses are, are down. You can like hear what the intruders have to say instead of just shooting them on site, sort of thing. Wow, what a great chat. Charlie, you got to go pick your dog up. Thank you. I do. Thank you so much for this. This is a thank you one of my favorite podcasts of all time. Can you please tell people where they can find you? Obviously, it's at Daily Zen, but talk a little bit, just briefly about your book and any other ways people can find you. Well, thank you for having me on, Doug. It was a real pleasure and a treat. Anytime. The Daily Zen exists at twitter.com slash Daily Zen, thedailyzen.org.

But it's called the Daily Zen Journal. And it's an illustrated 180 page interactive journey through all these ideas, I'd say. You can draw on it, you can answer different questions. It asks you to think about certain things, some that will make you feel really good, some of them will make you feel uncomfortable. And it's sort of intended to just sort of encourage some of the topics that I think we covered today. I think if you like this, you'll probably enjoy it. So I'm done plugging now. Awesome. Charlie, I'm so excited. I hope I'm allowed to say it. I'm so excited that you're moving out to LA. Me too. Cool, man. Well, I hope that you will come back on again. And what a joy.

The fact that I've got an incredible podcast to offer you with Jack Cornfield. We're going to jump right into that, but first, some quick business. He did not have a website, and so a gargoyle carried him away. She did not have a website, she was arrested by the king. They did not have a website, now they burn in hell. Demons ripping them apart and reconstructing them forever. Hey gang, it's me again, a hive of personalities that calls itself Duncan Trussell.

Long, long, rambling things that I put up there from time to time that I'm afraid to put on the main feed because I'm scared of getting too spiritual or sentimental or compassionate because I still want to be cool and I want you to like me, and for some reason I've stigmatized the idea that on the main feed you're supposed to talk about the fact that we're all made of love and the most important thing is loving people around you. So you can get more of that stuff over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Sign up and subscribe today and thank you to all my subscribers. Also, if you feel like buying anything on amazon.com that I mentioned on this podcast, search through dunkatrestle.com to find the Amazon link. Amazon has some very strict rules about their Amazon link now, which means I can't say certain things about it. For example, I can't say that anything you buy on Amazon, they give me a small percentage of it, and I can't say that by using the link you're supporting the podcast. And so that's not what's happening. There's just a link over there. If you go through that link and buy something that I mentioned on the podcast, for example, right now, I'm mentioning a very expensive computer, the most expensive computer on Amazon. You should buy the most expensive computer on Amazon, but first go through my link. Buy any toilet paper, any kind of household items, anything that would fit inside of your house, anything that you would, I'm now naming anything that would fit in your house or outside your house. And if you want to buy one of those things, click through the Amazon link and you will have that sent to your door. And I have now met the Amazon rules, but you got to really look deep through the website. Why would you do this? I love you. The fact that you would even spend more than a millisecond bothering with something like that is amazing to me. I thank you, whoever you may be, and for those of you who continue to use the link, much thanks to you. We also have a shop with t-shirts, posters, stickers, and a variety of beautiful things for you to decorate your home with all at DuncanTrustle.com. Friends, do you have an itch to send me something? Well, put it in the mail and send it to DuncanTrustle, P.O. Box 26717, Los Angeles, California, 90026. And I feel compelled yet again to thank the guy who sent me that insane electric guitar. Holy shit, man. I don't know if I thanked you or if you got the letter of thanks, but if not, thank you so much. That's an incredible gift and thank you to all of you who have been sending me stuff. God bless you. It's going to decorate many special rooms in my home. Friends, I just took a bit of a meditation class taught by David Nickturn this weekend and I met a lot of you at the meditation class. One of the things that kept coming up again and again is what do you get from a spiritual practice? What kind of stuff do you get? You do get stuff out of it. You get more focused, but more than that, you become aware of something that maybe you're not aware of now, which is impossible to even talk about because you have to do the practice, but it's very psychedelic and trippy and incredible. But what do you really get out of this stuff? Maybe you don't get anything that's as important as the fact that at some point, if you work on yourself long enough, you're going to get around somebody who is feeling bad, nervous, neurotic, freaked out, scared, unhappy, or is in a phase in their life where they really just need somebody to be a loving rock near them and to help them through whatever difficulties they happen to be going through. And for me, that person or one of those people is Jack Cornfield. This man is like a tuning fork and whenever I get around him, he does an incredible job of helping me remember something that is so easy to forget, which is that there are a lot of wonderful things happening on the planet right now, no matter what the howling dogs of destruction are telling you on the news or on the internet. So I really hope that if you're feeling rough, this conversation with Jack Cornfield helps you feel a little better. Jack is a meditation teacher. He is an author who's written many wonderful books on meditation. One of my favorite books on meditation called A Path with Heart. You can get that on Audible. I like the one on Audible because I like listening to Jack's voice. He also teaches meditation classes all around the planet. You can find out more about him by going to his website, jackcornfield.com. All right, everybody, unseal the locked iron coffin of your heart and open it up so that Jack Cornfield can spray great rainbow beams of sweet, compassionate and love all over your soul. Welcome to the Dunker Trussell Family Hour Podcast, Jack Cornfield. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the Dunker Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Ha! Jack, thank you so much for letting me invade your home here and interview. How are you these days? I'm terrific. Thank you, Duncan. The world's a mess, but I'm still good anyway. Do you think the world is more of a mess or less of a mess? Then, like before you were born, what? What's the time frame, baby? Let's say before the 1900s, more of a mess or less of a mess? It's a mess in a different way. Infant mortality was off the charts if you want to think about the blessings of modern life or how good it was back in the old days. Just think about dentistry, for example, and you go, oh, I'm glad we have a little modern life. But then again, we're melting the global glaciers and ice caps. You know, it's a wash. I do remember this, though. My daughter, who is an asylum human rights lawyer who works for people whose lives are in danger on the world, she called me after the last election and she was weeping because she was afraid for all the vulnerable people that she works with and other things. And it went over and I talked to her and I said, you know, this is not a new thing. My mom lived through, her dad came back from World War I. She lived through the Great Depression. She lived through World War II. So when things were bad, she said, yeah, I know what it's like to live through really bad times in the whole world. And I said, Caroline, back a couple of generations ago, you know, in the late 60s, when Martin Luther King was assassinated and Kennedy, Robert Kennedy was assassinated and there were all the riots at the Democratic Convention and the war in Vietnam and it felt like the government was lying to us about so many things and so forth and we were out on the streets. I said, every couple of generations it comes around again and I took off this red protection cord that I'd gotten, blessing cord from the diorama that I wear and I wrapped it around her wrist and I said, now it's your generation's turn and you know how to do this and this is what you've learned for your whole life is how to stand up for what matters and I give this to you and we have to do this every generation or two and this is part of what's asked of us as human beings in some honorable and dignified way. I want to talk to you about this phenomenon and I want to talk about young monk Jack Cornfield studying under Ajahn Chah. Did it occur to you that at some point that would be passed to you and that you would have to, in some ways, not to put it in that too dramatic terms but shoulder the burden of going from student to teacher and if so, how did that make you feel? Well, I need to read you a poem first because you're talking about passing it on through generations and it connects where we started in that conversation about the world which is woven together unbearable beauty and an ocean of tears and that's human incarnation and this is where we are. I see her on TV. This poem is written about Emma Gonzalez by one of my favorite poets and friend in Oakland, Allison Luterman, who writes all kinds of great poetry. I see her on TV screaming into a microphone. Her head is shaved and she's beautiful and 17 and her high school was just shot up. She had to walk by friends lying in their own blood, her teacher bleeding out and she's my daughter, the one I never had and she's your daughter and everyone's daughter and she's her own woman in the fullness of her young fire calling bullshit on the politicians who take money from the gun makers. Tears rain down her face but she doesn't stop shouting. She doesn't apologize. She keeps calling them out. All of them, all of us who didn't do enough to stop this thing and you can see the gray faces of those who have always held power contort utterly baffled to face this new breed of young woman, not silky, not compliant, not caring if they call her a ten or a troll. And she cries but she doesn't stop speaking truth into the microphone though her voice is raw and shaking under the molten sun. I'm nearly 3,000 miles away thinking how Neruda said the blood of the children ran through the streets without fuss. Only now she is, they are raising a fuss, shouting down the walls of Jericho and it's not that we road weary elders have been given the all clear exactly. But our shoulders do let down a little. We breathe from a deeper place, we say to each other, well it looks like the baton may be passing to these next runners and they are fleet as thought, fire as stars and we take another breath and say to each other, the baton has been passed and we set off then running hard behind them. That's cool. And I love the way she ends it because it's not that we desert what we care about, we run behind them too, but somehow we support them as well. And this was somehow the transmission to my daughter. So you're asking, did I have any idea when I was a young monk that I'd be carrying some little piece of this tradition? And it occurred to me actually, I said, well, I'm learning this stuff and it's not the kind of thing that I got in an Ivy League education. I'm going to tell you that. Nobody taught me about forgiveness or compassion or how to deal with my own anger and rage and outrage and how to have a mindful and respectful conversation with another person. I learned organic chemistry and medieval philosophy and I learned all kinds of good Ivy League etiquette but nothing really about the interior life of the heart, which is how we guide our lives. And this is the education that not only I needed, but humanity needs because right now if you look, no matter how space technology and nanotechnology and biotechnology and all this, your cell phone that has the Great Library of Alexandria in your pocket, we still have continuing warfare, continuing racism, continuing environmental destruction, tribalism. A change of consciousness is desperately needed. Humanity has to learn to see that who we are is not this separate, encapsulated cowboy separate from the rest of the world, but that we are interwoven in every breath with the winds that come across the Pacific and dust Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa and before that dust the Fukushima nuclear reactor that we're interwoven in every drop of water that we drink with the dolphins of the sea and the melting ice caps and that somehow we're in this together, we are family and that consciousness, which was central to the awakenings in the monasteries, is about to see this and know it and live differently. I thought, yeah, this is good stuff. Maybe I'll pass it on to somebody else someday. That's a long answer, Duncan. It's a beautiful answer. I think it naturally leads to a question I had as you were reading that poem and that phenomena is just incredible and it's amazing to watch the, you know, geriatric, angry politicians freak out when they realize that they're being exposed as bribe takers, sophisticated bribe takers, but bribe takers. But still in that poem, you have not this girl shrieking, yelling, angrily, blasting out. We are all one. But you have more anger, justified anger, righteous anger. How could you not be angry? School's bad enough. But now you have to go there and worry about getting shot. This is, I can't even imagine. Oh, that's getting put out of your misery when you're in high school. In a way it is, and it truly is. You have to have a little, little kind of dark, darkish nighttime humor about all of this shadow humor. Yeah, but listen, yeah, when I was there at that march for our lives in Washington, part of what struck me was there was like three quarters of a million people out on Pennsylvania Avenue, and part of what struck me actually was how civil it was. There were kids and balloons and bicycles and families, and there were people speaking from their guts and their hearts about how we have to stand up, and anger in it, of course, a kind of righteous anger. But that was not the main vibe. The main vibe actually was such that the security guards and the cops and everybody was smiling. There was some way, this is the world that we want to live in, a new world where people care about things, they can speak the truth, but also they're tender and respectful with one another. And so that's the change that will happen. Yes, it needs a certain passion. Yes, it needs a power, but you could also feel it was the power of love. She's saying, you know, not one more, not one more. But there will be. There will be. There will be next week. There will be until the not one more becomes so loud and so compelling that something changes, but even so human incarnation isn't going to change because the world's awash in weapons. That's right. And we, as the United States of America, are the largest weapons supplier to the entire world. We have sold hundreds of billions of dollars of killing machines. Even our foreign aid, half of our foreign aid is let's send weapons. And then we were, we're not safe. And when we're arming the world, so. Can I just interject what something my Uber driver on the way over here just told me regarding that? Because I was saying, you know, look, this is so many people. We are just very attached to hating Trump, very attached to hating him. It's fashionable to hate him. You're supposed to hate him. We don't like him. If you talk about Trump, you have to start it off by saying, you know, I don't like him. Yeah. But so here we are looking at the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, peace in the Korean Peninsula. One of the, one of the just powder kegs. And the Uber driver Korean is like, this is the greatest thing ever. This is so great. And he said, you know, it's family in South Korea. Of course. And he says, and he says, I don't like Trump, but that happened because of him. That happened because of him. And we all have to, we all have to deal with that. But then he said something because then I was like, yes. Can you imagine if we all, if by some awful, insane, terrible stroke of weird catastrophic luck, Trump is the one who brings global peace. If somehow peace breaks out in the Middle East somehow. And he said, no, that's not going to happen. Because like you said, the United States is one of the number one weapons manufacturers. He literally said what you just said. This is the sinister thing he said. He said, if you're selling umbrellas, you need it to rain. And in the same way, if you're selling weapons, you need war. And that, that is where we're at right now, which is we have a massive industry located in Los Angeles, by the way. You know, I didn't know that right in your neighborhood, right in our neighborhood. What about, what about that? What about that, Jack? What do we do about, what do we do about that? And I'm sorry to go on this rant. I'm sorry about that. This is my question. Grant Duncan, I'm shocked. I'm shocked that you're ranting. No, because what we see is like, you see this, you know, piece, piece, piece, piece. And yet on Twitter, it's hate, hate, hate, hate. I hate Trump. Take a breath, Duncan. Take a breath. Let me, let's change the elements of this conversation. Because you're talking in your rant with a lot of passion and some, some real intelligence, although it's partial intelligence, but it's still, it's important. Well, and you're laughing about it, not because you're a partially intelligent guy or anything like that, but because, of course, words and views are always one sided. There's another perspective. And if Donald Trump can bring peace and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula or the world, hallelujah. Thank you. I, you know, I bow to that. Yes. But you ask a much deeper question. You know, we are a wash in arms. And it is the weapons in the heart that have to be denuclearized. It is the landmines in the heart. It's the AK-47s. It's the cruise missiles in the heart. Yeah. These things come from humanity. And when you have kids in a kindergarten or preschool and they start whacking each other with blocks, you separate them. You say, use your words. You teach them small elements of civilized behavior when their aggression comes. Couldn't we learn as a species to say to our leaders, use your words? How about that? How about solving? There will be conflict. There's always conflict. Conflict is that we have different desires, different needs and so forth. We have to figure out how to share the earth and share what we have. There are different ways to solve conflict and there is a better game than war. There has to be some other way to do it. I mean, the Olympics were supposed to be that, but now we have Olympics and war. Hallelujah. We have them all at the same time. Here's two short little things to say about the spirit in which we make the change. Because we're on a kind of a cusp and everybody can feel it. Are we headed toward yet more conflict? Are we headed toward just continuing the denigration of certain people? You know, the growing gap between ultra-rich and the enormous number of poor people in the world. Right. So, two little stories. One, my friend and colleague Wes Nisker, who was, or Scoop Nisker, who was a great radio person in the Bay Area for a long time, but also a Buddhist teacher, went to interview Gary Snyder. Gary Snyder is in his mid-80s. He's one of the founders of the modern environmental movement. Pulitzer Prize winner for Earth household and other things that he wrote 50 years ago about bioregionalism and how we care for the Earth. And he said, Gary, he said, you look out. There's global warming, climate change, loss of species, ocean rising. What advice do you have for us at this time? And Gary looked back and said, don't feel guilty. If you feel guilty or angry or, you know, frightened, you add that same destructive energy to the energy that's already caused the mess that we're in. So, if we're going to save it, it's not going to be out of guilt or anger or fear. It's going to be saved because we love it, because it's us. And the only power that can meet the power of weaponry and the power of those who aren't afraid to kill is those who aren't afraid to die, those who aren't afraid to love no matter what. And you see Martin Luther King standing up and his, after the church was bombed and children were killed. And he says, we will meet your physical force with soul force. Wow. And that soul force will, that is the only thing that's a match. That's Gandhi's power. That's the power, actually, in every generation. And even as we speak, and we have this one hour or whatever that we talk together, the news is all about the unusual, you know. Dog bites man doesn't get into the news, you know. Right. All these people got home during the commute safely, does not get into the news. Today, you know, 334,000 airplanes landed safely in the world, doesn't get into news. The fact during this hour that we're speaking that there are 7 billion times maybe 10, 70 billion small acts of kindness on this earth that people actually stopped at a red light so you could go through the green like those kindergartners. Okay, you hold your, you know, that doesn't make the news. All that makes the news is what will grab your attention like it's going to grab some part of your anatomy. Yes. Is the stuff and the lowest part of the brainstem. And when that gets activated, we don't follow the dignity and the truth that we actually know. Story number two. Great. So I met a demonstration at the San Francisco International Airport a year ago or so after the executive order was passed to prevent people from the seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the country and all these people were stuck in airports. And my daughter and a whole group of young immigration lawyers and human rights lawyers went down there. There were more lawyers there than there were people behind, you know, being caught and they put up signs free legal advice to anyone who needed immigration help and so. But there was a couple of thousand people down there, all chanting and demonstrating no ban, no fear, all of that. My favorite part, we went to one of the exit gates. There were 400 people chanting. And in the middle of this crowd by the gate was a New Orleans jazz band. So the crowd would be chanting no ban, no fear, refugees are welcome here. The drummer would kick in behind them with a nice beat. Then the trumpet would come on top and lay this really cool riff on top. The sax player cut in. Pretty soon everyone is no ban, no fear, refugees, welcome. It turned into music. All the airport security personnel, everybody's smiling. It's a work of art. We're there. We're protesting. They know that it matters to us, but we're doing it with art and beauty and you almost can't deny something happening. And so there's something about bringing a different consciousness than just, oh, I'm against this and these are bad and these are good guys. Molly Ivins, who was a great, she was a best selling author in New York Times, columnist, Texas, you know, fire brand. And before she died, she says, she said, beloveds, as you go out there and raise hell and kick ass and fight for the good. She said, be sure to have a good time doing it. Really make sure that you're having a good time and let everyone know that this is the fight that you can have and that you can enlist other people and that it was a lot of fun to do this, to actually do this and say, we're on the train, the bandwagon, for the transformation that the world needs. Wow. To do it, you need two things. In Zen, they say there are only two things. You sit and you sweep the garden and it doesn't matter how big the garden is, which is to say you quiet the mind and tend the heart. Sit is sort of Zen shorthand for get your inner shit together in some way, right? You come into yourself, you quiet yourself enough, so you're not acting out of fear and reactivity and kind of adding to the chaos and the tangle. And then like Gandhi, who took one day a week in silence. And it didn't matter that he was taking part in the entire British Empire. And they'd say, Gandhiji, Gandhiji, there are hundreds of thousands of people out in the streets and people being killed and shot and so forth. We have to do something instead. I'm sorry, Thursday is my silent day. I have to get quiet and listen to what is the deepest and truest and most honest and honorable move I can make that we all can make. Maybe it's just to go and pull some salt from the sea, the salt march. Yeah. I have to do that. And then I get up, you sit and then you go out into the garden of the world and it's not your job to change the world. That would be hubris. Okay. You, Duncan Trussell, through your show are going to redeem this world, this human world. But it's your job to bring your gift and to mend the part that you can touch. And you will be depressed and unhappy with yourself and sort of swept over by the low brainstem, you know, stuff that comes through the news. If you don't do it because they want you to feel helpless. They want you to feel that there's nothing that can be done. It's too big. It's too much. That's part of the psychological form of the misuse of news and communication and politics. And you're not fucking helpless. And you're not someone who can't make a difference. And therefore, when you reach out and you say, I will do my part, I can mend this part that my hand can touch, I can see this. And whatever it is, raising conscious children, making conscious business, standing up for justice, looking at economic disparity, you know, looking at who's been targeted, what communities are vulnerable, and helping or standing up for that. When you do it, all of a sudden, you become a participant in creating a different world. Wow. That is so beautiful. What? It's like this is one massive garden. We've been assigned these little patches, these little patches. So this is beautiful. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. This is beautiful because you are, to me, this is a formula for a practice. For a pragmatic formula for a potential world peace. If we all start tending to our gardens in the way that you're talking about, if we all figure out a way to become more conscious, more compassionate, to denuclearize our internal Korean peninsula, so to speak, and then tend to the garden around us, who knows what could happen. But it has to start here. Has to start here. This is the origin of it. Mind and heart is the origin of how our world works. I love it, but this is what I want. You are such an incredible fireman. People call you people Buddhist. A better word is you extinguish these blazes. But for me, my current blazes, I am so frustrated and pissed off, I guess you could say, annoyed. Not with the world, but people who are pissed off at the world and are blasting all this. And I recognize the deep hypocrisy in that statement. But these people blasting so much hate, infinite hate. It feels to me that a great many people are deeply invested in the world being rotten because it gives them a chance to fire off infinite tweets or Facebook posts about how rotten the world is. They're spraying out so much fear and so much, there's no forgiveness there. Anytime anyone does anything, these people who do these monstrous things, the ferocity with which they're attacked, it is so, in its own way, abhorrent that it makes me feel like, oh, great. Well, like now you guys are just another version of that thing. So what I'm saying, I guess what I would ask is how what do people to do if they start realizing they're actually attached not to the idea of there being world peace or to being beautiful gardeners of consciousness, but they're more addicted to just being angry all the time. And they're pretending that they're gardeners. So James Baldwin put it this way. He said, I believe that one of the reasons people cling to their hate and prejudice so stubbornly is that they sense that once hate is gone, they will be forced to deal with their own pain. So when there's hate there, I become really curious. And it's not to say I can't get triggered because I can when people are acting in a horrible way and increasing the suffering and the polarization of the world or increasing the suffering of those who are vulnerable. I can get triggered and, you know, really upset. So I'm not just like Mr. Calm over here. But from a deeper place, one has to become I have to become interested in what is it under there that makes people be hateful. And almost always in my experience, it's their level of pain, despair, insecurity and fears. The fact that they haven't been respected in some way, that they've lost their own sense of dignity and agency. And, you know, I see that over and over again. And, you know, when I was in Palestine and Israel doing some peace work, you know, I could feel from the most kind of vehement, hateful side in that that underneath it was I've been first of all, I'm terrified these other people are going to take everything, kill my family, whatever. But also under it was so much trauma. And a lot of it's unconscious and then it just gets retraumatized. So in that regard, you know, when I think about all these people who are hateful and so forth, I would rather look at, well, what is the fear you carry? What is the depression you carry? And how is the society not helping you? We live in a society with so much loss of jobs, economic injustice, lack of respect, you know, in the way that it's being organized now. There are a lot of people who feel there's nothing better to do than that. That's the only move. And then we project it out because we can't bear our insecurity. We can't bear that that pain is actually ours. So we blame it on the Mexicans, or we blame it on the Muslims, or we blame it on the communists, or we blame it on the blacks or the yellow or the brown or somebody who looks different than us in some way or other. And we project it all out because we can't bear the insecurity of being a human being. I got you. And the truth is that we are vulnerable and no one teaches us that that's okay. The poet Rilke writes, ultimately, it's upon your vulnerability that you depend. And what that line means is that every time you go through a traffic light or drive on the right-hand side of the street, your life depends on the fact that somebody's going to drive on the correct side of the street coming toward you. That every time you buy food in the market, or even the farmer's market, because you're like this hip person, goes to the farmer's market and you can afford it, whatever, you know, you trust that that person didn't put some lethal amount of pesticide on that food. That we are at the vulnerable to one another every day in every stage of our life. And to recognize this means that we're in it together. But people who don't know this, who don't understand our human lot, that we're these beautiful, and maybe sometimes like the ugly flowers that are planted in this garden of life, that we are life and so forth, that we're in it together, get swept away by this. And of course, it's easy to judge the people who are judgmental, right? Yes! As you say, the hypocrisy, and to hate those who are hate-mongers. Yes! And then you say, hmm, now that's interesting, what is that? Well, that energy washes in through your nervous system. It activates you. Yeah, let's get on the hate train. Right. We can match them. And then you say, you know, that's not actually the place I want to live. And that's not the place of consciousness that we need. There's a beautiful book. I was recently in Darm Salah for the Mind, Life, Science meetings with the Dalai Lama and all these neuroscientists. There's recently a book called The Book of Joy that was published. New York Times bestseller for anyone that still reads books. By the Dalai Lama and Archbishop Tutu from South Africa. Both Nobel Prize winners and good friends. And Tutu came up to Darm Salah. And they spent a week answering the question, how can you two men who've seen so much suffering, how can you be happy and joyful and laugh? And Tutu has this kind of giggle that's just totally wonderful. But he lived through apartheid and saw his friends and colleagues be shot down or necklace, you know, with a tire around their neck set on fire. And the Dalai Lama, every week, talks to people who are walking over the Himalayas, sometimes almost barefoot to escape being tortured in Chinese army prisons because they say the word Dalai Lama or their temples are being, you know, closed down or burned or the nuns put in prison. And yet people go to hear the Dalai Lama partly, yes, he's a world figure Nobel Laureate or he has these beautiful Tibetan teachings that none of us really quite completely understand but it seems really cool, you know. But I think people go to hear the Dalai Lama by the tens of thousands because they would love to hear him laugh. And the fact that somebody who can carry that weight of suffering and still have a joyful heart gives us hope. And when he's asked about it in this book, he said, they've taken so much from me. You know, they've taken our temples, they've taken our sacred texts, they've taken our religious freedom, they're taking our land and culture. Why should I let them take my happiness? So we become the, I use different languages, we become the pollen, you know, what kind of fragrance are we going to spread through the world, you know. And if you go and work in a refugee camp or places where people are, you know, imprisoned and so forth and you go and you're really depressed, that doesn't help them. They don't want a depressed person coming in. It doesn't. You're, you know, there's some way in which actually you have a dignity of spirit and you have a freedom to choose your spirit no matter the circumstances. And that's your deep and fundamental freedom. This is, it's so beautiful and it's so true. It seems like so many people are more interested in producing a reaction of horror or grief or guilt or whatever it is. There's, it seems like the height of selfishness to go into a refugee camp. Make sure you fill me weeping to go into the room of someone dying. What am I going to do without you to do all these things? It seems to be a, you know, actually I'll tell you, they, Mitzy Shore, who was the owner of the comedy store and one of my teachers died recently and we had a memorial and man, it's the most amazing thing to watch comedians die. Not die. Hold on a second. We don't have a wishful thinking. Don't do it yet. We still have 30 minutes. No, the, the, uh, no, to, to see comedians talk about, you know, someone who has just passed away. And many of them, it's so beautiful and poignant and hilarious and, and offensive. It would be to a civilian. It would just be the most offensive thing you ever heard. What's really funny is a few of them managed to not even talk about Mitzy, but to just sort of give themselves accolades for all their great success, because the memorial was actually just an excuse for them to be on stage and to like, to like talk about themselves. And so in the same way, I think that these, the, the world and the catastrophes and the disasters and the perceived disasters and the real disasters for many people have not, the people aren't even drawn to truly wanting to like help this garden, but they want to be on stage screaming about how rotten things are. That, that seems the, to me, what's going down is that people have become attached to the horror. And they wouldn't want, this is what I was thinking. I wonder how many of these people who just despise Trump with all of their heart, if they secretly could choose between Trump being bringing world peace and there being war, how many of them would pick war? Because they would rather there be a cataclysm than they'd be wrong about somebody. That's what I was thinking. That, you know, to me, this seems like on both sides, people have become attached to being miserable. Not me though. Not you? You're not? I'm being a little sarcastic. I think there is an attachment there. There is an attachment to the living in the world of like, well, what are we going to ran? Jack, if we have a beautiful garden where we've all tended to it and it's beautiful and it's peaceful, what are we ran, what are you going to run about? So I have, you know, when I look inside and listen to you and try to get quiet, there's a couple of things. In terms of Trump, you know, if he can make peace and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and guts a Nobel Prize for it, I would be very happy about that. And I also realize that many of the other policies and statements that he's been making, fuel hatred elsewhere in the world, create dissension, target and really harm vulnerable people in all kinds of circumstances, often the people who are already the most vulnerable in the society, put all the power and money flowing more directly to a very small elite and so forth. So while I would celebrate that, the thing is I'm more interested in seeing, honestly and clearly, than being attached to my opinions, which I certainly have. So I would celebrate that. See, you're sort of talking about black and white, you love them or hate them. That's also a very, how do you say it, early, undeveloped, developmentally speaking, children either see their parents as all good when they give them ice cream or all bad when they say they have to go to sleep. There's a developmental stage that happens at some point where you realize that your parents are both good and bad. Yes. You know, and that the world is both good and bad. Now, part of what you're talking about is in the human heart. Part of it is also the current technology because we get fed or we choose, we go to the buffet of news online very often and so forth. And the algorithms, the main goal of Facebook, Google is to capture your attention. And the easiest way to capture the attention of a human being is to scare them. Right. It's also true for politicians. You know, the whole aim of politics is to frighten the populace, to say, oh, we need a strong leader. That's a lot of how it works. Right. So we are actually the best paid psychologists in America are working on algorithms to grab the attention from your brain, and particularly the best way to do it is the lower part of your brain through greed and hatred and fear and so forth. So when you see it go, oh, okay, that's what's happening out there. I'm not that interested in that game. Actually, who I am is so much bigger than that. Right. And I'm going to cut my news down to 10 minutes a day. Basically, you know the plot. There'll be some new thing that happens. There's an earthquake that day. There's a law that's passed that harms people or helps people. Right. 10 minutes will get you the gist of it and why run the rest of that through your nervous system. And then instead of running it through your nervous system, say, now I'm a free agent. I'm a human being and I'm going to do what is really true to my own heart. Beautiful. So, and then, you know, when we talk about what you do, how you respond to this world, again, you sit, you quiet the mind, you kind of listen inside, and then you see what your gift is. And my friend, Maladoma Somay, who's a wonderful West African shaman and medicine man with a couple of PhDs, you know, in his back pocket, kind of extraordinary. If anyone's interested, I think it's Man in the Water of Life might be the title of his first book on his initiation in Africa. But anyway, he said that among the Dagora people in West Africa, it's believed that every child who is born carries a certain cargo. And I like this metaphor. It's like the cargo ships that ply the rivers in West Africa. And that your job in this human incarnation is to deliver your cargo. Wow. That you have a particular, you know, gift or something to bring. And then I'm going to read you a story that kind of helps to illustrate it. That's so beautiful. I've heard a different version of that, which is a baby comes with a sandwich under his arm. Have you heard that one? I haven't. It's less beautiful. Pastrami or what? What is this? It depends on. Or grilled cheese. It depends on what deli you went to before he was born. Right, of course, or when you got pregnant. So here's the story, if I can find it for you. What is the baby supposed to do with the sandwich while I'm looking? The baby, I guess the baby, you know, gives you the, that's part of what happens when children are coming to the world. Is this light? They come with a sandwich, right? I guess whoever came up with that saying was clearly hungry. The sandwich trailing, trailing clouds of glory and mustard and ketchup or whatever it is mayonnaise. Okay. So here's the story. This Hawaiian educator named Poo Anani Burgess. She says one of the processes she uses to help in schools and communities to get people talk together is called building the beloved community. And the exercise of it requires people to tell three stories. The first is the story of all your names. The second is the story of your community. And the third is the story of your gift. So one time she says, I did this process in our local high school. We went around a circle and we got to this young man and he told the story of his names well and the story of his community. But when it came to tell the story of his gift, he said, hey, what mess, what kind of gift do you think I get? I mean, I'm in this special ed class. I have a hard time reading. I can't do math. Why should you shame me like this? Make me ask what my gift is. If I had a gift, you think I'd be in the special ed class. You know, here we are. And so the boy just shut down and shut up and she says, I felt really shamed. I've never wanted to shame anyone, but it can happen. You know how we are. So a couple of weeks later, she writes, I'm in a local grocery store and I see him going down one of those aisles and I decide, nope, I don't think I'm going to go that direction. And I start to turn around. But somehow he sees me and he runs toward me, Auntie, Auntie, I've been thinking about you, thinking, you know, what two weeks I've been thinking, what my gift? What's my gift? I say, okay, brother, what's your gift? He says, you know, I've been thinking, I can't do that math stuff and I can't read so good. But Auntie, when I stay in the ocean, I can call the fish and the fishy come every time. And every time my family not have very much, I can put food on my family table. Every time. And sometime when I stay in the ocean and the shark, he come and he look at me and I look at him and I tell him, Uncle, I'm not going to take plenty fish. I just take one, two fish just for my family, all the rest I leave for you. And so the shark, he say, oh, you cool, brother. And I tell the shark, Uncle, you cool. And the shark, he go his way and I go my way. And I look at this boy and I know what a genius he is. But in our society, the way the schools are set up or the values we have, he's rubbish. He's not appreciated. So when I talk to his teacher and principal, I ask, what would his life have been if this curriculum were gift-based? What if we were able to see the gift in each of our children and taught around their uniqueness and gifts? What would happen to our community if we were gift-based, if we could really understand that each of us has a gift and our communities could draw on that and support that? So, you know, I'm thinking about or I'm picturing those who are listening. Because again, our society limits what we see as valuable to certain, you know, you have to have money or you have to have this kind of degree or you have, you know, to make a difference, you have to be this or that kind of person. And it's simply untrue that who you are as a human being already carries gifts. And who you are as a human being has an innate dignity, you could call it Buddha nature or true nature. Who you are as a human being knows things, knows you're connected with the world, knows it underneath no matter how depressed or cynical or even angry you are. There's some way in which you also want to be loved and you want to offer love. Because it's innate to us and the fact is that we are loved, the consciousness and lover are the same thing. I think we were all together in the Big Bang and we miss each other, you know, or something like that. But when you get quiet, you know things much more deeply in your heart. And if there's a tremendous amount of hatred and fear and so forth, it's only because underneath that there's a tremendous amount of pain and anguish. And can you hold that with compassion? When you can, it starts to ferment and get transformed and like fertilizer. When you can hold your measure of tears and sorrow with some deep compassion say, this is the human life I've been born into and I can hold it in this way. And things start to change. Man, this is so perfect. I am so grateful to you, Jack. You have such a gift and it's something that I wish I could stay in that place all the time. But you can't. Well, no, it's so easy to forget all this. And you're not supposed to, Duncan. That would be another ideal. And then you could judge yourself, I'm really a crappy spiritual person and I can't stay there. I want to be, you know, Mother Teresa or something like that. You just don't look like her. And you never will. And it's just not going to happen. Plus, when Mother Teresa went into San Quentin to visit and came up to Marin to the Bay Area, before she left, she said to the prisoner, she said, no, I need to ask a really big favor, something important. She said, I want you to pray for me because I got a big job in this world and I really need help. And there's something about the kind of, you could call it humility, but really just understanding that we're all in this together. And the idea that you get into some state and keep it that way. Mother Teresa also could get annoyed, by the way, you know. Right. And okay, now I'm going to get into this big expanded wonderful state of consciousness. I'm going to hold it and I'll just keep it there. And you can't breathe. But the thing is that the heart pumps and the lungs open and close and the body breathes and the lunar cycles change. And the tide comes and goes and the menstrual cycles and the stock market cycles. And consciousness, the mind and heart also open and close and the eye doesn't have it open all the time. I love everything all the time. I just love it. No, sometimes you need to be quiet. Sometimes you need to tend the garden in a very simple place. Sometimes you need to wait till the sun goes down and just get interior. Sometimes you need to renew yourself and then you open up again. And sometimes you lose it and say, oh, wow, boy, I really lost it this morning. That's what consciousness does with some amusement. And then you kind of pick yourself back up again and say, well, that was interesting. And because the ideals and the notion of perfecting yourself is folly. I mean, you're going to perfect your body. Forget it. Just look closely at it. You're going to perfect your personality. That's even more hopeless, right? You're going to perfect your mind. Look at your thoughts. It has no pride. Right. The point, I mean, yes, you can do your therapy and do your meditation and, you know, jog and have a good day and all these things and you get a little better. But the point, I mean, you can say, OK, how's that going? But the point is not to perfect yourself, to perfect your love. And to perfect your love means to see yourself and other beings, flawed beings that we are with the eyes of love and understand that that's it's the truth. It's the healing balm. It's the thing that makes not only the heart sing, but actually makes what we care about come alive on the earth. Jack, thank you so much. As always, this is a beautiful moment for me. I'm so grateful that I get to spend any amount of time with you at all. Me too, Duncan. What about everyone else who wants to spend time with you? How can they find you?

333^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - TOM RHODES is THE CHANGELING!!! Transcript and Discussion^2013-07-04^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello everyone and thank you for tuning into the Dunga Trussell Family, our podcast. Why don't we start this podcast off right with a Fourth of July song from my dear sweet friend, the teacup pig. This is to you, Katy Perry. I love you, girl. Everybody has a dream to one day be a firework. To rise up in the sky and explode into pieces everywhere. Feel the sizzle of the heat as your skin plays away from your bones. And your eyes melt out of your sockets as you fall back down on the ground. Yes, we one day will be fireworks. All we need is a dream, some gasoline and a plane. Yes, we one day will be fireworks. Falling to the ground in an entertaining way. If I had my choice, I'd much rather be a firework. Than work at a job that made me feel so cold. Surrounded by people pretending they're not fireworks. Tizzling their life away when they secretly want to explode. Yes, we one day will be fireworks. We must decide between the cremation flame or a hole. Yes, we one day will be fireworks. No matter what we do, the sun is going to explode. So this 4th of July is your land on the beach with your girl or your guy. And you look up there in the sky and see those fireworks exploding so high. Imagine that every single one of them is a person. Somebody who came before you and died just like you're going to die. And remember that you're impermanent and that you too will explode in an atomic chemical reaction. Or you blend back into all things. You don't last forever, nothing does. And that's what the 4th of July is about. And I love you Katy Perry. And if you would please just respond to one of my letters. And I've been sending you a meme so much to make just an autographed headshot. It would be so wonderful as a take-up pic. I'm going, I'm going, I'm going to get a take-up. The Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Shore Design T-shirts. Here's an interesting trivia fact that many people don't know. Did you know that the reason John Denver crashed his plane into the ocean is because he was wearing a Shore Design T-shirt? That's right. The master folk musician, the sweet singer of the wind himself, John Denver had just put on a soft Shore Design T-shirt, climbed into his experimental plane, and just as he hit 2,000 feet, fell into a sweet soft slumber. And while he was asleep, his plane crashed into the sea and drifted down into the coral reefs below where they say that starfish were found, chewing on his body, sucking his flesh away and transforming it into caloric energy that they could then use to look so beautiful there on the ocean floor. ShoreDesignT-shirts.com, they killed John Denver, sure, but it was worth it. What a wonderful death. Nothing could feel better than falling from the sky if you were John Denver and if you're wearing these shirts that are made of the softest fabric that any human has ever felt or experienced. The ShoreDesign T-shirt fabric has been described by President Barack Obama as feeling nearly as soft as the inner folds of the throat of prisoners in Guantanamo Bay who are being force-fed as they desperately try to kill themselves to escape the miserable and eternal hell that they've been placed within illegally by President Obama. And from time to time, he likes to take a little trip over there and shove whole apples into the throats of these prisoners. And according to President Obama, is his fist shoves down past their tonsils and gets that apple down into their stomach, and the feeling of their esophagus, of their tonsils, of their tongue is so very soft that the only thing that our sweet president can compare that feeling to is the feeling of a ShoreDesign T-shirt and the way that thing feels is it rubs against your body as you go jogging or go to yoga or take your tap dancing classes here in this wonderful country where we are having such a wonderful 4th of July.

Rhodes. Here we are. You're going to turn off the AC. Oh, yeah, let me turn that off. Sorry. Sorry, man. I got to get it chill in here though. I already did the I do the intro before so the intro already happened. Hey, there's not the buzzing sound of an air conditioning. No, it's gone. It's not amazing though. You could just roll in a Rectangular shaped thing and cool air and that's good because like what the heaters that people have in winter like people die all the time from those You mean from setting their houses on fire, right? Or like I don't know some poor quality ones put out some kind of Boater gas. Oh, yeah thing that isn't asphyxiates the whole family Don't you think that's an interesting thing about mass producing any item is that when you no matter what it is like people who make baby toys They know when somebody comes up with some new rattle, they know this is gonna kill 15 kids right and McDonald's small pieces in the happy meals. They Choked to death a lot of kids. Yeah, that's an odd like when you produce something at the Enough of something it will kill. Well, and you know like China. They don't give a shit What was that the baby milk had like lead paint in it? Yeah, two years ago. Oh, they don't care They don't give up, you know, if you'll buy this air conditioner for 120 bucks You know, I mean think about stand-up is totally different stand-up comedy is like one thing that It doesn't it's not really gonna kill somebody like when you put out a comedy album That's not on your mind like oh, yeah This is a couple of kids are gonna choke on on some of these jokes and die in front of their parents They're parents are gonna walk into there and see in the crib this blue bloated thing with one of Tom Rhodes jokes Earbuds well, that's and that's why I make my CDs a certain size. So they They're too big for a toddler's throat You know, it's really sad though, man If like one of your jokes just for whatever reason you just hit the right resonance or with the combination of sounds Disrupted the neurology of toddlers and killed children You're you your CD the sales would probably go up, right like when there was suicides from Metal bands and things like that. Yeah That's like a when when when that's the other side of things is that People want like with music and art if it kills people, it becomes more desirable Incredible It's throughout history, you know book sales and yeah music remember it was like You're probably too young to remember but it was like in the 80s with the devil was in rock music And now it's like God with terrorism and all this Real-life nasty shit people have to deal with like life and government. Yeah, it's like God I wish the old days when all we had to worry about was that the devil was in rock music and some kid played a record backwards and killed Himself and oh my god. Yeah, it's only two teenagers in the entire country But we got to have a big awareness program now of The devil. Oh, I remember that man. That was a joy Did you ever believe in the devil when that stuff happened? Did you believe I was like, you know, I'm from a Town I grew up in outside of Orlando, Florida little town called Ovito. Hello people. Oh veto You know in really religious, you know area I always loved like AC DC and the whole, you know highway to hell that's you know Song used to upset people. I went to Bon Scott's grave and I did the Perth comedy festival two years ago and He's from Fremantle, which is the Ovito of Perth And I Went to his grave and put flowers on it because like he helped me get through the eighth grade Well ninth grade without killing anybody Wow, you know, when you're like, oh, you're a freshman and whatever and you know Just life is confusing and I had a altercation with this kid at a baseball practice couldn't take a joke I'm behind him. We're doing the warm-up things. Yeah And I sneezed on my right hand and with my left hand I wiped it on his back and then he just turned around and punched me right in the nose Oh, that was like this big ordeal and then I was supposed to fight the kid like whatever the next day after school It's big showdown and everybody's waiting for it. And you know, I just went home and listened to powerage Did you fight him? No, I went home and sat in my room and listen to AC DC because I mean like I wanted to do more than fight him I wanted to you know Set fire to his family home and kill his entire family. I was pissed Right, you know, I mean, I was being goofy with the joke, but like this kid was just a dick Yeah, you know, he was in the Christian Athletes Association And and they were like against the devil and rock music. They would have the meetings You know reading rock lyrics and things like yeah, like highway to hell and you know, so I Really really appreciate bond Scott and I put flowers on his grave So if I don't know I mean he was friends with the devil. Do you think? But do you think now do you think how much of that the devil owned every booger and bond Scott's nose How much uh How much of that's theatrics do you think like how much did he believe a hundred percent I think, you know, they probably I mean They were just you know piss-takers as they say in Australia. Yeah, I Think they got you know, they got a kick out of upsetting their local people Sure, and I think that's I mean now it's child's play, you know, especially when like, you know gangster rap and you know Fucking kill police and shit like that. But you know back then that was really cute But don't you think even gangster rap and kill the police is kind of child's play really? I mean, yeah now like I'm saying I mean you got that you got that guy in London and he chopped off the British soldiers head in the street Yeah, and dude standing there talking casually with the meat cleaver in his hand and to the PS get your phone out You know like letting people film him and yeah with their phones Like saying when he's standing there's got blood all over his hands like what what fucking deranged person could cut off another human Being's head. Well, yeah, that yes, that's where we start moving out of the land of child's play and into the realm of like, you know Memorable action, but even that When you consider the then what's you know, what's really happening is still that's kind of almost like a pathetic Revolution attempt of somebody trying to do something revolutionary because he's so overwrought when he looks out at like the crazy shit That's going on, you know, which is people people doing heinous shit in the name of religion It's just like I mean, why hasn't humanity grown up and evolved past this where there's enough Reasonable thinkers in the world that would go okay, stop, you know, yes Let's address this fucking ignorant issue of you know, your god wants you to kill Fucking infidels. Well, yeah, and then you get then then you have that and of course, you know Then the number of deaths from religious violence is is now I think You know in the last five years you could just show okay. Well, how much how many deaths are caused by? nationalism and how many deaths are caused by Religion and I think that nationalism had it was really beating religion like it was way ahead for a while hundreds of years Yeah, it's doing much better in the game, right? But you have a chart in your kitchen It's one of some families have the little growth chart, you know and written in pencil. Yeah, but you know what they both have in common is that they both use human sacrifice to Achieve their goals and that to make their point. I guess, you know, like look at those Ruthless drug dealers in the north of Mexico last year. They that where they pulled up In some town that was they were having issues and some people were trying to do the right thing or I don't know exactly what but They pulled up in like two pickup trucks with all these like 20 or 30 bodies with Decapitated heads and just started they threw them out on the road. Yeah, just so you know make their point Yeah, that's the that's it's the last there's like only sorry. I'm hitting the peas so hard You need a piece green I need a piece green That sounds like some kind of thing to like you use with dominatrix's to like Maximize the amount of piss that comes out of them because I grab my peace cream You mind if I get my peace cream it like slows down I brought a piece green I'm a professional Peace green um you the the The Concept of death is one of the final taboo is available to us That's like the last thing that we can't figure out and so it's very we're still terrified of death That's like the bit final last fear is death. Everyone's just fucking scared of death And so that's like the worst thing you can do to someone has killed them And that's like the worst thing that can happen to you as you die like I was just at this Um For this thing I'm shooting with Rogan for sci-fi we We went to a conference of scientists and neurologists who are trying to it's called the gf2045 and it's these scientists These reputable scientists are trying to extend the human lifespan Because right now every year the human lifespan increases according to this one guy from Princeton that we interviewed the human lifespan increases every year by Something like a quarter of a year So every year the lifespan increases by a quarter of a year and their goal is to make it so that every year the human lifespan Increases by a year because then you have immortality and that's what they're working on is trying to achieve human immortality. They're in a desperate Struggle against death They're trying to eliminate the parts of our genetics that cause us to age and they think that it's very likely Very very very likely that within the next hundred years something akin to human immortality Will be achieved because they're afraid of death, you know That's like the big fear shit. I smoke cigarettes. I'm never gonna make it That's the crazy thing Tom Yeah, I mean you're you're yeah smoking cigarettes is that's why all these none of these people smoke and they all eat shit Loads of vitamins right because all foods and yeah, cuz they're trying to get to that point But you know already with cancer medication and stuff the new kind of medication they have that just targets, you know Just strands of DNA instead of like chemo bombarding all of your but still they can't discount or ever eradicate human stupidity the I just want to say pee again. What was that Philadelphia? Philadelphia Philadelphia that forklift operator guy the big crane shovel scooper thingy the guy knocked over some building Yes, and no one was hurt, but I mean there's there's a you know a lot of dumb people working big Heavy equipment. Here's where a good spooky man. They because that was one of the questions We asked I will not spill in the beans too much on this show because I'm supposed to keep it kind of secret or not talk about the details But this um, why not reward the listener? Yeah, no shit. I mean this show. This is one little piece That's something else. I gotta look up. You don't think these listeners are busy enough. Yeah, right in their day Yeah, fucking give me a link. No, tell me don't tell I don't have to do something. I'm already doing something else Yeah, no one's gonna fuck it. Yeah, exactly and not like I'm gonna get busted for talking about now I gotta go to you one of the questions we asked a scientist was that there was it was like well, okay, great, so We extend the human lifespan Doesn't keep people from walking in front of cars doesn't keep people from getting into accidents and this guy said no, no, no actually Genetics are so responsible for intelligence and People who get into accidents, you know, people get run over people get in a car accident. They're not dumb But they might not be you know They might not be smart enough to know not to drive after seven beers So we're just gonna just thin out the the gene pool and then They're gonna have automated. They're already working on cars. You don't have to drive. Yes, you can you know Just be magic cars. You link up to a system and just well that that see that's based on the idea that we still have to I picture a lot of bright sweaters in this Maybe bow ties will be all the rage. I'm I'm glad I'm gonna miss it You don't here's the problem the most boring fucking people with no stories. They didn't drink Oh, no, man, these people weren't boring at this conference. These people were fucking weird boring. It's not the right word There was a side hillbop weird. Yes. Yes. Yeah, man. Like there this is a these people there's there was a curious heaviness at this place and and and it's like what because what's happening is I Basically what's happening is Technology is beginning to be recognized as a life form technology as they say is like this set like I don't know how many kingdoms There are I think there's six kingdoms or something eight I don't know how many kingdoms of life there But they're saying technology is soon to be added into a new kingdom of life and the technology is growing out of humans humans are The like when you see that weird fungus that drops on ants and causes like the ant to climb up a tree where then it Explodes with all this like fungal shit that rains down on the other ants. Well, that's what technology is done with humans It's infested our consciousness and is driving us towards this point where we actually usher in or like the midwives of this technological being which is going to be the Computer that we wake up through full-brain emulation. We're giving birth to this thing like rosemary's baby Or they make her wear the funny fucking necklace Smell this is pungent that way. That's a terrible impression of her But you know what? I mean, we're the midwives of the apocalypse. We're growing the anti Christ We're lit and I'll let me tell you man This is what's fucking weird about this because our movies just got too boring We had to fucking amp up real life Jack Yeah, yeah fucking it's Hollywood fault made it put out some more entertaining shit We wouldn't have had to do this. Let me tell you man when you go to a conference of geniuses There and you see dudes in robes walking by because they have archbishop's hanging out there and stuff Something about the combination of trying to bring the dead to life make humans immortal and Robes when those things mix when you see the crossing of those things you're like oh wizards again anytime the robes come out You know, there's gonna be trouble And whenever there's robes, so there's a like it's like some like cult thing. It's it's not a fucking cult. It's real Right, this shit's real. It's a cult and if you get robes, it's a cult Well, that's there what the Dmitry Ishkov the Russian billionaire through this fucking conference he as part of his thing he wants to bring people from mystical traditions and to try to Figure out a way to mix in to not just let religion get totally You know curbed on the maybe the new religion will have some like robot instead of Christ, you know, yeah, hey, I got an idea. How about a little less robes and a lot more robots motherfuckers? Yeah, I mean so whether you think they'll just mutate us into We'll just be wired completely Well, no, it's it's it's the idea is like what what's happening is So here we are right we were born you're born you don't have any control of your body You're just born into this fucking body and your genetics and your Place of origin and your parents will sort of determine how you're gonna turn out So it's not like when you're just playing a video game You pick your avatar and you make it this or that and the hair color and then it's so what what's happening is what? Technology is doing is it's increasingly it's Accelerating our ability to manipulate matter to manipulate reality and we are matter We're made of matter and so as part of this what it's doing is it's not just allowing us to transform the external world But the idea is to allow it to transform the internal world subjectively Use things called neural prosthetics well that you implant in the hippocampus That makes it so that them because the way memories work is they go into your hippocampus and They then go into this I don't know which part of your brain and then so it's short-term memories hippocampus those process into the Long-term memories so you put a neural prosthetic into your hippocampus now you're recording all your memories So now you have all your memories well permanently recorded which means that? You could theoretically Upon your expiration Reconstruct your past and allow other people to experience Time from your perspective from the moment you got that and Implanance there's one of the things and then if you have enough people have a Neuro prosthetic in their hippocampus and let's say you have a large enough swath of the population like the number of people who have cell phones now have these neural prosthetics then You take all those different memories and you can assemble them into an accurate Depay digital depiction of the past and then that means that you could Create a kind of digital time machine where people could put on some sort of and relive your life Relive other people's lives Wow, so that's where we're plunging towards and Ever accelerating rate and that is why there is a funny heaviness about at least to me I found there to be a funny heaviness that are about the thing because it's like It's that classic hubris that human beings have you know where they're like oh no we've got this we've got this we'll just We'll just bring this thing into existence. We'll do full brain emulation and we'll make it so that a Machine wakes up and comes to consciousness of itself. It'll be fine. Everything else we've done has been fine Why wouldn't this be fine? This will be fine and Just like that fucking ant that explodes with fungus Humanity will explode with a new sentient being that comes blasting out of all of our progress and that is a will be Jesus Finally Well, that's the second come finally it'd be great and No, other people aren't gonna be the other characters. We're all gonna be Jesus. I Don't know man. Are you spear? Are you a spiritual person? Oh? I used to be more but I was just in Malaysia and they have that ant that blows itself up to Put gooey shit all over its enemy. Yeah, and it's interesting that it's Muslim country Right the one ant that can blow himself up is from a Muslim country. He said yeah. Yeah, isn't that weird the fuck So what's in the air over there? That no Malaysia is a lovely lovely place. Yeah, well, I mean the whole yeah, it's oh, yeah It seems like a beautiful place and that is an interesting thing that there's suicidal answer there That's a fascinating thing that people even do that shit, isn't it? Yeah, so will you ask me am I say am I religious or spiritual? Or yeah, I mean I you know, I'm pro Jesus, but I he's more just like a prophet like Muhammad Ali Bob Marley Charles Bukowski Evil Knievel do you feel ashamed or scared to say that does it do you feel like it impinges upon like it? Brings a kind of no, I mean, I you know, I don't picture like a god old man In the sky with a beard. I I I think that the there's an eternal vibration of energy Hmm and that when we're in our human suits were little droplets And then when we die we return to the spiritual ocean that is all one and the the vibration of the planet the energy So so yeah, I don't know. I mean, I maybe I believe in science I mean, you know, I like the the notion of miracles and I like I like hero figures and Jesus was a pimp. Yeah, and another guy. I love his caravaggio. He's one of my prophets He was a painter in Italy. I'm just gonna use p words this entire podcast. Don't worry Caravaggio painted for 40 years before Rembrandt and Rembrandt is heralded for his use of light Caravaggio his light lighting was really dramatic like movie scenes and he depicted the the Bible to be scenes from the Bible to be the Criminal street thug acts that they were like the John the Baptist you know the beheading of John the Baptist and the you know just all this and this guy was a hot-head lunatic and He killed a guy in a duel and he just was constantly just drunk and fighting and You know, but he was He was pro Jesus. So you see yeah, you're you're you see the Old Testament as this kind of like wild gritty Event that happened this sort of I think I mean there you got to admit there entertaining stories, you know King David was fucking everybody right and Whatever no man, that's the thing people don't recognize how psychedelic the New Testament is and because and and this is what I wanted to talk about in the beginning as we were talking about the existence of Satan or the existence of some demonic force and You know one of my one thing that I like to do when I get really stoned is go to the Televangelist channels and to watch the televangelists Manipulate weak people late at night to try to send them money right and the reason I like to watch that I got expensive haircuts and clothes and glittering diamonds. Yeah, yes But that is that to me is truly demonic. Yes So that's why it's fun to watch because when you when you see that then you see like oh Holy shit, this is I mean fuck, you know not fuck Marilyn man I've Marilyn Manson's an interesting performance artist and he's got some good songs But that guy's not in league with the devil. He's too fucking honest, right when you see a man in a suit late at night Rhythmically talking about these powerful stories in a way designed to hypnotize The elderly the infirm the sick all the people that Jesus was telling you to heal They're singing this song this siren song That has within its core a call to all of humanity to go out into the world and give yourself to help and Give yourself to the point of death to help all those around you in the name of love when you see That complete reversal of that thing using the thing itself Yeah, well Mark Twain said if Jesus were alive today the last thing in the world. He would be would be Christian, right? Exactly and exactly and and this is a thing that like the notion of you know, like Hindu if you live this Just the monster characters are so fascinating. Yeah gods. It's like the original comic book Yes, all these you know fascinating creatures and and gods and All the Hindu stories believe in the good versus evil and if you're a good person or persevere and you know Keep a good heart. You will always overcome evil. I mean, it's interesting They believe in an evil and Charles Bukowski on this One reading I forget which one live at Redondo Beach or something He told a poem about evil and he said I believe in evil because the evil can can strike Like eight ball in the side pocket motherfucker you know, so I Mean, you know the duality of Spiritualism, I don't know what the point was. No, the point is that evil is that when you talk about in Hinduism You talk about the monsters that they create. There's more of a An acknowledgement of this, you know force in the universe and how this force in the universe is as much a part of the universe Is anything else, you know, and that's the that's where you start getting the mind fuck of the story of Jesus you know because you have the story of Jesus that the I Remember going to this church. I can't remember what shows a famous church and they have like 13 seats No, 12 seats and one one's blanked out or something because there were 13 Apostles the 13th being Judas or that's where they place him as a 13th apollon They're like that is for the betrayer who will not be named And I was like wow you mean the creator of Christianity the guy who fucking pressed the button on the whole goddamn thing and That's where you get into the real the real like the backstage Christianity or the Gnostic Christianity Which is like guys if you're really gonna look at this logically you got to give Judas as much credit as Jesus Totally, so where was this church where it was just it was tiny. There's a big No, they were no another 30. There was a display some kind of like a spiritual religious depiction But it was like I found it interesting because they're like instead of being like well We should give an a better seat for the betrayer because the betrayer created the story the sacrifice the betrayer created the Judas was the lubricant That allowed Jesus to slide into history, right, right, right, right, right? He wouldn't be sure He wouldn't be a Pontius Pilate Pontius Pilate was like, you know, you know a bit of a victim Pontius Pilate was like Just trying to get the hippie to say sorry. That's pretty much his whole function was like he was an old southern judge Then he just wanted you to capitulate and apologize There's a feeling you get in the New Testament that when Pontius for those of you don't know a surprisingly large number of people will not even read the New Testament because of the Giant shit that modern Christians have dumped onto the whole So people won't even touch it they're like I just don't want anything to do with I don't want to be anything like in the same way like You know where Marin's got a funny joke about Scientology where he's like He's afraid to read any of the books because he knows at some point on somebody's But but uh The yeah, so so a Pontius Pilate for those of you don't know Pontius Pilate was the Roman judge who right there who tried Jesus and Jesus was brought to the Roman judge by the The the Jews the who wanted Tim dead because Jesus was going around saying we don't really need to follow these laws anymore That all you have to do is love God and you're gonna be fine And so the kill him yeah, because if we disrupted all of their religious power It fucked up the priest class the priest class hates that concept in the same way that the oil industry would hate free energy It's the exact same thing it ruins the power structure So he was brought to Pontius Pilate who you get the sense that he felt This effulgence coming off of this guy or could see that it was a righteous person and didn't want to kill him and kept saying to him You know What are you doing? What are you just there? They want to kill you all you have to I think you just needed him to like Apollo it was like a basically an apology or a bow down to the priest class Maybe just you've pissed off the Jews man. You don't want to do that. They'll kill you they had and so anyway he um That's why he what you know He washes his hands and then after he after he's like Sentencing him to death. He tries everything. He like brings Jesus out in front of the mob and says to them We pardon we will pardon one person who do we pardon it was him and Barabbas this murderer and somehow the crowd was like pardon Barabbas Not the fucking hippie Barabbas. Maybe Barabbas was a hoot Barabbas was hilarious. You had a great name for a comic I guess He sounds more like someone who'd run a comedy club That's gonna be my Starbucks name from now. Barabbas. What's a Starbucks name? Somebody I we heard some Indian people telling us who were from some friends of I forget it We were talking to who had they had complicated Indian names So when they go to Starbucks and they asked the name they always like Kim You know Sue they all all these ethnic people with really tricky names have a Starbucks name I'm gonna start using Barabbas I Love the idea of giving complicated Starbucks the other one What's the from Harry Potter the the name that can't be spoken That's that's my Starbucks name Voldemort you can't do Voldemort man You're gonna seem like the biggest nerd on earth You can't that's a good idea because you look the opposite of a nerd man. You're you're as close to Elvis as there is in stand-up comedy. You're such a charismatic dude, man Whenever I get around you always think like this guy could start a fucking religion or a church You just like Radiate charisma, man. I should I you reminded me when you're cuz I you said there's 13 seats and I I didn't picture a big Cathedral I pictured this small thing I When I moved to San Francisco in the early 1990s I lived in the Western Edition right on Alamo Square Park, which at the time now It's you know kind of gentrified and there's you know nice stuff It was always a fabulous area, but it was a little bit of a rough area Yeah, especially on Devisadero the big street and it was there for years Excuse me It was the African Orthodox Church of St. John and it was it was the the John Coltrane Church It was a some religious jazz guy or spiritual jazz guy From the neighborhood Started this church based on The music of John Coltrane and love Supreme and so it was this tiny little storefront with these little pews And there were instruments everywhere like a guitars and you know tambourines and like whatever all kinds of stuff And the whole everyone was incurred and all they did was play jazz every Sunday afternoon And I'm a stoner and just moved to San Francisco, which was my hippie utopia Yeah, you know, I just you know dreamed of moving there from Florida and you know Finding enlightenment and then like three blocks from my house is is the John Coltrane Church and man It wasn't no better Sunday afternoon Then you know did did hit a couple bowls You know and then just go over there and and hang out for a couple of hours And it was really beautiful and the thing where everybody was encouraged to pick up an instrument Is because we're all a part of the music Yeah, and we all make a contribution to the big fabric of the universal song. Isn't that beautiful? That's beautiful And of course they shut that place down It's making people happy and loving you can't have that you can't have this get rid of that nuisance This is yeah, and you sent it like it moved to like Hunter's point or some shit, which is like some You know housing project way outside of the on the outskirts of the city I don't even know if they still exist, but I mean it was such a magical little place in the neighborhood Yeah, that's a seat and anyone could I mean anybody could do that like people could just start doing stuff like that all the time It's not that hard people have houses. There are ways to to do things like that But there's a sense of this invisible wall between the you that is the you now and the you that would be like I'm gonna start a place where people playing music together religiously You know what? I mean like that barrier is such a fascinating bearer the barrier that keeps people from taking the leap Yeah, what is that barrier? Hmm? I don't know. I've never been afflicted with that. You don't have that Moved in New York when I was 20 moved to San Francisco and I was like 22 I moved to Amsterdam You know, yeah, you're you you are not afraid to you don't really even Having an address so to speak. No, I don't live anywhere. No, I get my mail sent somewhere and To help me, you know, keep the you know credit cards paid and things But no, I haven't lived anywhere for like seven years now. I visited my storage unit today I had to we were in my annual trip My I have a storage unit here in Los Angeles and like we were in New Zealand in May and It's it's getting close to winter. It's like autumn there now. It's winter. Ah, and So we needed coats and stuff and now it's summer here. So I had to like dump winter shit and things accumulated How did you avoid being a scared person in this incarnation? Hmm. Well, I guess From wanting to be a comedian. I mean, it's you know, what more fearless act than to go on stage and Like when I started in Florida, you know, I wouldn't say they were drunk, but there was a there were a lot of rowdy One-nighter rooms, you know, yeah No, like a particular tough biker bar and Daytona I used to do an I'm a little nerdy high school kid, you know starting comedy and just that and moving to New York City 20 I mean, I couldn't get many sets, but you know to move to New York City and think your shit is good enough Yes, I think the the the courage to just Start a new life and move somewhere. Yes I've never had a problem with that. My favorite doors lyric of all time is I've never been so broke that I couldn't leave town I'm a change Land See me change Yeah, man, but this is a You know, you have to know understand that this is an affliction for a great many people in the world like so many people are Chained down to this life. They're chained down to some place. There's this my brother army guy tough Republican Right-wing guy to the core and bully used to beat me up all the time his eternal Lifelong brother advice to me has always been suck it up pussy So, you know if you're saying people are down and they're having problem. Hey suck it up pussy That's my brother's John's message to me and the rest of the world suck it up We're starting my religion tonight Duncan. Yes, you're saying it really I think you and I You it's just gonna be it's being born right now, but it is a it that that that I like things like that and it reminds me of the Store is in stories, you know like a lot of like Zen is just this simple simple thing and it really doesn't get in it doesn't want it doesn't doesn't want to do the whole complicated thing at all so that you know, there's stories of like Zen masters just like Smacking there just like just smacking the shit out of their disciples just randomly and that that Somehow that of the effect of getting slapped by like an enlightened person Shakes you free, you know, it shakes. Wow. Yeah, it shakes you free And it like is that would be an awesome church where you just gather once in a while They slept a shit out of you. They did they have these instead of like getting your communion and wafer you walk up to the front Why are you even here? Why aren't you? Why aren't you out there making your life better? Are you improving yourself? For our kid don't fuck at it for what improving yourself for I like that when you alpha human the new Ron Paradise yeah describing well, you know, that is a thing that I think people people you know miss a lot Which is this is one of the paradoxes sometimes you run into somebody Who's like really big on helping people and you'll run into a helper and yet, you know Your instincts you get around helper somebody who's really into service work And then you right away the part of your asshole identification thing is like Angry person shitty person miserable person and it's like they took they they they took a step They skipped a step They just went straight till the go into like serve soup instead of recognizing that they're a person that needs help too and that They needed to work on themselves first and that just going out there and putting soup in people's stomachs isn't isn't gonna like Fix you so fix you as much, you know, and and that's why that's what I mean Well, you got this idea of like conquering that when you conquer fear you really do help Shitloads of people. I mean probably right now. There's some people just from listening to you for five minutes There's someone right now Standing in front of his bed putting clothes in a suitcase. Just kidding People are people are on the go now. Yeah, people are they got the okay from me. They want it's okay. Yes Yes, should I do this if that question is in your head people? Yes. I say it's okay. What about the danger? What about the OD what about the pregnant? No, I know about the kids. Yeah, I mean, I moved to New York when I was 20 It was the worst year of my life and I had seen Jay Leno I He used to be You know dangerous opinionated comedian believe it or not in like the 80s Yeah, and I was a teenager and I didn't have a ticket and I snuck in this back door And I listened through the curtain and then he comes back it turned out to be right where his dressing room was where I snuck in and And I got to talk to him and he I said do you have any advice for me as a comedian and he saw I moved in New York Every comedian should be in New York or LA and so that's what got it in my head I have to move to New York and that was probably the worst year of my life right when I was 20. I wasn't ready Yeah, but okay. Okay unpack start unpacking start unpacking. Okay, but put the suitcase back in the club But isn't that but yeah, yeah, just give up actually give up it might hurt you but that the see that's the thing This is the thing that like make a few test trips somewhere first. Is that it? Yeah, cuz like I moved to San Francisco I had I knew I wanted to move there So I took like two or three trips I invested in myself and I went and stayed out on a friend's couch and checked out the city and hung out and then The same thing many years later when I wanted to get in with London I had a couple friends that live there and I stayed on their couch invested in myself and then I started I got in there and then that led to all these other gigs all over Europe and then all over the world So, you know, don't don't you know, don't just leave in the middle of the night, you know test something out first Yeah, be responsible. You don't have to go rushing off to in the end of the land of destruction but still it still it is like a To me, I just I don't know why I'm so obsessed with this topic, man But I just I just find it so fascinating the the way that there is a glue trap in society that Will that traps scared people and they are the ones who end up running the machine, you know And then then within the machine. There's all these like Free beings these like wildlings like you that are like galloping through the machine Free as a bird storage unit. No since yeah, that's not that's not a through you You don't when you go to see your storage unit. There's not as feeling of like this is bad I'm in a bad place. Oh my god. No, it's great. I like wow. Oh, hey, I got that in Peru. Oh Shit, wow, man. Look at that thing. I bought in New Zealand guy. I love that But you you just look at it. I would run into people when I would when I was um, I Remember going to India When I was in college and running into people like you who were just travelers and and wise interesting people and it was like You always feel like you're around a pharaoh being you're like what the fuck this is a thing that isn't This thing is a wild thing. It's broken free of the thing that If everyone broke free like you What can't we describe as what what would society be like if everybody broke free like well I mean you'd realize how you know how much unbelievable beauty is all over the planet That's there's just so much to see and so many wonderful beaches to you know walk naked on and with no one around in places and just pristine heaven all over the world and and then you know the the beauty of of Like rice paddies and Bali and I mean like the the terrace farming and the terrace farming in Peru and Different beliefs I was telling you about that Religious ceremony for Pacha mama that I saw in Peru and that's the they believed in Mother Earth because Mother Earth fed them So I don't know how they did it like you think Um Aliens helped them build Machu Picchu and the Nazca lines Yes, you know, but the Nazca lines that they those were UFO landing strips But describe them for people who don't know they were not discovered There's this half of Peru is desert you think of the Amazon and Machu Picchu but there's lots of it that is just desert and there's this one flat area of the desert and it wasn't discovered until aircraft was invented in like the 20s Someone was flying over and they saw these massive rock Carvings, and it's actually rocks lined up. This is the way they did it And they're they're carvings one's a you know a condor the other one looks like an astronaut one Yeah, there's like 20 of them There's a monkey and then there's these they think they were UFO landing strips, right? And I flew it over it in a in a little tiny Propeller plane, and it's totally UFO landing strips. Yeah, totally, right? There's this candelabra out on the coast that like perfectly that they that they drew into the side of the mountain and If you line that up to the Nazca lines that would have been like where the ship was coming in like and then like 80 100 miles up the way is is the Nazca line So but anyway the they have this terrace farming all over these mountains in the in Peru and just they were all about You know the Incas were a reciprocal society and they grew food and they shared it with people and so we I was working for this After I had the late-night talk show in Amsterdam the same network. Let me do a travel program. Yes, and it did a highlight on Peru and so We went to Puno on Lake Titicaca and took a boat like five hours out into the water to this island Lake Amantani Island, and you stay with a local family. There's no electricity on the island They said bring fruit these people go apeshit for fruit. Wow. We brought a bag of oranges You should have never this woman is watching this woman eat this orange was just a fucking orgasmic Heaven like it's like like it was like it was just the greatest piece of candy or something It's just this woman that you were hello We get there and I know and she went straight for the oranges ripped a bag open and just fucking wow Peeled it and oh man. She was It was beautiful and then the whole village because we were filming they said they did this Pacha Mama ritual and That's this ritual to Mother Earth that And it wasn't the right time of year for it, but they wanted they didn't want our cameras our film to miss it So the whole village came out and they put it on for us like the next day Which you know we hear about Native Americans not wanting their film or their picture taken Yeah, you heard that back in the old days or whatever sure these people were like now We'll do our most sacred thing for you and You know set up the cameras and so everybody gets in a circle and they got the guys the shamans got you know He's this smoke in the place out With whatever incense and then There's a little fire with like cow shit that's burning and they put all these Cocoa leaves and everybody takes a cocoa leave and everyone you take the bag as it comes around and you you say a prayer and you put your little You know cocoa leaf in it and everybody passes the bag around and then the shaman like holds it up You know and it's got everybody's leaf in it and then he puts it on the burning cow shit and And And burns it and I mean it doesn't it was so unbelievably beautiful yeah, and This I'll never forget the guy the sound man standing there with the pole and the fuzzy microphone And the guys sit his tears run down his face while we're filming it It was just like one of those moments like wow, this is this ancient ritual these people have done for thousands of years These are the direct descendants of the Incas possibly a ritual that was done in the presence of Aliens you're landing on those strips right yeah, man. That's a that that that That experience is how much how much money is that experience worth? How much what was something like that? No price. No price. No price. There's no that that's a that kind of stuff is what you get when you travel and When you when you become nomadic and when you um When you break free of the of them well, that's why I was in I was in Malaysia I just got back from Singapore and Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta and this guy had to take my passport to go get the Malaysia work permit put in it and And as I'm handing it to him like this is my most valuable possession Right, you know Please be careful Yeah, are you now this you're doing comedy in Malaysia? Yeah, there's a great tour there and then the Malaysian comedy scene is really cool It's it's a Muslim country, but it was a former English colony, so they all speak English and You know, it's where the Petronas Twin Towers are okay if you ever seen those very iconic. Yes image And so you got Malay Muslims Indian Hindus and Chinese Christian or Buddhist That's the ethnic populace and that's their comedy scene and there's They ruthlessly make fun of each other's religions and And and and each other's ethnicities and things and I mean there's this whole one one Malaysia. They got this, you know real united Spirit I think should be emulated by the rest of the world But I think they're more free than we are cuz they like openly make fun of each other's beliefs and I Mean, I you know, I'm sure there's some government restriction, but I thought they were pretty free like that. They're doing stand-up comedy Yeah, and you got you got brown dark skin local people as the audience and they're young Well educated Well-heeled hipsters that is see fantastic. This is the thing man This is Singapore you play in half to ex-patriots and then half Singaporeans, which is you know, you know people from all over the world and Also similar to the Malaysian ethnicity. Do you find it weird performing for American audiences after going on? Oh, no, not at all. I love it all, you know, it's a challenge to go I mean, it's different playing in California than it is to you know, Illinois or anywhere and going to different countries at the challenge of You know, what will work, you know, what you know will work What you think is iffy working it out on the fly Right when you get there and then also the the observations that you gain about those places, but but but you the You know any joke that you have that's a local joke from LA or no, you can't do shit like that That's shit shit. That's when you find out what's universally funny and what regional shit you should cut if you want to do the worldwide Circuit and the worldwide circuit. It's amazing. And that's why I don't live anywhere. There's too many fabulous gigs And and it's like always I want to you know, part of me wants to move to New Orleans and other part of me wants to move to San Francisco and you know My wife points out, you know, Los Angeles might be important, but I just keep booking gigs There's too much great shit. There's too many Great adventures to have and then to be paid as a comedian again. It took me so many years to get to this level I'm not gonna relinquish it easy. You know, I'm gonna squeeze just like that woman eating that fucking orange, man I sound that's the way I'm gonna do the fucking life I'm just gonna fucking get the juice on my face. I'm gonna fucking wipe it. I'm gonna lick my fingers I'm trying not to let a single drop be lost Enjoy the sticky face afterwards Yes, god damn it, I want to break a guitar Yeah, actually, you know what we've almost done an hour we can just we can we can all we know You know what actually, you know what let's go smoke a cigarette use my ice-cream smoking But let's go let's go outside and then we'll wrap it up. That's better. So hey, so here's the question I don't think we fully answered it. What would society look like if everyone were like you if everyone was a traveler Everyone was moving freely through the world. I think people would be a lot More chilled out. It'd be a little more relaxed You know, like you think you got traffic problems in your town you go to Jakarta, you know Can kill yourself who runs the factories who runs the who runs the airlines who runs Yeah, I guess, you know, somebody's got a you know, clean the P dribbles off the toilet seat in the hotel. Yes Isn't that now? Yeah, okay, so maybe it's not possible. Welcome to the Judas paradox man. Here we are again It's like this is the big paradox, which is that for society to function You need frightened people for the world as we understand it to work You need people who are terrified to step outside of where they're at or you need people who are and who are satisfied with Being in a in a in one little area not moving around and there are people who are satisfied with that and that's great but for society to function as we know it you need vast quantities of human suffering and that is a confusing paradox To me, which I don't I don't I don't really know What do you think about that? I don't know I mean, I you know, I picture China and I've been there a bunch of times and just the Multitudes of people there's too many people there and there's communism. They all need a job. So you'll have like There's certain how you go like guanjo or sujo And you know, there's like two guys on the elevator, you know, and that's their job. Just to push the button It's just so many people that need jobs and yeah, there's just too many people there Are they happy they're gonna take over the world it's they are, you know, our holy I there was some comedian I don't know who said it in England that you know the Picture the future we're all gonna be living on the moon in a Chinese concentration camp Yeah Yeah, so I mean, you know have your fun while before the whole shithouse goes up in flames is Jim Morrison So you do you think the shithouse is going up in flames? No, I think the earth is just gonna shake us off one day It's just tired of our bullshit, you know, I think it though I think the world probably will out-evolve us the world will out-evolve us in the sense that it will will just like the Environment the environment may collapse or you know what they're saying. They're saying in like 50 years Miami's underwater Right. That's what I'm saying. They're just like shake half of us off for the earthquake and And and and you think that's something that's close. Oh, no, you're not it now I don't know. I guess I don't have an answer for your question there That's maybe that's what I should say. That's great. Yeah, man. That's that's how you could always tell a smart person I'm just searching for an answer. I don't have one way you can always tell a smart person is they will say I don't know and and I like because somebody asked me I remember the other day somebody asked me this question And it was an unanswerable question about I Can't remember what it was man, but you would basically have to be God to answer this question Like and they asked me this question and man like four minutes into my answer as I'm just answering this question You don't know you don't know at all you idiot You're a moron to even like try to like it's good to say you don't know I that's good But but I you know one one thing I wanted to ask you Because you do have the perspective of someone who hasn't been localized in the United States Do you get a read from people if you what's your feeling on this new revelation that the NSA is? recording every email Text Skype Conversation and recently grew in Greenwald the reporters working with Snowden the leaker as they call them whistleblowers the right term for him but Is revealed that there's documents showing that not they're also recording cell phone calls which means Somehow some incredible amount of cell phone calls are also being stored. What do you think about this? Yeah? And there obviously it wasn't just limited to the United States the French government and the German government is looking into Maybe that the United States violated their privacy Issues and things. I think the rest of the world looks at it the way I look at it in that It's shocking that no one really seems that upset about it. Yes. No one really gives a fuck right people think oh my god Well terrorism of course we're at war just yeah, it's it's necessary, but It's it's it's it's unbelievable. It's frightening. I and the They raised bus fares in Peru people fucking rioted in the street They raised the bus fair like 25 cents something like that. These people are so poor don't have anything and they you know That makes such a difference in their their lives 25 cents. They fucking are rioting. Yeah, and they overturned the bus thing What would it take to get Americans fucking in the street and shaking their fist at the man and protesting? I mean like nobody gives a fuck back to you just continue your sleepy little life yeah sleepy little life and and that is a that I think that When you events like this happen you do see the depth of the conditioning here in the United States because If we're not reacting to that in any kind of strong way outside of I mean, I fired off a couple of angry tweets Ha ha ha ha ha ha Why don't you think about that guy Snowden too? I mean for this guy to just go Fuck you We're like he can never come back to the States this guy. Where can he go? He's trying to get to Ecuador He's in a Russian airport. Yeah, you know, yeah, you know what Russian airports are like just fucking vomitus. It's just horrendous and Peru Ecuador is next to Peru. I love Peru I don't know if I'd want to live there and Ecuador is a really tiny little country. Yeah, you know I mean what this did to do that take that risk and reveal this Then for people not to give a fuck. I mean it's It's mystifying it's beyond it's it look man. It's fucking beyond mystifying. It's like this is clearly Some our society is clearly a brainwashed society our news is a state-sponsored news when you see these reporters talking about Snowden and calling him all the accusing all these weird things he wants to be famous is one of the things they said come on Like I was watching this fucking camera his name and usually I like his interviews. It's that British guy is against guns What's his name? Pierce Morgan Pierce Morgan he's interviewing. He's interviewing him and he's like as he's got Dr. Drew on and he's asking Dr. Drew like but isn't that part of him that just do longs for fame and Dr. Drew's like there could be that part, but it's like Glenn Greenwald has been working with this guy. I did this amazing. I'll email it to you. He gave this amazing fucking speech Talking about his experience with working with this guy and he pointed out He could have sold these documents to a variety of different countries, right for Millions and millions and millions of dollars He could have made so much money if he wanted to be a spy He could have made so much money with this shit, but he didn't he's you know He like he told he's told Greenwald that it's he had to do it thought he was doing the right thing He has to do it. I think the biggest issue here is you know Snowden Apparently only had like a GED education and he worked for like a branch something the some branch company that did things for whatever the CIA or the whatever the NSA and That's how he had access to all these All this Sensitive stuff secrets and then Bradley Manning who you know the wiki leaks All those secrets that this guy, you know Got he was a weird little private. Yeah a private soldier. Yes rank and Confused about his sexuality. I think the biggest issue here is the American government. Why do they let these people of Lower whatever Look at the morons that they are letting have access to everything important if it was that important Why didn't you fucking hire somebody sure a little more intelligent and a little more? You know Sleazy, I don't know what I mean I think the biggest issue is is the American government shouldn't like be trying to extradite this guy They should just come out and go well, sorry We're just so fucking inept that we just leave all of our secrets. Yeah for anybody to Bradley Manning all the secrets he got He he had disks and he would label them Lady Gaga and so when like sensitive stuff would come up on the computer He'd slap in the disc and download it That's how he collected all this stuff and you know any soldier walking by his desk would have looked down and saw the You know the lady Gaga fucking discs and you fucking pans idiot Jesus lady God Nobody is gonna question a lady Gaga fucking Disc on a guy's desk. No, but I mean, I think that's it. I mean the the ineptitude of our government the The the my wife and I were having a conversation about the Guantanamo Bay people being tortured Yeah, and I was like I wonder what the top 10 torture songs were and so we Google it, you know on the iPhone We got it, you know the information in in five seconds answer to our question number one was fuck your God by this satanic Hold on hold on hold on deicide You're saying they play this shit. Yeah loudly when they're torturing the people right and then And so that that song makes sense that was the number one song But like the other choices were like Don McLean's American Pie and like Queens we are the champions which that Brian may guitar Listen to that all day. I mean like real our government is so lame. They can't even choose good torture songs And then like we can't even hire the people that would protect our country's fucking secrets imagine this Somehow and some alternate dimension China invades the United States because some crazy commie Not commie a commie hater in the United States Figures out a way to hijack a Chinese airline in flight into one of their buildings some super religious fundamentalist Psychotic freak figures out a way to just do this insane terrorist attack on China And so China's like no no no fuck you we're invading we're coming over we're coming over We're getting our pound of flesh. They attack you after a You know a few months or years of watching your you know you you'd get a call you get a call maybe you know Hey, dude, did you hear about stand-up? What? Yeah, man. He got fucking blown up like a drone hit him. He's dead He got blown up by a fucking Chinese drone. You're like what? What are you fucking talking about and then you like hear about how your aunt got blown up or your friends got and then at some Point you're like you know what fuck this. I'm gonna fight the Chinese who've invaded my country I didn't have anything to do with flying planes in their goddamn building, but I'm gonna try to take out a few They're probably gonna kill me, but it's gonna be worth it because they killed some of my best friends So you go out there and you start fighting. You're just a fucking comic You don't know how to handle a gun you get arrested within two days Throwing on a boat or a ship a cargo plane the next thing you know You're in fucking China. Wow on an island make a plastic things chain to a fucking chair And they're playing Chinese pop songs to you. You don't even know you don't even know though You don't need to speak Chinese. It's just some weird Chinese guy blaring shit music Indie into your ears and you're there indefinitely That's what we've done That's what we've done as a country and it's like I know I love to think of it as inept and I love to think Oh, it's just an inept bumbling demon, but I don't think it's that inept man I think it's getting smarter and smarter and every time information gets leaked and They're sitting there waiting for the streets to fill with rampaging angry Americans who are like you can't monitor us and it's just quiet people are going to work. They're like, oh Great Nobody's gonna care because the Chinese are always gonna give us fireworks Yeah, they're fine. They're fine. We could do anything to these motherfuckers. Yeah, I'm giving them good video games Yeah, I keep putting out those video games those mega fucking hits and anyway It's it's a it's a little spooky and you're gonna you do you think sometimes that you're gonna be in the Philippines or in one It's some country. I'll be in China later this year Do you ever feel like you're gonna you'll be out of the country if shit fell apart here? Probably this that odds are you wouldn't even be here when shit fell apart. I Would hope there was some what there was some famous book that was made into a movie in the 50s. I forget the name of it But like there's a nuclear holocaust and only Australia survives. Yes, and it's It's paradise and you know beautiful beaches and You know, hopefully I would be in Australia when the shit goes down, but you know, New Zealand Um, you're a positive guy. I'm sorry for Tates. I know turning Debbie downer I didn't mean to state drive the fucking thing into a pot. No, I Love your mind Duncan. I man, it's it's always such a good ride when you know, we get together But I but listen, I I want to I've got a I've got to start listening to your podcast, man You do hearing that it's Tom Rhodes radio, baby. Yeah, and I did Kim calm when I was in New Zealand Yes, and you when you told me now, can you just for people who don't know? Can you tell them who Kim calm is because most people know but I'm sure some people Kim calm started mega upload calm You know when you know, I mean right at the beginning of the internet This guy was was was doing Cool started out as a hacker a really interesting story and then you know AT&T hired him these different corporations that he had hacked to so they could figure out, you know, what how he knew to get in through these systems and There was the mega upload calm was there's massive file sharing so lots of movies were exchanged and The way his his site was set up. There was no search links People just shared files, but just millions and millions of dollars were not given to the Hollywood, you know movies to yeah, whatever so The he's on the FBI most wanted list The United States government is trying to extradite him from New Zealand. He's from Germany and Interesting guy, you know, he lived on the top floor of the Hyatt in Hong Kong for like five years Wow He's got a wife and a few kids You went to isn't that came to the mansion mansion, and is it really a mansion unbelievable mansion?
