Update from your life. The person you've played this for is feeling very uncomfortable. They're beginning to wonder if they should trust your instincts when it comes to podcasts. But don't worry, this segment coming up after the break will win them back and you will be vindicated. We're going to jump right back into a classic vindication segment right after this. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Manscape. It did happen to me once that after a particularly long dry spell of no love making, I was finally going on a date and I thought there really might be the possibility that I was going to hook up and so I went to the kitchen and got a pair of old kitchen scissors thinking that would be enough to do some kind of sad haircut job on my pubes but as it turned out I slashed my balls leaving a cut on my balls and a patchy weird pube haircut that seemed like somebody was in a hurry maybe because someone had identified their crotch as being a crotch and a bank robbery and they were going to do a quick crotch haircut. The point is I ended up not going on that date because too many things would have to be explained should my pants come off. Gang, it's been a long pandemic but it's spring and summer and things hopefully are going to get better and so you're not going to get away with saying oh you know it's because of the pandemic that my pubes look like Janice Joplin's hair at Woodstock.

As mentioned before the intro, this is the part of the podcast where you are going to be vindicated and you're going to prove to anyone that you decided to play this for that you have incredible tastes in taste in our podcast. Hop on the prayer train. A great spirit that lies between all that is and does not fill the vehicle that this podcast is being played with your eternal power and flay the soul of all that have stood out to the power of this podcast. So that in their pain they may see that it is truly the submission to the power of the DTFH which brings lasting peace, joy and tranquility. So many of us were once unflayed of soul, upon the flaying of our soul, we gain true nemesis and merge eternally with the grand creator, Amen. That was the prayer train. And now you're vindicated, the friend that you played my podcast for thinks you're cool. We've got a great podcast for you today. This podcast came about in the best way a podcast could come about. I was chastised by a communist on Twitter who felt that I had said something about communism that indicated that I was an idiot. How dare you say I went to the Stalingrad University of communism online. Regardless, after Twitter yelling at me, he suggested some guests that I might want to talk with and pointed out that I hadn't really ever had a discussion about socialism or communism on the podcast. And one of the people he recommended was Jake Flores, a very funny comedian with two awesome podcasts, PodDam America and Why You Mad. You should listen to these podcasts. If you've got some weird, uneasy feeling when you hear the word communist or if you are nervous about the idea of communism itself, he actually might make you feel a million times better. Not only that, he's brilliant. And he really educated me in the best way possible during this conversation about the history of communism. And I misunderstood a lot of it. So you were right, Twitter communist. Now without further ado, everybody please welcome to the DTFH Jake Flores. Welcome to the DTFH. I'm so happy you're here. And it happened in the most beautiful city in the world. And I'm so glad you're here. Thank you. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And it happened in the most magnificent way. It possibly could have happened, which is a disgruntled communist suggested I speak with you because they're upset over what they saw is my opinion on communism. So, and I honestly, I wanted to interview you before that. So it was actually a really perfectly timed, angry tweet. Yeah. Thank you to my little disgruntled Cupid out there in the internet's world. Yeah. I feel very conflicted about this because on the one hand I saw that and I was embarrassed and I was like, no, if you like me, please don't yell at people I like that makes people bad. And on the other hand, I really wanted to do this. So thanks, I guess to that person. I don't know. Well, you know, I've gotten really good at distinguishing like just, you know, troll shit tweets from people who are legitimately like, you know, to get to the point where you're listening to someone's podcast and then to critique them on Twitter and then to recommend people to talk to that to me shows a kind of, it's not, that's not, do I like having anyone irritated at me, especially a communist online? No, not necessarily, but I am legitimately glad that they recommended you and they were legitimately right and not, I don't, and I disagree with their critique, but they were right in the sense that I haven't had any like communists on that I'm aware of or any that where that has been the top of conversation. And so yeah, I want to fill in that void. And also I would love to brush up on communism a little bit because it's been a long time since I studied it or looked into it and I don't really understand it. And so welcome. Thank you. Well, yeah, I mean, we're after that. You know, it's, it makes perfect sense that, you know, there's been like sort of a resurgence in interest in this sort of thought in the last few years. And it's, you know, partially because it's such a taboo subject, the internet has helped quite a bit. And so it makes sense that, you know, that this sort of stuff is naturally slowly creeping into the ecosystem that we work in as like comedians and stuff like that. No one's like, Hey, Duncan, why didn't you, why don't you know all of, you know, Mao or what? Like, it wouldn't make any sense. Yeah. You know, why would you, you know, and, you know, so, so totally normal that this is happening, I think. And the other thing I want to say right off the bat, talking about this is I think there's a tremendous amount of pressure probably on me to represent what I'm talking about correctly. I will not be able to do that. I am not the best person to be talking about this to you. However, I think I might be the best standup comedian. So that's where I'm coming from. Cool. And I know that we share that in common as an experience, you and I being comics. Yes. So I'm going to give it my best, but, you know, I am, I am like you, Duncan. I'm a student. I'm a little traveling wizard going through space. Yeah. Learning things. Yeah. I get that about you. That's one of the things I like about you. And, but, you know, the thing with just even talk, like even talk, saying the word communism for me is especially intense because, you know, I grew up with a, my dad, like, volunteer to go to Vietnam and went back another time. He, he, you know what I mean? And so for him, just the word itself was like pretty like, I don't know that I mentioning it would be bad around him. And then also I think anyone who came up in the United States has a healthy amount of conditioning related to the word itself. And cause, cause it's one of those, um, you set off this alarm system when you stayed around people and they all weirdly do that, like invasion of the body snatchers thing where they were gurgitate the identical sentence, which is communism doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah. You know, and that's, that's weird to me because a lot of the people who say communism doesn't work. Even if you, if you, if you ask them to give examples, they might be able to have some muddy a historic, like it just gets people killed, but they don't, they haven't gone much deeper into it. Uh, and so, but I, I also feel a little fear and trembling related to the subject matter just from a lifetime of conditioning. Yeah. I know. I mean, it's, it's scary because we're living with like a hangover from the cold war and all of, you know, you have history kind of for the last 100 years or so. And like it's, uh, of course it's, it's just extremely taboo and you're indoctrinated to a ridiculous degree to consider this thing, you know, like akin to fascism or something like that, which is really weird because fascism is like kind of more hypercapitalistic, but nobody understands this. Yeah. Right. And I don't know. The other thing is like, if you can think about this and it kind of flattens out after a while, if you really do the, like the debunking, but it takes a little while. So for example, when people say like communism doesn't work, yeah, sure. You know what? I mean, there really hasn't been an example of it really working, but that is a meaningless statement because capitalism also doesn't work. What does working mean? You know what I mean? Right. What is the end goal of a society? Well, so far we have not reached any sort of like state of utopia in any state on planet earth, you know, and with capitalism, you know, you can, I mean, people always say like, oh, look at all the bodies that communism, you know, stacked and with Mao and with Stalin and it's like, sure, but like how many people have cat capitalism killed? Same amount at least, you know, with slavery and war and all this stuff, you know, right? So, you know, it's a mood argument. No one is arguing that I'm not going to sit here and tell you, I figured out how to organize all of human society. No, I'm just going. No, of course not. But I, you know, I would say, you know, you don't have to be some kind of communist or even a socialist necessarily to like just have some basic common sense in relation to you know, it's the old, it's like, if you and me are on an island and I have taken all the bananas, you know, and you're, you're hungry and I'm like, no, I'm not giving you the banana or I'm like going to make you do triple or quadruple the amount of work that I did to get the bananas to get a banana. Yeah. You're going to just, as a friend, be like, this is fucked up, man. Like this is some things, this doesn't make sense the way we're doing this banana share thing. Like it, but it, and then, and then when you take it to like, you know, my mother-in-law, I have, if she, it would be really fucked up if all of a sudden she started charging us for like taking, for being with my kids, you know what I mean? That'd be weird. Like if a grandmother started charging her parents started charge, that would be fucking weird, but then like it goes on and on and on various examples, kind of showing how bizarre this weird exploitation is that we call that comes up in capitalism. Like, I think, you know, anyone could say that's fucked up, right? But, but with the moment you, you start saying it's fucked up, people get on your ass right away. Like you're not supposed to say these obvious things. You know, I mean, look what happened, they were in that COVID bill, just trying to get the minimum wage raised a tiny amount. You know, that was impossible. Yeah, it's, I mean, we're living in the worst country for that, you know, deeply steeped kind of ideology. I'm going to go back to what you said, the banana thing, right? So that's like a, it's a fun metaphor to work with, right? But like, let's be honest, you and I were living on an island and there were a bunch of bananas, we're two pretty chill guys. We would probably just share the bananas, right? Yeah. But this thing that you were describing where you hoarded them and manipulated me with, you know, you having all the bananas. See, that could happen. You would just need, you know, certain like infrastructure in place to have that involving the growth of the bananas. And then, you know, you have, right, armed guards and or other people to control them or whatever. This is basically how class society came about. If you read about, you know, pre feudalism and stuff like that, there's a very strong historical case to be made that like, when people were like communal and hunter-gatherers and stuff like that, we lived in a much sort of more classless society. And so this all leads into the basics of like materialism, which is the nuts and bolts of how you get to a conclusion like communism, which is that, you know, the abstract state apparatus that we built on top of ourselves to organize stuff like food distribution is what kind of led us into these like we're class society things. But before I even get to that, so I want to start off with the very basics because I really like the reason I wanted to do this is because I'm a big fan of yours and I love them in like hospital and stuff. And when I watch your stuff and when I listen to your stuff, I'm like, I bet, I bet that people that are into this sort of stuff could easily understand materialism, the philosophy of communism, because it is as exactly as it's very interesting and it's very like your brain sparkly and stuff. When you think about it, it's just in a different mode. And so like at the very core of this is I guess when I think about like the stuff you talk about on the show, a lot of it is what's referred to as ideological or not ideological idealistic, right? It's very like airy and it's has to do with abstract things. And, you know, closing your eyes and creating the world in your head as you, you know, use your brain or whatever. So at the core of materialism is this conflict between materialism and idealism. Right. So a long time ago, there were two groups of philosophers. Idealists sort of argued, I create the world in my head. My eye is the lens that I project the world through. Yeah. If I die, it goes away, right? Right. Materialists, on the other hand, said, actually, the world creates me. It the world, everything, all the circumstances that I live in and all the physical dirt and muck and bricks and things like that create like they carve me out like via a negative space, right? It's almost like looking at one of those black and white pictures and going, is it a vase or is it the two guys heads, you know? Yeah. And so it's interesting because that's that is inherently an unanswerable question, right? Like when I die, does the world go away or does it stay and I go away? Like, I don't know, you know, right? No one knows, but what's important about this is that both of these things are like key components in understanding the greater like everything. And most people walk through life really only grasping to one or the other. Like even communists that I hang out with stuff, a lot of them are very vulgar materialists and they're like only materialism. And I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, you got to listen to Duncan Trussell. And then I'm like hanging out with people and they're like, no, no, no, no, no materialism. I'm like, or yeah. And you know, the other way around or whatever. And and it's crazy because even Marxism is all about how the two things inform each other, right? Right. So I really can. How does materialism look like? What is the the life of a materialist look like versus the life of an idealist? Well, I mean, so I guess one way to understand this is that at a certain point in human history, a lot of people that were promoting idealist ideas, like we're sort of arguing that the advances that occurred in society were because of great men who had great ideas. And those ideas, when you come up with like the theory of relativity or something, that goes into the human zeitgeist and it's out in the cloud and all of a sudden advances all of us and it's better for us, right? And that's like a fun idea and there's some truth to it. But it's also very advantageous for rich white men throughout history that have been the people that sell these things who go, you know, yeah, it's it's all because of this one guy, you know. So there's no reason for everyone to have resources because we need to give the resources to to me. I mean, all the stuff, you know. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, where I see, I see. It's like, OK, yeah, yeah, OK, it's the way you might write. OK, right. OK, I get it. So it's like, that's so cool. So it's tricky, right? You're trying to get wrap your head around. Why the fuck does that guy have own? Why does that dude own skyscrapers? And I work at a McDonald's. Yeah. And so then you're thinking, well, the reason that is is because there's something more like something special. About that guy versus all of us. That's what he's doing. That's what he's telling you, like, no, you but you also you need to work it out in your own fucking head or you're going to go nuts. Right. It's like, if you just start thinking, like, oh, really, the way what's happening, what you're looking at here is just like a thing that's been going on forever, which is that people establish themselves with all this wild power. They get guarded by some kind of private army and then they figure out ways to make you feel OK, making their hamburgers. But, you know, right? That's that's the idea. And the way they do that, the way they make you feel OK, making their fucking hamburgers is by number one, making you think there's some kind of special wizard and number two, making you think, you know, you keep making these great hamburgers and you're going to get a fucking skyscraper. Yeah. That is not what you're talking about. Exactly. Yeah. OK. That's totally it. And so so, yeah, idealists sort of sells you it like that. And the materialism is this, you know, thing that comes along where people start to realize, like, wait a minute, you know, this actually doesn't compute. And this person is lying about saying like they earned their way to the top of that skyscraper. They just inherited, you know, wealth. This is all trackable. Capitalism really has only existed as a phase of history for a few hundred years. And then the people that became powerful from capitalism, a lot of inherited it from feudalism, the phase before us, you know. And so you look at this and you start to realize, like, you know, what was a big materialist like breakthrough for me when I was a young comic is I would watch TV shows even before I did comedy, just as a young person. I would watch TV shows and movies and stuff like that. And I would think, why did they never show like the eight, the full eight hour work day in these shows? You know, like when you watch a TV show about someone, they're barely ever at work or if they're at work, it's for a little bit. Or if they are a TV show about being at work, they're having fun all the time. And what you've ever seen reflected is what my life actually felt like as like a 21 year old kid working in a hobby lobby. It was just like staring at a fucking wall all day and hating it. And I think most people will tell you, well, that's because that's bad storytelling. But I'm also like, I think that actually, no, it would be a good story to tell what it's like to like work in the muck all day. It's just that the story is inherently going to be antagonistic against your boss. And that doesn't really sell in in art, right? And so, right, you know, what you do instead is you paint like your ideal life. And I started to notice this because when I started doing stand up, I noticed that if you talked about working and stuff like that, people would really they would speak to people because everyone kind of has this common experience where you just fucking work all day and it sucks. But you would be encouraged, though, to to tell a different story, like tell a story about, you know, yourself in the future, where you're like having all these crazy adventures and stuff, because that's what happens on TV shows. So I'd find myself being feeling a little bit of pressure to change my act away from what was actually happening in front of my face. Just telling stories about this imagined me in the future. And I was like, oh, my God, this is this is like what Mark says fucking talking about. Like, you know, and Mark's talks about that kind of. I mean, on an abstract level, you know, actually a better comparison is John Steinbeck said that all Americans are temporarily embarrassed millionaires. So we have this mindset of like not living in the moment where we're actually down here in the shit. And that's so brilliant. Isn't it crazy? You know, I was just writing this and bear it like I remember when I was in L.A. And I it was like the first Hollywood party I got invited to. And I'm fucking, you know, I'm like dead broke, man. We all were, you know, we're comics are when you start off broke, you might in bro. You know, like, I remember like Ari had come over to my apartment with this comedian, Stephanie has to get hated. And the first thing they did was open my refrigerator and I had a package of cheese. And Ari goes, you have cheese. And they both just started eating it because they're hungry, you know, but I remember like going to this guy got invited to this party and it was in this fucking hideous mansion, all this hideous art on the wall. And I thought. New rich like what the fuck was that? You know what I mean? Like what what the fuck is like? I'm a Rockefeller or something. You know what I mean? But my mind has to fit in perfectly what you're saying. Yeah, like my mind was acting like I like how what experience did I have with any? I'm like I was I was at the time like old poor. You know, but yeah, I know what you're saying. So it's like we've all been tricked into imagining this right around the corner situation. Yeah. Much thanks to better help.

Most of us will live and die without that ever happening. It doesn't actually happen for every human in society, right? I think it's kind of interesting about this. It's weird. It's right in front of you, but you never think about it. A question I like to ask people is, let's talk about reincarnation. If we believe in the concept of reincarnation, just hypothetically, who do you think you were in another life a thousand years ago? Right. Who do you think, for example? Me? I don't. Man. Yeah. The whole reincarnation thing. I can't answer it, not because I don't believe in it, but just because it's like, anytime I've run into people who are really into reincarnation and they tell you who they were, it's always pretty fucking fancy. Yeah. It's always like a Merlin or a king or one of the main characters in the- Joan of Arc. Well, statistically, you were a serf that was covered in cow shit and lived and died in cow shit and hay, right? You were a dead baby. Yeah. You lived for like six breaths. Yeah. You see this often also reflected in like art and writing and stuff like that. Like somebody, man, I interviewed Kim Stanley Robinson a while back and I heard him say something that blew my mind, which he said, the novel is a bourgeois form of art, right? It's always about like a small group of people who it's never about like millions of people, right? Which is why he writes these big sci-fi novels that are about entire worlds and stuff. Yeah. I think about this because like, take like Game of Thrones, for example, you watch that show. Fuck yeah. It was great, right? But what's funny about that show is that like, it's really about the hundred or so ruling class people at the tops of these societies. Yes. And like that is not how history works. Like history was not shaped by like, you know, one king and his prince brother or whatever. It's these big, bubbling, roiling, boiling like mobs of people at the bottom, right? Right. Interesting. So another way, I think about this is like, I'll get into that. So you know, you mentioned earlier, though, that not everyone can have everything. Not everyone can have like, just based on like common sense. Yeah. Not everyone can have the same amount of stuff because there's a limited amount of stuff. But from your, from what you know about, what's that? Not exactly. It's not that there's a limited amount of stuff. See actually, okay, that's a good. So wait, that my question is, do you can, is in this philosophy, can, is there a possibility where everyone can have like access to the resources that we attribute to wealthy people? Like being the sole domain of the wealthy. Yeah. I mean, that's called communism. And then utopian goal because what's fucked up about what we're living in right now is that this is another early thought I had when I realized like something's kind of off with all this stuff that I'm thinking capitalism is telling me is like, you know, whenever you watch like the Democrats and stuff and like their messaging is all like, we're going to lift up people and like marginalized people are going to, you know, have college programs and everyone's going to excel in society, excelling and becoming wealthy. These are relative terms. You can't be wealthy unless someone's poor, right? So the idea that everyone is on a trajectory upward and we're all going to get sucked up into the fucking upper class doesn't make any sense because if it won't be an upper class, if there wasn't a lower class and it only like really functions as an upper class because it's smaller than the larger class. So like capitalism, one way I like to think about it is that it's like a computer program that every time you open your little DOS window and you enter it and you play it out, it always turns into a pyramid every time. And we sort of entertain delusions that it will not turn into a pyramid. So like something's been happening recently, like people have been arguing about Amazon, right? And a lot of people who don't really think about this stuff will tell you, oh, we should boycott Amazon, right? And it's like, yeah, that makes sense. Boycotting is good and they're a bad company, right? But the thing is, A, that probably won't work because they want everything and B, if you boycotted Amazon and they, Jeff Bezos got sad and he went away, he went off. Fine. You don't like me anyway. He quit his job. Yeah. Because of the way the capitalism is shaped and the market is shaped, something would come along to take its place and it wouldn't be like a more ethical Amazon because unethical nature of it is how it became Amazon, like it's still going to be shaped like a pyramid no matter what, right? So the problem here is like the shape of the thing itself, right? Yeah. And so do you ever, but with that, like really dark moments, some, and like when I'm like thinking about the world, you know, I'm just like looking at my, just this morning, looking out and a fucking crow comes flying out of a tree, it's getting attacked by a mockingbird or something. And then, you know, the crow comes hobbling down the street a little bit later, one of its feathers is all fucked up. And you know what I mean? Like you look at the world, like all the other ecosystems and it's like, it's a nightmare. It's walking dead. You know, like the reason rabbits are so freaked out and everything's so freaked out is because they get killed all day long by cats and predators. And so you look at the world, I'm saying this isn't, I don't know, this feels materialistic, non-idealistic moments. I look out at the world and I think, holy fuck, it's just on every single level, including ours, it's killer be killed. You know, it's, it's, it's thing devouring other thing for its energy, mostly outside of like, you know, things that have photosynthesis. Oh, that's such a good question. Um, okay, check this out, right? So Darwin wrote about evolution. And when he wrote about it, right, that's what he focused on for a long time was like all this, like, compared competition between animals, they have to kill each other to survive and to, you know, the strongest person survives and stuff like, like, right. And after he wrote that, a lot of political economists and philosophers really latched on to that part of his writing specifically. And they were like, this is why it seems that the free market is natural. Like we are just in constant competition with each other, right? But the thing is, the rest of Darwin's life after that, he's like one of those people, he's like one of his albums blew up and then the rest of it's way better, but no one pays attention to the rest of his stuff. Like his, the rest of his later on in life, he negated that and he really like tried to hammer home that, no, I went and, you know, studied all these other animals and like there's a lot of them cooperate with each other. And so, uh, someone who wrote about this was Peter Kropotkin is one of the fathers of anarchism, um, or a big, actually, and, and anarcho-communism, I guess is kind of what came out of him. I don't know, tweet angry shit at me if you're listening to this. Um, and I got that wrong. Don't tweet angry shit at me. We're comics. Don't tweet angry shit at me. Leave us alone. We're just trying to figure this out. So Kropotkin wrote this great book called Mutual Aid. And what he does in Mutual Aid is he sort of, um, looks at what Darwin wrote. And then he goes, actually, I'm going to make a counter argument. Here is like basically a million examples from the animal kingdom where we, you see animals only surviving because they're like ducks that fly together in the shape of a V and stuff like that and like hold together for warmth. And so this argument that it's inherently like genetic in us, that we compete with each other, I think is actually, it's not entirely untrue, but it's way overblown because it's very advantageous to the people that wanted to sell you capitalism because that story for them was like, look, this is the way it is. Right. And that's what do you want me to do? Go rewrite God. Come on. This is the way it is. We eat each other. Now get back to work. Yeah. But it's crazy though, because when you actually went to like communal hunter gatherer societies, like, like the societies that Europe was colonizing throughout all of the last few centuries or whatever, they were all fucking hanging out and just smoking weed and sharing food and stuff like that. Like a good example of that is the Mexican Revolutionary Emiliano Zapata. You know, I mean, he was basically from like a like a communal hunter gatherer society that had not had all this stuff imposed up on it. And then the reason he put on the bandoliers and the guns and stuff, because he's like trying to fight away this fucking government. It's like being imposed upon him. I bring him up also because I need to name drop my great, great, great grandfather was a Mexican anarchist who worked with a guy named Ricardo Flores McGone in the Mexican Revolution. I didn't know that before I got into all this shit. And then I found it out afterwards. Wow. Crazy. What are your thoughts on anarchism versus communism? Well, I don't think the two things are in competition with each other. I think that ultimately, I think that communism is the goal and I think that anarchism is like it's very practical and intuitive. And I mean, they're just very similar. It's just that anarchism, some people go off the deep end with anarchism, where they're like, we can't have, you know, a DMV or whatever. It's like, you know, no, we're right. Zero regulation. What's really what's interesting about the two things is that they're not actually in conflict with each other. The goal of communism is to basically flip over society and put the people in charge of the state and then slowly dissolve the state and then end in communism, which is kind of a everything's been melted down and we're just kind of hanging out and, you know, we don't have a military anymore and stuff like that, which looks a lot like what anarchists sort of argue for. But I think the method, the method of how we're getting there is kind of what's up for debate between the two groups. Right. I don't know. Because communism, the method is via this revolution and also the imposition of the state to figure out a way to redistribute all this stuff and then like it's like a cast on a broken bone. We're going to keep the cast on until we heal and become humans again. And then we'll take the cast off. And within that, wouldn't you say is a lot of idealism in the sense that you're dreaming that at some point people who have power and theoretically power that's been going on for a while, because this shit isn't going to happen all at once, are going to suddenly be like, we did it. We're it's a communist planet now. Yeah. And then and then let go of all the stuff that seems to be part of it, which is like, look, if we are going to do a revolution, fuck, we're not going to. What are we going to do against the state military and state police forces? We need weapons too. And you know what I mean? So we're going to be that we're going to be militarized. And you know what I mean? So that to me is the part where it's like, if only there was like something that we'd experienced in our contact with humanity as a whole over. Recorded history that gave us the impression that at some point people who have power like, here you go, it's yours now. That's a really good question. And you're right. So actually, one thing I want to tell you is that Lenin made the exact same metaphor. Instead of cast, he called it scaffolding. He was like, you know, he puts on the outside of a building and then the scaffolding falls away once the building is kind of thinking through the same way. Right. And like, you're right. So when people talk about like utopian communism, like you'll see these jokes every now and then I got about like, was called like intergalactic space, fully automated, luxury, gay space communism is like a meme that was going around. Cool. It was just really cool. I think you would enjoy this guy specifically. That all was based off of this South American Trotsky who went completely crazy. His name was Jay Posadas and he like went off alone by himself and then came back out and he had started a cult where he was like, OK, here's how communism is going to happen. We have to embrace nuclear war and then the dolphins talk to us and then the aliens show up and he was the three pillars of his philosophy were dolphins, nuclear war and aliens. It was crazy. Lost me and aliens for some reason. I like the dolphins and nuclear war. I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's like when you have to when you're drunk and you have to throw up or you're trying not to, but you know, you'll feel better. Yeah. So Posadas is crazy, right? Because he was imagining his thing was like aliens want to bring socialism to the planet, but we're like, they're waiting for us to stop like with a war and stuff, completely black and do nonsense. That's not how this works. Marxism, really. So the way Marxism works is taking looking at all of the patterns of human history that have led up to now and then really using that only to project like the slightest amount in the future. You can only produce it's like this thing where you can psychically think like a minute in advance or something like that. That's it. But then he's like, but the trajectory you get off of understanding the minute is where we sort of move next. And so every time we do another step and then hopefully it ends up here, but you're right, it is inherently theoretical, you know? And so the way that that works, the way that that's scientific method sort of works is like this. I'm going to have to do a really cliche thing like in movies where they start with the Big Bang and then, you know, please. So Big Bang happens and then planet Earth and then there's like water and there's an organism in it and he grows legs and yada, yada, yada. Next thing, you know, evolution into hunter-gatherer society where everyone's communal and then what happened after that, right? So clans formed and then villages formed and then contrary to what everyone thinks like that part of history, Kropakin says like, oh, they were just chilling. Like all that barbarian stuff is kind of made up or they're fighting, whatever. So after villages, then someone figures out agriculture, right? And when you figure out agriculture, when suddenly you're not hanging out with your friends, growing the food, it's one person's job to grow it. Then you have this situation where one person is in control of all the resources and they have to make up reasons why you should be nice to them and they shouldn't have to contribute as much or whatever. And yeah, you got like kings and religious. That's the king. Yeah. Or like, I love thinking about the first king. I love that moment where someone's like, I'm a king. I'm I come from God. You don't. Yeah. I'm a direct. That's the foot that's in the foot. To me, that moment where people who are probably kind of friends with the first was like, yeah, yeah, I guess you're. Yeah, I'm like, well, also he had like a knife point at your head. So you're like, OK, I guess you're the king. Like I. Yeah, that is more like it. Yeah, he's like, yeah, you're the king. I went. That's right. Yeah. I went to the ruins in Tulum, in Mexico one time. And this is fucking one of my favorite things that's ever happened in my life. We're with a bunch of tourists and there's this guy who's indigenous and he's very serious looking and everyone's like trying to be very like what the word is, like respectful around him or whatever. And he's the tour guide and he's going to show us this big room full of our carvings and stuff on the wall. And everyone's like, oh, wow, it's like his sacred culture or whatever. And then he just starts talking. He's like, yeah, so OK, so basically what happened is, you know, somebody figured out how to grow all the food. And then when they had all the food around, they had to fucking tell everyone, like, you know, back off. So that's how they came up with Ketzacotl, the sky, you know, lizard thing that flies around and makes lightning is because if you if we caught you stealing, I'm going to tell you, oh, Ketzacotl is going to come kill you or whatever. And then he was explaining it very flatly and very like funny. And then he was just like, but he explains something I thought was really interesting. He's like the first generation of people that came up with these myths did not believe them, but then they would pass them down to their kids and then those kids would pass them down to their kids. And eventually somebody would forget that it was made up. And then, yeah, now it's real. Yeah, now there are gods and fucking, you know, afterlife and all this sort of stuff that's a retribution for if you break the little law about the, you know, the corn over here or whatever. Right. So that's the birth of class society, right? Basically, once we have this division of labor in the little village that we lived in where somebody works for the other person in the audience, it just grows from there, right? And so we've fast forward a little bit through feudalism to like the French Revolution. So in the French Revolution, you know, you had all these like farmers and stuff, but you also had this emerging class of like people who owned stuff and were like professionals and lawyers and stuff like that. And then you still had a king and the king wasn't really doing anything. And the fucking like bourgeois I just described, eventually they decided we need to overthrow the king because like, why aren't we running society? We're smarter than him. Yeah, that happens. And and then eventually communism sort of goes and hypothesizes. Eventually the peasants will do that to the bourgeois and that's communism, right? But the important thing is so this is all working on what's called a dialectical framework, which is something that Hegel theorized, where he basically was just working out how like two ideas, you know, come in conflict with each other. They can't stay in the same space for long enough. It's untenable, boom, they explode, a third synthesis happens, right? So Marx applied this to history and he pointed out that like, oh, you know what happened in the French Revolution is that when the bourgeois and the king were existing alongside each other, but like their interests were not be met and the bourgeois felt like they were getting ripped off and that they had a chance to overthrow this thing for their own betterment. That's what's called a contradiction. And that's what's really important about all of this. So the cycle of history moves through these things called social contradictions, where like, eventually everyone in a class realizes that they're getting fucked over and that they also outnumber the people that are fucking them over and you start to go, hey, wait a minute, if we formed a union at the job here, we could get whatever, right? And so Marx didn't invent socialism or communism. He just noticed that this was happening around him, right? The factories and stuff. And he was like, oh, I bet it's going to happen again. And then it did. And so there's like, you know, you look at that and you go, OK, I'm not saying all this is true, but the framework, at least the argument is that we are existing in this constant cycle of things bubbling up and pressurizing into moments of great social contradiction, which then can only be resolved if there's like a snap and a break and like a reforming of that system. And that's the reason I bring this up. And the reason I think it's relevant to what's happening right now is like all of this shit that happened last year with like the pandemic and then people fucking freaking out and leaving their houses and going rioting in the streets even harder than we've ever had before with like the George Floyd protests and stuff like that, people were like, what's going on? Like, how do I explain this, you know? And I think what a lot of Americans will tell you is an idealistic argument. They'll go like, you know, there's like it's because people don't hit their kids enough, it's because cancel culture, it's because of, I don't know, racism even. Like that argument is kind of idealistic. And like the reality is once you understand this little lens that Marx gives you that you can pull out and put in front of your eyeball and look at stuff, you're like, oh, my God, it's because of contradictions. And like every time you're, I mean, I don't know about you. Like I could just feel it like last summer. I was like, oh, my it feels like it's come out of my fucking body. Like something's happening, you know, something communal is like really happening. Yeah. And like even people that have not thought all this out and don't have the language for all this, I think you can feel when there's contradictions happening, because we do kind of have like a bug mind where we're all part of the same species and we do want to be like part of each other and communal and stuff. Yes. But it was so contradictory that we were being told to stay inside and that also we were being told to trust the police, but the police were killing people. And we're like, this doesn't fuck, this is a contradiction, right? And so like, right, this is the beauty of like this, this process of Marxism dialectical historical materialism is like at any given time, I'm not saying it's true. I'm just saying, take that little thing out of your pocket, put it in front of your eyeballs and look at what's happening ago. Does apply here? I think it does. Because you're saying like one, I didn't. That's a really cool thing. Regardless, like everyone's like fucking Karl Marx, that motherfucker with his communism, he like he invented it. You're saying, no, you just identified like in the same way. Like, I don't know, people study plate tectonics. Like they figured out what, how earthquakes happen. And so he identified this kind of seismic movement in society that results in these fucking earthquakes, except those are called revolutions. And right. And so what one thing to sort of back up what you just said regarding the crazy fucking summer. And even before that was this show is happening all over the planet. There were these wild, seemingly disconnected, massive protests that were happening in France. They're happening in Hong Kong. They started happening in the United States. They're happening everywhere. And it was a weird coincidence. I mean, I, not knowing what you just told me, I remember just trying to figure out like, why the fuck would this be happening all over the place? Like, what is this protest weather or something like that? And what you're saying is, no, that that's maybe a foreshock for what's coming, which fits in with what Marx identified as some kind of natural tendency in society. Exactly. All of those things happened because of social contradictions that were in place in those, you know, in Hong Kong and in what they were happening in like Brazil and stuff too, in Venezuela and places like that. And, you know, I remember somebody sent me, they were like, you've got to watch this documentary or blow your mind. And the documentary was about like someone basically arguing that just Facebook had caused all of these things. And I was just like, you know, this is a fun idea, but I don't think it makes as much sense as this like scientific Marxist explanation of like this stuff would be, the pressure was there anyway. It sounds like the technology that we have to communicate with each other just catalyzes that already inherent pressure. And I know that that pressure is real because I'm broke ass and I work for a living and like, I, you know, I feel like, you know, this all makes sense to me as a worker, you know, and I remember stuff very innately before I ever studied any of this stuff and just being kind of beaten down though by the American culture thing where it's like, well, yeah, but this is the way it is. Like you will never escape from this, you know. Do you think part of the reason people didn't like Trump was not just for the obvious reasons, but because here you have a fucking very wealthy privileged person displaying their like privileged to a very hungry world. And that that was going to accelerate this possibility that Marx identified. Like anytime you see anyone like, you know, he looks like he was in the Pink Floyds, the wall is the weirdest fucking thing. He looks like that drawing of the little like prancing fucking fat fuck. You know what I mean? Like in the judge or whatever. But I'm not bashing. I'm just saying like when you start seeing. Do you, is there something in common to communists talk about like the reason we have these walled communities is not just because of safety, but because if enough people see how people are living, then they're going to get angry enough that it accelerates us towards a revolution. Yeah, I kind of, well, let's talk about Trump first. So, you know, what's really interesting about Trump is that when I look at him, I see what you just described. Like I'm like, this is fucking disgusting. This display of wealth, right? But I think Americans, because they have that temporarily embarrassed millionaires problem, like his fan base should have been angry that he was richer than them, right? But they weren't, they were like, no, that's my God, I'm friends with him. I'm about to get as rich as him, right? And so this really echoes what kind of happened in Nazi Germany, like right before all that shit really blew up, which is that there's this myth, right? After Trump got elected, like liberals were kind of like the media was kind of like, oh, he got elected by all these like angry, poor coal miners and stuff and like broke like white trash people. And like, sure, some of those people are in his base, but most of his base is very middle class. They're like people who are like small business owners and own hot tubs and stuff like that. And case in point, you know, when those people with QAnon people stormed the capital in January, I was watching the news that day and they interviewed some of them and they would be like, I'm a small business owner. Yada, yada, yada, like it was like, wait, you're not the worker. You're, you're what's called the petty bourgeois, right? You are a small business owner who thinks they, like they identify more with the class above them than the class below them. Small business owners are very like, oh, I'm better than my workers in this country. And so the reason that they were so pissed off is because they were living and what they felt like was a contradiction, which is that I'm supposed to be accelerating and getting rich as fuck right now. And my like fucking pool company, like isn't blowing up. And so it must be because of the Trump comes along and he goes, that's right. It's because of Mexicans, right? And it's like, no, it's not because I'm right. It's because of capitalism. But when you have the anxiety there and the feeling of the contradiction, but someone comes along and gives you a scapegoat, like a fucking immigrant instead of the answer being capitalism, that fascism, because that whole project was like, well, we're going to fix this by scapegoating this fucking problem and exterminating. Right. I got you, man. Oh yeah. Okay. So this is a Camus myth of Sisyphus that I'm revisiting. It's talks about this in a very different way. Maybe it's my misinterpretation, but it talks about. So Camus says you realize that at some point, you're going to have to realize that you don't fit into the world, that something's fucked up here. And there's a not fucked up, but as a human being, you're all you can't fit into the background. You've got to be as something. And in that act of being as something, you're forced into this weird confrontation with your own mortality, your own meaninglessness. And also the description he gives is really fucking trippy. Just like the it's the moment where everything just seems kind of alien and horrifying to you and you don't even know why you just don't fit it. What the fuck? So he calls this like absurdity. It's the moment of just realizing like, what the fuck? I don't like when you're outside and you're looking at like smelling gas and cars and there's lights. And for a second, you don't remember what any of it is. And you're just like, I'm looking at like a love, crafty and hell city here. So this is the encounter with the absurd. And so his Camus premise of the whole book is like, why wouldn't you kill yourself if you really realize that? Why wouldn't you just commit suicide? And so the book is about why you wouldn't commit suicide. But to get there, he has to talk about philosophical suicide. Phil philosophical suicide is a way out of the absurd, which matches your critique of idealism or what you're telling me, which is that and that was his critique of all these existentialist philosophers like Kirk Soren Kierkegaard and Husserl, who apparently who had come up with tricks. Kierkegaard said, you know, faith is the answer. Right. The fact that you don't understand the divine and are confused by it is the sign of the divine's power. Let us our confusion is our connection to the divine faith. And then Husserl had a more like, and again, man, I just read from reading this in the morning, a lot of coffee. Husserl just said that apparently he came up with some version of the plate platonic ideals, like a place where some ideal form must exist outside the body and Camus said, that's a more clever form of philosophical suicide, because you've discovered a thing we can't see a non-materialist thing. Camus doesn't even mention materialism in this, but it's exactly where he's coming from. It's a critique of idealism based on what you're telling me. And so, yes, you're saying this is another form of suicide. What you're talking about is a form of suicide that leads to fucking fascism, where instead of looking the problem right in the fucking face, you come up with a easily defeated, prop, mostly helpless group of people and just start beating them. And then somehow in that, you like feel like you're like fixing things. Yeah, it's crazy. And it's like, I mean, that's a really good comparison. And I'm sure all these philosophers, whoever came after whoever was informed by the other, because they were all nerds and they all read each other's shit and whatever. So like, it's probably all connected somehow. But like, I mean, yeah, basically, you know, I ultimately don't know really what the answer to this is, but it does seem like human beings tend to experience that alienation that Camus was talking about and Marx talks about. And everyone kind of puts a different word on, which is like an emptiness where you're yearning for something like to kind of solve it. And there are really bad answers to that, like getting really fucking into QAnon and just like filling your life with that. And then there are answers that are kind of neutral, I'd say. Like people, people, people, I think that are really into just like Christianity and having like a personal relationship with God or whatever. I think this is kind of filling that. And then I think the communist answer is making the argument that like, no, what you're, what you're feeling is actually like you're yearning to like live in cooperation with your fellow man and not in this like weird man made alienated fucking battle with, you know, in a power line with each other all the time. And, you know, and when you feel that contradiction stuff, I'm talking about what like when last summer, like when I just fucking woke up, something's happening, I don't know, my bright antenna is just going off. Like that's like a better world yearning to be birthed out of us. Like at all times, but, you know, but it's just, yeah, no, it's like giving birth. You know, I mean, it's like painful, bloody and stuff. No, not like giving birth that hurts because it probably isn't going to happen. It hurts because I don't think no, yeah. It's like it hurts because it's like it hurts the way a bird sees in a cage. She's a bird fly by. It's that kind of fucking pain. It's like you get it. You catch a smell of this possibility. You don't know what the fuck it is. The moment you start calling it something, people are like, what are you a fucking communist? You're like, no, I don't, I don't think I'm a fucking communist. I don't know. Is that bad? And then, you know, but, but to me, like, and this is an embarrassing thing and all anyone listening, you're communist friends who probably hate me. Forgive me. Okay. But, but the, you know, God, I'm sorry, man. I don't mean to embarrass you, but burning man is like a ren fair for communism. Oh, it's like, obviously, what's that? I'm way into this. It's, it's like, yeah, you got to pay to get in and all the critiques of it. You could go look, there's infinite critiques. But if you've been living in a fucking society, as I have, where everything is outside of your family or friends is based on some form of exchange and even friends think of dating, people go on a date. Some people and they're like calculating how much the other person owes. And when you're eating with people, it's a big ritual. The end is like, okay, you had the hamburger and I had the wine, but I'll pay for your wine, Jerry. That fucking thing. But like, suddenly you go to this place where the only thing you can buy is ice and coffee, everything else you have to have brought or people give you and you go there and like, all of a sudden, people are just giving you stuff. And you want it, not like little things like food and like helping you and like you want to cry and you feel like, what the fuck is this? And like, you know, you're with your like camp and you're helping them build stuff, but you're drinking and you're laying in hammocks in between and you're laughing and it's fucking fun and real and beautiful. But you don't know why you feel so sad and happy all the same time. And it's because for a tidy second, you get to experience this other way things could be this other way that isn't scary where there's some dude in a fucking Chinese military outfit dragging you out of your house at night to ask you why you tweeted some Winnie the Pooh fucking picture. But you know what I mean? But it's like, it's like people who really are just like loving each other. It's temporary. And you know, it's not going to last and there's all kinds of problems with it. But I'm just saying it's the, you know, most people, when they think of work, they're like, ah, fuck work. Yeah. Because the only work they've experienced is like work where they're working for someone who's paying them. You know what I mean? Or their parents made them mow the lawn or something. You know, humans like to work. It's just that we want to get like compensated correctly for it. The problem with capitalism is that I'm not, isn't an argument like we need, we don't want to work anymore. It's like, oh, I just want this guy to stop taking all my money that I made, like all the value that I made. Actually, you know, a lot, big part of Marxism is talking about this communal utopian stuff that you're describing where it's like, oh, in the future, we all will like enjoy, you know, like hanging out with each other and taking care of, you know, the community and stuff like that. I dude, I was just talking about what you're talking about on my friend's podcast, The Antifada, we did an episode about the movie Spring Breakers, because we were just like, what the fuck is going on with this movie or whatever. Yeah. The conclusion that we had. It's fucking great, man. You should check it out. But like dumb ass teenagers going on Spring Break, hipsters like us going to music festivals, fucking Burning Man, Ren Fair, all of these things are the same thing, which is a vacation where you can experience like that communal lizard brain thing that your body's yearning for, but it's only temporary and that's what's so tragic about it. But you're, I mean, I agree 100%, you know? Yeah, it's like, it's temporary. But, but, but to me, that was like my experience with it was fuck, this is like actually the most insidious, clever form of communist indoctrination that I've ever seen in my life because it's some experience with it instead of hearing about it or trying to understand it. And to get to the place where you get to actually experience it is, I think if we're going to like cite some of the suspicious aspects of the society we're in, that's got to be one of them. It's like weirdly, it's easier to go to a place where someone's getting paid, it was going to give you shit that it is to like gather together with a group of people and mutually construct something for fun. You know what I mean? Like it takes a little more, more organized organizing skill. But, you know, this is what I want to know because I don't think I disagree with much of anything that you're, you're saying. I, the part where I just went, I just think there's just no way. Like it's, it's more likely, it's more likely oligarchy. It's more likely fascism. It's more likely what, Brave New World, Aldous Huxley. It's more likely that some kind of work, like a new, a new drug is going to come out that is a pacifier, you know, that like just makes people completely happy, whatever is going on or wherever they are. You know what I mean? Like then, then somehow anything more happens than like a temporary revolt, lots of people dying. We got to crack down and then some form of fascism. That's where I get bummed out about it. How do, how the fuck do we get to communist utopia in our lifetimes? I don't know because honestly, like I thought maybe we might get the slightest smidge of progress when Bernie was a thing and he's not. And now we're living in a post Bernie world and that's really depressing. But you know, ultimately, when I think about this stuff, I it's fucking weird because honestly, I don't actually, if I was a gambling man, I don't think we're going to reach anything resembling communism in my lifetime. So sometimes I feel like a fucking evangelist or something going around and going, it's about the, you know, this weird apocalypse future that we're not even going to live to see or whatever. But that's not the point, right? The point isn't the end goal. It's understanding the line on the graph that, you know, tends in a certain direction. And so, you know, better things are possible that are just on the way there. And I think that's why the stuff is so important to understand. However, I'm also not the most positive person in the world. I tend to agree with you. And a lot of times I think about this and I'm like, yeah, humans, human nature seems such that we will literally like just blow ourselves off the fucking planet before we allow this to happen for some reason. But, you know, isn't that the beauty of Marx, even though I, like, isn't that the beauty of what he was saying? Like, isn't that like the mercy of this person's philosophy is number one, recognizing that people who tune into this are going to first be like, wow, and then feel an intense level of despair at, you know what I mean? His advice was don't let's stick to a few seconds ahead here instead of worrying about some fucking utopia. Forget about all that bullshit. We got to stay seconds, like just in the, in the now of things, because otherwise we're all going to just blow our fucking brains out. So forget about that. Let's stay in the now. That's where he like synergizes with like a Buddhist teacher. I love Chogyam, Trumpa and like, who is also like would say things like it's hopeless. Just that's the reality. It's a hopeless situation. And everyone thinks that's a depressing statement, but it isn't. It's like, let's start where we're at here. Uh, but do you think one of the path, like we have to think about pathways to this utopia, because I feel like it's our human right. And regardless of the whatever's up, we're up against, it's our human right. And it's also part of making stuff as you think of the end result and forget about what's getting in the way. And then you can kind of reduce that end result until it fits in with something more realistic than what, whatever you, you have at your control. But what about this idea? This sounds like idealism though, but what if like the answer is not the revolution that people think, what if the answer is that communists, hardcore communists have to become wealthy, they have to become CEOs. They have to go through the avenues of capitalism, become insanely powerful and wealthy, and then you, then that's where you dismantle the fucking thing, enact laws from that place of power and wealth, act like you're all fucking wealthy, you're fucking Batman. You're the Batman of communism. You know what I mean? And then is that a pathway into people think of that as a possibility? I don't think so. That's honestly a very American concept. That's what we tell people so that communism doesn't happen. They go, how about you do this instead? But the problem is that does not alleviate the contradictions of society. It just heightens them in favor of someone else, I think. One thing I do want to make pretty clear to kind of come to a little bit of an inclusion about this release, my spiel is so what I think is honestly the path forward and the reason I think that talking to you and talking to your audience about this is going to be so cool is that I did not come here to negate idealism and materialism does not negate idealism. It's not a battle between the two things. One of my favorite things anyone said about materialism is that materialism does not negate idealism. It simply puts it in its correct context. And in that way, the two things work together in like synthesis. And I think really we have to kind of understand how these puzzle pieces fit together because like one thing about like modern society and like millennials and shit like that is like we're all like working right now and our contradictions are heightening and we're getting paid less and working harder and stuff like that. And our bosses are and the culture in general is kind of pushing like this self care stuff on us and like medicine and all that sort of stuff. And the thing is that stuff is not wrong, but it's in the wrong context because once when your boss tells you how about you meditate, they're telling you that it's like instead of giving you a raise and you're like, oh, let me can only add to that for you because I've heard all the critiques of mindfulness and it's one of the big problems with it is that like mindfulness and meditation, it's an ambivalent, it's neutral. You know, here's it's like jumping jacks or something. You know, it's like this is a neutral thing. But it's not just that it's being used. It could be used as what's what what you're talking about is like spiritual bypass. It could just be used as a way to like sort of give yourself the impression that you're doing something or that you're like what this is something that I used to be so good at, which was like, you know, just figuring out ways to make my cowardice seem like I was being revolutionary. I'm too good for the world. I'm outside the system. You know what I mean? Like, yeah, I'm totally in the system, but you know, I don't not really into this. But I am totally in the system. That kind of shit. And and because I meditate, I go to ayahuasca retreats. I, you know, I take acid or whatever it is. You know what I mean? And so the but the big critique is like, you know, they're teaching drone operators mindfulness. They're they're teaching people who are dropping bombs on people how to practice mindfulness to reach a kind of clarity when they're turning people in a hamburger meat in other countries. Right. So, but to, you know, for me, like the, if Marx is saying, we're going to stay right here, we're going to stay like in this moment now here, then that extinguishes a lot of like possible idealism just right there. Because a huge part of it seems like a huge part of what people use to soothe themselves is like little orphan Annie, which is the ultimate example of what you're talking about, you know, the little orphan gets adopted by the fucking oligarch, and then like all of a sudden has a great life. I mean, it's a parable of idealism. And what's the fucking anthem of little orphan Annie? The sun will come tomorrow, you know what I mean? It's like, you know, tomorrow it'll get better, motherfucker. You know what I mean? So to me, I think where you're right, where a lot of like mindfulness and a lot of meditation and a lot of like quote, spirituality gets misused or misplaced is by people who are trying to use it as a sedative. But any real experience with the shit, it fuck hurts. It's it's about dropping your ignorance. It's about letting like not ignoring all the shit that's inside of you or the world. And, you know, it's a fuck. It's I think a lot of people are shocked to suddenly discover that through some spiritual practice, they're experiencing a lot of what was it? You're saying that causes the revolution contradictions, contradictions. And that yeah, they're that through that practice, they're being invited to look the contradiction right in the fucking eye instead of ignoring it. And then that empowers people in some way. But I mean, tell me a little bit about like, and thank you so much for this conversation. Do you have a little more time? It's been an hour. I got it. Let's put it this way. I have more time than you. One. Wonderful. I got kids. Yeah. But but so let's bring it into instead of like that. You did a great job of like framing this. Thank you. I had a great time. Thank you. That was awesome. But now frame it in a day. What if Marx is talking about this? It's it's like being in the nowness of what's happening. What does that look like for an individual from on a day to day basis? OK, that's a really good question because we are so brainwashed into thinking about ourselves as individuals. And so this is like this is why this stuff is important. Because when you understand all this stuff and you have class consciousness, you immediately realize that that's not even a good way of framing it, but you still are an individual. So you do wake up and a lot of people might think, well, I want to make the world a better place. So for example, I am going to not buy or eat any meat, you know, and which is fine. I'm friends with a lot of vegans and I support that whole heartedly and everything and I understand why. But, you know, that's really still framing your connection to the world as you as a consumer and your power being as a consumer, right? So you can be a vegan for as long as you want. But, you know, if you if you in more concrete political ways, you know, you don't support your local union that then represents and puts pressure on a politician who makes decisions about factory farms and things like that, you have done way less in one direction than the other direction. So actually putting all this pressure on you and your individual lifestyle is very advantageous for the capitalist system because it has you kind of misdirecting all of your energy, you know? So actually, one thing you can do is relax, like hang out and, you know, enjoy yourself for a moment and put all this stuff in perspective. And, you know, it's hard because the thing that you can reach out at most often and really affect is kind of classically pointed to as your workplace. And that's really scary. There are a lot of tactics to keep people from organizing their workplaces. I personally think like any better any good that I'm talking about on this trajectory does not come from electing another AOC or a Bernie or whatever. It's we have to spread the gospel of everyone organized your workplace. And then we sort of rest power back that way. That's a difficult task. And I think the first step to getting there and before even joining your local DSA or whatever, reading, you know, theory on Libcom or something like that is just the lens, just understanding any given moment, what's actually happening and how actually to manipulate the various contradictions in the world. Because we're screwed when we go, OK, there's a problem with the police. OK, what if I vote for somebody who says they're going to train them? All right, that doesn't do anything to resolve the contradictions between us and the police. It just lowers a little bit. And inevitably, they heighten back up and rub against each other and start to make friction right. And so, yeah, I mean, it's really just just kind of a basic understanding. And, you know what, that's hard, too. The reason that another reason that this stuff is so alien and so taboo and American society is so hard to find is because there is an inherent contradiction in the fact that in order to read all this shit, you have to not be working all the time, which is, you know, why I do podcasts about it and stuff. But really, like, no, take take a load off yourself. Stop. They want you to have a guilt complex where you're like, it's it's me as the stuff that I buy is what changes society and the stuff that I boycott stuff. No, it's. Oh, my God, right? Like, it's like that. I remember when I first learned about this rotten pairing that court that companies do, where they pair their coffee with like they in the laziest way, they'll have like a picture of their like coffee beans and they'll say sustainable on top of it. And so you go there and you get this weird sense of guilt mitigation. Yeah. Because you saw a picture of coffee beans and above it, it said sustainable. And so you drink the coffee. You're like, oh, I did something today. Yeah. Or like, you know, like non-government organizations, like people just kind of ritually go like, oh, I donate a few hundred dollars a year to X company or whatever. Like those are all they just the money gets sucked up into them. And then they just pays the employee. That's like the fact that you felt better for doing that is actually worse because it's all your resources as a person. And we need those resources to, you know, build a better world to birth the better world from all of us. Well, you how do. OK, I'm here. Comes a fucking the oink of a pig. I'm having a fence put around my house that I bought first house. I ever have bought. I know that's insane. I can't believe it. And I have people who are working to do this to doing this work. And I know for certain that the person I'm paying isn't, you know what I mean? Just the way shit works. There's no way they're getting like it's not equally. It's not distributed equally. So I mean, just nuts and bolts. How the fuck do how do I do that? What does that look like? You know, how does that look? What does that look? I'm just saying, like, I'm privileged. I'm successful. And my experience of life is very different from my experience of life when I was pulling cheese out of my fucking refrigerator. Yeah. But but so I'm on the sadly like on the other side. No, it's not sadly. I mean, I like it. But still, it's like, what the fuck do what do we do? What do I do with like the little good fortune that I have? What does that look like? And I'm not saying like, like, what do I do? Like, I can obviously guess, but I'm just curious from a communist perspective or from the perspective of communism, what are the householders supposed to do? What are the people who have employees, even if it's temporary, supposed to do? What the fuck do we do? OK, so the first answer is relax, because, you know, a lot of people will tell you like as a very just flawed, immediate critique of everything I'm talking about is people will go, well, you use a cell phone and you order food off of Grubhub. I was a pizza delivery guy for many years. I use the app that exploits pizza delivery guys. Like it's part of just being alive in America. Yeah. Socialism comes from understanding that we are trapped in the workings of capitalism. So don't worry if you have to buy stuff that is inherently exploitive. All things you have to buy are inherently exploitive, 99 percent of the time. And, you know, you can do individual things like tip nicely or whatever. But really, more importantly is just live your life. But really understand that when those workers go on strike, the only thing you can do to support them is to support the strike. Or, you know, if there's an organized boycott, then boycott then. But like, you really have to pay attention to that stuff, too, because like, I mean, sometimes boycotts are bad because if they're not called by the workers, then like it actually hurts the company. They just did this in in Alabama. Amazon faked a boycott and they've tricked people into thinking like, oh, I should support this, but it's like the workers didn't call it. And so we still work for a place. We still need you to spend money there so we get paid and stuff like that. So like there's all these things that you need to understand. And if you understand them, it's actually very easy because then all you notice that all you really have to do is support the strike, you know, and spread the good word. And I, you know, I don't know. I mean, probably there's something I'm not getting to here, but I'm just trying to, you know, I don't know. This is all I got. No, it's cool. Spreading the good word. I think it's great, man. I think like one of the sweet things that you're saying is, which weirdly does parallel a lot of the like spiritual stuff is like, let's just drop the fucking guilt thing for a second. Like you're where you're at. You know, I remember I was whining to my meditation teacher once because I had just eaten lamb and I was feeling all guilty, which is the most sociopathic thing. Like, you know what I mean? It's like imagining Jeffrey Dahmer after eating a person, but then like apologizing to the skull or something is way worse than just eating the fucking thing, you know, but I was bitching him about it. And he's like too late for the lamb, too late for you. And, you know, like that's just the way it is where we are, where we're at. So I like that. I think there's a lot of room in what you're saying for me to to like just be like, oh, I guess I'll just relax. And that's it. But I think you're adding to it like, you know, get to know what you need, what union shit's going on in your town. Is that what you're saying? Like get to know where the workers are organized and pitch in a little bit if they need your help. You know what you're saying? Yeah, it feels very counterintuitive. It feels intuitive to people, I think, to do the things that you do all day, which is buy things and walk around its stuff and try to help that way. But it's actually it's much more abstract and weird. I mean, what you could do is actually pay attention and be an active member of your society and specifically support things that, you know, cause the sort of dialectic thing I'm talking about to further itself. And, you know, I'm not talking like, oh, look, with the Union Drive at Amazon, they're not going to violently overthrow their boss. That is just a resolving of a contradiction where they end up getting paid better because they formed into a union that says, hey, well, I'll quit if you try to fuck us or whatever. Yeah. So it's weird because if you understand this stuff, you will actually take enough of a load off yourself. We were not enslaved mentally with the weird liberal guilt thing of I need to donate and I need to fucking buy the right thing. And then you have enough energy and will within you to, yeah, I just pay attention to labor politics in your area. Follow your local DSA and stuff like that. And like, you know, pay attention to when Democrats run people, whether it's some bullshit, you know, where it's basically Republican or if it's a bona fide person who doesn't take PAC money and stuff like that. And, you know, on this basic level, I mean, this is a hard question to answer because like this is what I'm trying to answer all day in my life and with my podcast and stuff is like, how do we apply this to the world we're living in? I there's a few ways I don't know if we're living in a time where there's a really great call to action and part of not having that call to action does make me feel like the Camus absurdity thing sometimes where I'm like, well, I understand all this stuff and there's nothing I can do about it, you know, but that's. Hey, you know what, Jake? You know what that makes me think? Maybe another capitalist symptom is the hero thing. Totally. It's like, don't worry. You don't have to be the one to figure it out. Mate, you're not going to be the one to figure it out. We're all going to figure it out together. And you can know another way you can relax is you're not going to save the world. Right. That's the whole point. We're going to save it together. Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of us in a decentralized way. Right. Like, don't I feel like that my like begging you for some solution is just another sign of the fucking indoctrination. Yeah, which is be the leader, be the hero, be the fucking thing. You know, it's hard to relax into like, no, be part of the thing. Right. That's that's cool. Yeah. No, it's it's the you're describing individualism, which is like such an American idea. You know, we have all the John Wayne movies and Cowboys stuff. Yeah, we're inherently just we can't. It's really hard to break yourself out of the idea of thinking things happen because of individuals and I'm an individual, so I need to do this. But you're right, it's you're part of something. And honestly, that's why I'm like, let's talk to Duncan and his audience about this sort of stuff, because that's a thing that that looking into your inner world helps you work out. These things benefit from each other, you know, both sides of the coin. Like you're what you're able to actually enact outside of you benefits from like bettering yourself inside and vice versa. You know, like the the inner world stuff benefits from being able to put it in the right context. So yeah, I don't know. I mean, this is what I think is one of the things you could do, I guess, is just it's really hard to map out like instructions for how to raise consciousness, you know? Well, I think you've given a really great. Map and steps and most importantly, just information. I mean, that's what I do like about communism. The little bit of it that I've studied is the just like this is how it is. Like you what if you're mad at communism, what are you going to get mad at winter? Or are you going to get mad at like cycles of the moon or something? This is just this is the way it is. People do get mad at it for that reason. It's it's very depressing at first, you know? Yeah. Yeah. But it's also really like I think, you know, individualism is exhausting, man. And it's like it's you're only going to be disappointed and it's lonely. You're going to be fucking lonely if you're always trying to be the boss or the leader or whatever the crazy ass thing you're trying to do. Just that relaxing. That was another I'm sorry, man. God, I'm sorry. I want to use my only example of. No, I love it, man. That was the other thing I noticed when Burning Man was like it wasn't just like we're all sharing and also that you just don't even want to hold on anything anymore. No one's taking shit from you. You're like, it's what are you going to sit and eat your fucking grapes by yourself? Like some, you know what I mean? With like, like, you know, people cry, I saw someone cry. Someone gave them a piece of bacon and they just started crying. You know what I mean? It's like a but but also like the way the community holds people the way that, like, you know, people going through shit or like the community just naturally kind of like has a healing quality to it. Well, there isn't like, like anything I ever saw, you just realize like, God, I bet it's so much a mental illness in the world is just based on folks having this tourniquet wrapped around them and the rest of their species, you know? Yeah. So yeah, there's a healing quality to it. Totally. Yeah. You know, you sound like an anarchist right now. That's that's like kind of what, you know, Kropakam was talking about and stuff. The manmade artificial thing that we set up to divide us all is like making us sick. Like, I mean, everyone can relate to this right now. Or most people, I guess, if you participated in the pandemic, you know, it feels weird when you don't leave your house for 10 days and then you go out and you're like, eyes are all bugged out and dark rings under them and stuff. And you're like, literally unhealthy from not like could doing what you were, you know, evolved probably to do, you know, just live in community and live as a piece of a greater sort of operation that sustains us all, you know? Yeah, man. I think like, yeah, you are doing something because we've this is what you we need. We need more you to be doing what you're doing because what's happening is people are listening to you. It's this end of the podcast, which in the beginning I was going to be about communism. And at the end of it, where's the evil communist? Right. So is this an evil as a person I'm talking to right now? Evil, are you are you hearing like the bitter anger of some like person who wants to steal your fucking car and give it to like his collective? No, you're that's the thing is like when you hear the real thing, it's sweet. It's it's there's a kindness to it. And and also, I think because of that, it's inevitable. It's just too much energy to keep capitalism going. It's just not it's too much energy, too much exertion. Isn't that what Marx was saying is like, this is going to happen. Yeah, just because the fucking model doesn't work that you're it just can't. There's not enough energy to do permanent capitalism. Yeah, it's sustainable. Unfortunately, sometimes it kind of looks like it's it will kill us before we, you know, it allows us to overthrow it. But right, you know, I mean, that's the million dollar question. I don't know what's going to happen in the future. But I do think it's one of those two things, if this makes any sense. It is, I do think it I mean, it didn't. Can you I'm sorry, we are in an hour and a half. Do you have a little more time? I have a few more questions. I got all day, man. I'm having a good time. Thank you. Can you talk about a little because one of the things I remember reading when I was looking in the communism, Marx was talking about this problem of automation, saying like, you know, things are just going to get completely automated, where the worker will become unnecessary completely. Can you maybe do you know much about that? Or can you talk about that a little bit? Yeah, no, that's perfect. I'm actually in a reading capital, his seminal work in a group with a bunch of other people right now and we're exactly at that part. So this is perfect. He's so fun to read, by the way. He talks about he's describes like the monstrosity of the factory as if it's this giant dragon troposaurus thing. And it's just so fun. But, you know, I mean, inherent in the nuts and bolts of like what he's laid out, you know, the dynamics inherent to like the factory system describes this thing where, yeah, eventually machines, which cost a certain amount to run, but aren't like elastic in the way that workers are, they come in and they replace workers, and then you have like one worker running a bunch of machines instead of, you know, a bunch of right. And it affects the dynamics of the situation. So the thing that's really important about capital is it marks pretty much identifies as a first person political economy, history to identify that like where actually wealth comes from is not, you know, it's not from trading creatively, it's not from God, it's not from whatever. It's from the fact that a human being working is like an elastic thing that you can squeeze excess pro like value out of it's a long time to explain the math on this, but it's like, let's go with that. All right, it's like an inherent problem in this whole situation, which means that if you replace the factory with a bunch of automation, but you have one person you're then squeezing profit out of them, the only way to really like, you know, continue this process because you're making so much stuff is like, you have to open more factories and that's how you ended up with the industrial revolution where we put, you know, railroads and steamboats and shit all over the world. And, you know, all this evil fucking steam and dark clouds and stuff happened in the octopus and over the globe. And so he's looking at all that and he's sort of saying that's why it's inevitable that we have to the only way to solve this contradiction that is yielding all these evil results is to change what the technology is for. And the only way to change what the technology is for is to move out of the historical phase of capitalism, because in capitalism, like AI and machinery and stuff like that is for profit. And it will never not be motivated by expanding in the way, right? But if we resolve this problem and we achieve like socialism or communism or something like that, then suddenly that big scary machine is your friend, like it just works for like us to be able to get around. And I mean, like everyone benefits from technology in the modern world. I love using my phone. I travel around and you stand up and I don't have a car right now, at least. And so, you know, what I do a lot of times is I just roll into a town and I fucking use those bird scooters as little, you know, evil Francisco scooters and everyone hates them because they're like some tech asshole makes them any profits off of them, right? But what if they were owned by the public? What if they were free like the library? Then wouldn't it be fucking awesome to live in Denver or whatever, where you can pick up a scooter every now and then and just ride it around? Yeah, the the the the contradiction is only like it's on. It's only that. That's the thing about looking at these things this way. It is only resolvable through the synthesis. That's so cool. Break. That's so cool. I misunderstood it. What are you saying now? I get it because I didn't I probably that was probably the reason I remember is probably because I was the last thing I read the last time I read Marx when I was like, I don't give up. I this is fucking crazy. But the I didn't get to the part where he's like, look, it's not so much the factories or the automation. Yeah, it's that this is making one person rich. But a full automation for the people is utopia. That's a utopian place where it's like we're using solar powered bird scooters that, you know, or the AI has figured out a way to harness all the energy from the sun to fuel everything. And like there is no more need for work. I mean, that's that that's the thing. It's like that's to me that what I how what I thought Marx was saying is like if we go full automation so they're in there, we don't even need a worker looking after the machines because it's a fucking robot looking after the machines that's being looked after by another fucking robot. You know what it means? Like maybe, you know, eventually there's almost nobody at all running this shit. You know, that to me is where like all of capitalism collapses. You know, like now well now who's making money? And if no one's making money because there's no more jobs, who's buying the shit the robots are making? The problem and then the problem is it's over right now as of that happening. Someone still owns all those robots and is profiting off of it. But the premise of all of this is kind of like, hey, what if we have all this stuff in place and then, you know, the term is sees the means of production? Like we take it over and then repurpose it to do something different than earn profit for some guy in a top hat, right? And the point that we turn it towards is making our lives better, greater good. You know, and it's like, yeah, if it's also sometimes it's this stuff sounds crazy and like out there and it's like, really did it. That's what a library is, you know, it's a small scale. Like that's not a bookstore. We just agreed to throw money at it and go, OK, it's communally ever to read a book and that's for the greater good, right? And everyone fucking loves a library unless you're some demon. There's nothing better than a fucking library. You go in there, it's nice, it's quiet, bring your kid in there. Like, holy fuck. There's books everywhere. Yeah, every like that's the thing. All the I guess like a long term PR campaign or a natural kind of like, you know, if we're going to look at corporations is like some form of like data organism and organisms want to stay alive. And so any kind of message messaging regarding like the evils of what of communism or any of this stuff, it really is just like you're going to get that because it's an existential threat, like the whole thing. Yeah, it fucks the whole thing up. Like, and of course, the thing doesn't want to get fucked up. So it's like it doesn't work. Dude, that's literally where PR comes from. There's this great documentary by Adam Curtis. I was watching a while back. I think we mentioned that last time we talked, but it's called The Century of the Self and he talks about how. So check this out. This is crazy, man. Sigmund Freud had a nephew named Edward Bernays and Edward Bernays moved from Germany to America, and then he just started working in America and like, I think he's a writer or something. And he got hired by the CIA because the CIA wanted to overthrow the Guatemalan government because they had elected a democratically socialist government, and that was interfering with the fact that we had the United Fruit Company in Guatemala. And so the point of that was for us to extract profit from using workers in Guatemala, right? But they elected a democratically socialist government. So what they did is say, hey, we're going to nationalize the fruit industry we have, so it benefits us. And so the profit comes into growing our country. And so what the CIA did is overthrow the government, install some evil military guy. But the way that they needed to sell that to Americans as a like a war effort was to re like frame it and recontextualize it. And, you know, change the narrative. And so, you know, they hired Edward Bernays, fucking a Sigmund Freud's nephew. Oh, weird. He used psychology to like to change, you know, the the framings around this stuff and make it look like, oh, we're going to fight an evil third world government dictate. The guy was elected like with votes, you know, and he was trying to give people the, you know, the benefit, the fruit of stealing the land. Yeah. He's stealing the land from the people. And that oh, and that birthed PR public relations as a science comes from like that incident after that, he just that became his job. And he came a guy who went around and said, do you need me to re fucking contextualize something and sell it to people on behalf of capitalism? That's what I do. And then, you know, the rest of American history and advertising all that stuff was birthed from there. That, see, this is like in this, there's a great book that I think you would like by Jaren Lanier. You ever read his stuff? No, I'll write that down. It's like 12 reasons to delete your social media accounts. OK. And he worked in Silicon Valley and like he was one of the people who developed VR technology to where it is now and stuff. But yeah, he that's his what one of the like fears that he's putting out there is like it's AI is going to like be like, you know, it's going to turn all of society to a fucking skinner box. And you're going to be completely dominated and manipulated by. And another friend of mine, you know, pointed out that my friend Jason Lou was talking about how anytime anything appears in pop culture, no matter how legitimate it is, it instantly gets adopted and then warped by pop culture and a domesticated version of itself, meaning that any, you know, did you the best example of this is, did you see that fucking failed Coca Cola commercial? It's one of my, do you know what I'm talking about? I don't know. What did you know? Oh, my God, you got it didn't work. It's one of the Kardashians is in it. And like she was a Pepsi one. No, the Pepsi one. That's what I mean. It was a Pepsi, the one where you have like the fucking protest and she gives a Pepsi to a cop. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know what I mean? But it's like, it was, you know, like someone's sitting in a boardroom. They're like, all right, we got protests. How do we turn this into an opportunity for Pepsi? And they're like, well, we need a Kardashian for sure. And then we'll make it so that the bridge between the people and the police state is Pepsi. And that's how we're going to solve this problem of police brutality. Yeah. It thinks it's too absurd. Like it didn't work after contradictions were heightened high enough to where it didn't like you can't sell that back to somebody as a Pepsi commercial. No, that was the fail. But that was a human failure. Yeah, the scary thing is when AI takes over the PR campaigns of the CIA and then suddenly it's like, you know, people like us start seeing shit. And we're like, you know, that kind of does make sense. And we don't even know that our needles have been nudged by some artificial intelligence in the servitude of some state agency that wants to continue some cultural trend. That's where it gets scary, man. It's like, yeah, you know what? So that relates to what I was talking about with the individual like consumer power stuff, you know, because it's like all of this is the illusion that the things you do and things that you're clicking on and liking or whatever do stuff like here's an example they use when they talk about the birth of PR in that movie, this fucking blue line I heard about. Wait, can we cut to a commercial real quick? Yes. I'm sorry. I just funny to say cut to a commercial in the middle. I'm sorry. I was going to get interrupted by commercials though. I feel guilty. Oh, no, no, no. I mean, we live in capitalism. You have to do it. You know, that's so funny, though. It did occur to me. I was like, oh, that's ironic. So check this out, right? Way back in the 50s when they first were kind of coming up with like powdered cake mix and stuff like that, like that you would make a cake at home in your new little suburban oven or whatever. They used to be all the ingredients came in the box and then you'd pour the box into a bowl and you would add water and like some milk or something. And that was it made a mixture. And then you made a cake and they didn't sell very well because they realized that after a while people were getting depressed by how they didn't feel like they had any agency in the process of making this cake. So what they did was they took one of the ingredients that they had powdered, which was an egg, and they un-powdered it and they took it out of the cake mix. And now the instructions, when you get a cake mix, it says, take an egg out of the fridge and break it and mix it into the cake mix. And that way you feel like you're doing something, even though you need not be doing it. Yeah, that crazy that is happening nine million times a day when you open Facebook and Twitter and all this stuff and like just can tell yourself these little stories and like that's even what I was saying about like, you know, the consumer stuff, whether it's, you know, I'm going to shop. I'm going to boycott Amazon today. I'm going to shop at the ethnic store that's owned by somebody I like or whatever. All these things are that's it's just the egg over again. You have to look big picture and figure out a way to get around all this stuff because it's just tricking us into leaving the only thing more dangerous than leading a meaningless life is leading one in thinking that it's like really meaningful. You know, all right. Oh, God, that's so depressing. Well, look, you know, I think one thing that you said, I'll carry with me for a long time because it's very pragmatic and it's just help the fucking workers. That's not hard. You can do that. It's easy to find out where the DSDSA is in your city. Or if not that some union or probably somebody could use at least you're just listen. Right. Like just listen. What are they saying? Is it crazy? Do you agree with it? And then if you agree with it, I'm sure there's some simple thing you could do that helps and that doesn't make you part of some sinister communist revolution that's going to take all the joy out of life. But really, it's just you're just helping people who are working and need need some fucking help. I'm going to do that now. And I appreciate you, man. I really appreciate this conversation. Thank you. It was a good refresher. I forgot a lot of that stuff. Oh, hold on one second. Jerry, bring me another fucking Pellegrino. Sorry, my assistant, man. He's a fucking idiot when you heard my mouth go dry. Well, maybe you should work harder. And one day he'll be the podcaster. Yeah. Hear that. Oh, man, thank you very much. Can you let people know where they can find you? Absolutely. Thank you, Duncan. This is an honor. I'm such a fan. And so I had a Christian. Thank you. My at on all social media is Feral Jokes. It's an anagram for my name, which is Jake Flores. And I know, fun, right? And my podcast, I have two podcasts. One of them is like I do a podcast with a bunch of comedians. We're all DSA organizers and stuff like that. And we do, you know, comedic stuff about what I'm talking about in the news and stuff like that in history. It's called Pod Damn America. It was a joke making fun of Pod Save America. And that was years ago. And now it doesn't make any sense anymore, but whatever. The other one's called Why You Mad? And it's a little bit more conversational, a little bit more Duncan style, I'd say, where me and my friend, Louisa Diaz, who's an anthropologist and comedy booker, we just really get into trying to make little fun rhizomes out of talking about various things and stand up art, art history, theory, philosophy, communism and all that sort of stuff. And those are pretty much my two things, you know, I think I might do stand up again sometime soon. If the pandemic permits sometime this year, maybe next year, but you can find all that stuff by following me on social media and whatever. I list all my dates and stuff on my website. That's it. Thank you so much. Thank you, Jake. Thank you so much. Everybody connect with this man. I hope you'll come back on the show, man. I'd love to continue this conversation. Anytime, man. I would love to. Thank you. That was Jake Flores, everybody. A big thank you to our wonderful sponsors, BetterHelp and Manscaped. And much thanks to you for listening.

Hello my sweet and beautiful children of the summer winds of change. It is ID Trussell, and now we're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. If this is your first time listening, hang in there. We've got a little malfunctioning happening with our quadruzing constipter, and because of that our entire fucking paradigm is getting off bonkers right now. I've got like 700 hummingbirds that have appeared in my fucking house and they're swirling around forming weird hieroglyphics with their fucking white patterns. Hey there guys, there we go. Sorry about that. I've got one of these new god damn sound boards made out of a giant chameleon skeleton, and I think the reality crystal in there has gotten some kind of mold contaminant on it or something, so forgive me for that. If this is your first time listening, welcome to Leather Sports. This is a podcast where we talk about one thing only, that's sports. None of this fucking yappy-pappy-dippy-doopy-woo-woo-y bullshit that you're gonna hear in a lot of other podcasts where people talk about their feeling. No way guys, we're gonna talk about the field. We're gonna talk about football. We're gonna talk about what it's like when your fucking ass smashes down into that fucking field. Ah, got it. Welcome.

You will be taken to Amazon, where you can buy literally anything on planet Earth. And since I've been getting ready to go to Burning Man, I've been buying pendants, necklaces, like rope for necklaces, full body suits, all these very strange things you end up having to have when you're making the pilgrimage to see the burn. I hope you'll go through the link. If you do that, anything that you buy in Amazon, they give us a very, very small percentage of, and it costs you nothing. Go pick up some pendants, some necklaces, some candy, a bidet, a butt plug, a helmet. It's all there for you. Just head over to amazon.com. All right, babies. Man, I really do hope I'm going to run into some of you guys out there on the Playa. I don't know. Let me know where you're at. Tweet at me. What camp are you at? What should I do this year? Where should I go? I'm really excited. Are you feeling it? Are you feeling the pull of the desert? I sure am. All right, here we go. You're going to have to listen to another intro, because this is a live podcast and I didn't attempt an intro on this one. This was at the Float Conference in Portland. All right, let's do it. Here we go, everybody. It's time for a live DTFH. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. All right. All right, so I thought we'd take a small detour away from rigid Float Science research for a second here and do something a little bit different. We are going to have a live recording of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast here on stage at the Float Conference. This guy right here, Chris Petrafix from Pro Float, Inc. Many of you probably know him. He's been a huge part of making this possible. Give this guy a giant hug next time you see him. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Duncan Trussell. What's up? Hi. Welcome. Hey, how are you guys doing? Great, man. Awesome. Well, this is really cool. Whenever I do a live podcast, I want you guys to know how they work and then we'll jump right into the thing. First of all, I don't know how many of you listen to my podcast. How many listen to the DTF? Awesome. Well, the opening rants that you hear me do, I spend a lot of time on those rants. So it's a really weird few days when I'm doing that because I'm going back, recording, listening to myself, hearing what I said, thinking, God, who the fuck do you think you are, man? You sound crazy. Then going back and rerecording and rerecording and rerecording and rerecording and rerecording, trying various combinations of coffee and marijuana and mushrooms until something comes out that seems okay. And sometimes it doesn't happen. Sometimes it's just, I just put it up and I think, oh, well, I hope they forgive me for that one. So what I do in the live shows, because I think what's cool about a podcast is that it is a collaboration compared to other forms of entertainment. It's a collaboration not just between me and the guest, but between me and the listeners. I get incredible emails from you guys and tweets and texts correcting me, scolding me, telling me things that I should check out, telling me I don't fucking know what communism is, man. And I listen and it helps me evolve a little bit. So for these live shows, I like to get suggestions from you guys about things we could talk about for the opening rant. So what do you guys want to talk about? First, somebody said not floating. Had enough? How long have you been here for one fucking day, man? Wait, wait, you're the wrong conference. Goddamn, these fucking float conferences. All they do is talk about floating around this fucking place. First float on psychedelics, sure. Okay, what else? What? Okay, creative process? Okay, that's cool. He asked if I ate the mushrooms that he gave to me at the commie store. No, I didn't, officer. I'm drug free. Anything else? What's that? Portland hipsters? I don't know. What was it? What is communism? What is communism? Okay, well, I think I got a couple of things we could talk about for sure. I didn't look into communism yet, so I don't know, man. Seems interesting. So the other thing I like to do to start these shows off is to get everybody to alme together and to alme for a little bit longer than any of us feel comfortable alming for, which is the right amount of time to alme longer than you feel comfortable for. And it's really cool because a lot of us have never experienced congregational alming and what that sounds like and how powerful it can be. And if you get over the first few minutes of weirdness and let yourself do it and just listen, you might find that it begins to create a really interesting effect inside of you. And it's also an interesting sound because at any given moment all over the planet, hundreds and thousands of people, maybe more, are making that sound. And that's something that always trips me out. Not just people in temples, not just people in new age cults, not just people in yoga studios, but kids are saying it every time they go, mom. It's even in mom, which is quite beautiful. So we're going to do the alme for a little while and to get us started, I'm just going to light some incense here and pass it around. So I don't know what the floor is like here, so probably don't drop the burning incense on anything flammable. But if somebody could, if some folks, I need three people to come up and just start passing this around. Wow. Thanks. Did a dog just bark? Here you go. Thank you. You can just go back down and pass it all over the place. Thanks for jumping on us. Wait, no, I've got two more. This is a really good one. My barber gave me this one joke. He said use it at the podcast. Yeah, this one's cool. I can't remember the name of it, man. He told me it's some kind of sap from a tree. You guys probably know what it is. It's not frankincense. Yeah, that's it. Kopal, which is interesting because the name of Krishna is Gopala, one of the names of Krishna. And the other kind of incense that we're passing around comes from Vrindavan in India, which is the birthplace of Krishna. So it's good shit, man. Thank you. There we go. All right, yeah, let's do it now. Oh. Greetings, my sweet friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and thou art listening to a live Duncan Trussell family hour podcast being recorded at the Portland Float Conference. Man, this is what you guys are doing here at this Float Conference is incredible. And I think it's really important, and I'm sure you guys have been talking and bowing to and honoring the creator of the first float tank, John Lilly. And yeah, I love John Lilly a lot. And John Lilly falls in line with a lot of other great inventors in the sense that we use their technology and we take their technology for granted that they brought into the world. But a lot of times we kind of forget the other stuff that they talked about. And John Lilly is a prime example of that. There's some other ones too. Nikola Tesla, for example, is another example of a genius. And both of them have something in common that I quite like, which is both of them claim in some way or another to have been contacted by entities. And what I like about John Lilly and Nikola Tesla is they weren't afraid to use that word entity. They weren't afraid to talk about what was happening to them inside those. He wasn't afraid to talk about what was happening to him when he was taking psychedelics and floating. How many of you guys know that story about what happened to him in the tank? Clap if you know that story about. We live in a time now where some of the smartest people on earth, Elon Musk being one of them, are talking about the dangers of artificial intelligence. How recently with the scary shit that's going on in North Korea, Elon Musk said that we shouldn't be worried about North Korea, but we should instead be thinking about artificial intelligence because it's a thousand times more dangerous than nuclear war. This is Elon Musk. This is one of the smartest people on planet earth saying this and what's really interesting about him saying that is that in 1974, John Lilly made contact with some kind of malevolent entity that he called a machine intelligence. He called it solid, what do you call it? Solid state intelligence. What's the name of it? Solid state intelligence. Some kind of entity that was going to manifest as technology and was going to use human beings to appear on the planet and take over. This was long before Elon Musk started working on solar panels. This was before AOL. This was before Twitter. This is before we had a tweeting president or before we had the emergence of the first emergence of a malevolent AI that I'm aware of, one of the first emergencies, which is these fucking Twitter bots that are creating the impression of a majority that isn't there. All of this was in a weird way predicted by the creator of float tanks. It's amazing to really think about that because I know a lot of people, they say, oh, you know, Lilly later on down the line, he was like shooting too much ketamine and he lost his mind. And yet he predicted one of the great problems that we are facing as a species today, which is that this technology that is coming through us has such great potential to transform the world in a beautiful way. And yet, and yet it has an equal potential to completely destroy the entire planet. Now, I'm sorry, I don't mean to start off on such a negative note, but I think if there was ever a time to talk about how important what you guys are doing is, it's at a float conference, right? It's to emphasize what you're doing. Maybe I don't think any of you have forgotten it, but this technology that you are allowing so many people to have access to is a transformative technology. It's a transformative technology that is going to and has allowed so many people to get outside of their limited conceptualization of what life is and what they think the universe is. And to overcome the boundaries that this paradigm that we're in right now wraps around our fucking brains. It's showing people there is so much more to this universe than what you can see and what you can feel and what you can hear. Now, the first time I took psychedelics in a float tank was actually the last time I took psychedelics in a float tank. And I had this wonderful, for a while, I had this wonderful Zen tent created by Shane Stott, a beautiful, beautiful thing, man. And I had it in my house. He came and helped me set it up. And I was really excited about it, you know, because suddenly I had this whole in the universe sitting right next to my podcast studio. So I could just go climb into this thing and vanish in the time. And of course, I was thinking, man, I'm going to eat some fucking mushrooms and go in there. And I'm going to contact entities and I'm going to get the transmission. So I did it, ate some mushrooms, just joking cop. I didn't really do that. For those of you listening, there's a police officer in the audience disguised as a hippie. I could see right through you, man. So I ate these mushrooms, went into the float tank, just floating in the tank. And it was beautiful for a second. And then the mushrooms very clearly started talking to me, I guess you could say, in the way that they do. And they said, why don't you go outside, man? This is dumb. What are you doing? Why are you laying in a dark pool of salt water when you can be under a tree or looking at birds? That's the first time I attempted to add something to the floating experience. The second time I attempted to add something to the floating experiment experience, it was a bigger project, because there's something called the overview effect, which is, I think it's called the overview effect. It's when astronauts see the earth from space and they're floating there. That's what it's called, right, you guys? Yeah, the overview. Okay. So it's this profound moment where you look down and you see the flat earth, and you're like, it was all a lie, man. They tricked me. It's this thing where you look and you see, you know, this beautiful planet that we're all living on and how precious it is. And it's an intelligence and it's a divine intelligence. And it is the mother and we're all part of it. And it's our responsibility to make sure that this planet is kept alive and beautiful and all these poor fucking animals that can't do anything to stop the industrialists and all the pain and stuff. You see it all, you see it all and you love it and it changes you forever. So I thought, shit, well, probably not going to go into space in this incarnation, but maybe I can create the overview effect by putting on virtual reality goggles in a float tank where I was looking down on planet earth. So we, and anyone here who wants to try that, do it, go for it, try it. It's all yours. Maybe you can make it work. But what happened is... So we get, we spent a lot of time with this, man. We built a, we built a simulation of floating in space. We like waterproofed some VR goggles, strapped them on, very excited, went in the tank, floated there. And then like within a few seconds, the fucking thing fogged up and it's like, and it's heavy, you know, you got this heavy thing strapped to your head. And you know, I'm not afraid to say it. If John Lilly can talk about entities, then I can say that float tanks, they talk, they'll talk to you. They have a conversation with you. And the float tank said to me, what are you doing, man? Take that fucking thing off your head. It didn't say fucking, but it was like, this isn't, you're trying to add something. You're trying to add something. And that's what humans do. You know, we want to add, we want to add something to, to something that maybe doesn't need anything added on to it. Because when you're floating and finally you get to experience darkness, which is such a precious thing. And I think that the, when people first were talking about these beautiful devices, they were calling them isolation tanks or sensory deprivation chambers. And I think that's an indication of how absolutely crazy our society is to say that if we take away light and if we float in this beautiful body temperature water that somehow we're depriving our senses, when the float tank shows us, this is all you need. Nothing. This is all you need. In this darkness is everything. In this darkness is the earth, is planet earth, is the overview effect, is the overview effect not of the planet, but of everything. Because it's what we all are. And so it's a healing technology that you guys are offering people when you bring them into the tank for the first time. And it's a transformative technology. And I think the reason so many of you, when I've gotten to talk to you, seem so fucking cool is because as all transformative technologies, people who work with them are also transformed. This is something really hilarious. If you look up on the DEA website about LSD, you know what I'm talking about, man. One of the fascinating things I read about it, you know, it's kind of like a frustrated note about LSD distribution chains is that an LSD distribution chain, when it breaks down, because as people begin to sell LSD, they're taking LSD. And the more you take LSD, the more you're like, why am I selling this, man? I should give it away. And so the thing melts down on itself, because the technology that is LSD, it begins to transform the people who are utilizing it and giving it to other people. And I think the float tank, floating is the same way. And the more that you guys heal people in this way, the more you have to, I would suggest, you should be open to the possibility that John Lilly didn't do too much ketamine, that John Lilly was tuning into something very, very real, which is that we live in a living universe, and that this living universe has the desire right now to transform us and to transform us in a way that we aren't machines, that we don't turn into robots, that we don't turn into Twitter bots, that we don't turn into people who only say what we think we're supposed to say and only parrot what other people tell us is the right thing to say. And I think that the more you open yourself up to that, the more you'll be transformed. And podcasting is a transformative technology. And when I first started podcasting, I was a very different person. Over the course of all these conversations, my life has shifted significantly. And that's what happens, I think, when you're doing something with even the slightest intention of helping the world at all. So today's guest who's here with us today is someone who is one of the people that has radically, just from knowing him, has radically shifted my life, has transformed the way I think about a lot of things, including sex, and he's my, especially sex. But a lot of other things too. And I think he's being transformed by his podcast in such a way that, and that's what we're going to talk about today, is how he's transformed over the course of doing his podcast. And what he's up to right now is pretty incredible because he's gone off the grid. And so I'd really love you guys to give a giant round of applause to our guest today. He is the author, the co-author of an amazing book that you may have heard of called Sex at Dawn. He has an amazing podcast called Tangentially Speaking. Everybody, please open up your heart chakras and send out as much loving energy as you possibly can to today's guest, Chris Ryan. Chris Ryan, it's on. It's on. How you doing? Free floaters. What's up? Chris, I was listening to your last podcast. You're floating, not in tanks now, but you've been on basically a van tour, I guess you would call it. What are you calling it? Vanthropology 2017. That's right. And you've been living in a van and one of the really poignant and incredible things that you are talking about is the joy of swimming in a river. Every morning, yeah, when possible and every afternoon. Yeah, we're sort of cruising around and we were up in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon, Northern California, and you just, the roads go along these beautiful rivers. And normally you're driving along and you look at it and you think, oh, I bet it's nice to swim in that river. But now it's just, fuck it, pull over, find a spot, and jump in. It's fantastic. What was it before you went on the vanthropology tour? When was the last time you swam in a river? Oh, good question. I don't know. I'd have to think about that. I mean, I just, that's how you can tell how fucked up you are. Like if you want to figure out how fucked up you are, just ask yourself, when was the last time you swam in a river? Yeah. And if it's like more than a few months, you're fucked up. Yeah. Or do you know what phase the moon is in right now? You know, when I'm living in a city, I never know. When I'm out on the road, I always know. What phase is it in? It's, it was full about a week ago. Yeah. So that's, that ain't a phase. It's a week past full. It's like a cosmology term. Oh, it's in the phase full about a week ago. It's waning. It's waning. Oh, it's waning. Is that what they call it? Yeah. Waxing and waning. Okay. But don't they have different names for this? Isn't it like it's like quarter? What do you want to know? The phase? What? Oh, it's waning gibbous. Gibbous. Yeah. Right on the tip of my tongue. Yeah. Waning gibbous moon. Yeah, I think that's where it is now. It's I gotta, I have to learn the phase of the moon, not only because it connects you to nature, because it makes you sound like a black metal rock star waning gibbous. Yeah. Well, yeah. So I don't know about this though. I don't know if I want to know all these terminologies, because getting into your technology thing, like I think I don't know a lot of constellations. I only know the big dipper and maybe Orion's belt. I think that's about it. And I wonder what's it like? I look at the sky at night and I see just a shitload of stars. I don't know. I want to trade that for Oh, there's a blah, blah, and there's blah, blah, blah. It's a different way of seeing things, right, which gets into technology and we start naming things, then we see them differently. I mean, yes, not to knock any astronomers, you might be in the crowd, but no, certainly, like when you're like laying in the sand of, let's say, I don't know, the playa burning man, and you're gazing up at the stars, and your eyes are, your eyes are blacker than the night. And you're gazing up the stars. What thing you don't want is for someone to be like, there's the, there's Orion's belt, the sea of Pleiades. No, I know what you mean. And ignorance helps in a way. It keeps you open. There's an innocence and a genius to ignorance, I think, which I'm trying to preserve as much as possible. Ah, I think you're doing a good job, man. You're, I mean that in the most, for real, I think it's a real, that's what you represent to me is this enlightened sage who is like, because you know, I've been, when we first met. Yeah, that's before you had your PhD. What? That's before you had your PhD. Yeah, right. For those of you who don't know, because Chris used to have PhD next to his Twitter name, I realized like, oh, fuck, anyone can put PhD there. He stole, he stole my PhD is what he did. I put PhD next to mine. And then it's great because like, occasionally people who are mad about something you tweeted will be like, what kind of fucking doctor are you, man? Yeah, man. But when I first met you, you, you, you fall into a, I guess you fall into a class of person that I get to make contact with through the podcast occasionally. You're a traveler and you're somebody who has somehow avoided being completely tied down to a single place. You're a traveler. You, when I first met you, you were traveling. Your travels seem to be, if anything, you seem to be becoming, becoming even more disconnected in some way. I know you have a place into paying. I don't mean disconnected in a bad way, but it feels like from listening to you talk about these experiences out on the road, that you're being drawn deeper and deeper into a lifestyle that I don't even think a lot of people are aware of as an option for them. Or at least it doesn't seem to be a realistic option if you find yourself knee deep in kids and a job and a marriage and a thing and the stuff and the, to like go and travel around in a van. I mean, isn't that, in fact, we live in a society where that is made fun of, right? There's a meme van down by the river, right? Right. But there's a, there's a counter meme now, which is this sort of glamour of like modern nomadism. And like there was a big article some of you may have seen in the New Yorker six months ago about a couple that travel around in their van and it's glamourizing it and it's cool. And I mean, in their case, it was kind of funny because they make, they finance their trip with their Instagram page because they've got so many followers, then they do product placements and they're branding and they're sponsored by this van company and they've got all this stuff. So it's sort of tied into the whole commercial thing, even though it's a counter example in some ways. Do you think that's bad? I don't have any moral judgment about it. No, I mean, I think people do what they need to do. Like in my podcast, I don't have any ads, but it's not a moral judgment. It's just that I felt weird selling underwear, you know, because a lot of what I talk about on the podcast is don't wear underwear and I made him spit. I made a comedian spit, ladies and gentlemen. It's a high point of my life. Yeah. Man, that's nuts. Why don't you, why don't you think we should wear underwear? Go commando. When I was 11 years old, my kung fu teacher told me never wear underwear and always sleep in the nude. And he's in jail now, right? You know, do you remember? I told you this story on Joe Rogan's. He killed his father. This was before he killed his father. Yeah. But now I'm going to make him cry. Just watch. Do you think he killed his father because he walked in on him? He's wearing underwear while he was sleeping. It's too tight. That's too tight. No, it was a, it was a strange thing. Yeah. His father was abusing his mother and they got into a fight and it was this big thing. Wow. Yeah. That was when I, I told that story on Joe Rogan's podcast. One of the first times I was on, maybe the first time. And that was, I got a sense for the power of that podcast because a day later I got an email from a guy who said, yeah, I heard you talking about this thing and I was the prosecuting attorney in that county. And, you know, here that you've missed this date or this, whatever. And it's like, how many fucking people are listening to this podcast, right? That the prosecuting attorney from 1974 in Western Pennsylvania happened to be one of them. That is one of the things I try to keep out of my mind completely during a podcast because when you start thinking about that, you can go absolutely nuts, especially Rogan's podcast where you're like, there's, if there is an Illuminati, probably like two of them are listening to this shit, probably. You know, so like there is that thing. Yeah. While they work out. While they swing kettlebells inside a pyramid or something. Yeah, man. It's, it's, it's, it's interesting. It is weird. Do you get this thing, like when you're at a sporting event in a stadium and you look around and you're like, okay, this is 70,000 people. This is what 70,000 people, like my podcast, I get around 80 to 100,000 downloads per episode. Yeah. And sometimes, like I was at the Rose Bowl and it's like, that's 50,000 people. Yeah. You know what I try to do? I always refer to the, there's a verse from the Bhagavad Gita, which is you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. So it's like with a podcast, if you get caught up in that, which I know what you're saying, and sometimes I have thought that, then you could, what'll happen is you'll start changing what you're talking about on the podcast. You start getting super concerned because of this imaginary number. Who fucking knows what the number is? It really doesn't matter. Like the, the, the, the, we have to only stay in the moment, you know? Well, that's the beauty of it because on one side, there's this huge, like crazy abstraction. But I mean, I did your podcast, first time I ever did a podcast, first time I ever heard of a podcast was Duncan reached out to me and invited me to be on his podcast. And I was like, what the fuck's a podcast? And who the fuck is Duncan? And, but I was living in Spain, and I was going to be in LA visiting my parents. And so I agreed to do it. And I thought, okay, I'm going to some studio because sex, it on had come out a year earlier or something. I was doing a lot of media or whatever. And I went to the address expecting it to be a studio. And it was Duncan's house. And I walked in and there were two chairs and a table and some Mike set up and Duncan said, you want to get high? No, no, thanks. You want some mushrooms? No, no, thanks. You want a beer? All right, I'll have a beer. And, and then it's like, okay, push the button. We talked. And that was it. And then we went out and had dinner. That's right. Yeah, it was amazing. And I was like, that, that's a podcast. Wow. Yeah, I love it, man. It's so simple. Well, it's humanizing, right? I mean, that's, that's the idea is, I think, we, you know, hopefully we're there, there was a time when people didn't have access to this technology. And, and that was the time where people develop these like famous personalities and like these insane ideas of there being some kind of wall between them and everybody else based on their being famous or something like that. And it's really gross. Some people are still like that. Like some people are all fucking puffed up and they think that there is some difference between them and other people. And I think what one of the beautiful things about podcasting is it's allowed a venue for us to like, to be human, you know, like my favorite comedian is Doug Stanhope. Sure. And the reason he's I love him so much is because he's an exorcist, because he's completely honest. And when you go and see him, he's purely bellowing out exactly who he is. Yeah. And the thing that he is on paper, you might not be like, that's the healthiest thing to be. It's like, you know, but it, but because of his pure honesty and his incredible talent and how fucking funny he is, you realize like that is the thing to be. This is something that Ram Dass talks about that I love a lot, which is that we have to honor our incarnation. Have you ever heard that before? No. So it's like, the idea is you start getting into spirituality and or, you know, whatever spirituality, mindfulness, consciousness, whatever they call it. And you start thinking, I was just talking to someone, maybe he's here last night, I was talking to him. And he was telling me how he'd gone on a hike. I don't know exactly which mountain he'd gone to the top of here. And he was looking out and it was just beautiful. It was just spellbindingly beautiful. And he felt so good. And then within a few sentences, like, yeah, but you know, I got to start meditating, man. It's like, you are met it. That is it. Like the few we always have this idea of who we should be if we were good, right? And who we should be if we were okay. And the problem with TV in the past is corporations present this idea of what a healthy human looks like, right? They're not there. They're in shape. They're symmetrical. Generally, if they're asymmetrical, they're still like incredibly classically beautiful. And they have a job pickup truck. They have a fucking pig. Yeah, well, they have they usually have like a very expensive Range Rover that they're in debt to the banks for. Usually that's a what a healthy human looks like 26. Yeah, yeah. What is that 21 forever? Is that what that shop is called? Forever 21. Fuck that shop. Forever 21. Are you fucking kidding me? No, thanks. Oh, you mean the age like forever. If you're gonna be if you're gonna be stuck at an age for the rest of your life, what age would you be stuck at? Probably 21. I mean, because you think you're forgetting is like you like I think of it like forever 21 in the sense like it's a vampire. Like somebody turned that person into a vampire when they're 21, but they're really like 300. Right. Okay. So that's when you want to be forever 21 because like it's vampire clothing they sell there. Is that what I guess would make it a lot cooler. I'd probably shop there if it was vampire clothing. But the Yeah, so I know what you mean though, like you don't want to be literally 21 forever completely confused astoundingly like unhappy because you haven't figured out what you're going to do with your life. Yeah, yeah. Although when I was in 21, I was when I was 21, I think that was when I went to prison in Alaska. So maybe that's why I'm what did you go to prison for shoplifting? What did you shoplift a Snickers bar? That is so crazy. How long what was your sentence four days? Memorial Day weekend. That's in May, right? I was getting Memorial Day and Labor Day way. Yeah, it was a Thursday and my friends and I had been hitchhiking from Skagway up through the Yukon and across to Fairbanks. So we'd been, you know, camping for 10 days or something and we got there and it's a long story. But we basically two of us went to the grocery store because the one guy wanted to call his girlfriend. And while we waited for a guy to get off the payphone, we walked around pretending we were shopping and I ate a Snickers bar and we got caught. And one thing led to another. And so we were in this medium security prison for four days waiting for the magistrate to come in on Tuesday. Were you wearing underwear? No. I was not. It's funny you mentioned that because what we did, I wasn't, I went to prison with no underwear and I was 21. We, not only was I now wearing underwear, I was wearing shorts. Whoa, shit. Yeah, because what happened was, how short? Short. This was the 80s, you know. There's before the surfer shorts came in. Wow. Yeah. So what happened was we, the three of us had been hitchhiking and it was me, a dude from Telluride named Rob and his buddy Brent, who was a black Mormon who had been adopted by Mormon cattle ranchers at birth. So anyway, those two were traveling together. I sort of hitched up with them. We got a ride. And so we got to Fairbanks. The first place we went was this laundromat because in Alaska, some of you are from Alaska, I imagine the laundromats have showers and they're like kind of set up for travelers to like go in and clean up and everything. And so we went to this laundromat. We put all our clothes in the washing machine because we, everything we had stank, you know, or stunk. I'm not sure the grammar there. Right, both. Probably both. Yeah. So we put everything in. So all three of us were wearing a jacket with no shirt and shorts with no underwear and boots with no socks because everything's in the washer. And then we went over and got arrested and four days later got out. Wow. So you, what, two of us, the other guy was in the laundromat like, where the fuck are they? Actually, we called from the prison. We got our one call and we called the laundromat. And we were like, is there a dude has been sitting there for about four hours looking nervous? Like, yeah, you buddy, get over here. Where the fuck are you guys? We're in prison, man. Did you run into trouble in prison? Anybody fuck with you? What happened was when they did the intake, the dude who did the intake looked at the report and my buddy Rob from Telluride had drunk a kefir, this liquid yogurt shit, which I had never even heard of. Anyway, so he looked on the report and it's like Snickers bar in a kefir. Are you fucking kidding me? And this cop brought you in in handcuffs. And it's like, guy was an asshole, you know. And so I had some pie, I had a pipe and a little weed and which wasn't illegal at the time, but didn't predispose the cop to like me much. And wait, I thought, how is it in Alaska that weed was not illegal? Yeah, weed in the early 80s, you could have up to four plants in Alaska. Yeah, as an adult and you could carry up to an ounce legally. Anyway, so the guy was doing the intake and I said, like, I'm never going to see that pipe again, right? And he's like, yeah, probably not. I said, and I'm never going to see that weed. I don't even know if there is weed there. And he's like, Oh, because basically what I was saying is like, if you want the weed, take it, you know, and so we sort of build a nice rapport. And he said, look, I'm not going to put you guys in with the general population. I'm going to put you in on cots in the gym. Nice. And you just stick together and you'll be fine. And we we stayed together. And actually, it was a really valuable experience for me, because I mean, you see those doors close. And it's like, you know, nobody gives a fuck who your daddy is, you know, nobody cares you went to college or you're smart or you know a lot about Ralph Waldo fucking Emerson, which is, you know, what I knew about it at the time. So yeah, it was an interesting experience. And I remember this one guy, like the sort of guy I imagined that I was most scared of, like a big black dude was in there for, you know, murder or something, putting his arm around me and saying, you're going to be all right, little man, you're going to be all right, Snickers. That's what I'm going to call you now, Snickers, my friend. And we had the conversation like, do we lie about what we're in for in order to scare people away for a few days? Or do we come clean? Right. And we decided when I'm in trouble, I always tell the truth only when I'm in trouble. And so we told the truth and people just thought it was hilarious. I bet. Yeah, I mean, you know, that thing that you're talking about, the doors closing. Have you read this book, the gulag archipelago that Jordan Peterson talks about all the time? There's Schultz and Eatzen. Yes. I'm so glad you could pronounce his name, because I was just going to say gulag archipelago and skip over the author. But he taught there's a description in there about arrest, what it's like to be arrested. And how the moment you're arrested, this basically a chasm opens up between you and the world that you used to be a part of. And that chasm just it gets to a point where you're gone, you're gone, you are gone. And this is why, you know, this is something that just fucking pisses me off, man, when Jeff Sessions is like sending out letters to people or to sending out letters saying that we should start enforcing the mandatory minimum prison sentences. And this is something that I think is so haunting right now. You know, you're fine. You were fine. You made a friend in there. You got a free Snickers bar. You shoplifted the right way by putting it in your stomach. They couldn't get it out. But one of the haunting things that like really gets to me is how all of us are kind of programmed to ignore the fact that our prisons are filled up with people, some of them who did just take a Snickers bar, many of them who just had some mushrooms or, you know, I know someone who a few years ago got busted with mushrooms. And it's really, it's really fucking scary, you know, and like how his attorney told him, yeah, you know, if they want to, they can put you in jail for 20 years for this 20 years. Think about that. The next time you're like joking about it or talking about it on the phone with people or whatever, really think about that. Man, I'm being a bummer fucking watch out. You know, seriously, because it, you know, this is the thing that like really gets to me because as a society, we ignore the fact that our prisons are filled up with all of these sweet Snickers. There's so many Snickers right now. So many people in there right now who did nothing at all, you know, nothing at all. What's interesting that, you know, one of the things I talk about a lot on my podcast and you do as well is consciousness and sacred plants and, you know, the healing potential of psychedelics and all this. And it's so interesting that every culture that's ever had access to these substances has seen them as the greatest gift of the gods. The greatest thing that the gods have bestowed upon humanity was this piety or these mushrooms or in Africa, this dance that helps you enter a trance, right? The musical forms in Africa. And here we are in this weird aberration, the one society where you go to prison for longer, for having a significant quantity of hallucinogens than if you had killed someone. Right. Minimum mandatory sentences for second degree murder are less than they are for like a pound of mushrooms. It's what does that say? Every society saying this is great, except there's one society that says we'll put you in a cage for the rest of your life. To me, what that says is those societies value truth. This society is terrified of truth. Wow. But let's talk about floating. You know what I saw the first time I floated? Hold on. Wait, we're not going to fucking talk about floating. He didn't want to. He's a cop. Wait, that guy. Hold on. We'll get to, we'll get to floating before we dive into that. I want to talk about, I want to talk about this idea of truth. If you're saying that this, our society, doesn't want us to contact this truth, what is that truth? What is it telling us? What is the message that we're getting from mushrooms, from LSD, from ayahuasca? What is the message that we're getting that this society that we're in right now doesn't want us to have? Well, I think, you know, you can look at an intermediary level and say it's about valuing the integrity of nature over an open-pit mind. It's about valuing relationships and sensuality over ambition and acquisition of material things, those sorts of things. I mean, there are a lot of examples of that, right? You know, love over possession, you know, all these kinds of things. But I think on a more profound level, what those substances have shown me and I think show a lot of people is the deepest truth is that there are many truths. And so doubt is sort of the only thing you should really ever be certain of and that the culture's values, that the culture is so insistent on instilling in you, you start to question them. So I think it's not that these substances or physical travel, which I consider to be very similar to, you know, tripping, that's why I guess we call it tripping, is it shows you what Joseph Campbell, the mythologist, called detribalization, where you recognize that you're part of a tribe and then it's like, oh, wait, I'm in a tribe. So all the shit that I think is true is just what my tribe says. I just speak that language. So then you get out and you start looking back from another place where you see multiple truths in multiple worlds. And then you're in a whole different way of thinking so that when your government says, you know, pledge allegiance, motherfucker, you're like, to what? You know, go fight this war for whom? Yeah. So I think it's critical thinking is basically what the substance is instill in a strange way. And this idea is an idea I think about quite a bit because the implication of what you're saying is that there is a conspiracy that is so dark. It's so dark that you could almost just as a form of laziness call it Luciferianism, not to insult Lucifer. Actually, I don't want to pry isn't Luciferianism because Lucifer was a rebel angel. But it's like this idea is so incredibly dark. And this is where, you know, I think that there's a lot of walls that have been built inside of us, a lot of walls that we're not supposed to cross if we are going to be productive members of American society. Right. And one of the walls is this wall that you're talking about. Because the question is, who fucking built this wall? Who built this wall between us and these substances? You know, who is it? Is it Jeff Sessions? Is there and I would love to know your thoughts on this. Do you think there's an organized cobble of people who are like, we can't let them take mushrooms or they'll realize that we're lizards? Do you think that? Maybe not lizards, maybe assholes. Okay, right. Yeah, lizards are cool. You know, I think... I don't mean to diss lizards or Lucifer here, man, but who's behind it, man? I mean, it's like a real problem. Who's behind it? Who's engineered it? Again, I think there are different levels. So you can look at it, if you want to look at it as a conspiracy, I think there's plenty of evidence for that. So you look at Harry Anselinger, for example, who was the head of the division of the government that was responsible for enforcing the laws and prohibition against alcohol distribution. So then the whatever amendment it was that made alcohol legal again was passed. And then he was like, oh, shit, now this whole division of the government is going to be liquidated. I'm going to lose a job. Everyone's going to lose their job. We need to find something else to prohibit. So what's it going to be? Well, blacks and Mexicans are using this marijuana stuff. So let's drum up a lot of hysteria against that so we won't lose our jobs. So that's the origins of the anti-marijuana crusade in the United States. It was all about the flow of money and keeping the money moving. Then you have the example in the Nixon administration where I think it was H.R. Haldeman, who was recently interviewed about this, who some of you might remember was in the cabinet. I don't remember what his position was. But he said, talking about the drug laws, the draconian Nixon war on drugs thing, primarily against hallucinogens and marijuana, he said, we knew that psychedelics and marijuana weren't health hazards, but we needed to isolate and neutralize the people who were protesting the Vietnam War, which was mostly the hippies, and the people who were agitating in the cities, which was the blacks. And those are drugs that those people were using, so we made them illegal so we could throw them in prison, investigate them, wipe them out. He said this in an interview. I don't remember. I mean, look it up online. It's everywhere. You know what I'm talking about? It was like in Vanity Fair or something recently. And so there it is. It's like they know everyone, anyone who looked at marijuana with any seriousness knew damn well it wasn't dangerous. But we're many presidents away from Nixon, and they're still enforcing these insane laws. They're enforcing that against black people, against poor people. See, this is the thing. I mean, I don't know about your friend who got busted with the mushrooms, and it's true that a lot of people at dead shows are getting busted, and there's a lot of bullshit around that. But you could, if you have access to lawyers, you know, I mean, I went to a college where everybody was tripping every weekend. And no, there were never cops there. Well, this is so now we enter into something that's like, even more horrifying, which is that now we have like, where it gets, this is where it gets, this is where my mind really starts fucking spinning, which is that, so this country is built on slavery, we all know that. And slavery ends except in the prisons. Because in the prisons, people have to work. There's, there's, you have to work. There's work. So a lot of like, I guess license plates really do get made in prisons. Lots of shit. Live free or die. Live free or die. Yes. New Hampshire slogan on the license plates. If you if you really want your fucking head to spin, think about this. Our attorney general from Alabama wants to start enforcing mandatory minimums again. For those of you don't know what that is. That means that if you get pulled over and you've got some ass in your pocket, you will go to jail for five years. There is a five year mandatory minimum. The judge cannot not send you to jail. Yes, you're going to jail. So when you think about the statistics, which is that, yeah, more than likely it's, you're not going to jail if you're white. If you're not going to get busted, you're not going to get pulled over. But if you're black, you're going. And when you're in prison, you're going to have to do slave labor. So if you really want your fucking head to spin, think about that. A fucking attorney general from Alabama has figured out a way to make slavery happen again. That's spooky, man. That's spooky. And that's really happening right now. And this is a thing where I wanted to ask you, because when I might start spinning like that, I start feeling hopeless, Chris Ryan. So, you know, another example is I was just in the airport and like going through TSA, thick fucking security, it's getting worse. They're getting worse about it now. Like they're getting more intense, more scrutinizing, more like authoritarian. And there was a period with the TSA where they would try to be sweet. They're not doing that anymore. And as I was walking into the fucking TSA, there's like these like hardcore thuggish looking fucking cops, you know, packing heat, looking at all of us, tourists, kids, old ladies, no one there is going to hurt anybody, right? And we're being fucking processed. Our shit's being rifled through. And we accept it. We're just like, yeah, this is what it's like now. We just, our shit gets rifled through now. We just get rifled through and we want to travel. And I had this very hopeless feeling. I thought, how does this get better? When does this change? Can this change? Is there anything that could be done to make this go away? What do you think? You want me to say this publicly? Yes. Well, you know, I've lived in Europe most of my life, right? And I think one of the things that's interesting in Europe is that the memory of fascism is fresh, relatively. There are lots of people who remember when Spain was like that, right? Franco died in the 70s, late 70s. World War II, you know, Spanish Civil War, it's recent. So I think there's like a vigilance in people there, not to let shit go that way. Right. Again, that is lacking in the US. There's a lot of like, you know, I've been driving around in Idaho and, you know, there's all these signs, you know, all this like political sloganeering and stuff. But I think, you know, most of these yahoos in the mountains with their AR-15s, if the shit gets bad, then, you know, they're not serious. They're not going to be shooting at military vehicles. I think Americans are so out of touch with war because all the war, and we're an incredibly war-like culture, but we export it. We send the soldiers off and then we ignore them when they get back. We've been at war, the 80% of American history, we've been at war. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and that's, I mean, I don't know, probably 100% if you really look at it. But anyway, I mean, what can be done? I think that one of, what we're doing here is actually what can be done. I think we're using podcasts, you guys are using float tanks, other people are using ayahuasca and sacred substances or meditation or all these different techniques to free your mind and your heart and your ability to communicate with other people. I think that's where revolution really happens. You know, the revolution of the bombs in the street and the fires and the kind of public screaming sirens, I feel like that, you know, it's meet the new boss, same as the old boss shit, you know, it's the some other power just takes over and plays the same game. Right. The only way to have a real revolution, you know, they say think globally, act locally, I would take that act personally. You have a revolution in your life, in your heart, in your marriage, in your friendships, and hopefully that ripples out and becomes a better world. That's all I got. You had that revolution, you've had that revolution inside of you? I think that I never signed on to modernity in the first place. Right. Like, I was retired the day I finished college, you know. I've never really plugged in to, I haven't had a job since the 90s. So you, yeah, this is, yeah, right. So, but what about people who have had the job and people who are, you know, firmly solidified inside of the system? I think they're feeling it. You know, there's this line that we quote in sex at dawn from Arthur Miller, the playwright, who says an era can be considered over when its basic illusions have been exhausted. Wow. Right. And I think you look at the world we're living in now, especially those of you who are, you know, over 35 or 40 who have some perspective on this. If you look back, you know, 20 years, all these institutions were respected. The church, this is before the whole priest sex abuse scandal came out. The church was still respected. Wall Street was a conservative place where you could park your money and not have to worry about it. You know, the banking sector was like safe and conservative. You know, take whatever sports, the president, the politics. Yeah, of course, that's the worst. Remember that the president used to be like, that was like a respected position. Yeah. Anyway, all these institutions are just collapsing. Yeah. And so I think that a lot of people are saying this doesn't fucking work anymore. Right. Right. People are saying, oh, I'm going to have less money than my parents. Well, when did that, when did that turn? Right. It used to be it was getting better and better. Now nobody thinks it's getting better and better, you know, the climate change and whatever. So I think a lot of people, I think we're at this really exciting, heartbreaking, fascinating moment where, where a lot of people are looking for alternatives. And I think that explains why podcasts are taking off. Because, you know, the technology's there. But the beauty of it is you do a podcast, you click a few buttons, it goes out to however many thousands of people are listening to it. There's no company in between. There's no studio executive. There's no money man. There's no, it's just you talking to whomever's listening. And so there's a level of truth and authenticity that can happen there that I think is fucking revolutionary. I think it's as revolutionary as the printing press. Yeah. Well, okay. So like, yeah, it's an example of technology working for us. But just in a real from a real world perspective, because you, you have been, you're one of the most free people that I know. Most people I know don't swim in rivers. Most people I know don't travel around in vans. Most people I know are localized. Most people I know are deeply intertwined with the grid. So as someone out there, to those of us in here, I mean, surely starting a podcast is not the answer, right? I'm looking, I'm what I want from you. I want the fucking answer, Ryan. I want you to help us, man. I want you to help us. Like, what, what, what can we do? What are some real things we can do to experience this kind of revolution that you're talking about that happens inside first? What can we do, those of us who haven't had that revolution? What are some tricks, some tips, some ways that maybe we can end up floating down, it's floating naked down a river, stop not wearing underwear, fucking, how can we start shoplifting Snickers? Yeah, see, I don't, one of my favorite quotes is, is respect those who seek the truth, fear those who claim to have found it. So I don't claim to have found any truth. And so I'm very hesitant to, you know, give people advice. You know, people I don't know, especially, but my feeling is my friend Aaron and I were talking about this the other day. There are, there are things that you do in life that you become accustomed to really quickly. And there are other things you do in life that you'll never get accustomed to. So working in a cubicle under fluorescent lights, you can do it every day, but it'll never feel right. Whereas staring into a campfire at night, it feels right immediately. And, you know, after a week or two of that, you check into the Hilton Hotel down here, and it's like, this sucks, right? You know, it's loud, you can't open the windows, where's the fire? You know, where's the stream? Where's the sound of the birds and the wind going through the pine trees? So I think that there's a guide there. There's like, for me anyway, there's a, there's a navigational device where, where you, like for example, a couple of weeks ago, I went to North Carolina to interview, to have some people on the podcast who are building a community there. And so they've got animals and they grow their own food. And, and they're really interesting people because one of the sort of triggers for the, for the coming together of this community was a very tragic death that happened about a year ago. Two, actually, they happened, one was a surprise and one they saw coming. And, and those deaths have given a lot of meaning to this group of people and what they're trying to do together. And anyway, the point is, there are like 20 people living there and every one of those people was so fucking authentic. Just no bullshit at all, you know. And I was only there four or five days, I think. And then when I left and went to the airport and, you know, started dealing with normal shit, I suddenly, I was aware of how clean that was there. It's as if I'd been drinking clean water. And when you're drinking clean water, you don't go like, wow, that's some clean water. You know, but you notice then when you go back to the fucking Gatorade, right, that this doesn't taste right, right? You know. And so I think that's for me, that's, that's the guide, like things that I sort of fit into really quickly and easily. And they, you know, I try to follow that. And that I don't know, that's all I got. Yeah, no, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. I think a lot of us are afraid to follow that. You know, and I like, I, you know, one of the things, whenever I get around you, and when I listen to your podcast, and I hear the, the song that you sing, the theme song, yeah, the theme song by Carsey Blanton, I don't mean literally your theme song. I had the theme song of your podcast. Okay, whenever I listen to the theme song of your podcast, I just want to make mail bombs and send them to people. Okay, but this is the theme song is cool. To finish your point, we'll get to the theme song. I mean, your song, the song of Chris Ryan, that's in Sex at Dawn, your song. Whenever I hear this song, there's like, actually, in the mythology of Krishna, there's something, you know about the Rosalila, you must know about the Rosalila. Oh, cool. I get to tell you about the Rosalila. You'll like this. So the Rosalila, what happens is, in this mythology, Krishna goes out into the forest and starts playing his flute. And there's in the villages, the gopes, as they're called, the women are there, and they hear Krishna's flute. And as the, you know, and this is written in really beautiful poetry, but they basically leave, they leave the lantern burning, and they go into the clearing to find God, because they hear this song, and they leave everything behind because the song is just so beautiful that whatever they thought was important ceases to be important and like 100 of them gather in this clearing. And then Krishna divides himself into 100 different Krishnas, transforms into the ultimate lover for each of these people, like their soulmate, essentially, and they, well, they do it out there, man. They make love in this clearing, and what could be more ecstatic than making love with God? You know, what could be, what could be better than that? And so when I hear the song that you sing, it scares me because I think, God, you know, man, really, I could just do that. I could just let go of everything, invest all my money into like a van, and just like go, go, go, just get out, just go out into the wilderness. And it's really scary. There's a piece of me that like wants to do that very badly, but there's another piece that's clinging to the world that like feels there's got to be this one way to live. And, but if all of us start doing what you're doing, what would society look like if everybody heads out? If everyone listens to you and they're like, you know what, this is fucking stupid. Not only am I going to sit in front of a fucking campfire, I'm going to make the campfire out of my goddamn cubicle, and I'm going to fucking warm my hands on the fires of my old life in the woods. If everyone did that, what would happen to the world? Wouldn't everything collapse? A lot of the bullshit would collapse. Yeah, I mean, think how many jobs that people are doing in cubicles actually really need to be done at all. And then how many of them are going to be done by some fucking algorithm, you know, we're, they're going to be very few jobs left in 20 years because of AI and robotics and all this kind of stuff. And so I think as a society, we need to really seriously look at how are we going to distribute the wealth that's, you know, so far, we're not doing it well. It's all going to the very, very, very top. And, and to me, one of the ultimate ironies and tragedies of modernity is for this book I've been sort of working on, as you may have gleaned from this conversation, I'm not particularly ambitious. So I've been working on a book for about four years now. It was due three years ago and my editors are for some reason very patient about it. And it's called civilized to death. And it'll be out someday. But anyway, one of the things I was looking at in this book is I was looking at this sort of economic question, right? And how and the correlation between happiness and wealth and these kind of things. And what you find in all the research shows it is that people get happier when they go from poverty to about 60 or 70 grand a year per individual, right? But that's, that's basically the level where you've got enough money, you got a place to live. If you get sick, you can pay a doctor, you don't need to worry, your kids are going to starve, you're, you know, you're basically, you have your basic shit covered. After that, there's little, if any, correlation between satisfaction, life satisfaction and income. And actually it gets to a point where there becomes a negative correlation. So to me, the great irony is everybody's chasing money. And a few people are getting a whole lot of it. And they're miserable fucks. So if the winners in this poker game we're playing at the table here are as miserable or more miserable than the losers, then who benefits from this? Right. So I used to look at economics as like a poker game among a bunch of buddies. I, if I won 20 bucks, it means somebody else lost 20 bucks, right? The same amount of money comes and goes. It's a zero sum game. Now I look at it as a poker game at a casino. So now who's the house? Right. Right. Cause we're all losing. Nobody wins at a casino. Right. Even if you win, you lose, you lose it later. Right. So then this gets in, I mean, we don't have a lot of time, but this gets into this sort of deeper conception for me where I started looking at levels of life. And, and so you have the simplest matter, which is inorganic life. And then you have simple life, single cellular, you know, bacterium. And then you have multicellular and then you have, you get up to the most complex forms of life, which I think are social mammals like us, chimps, bonobos, dolphins, maybe insects, some, you know, ant hills and things like that. And then you say, okay, why would it stop there? Right. Right. Of course, we always think we're the ultimate, but the scales continue, right? You know, there's visible light, but there's wavelengths above it and below it. Right. So what's after us? We're made, each of us is made of many billions of microbes that don't share our DNA. Each of us is, you know, we think of you as an individual and me as an individual, but that's all a fiction. We're a system of, of all these different organisms working together. So then what are we embedded within? And that's when I get into super organisms. So we are embedded in these super organisms that we can't see because we're within them. Right. And so the agenda of the super organisms, which are institutions, I think, run counter to ours. So that's why, you know, we say, why are we destroying the earth? Well, we're not really. These super organisms are and they don't give a shit. And so, you know, it's like people will say to me, hey, you know, you're always pissing on oil companies because they're destroying the ocean. They're good people who work at oil companies and there are. Right. There are, but it doesn't matter because people don't run companies. Companies run people. Ugh. You know that the CEO of Exxon could go to Peru and take some ayahuasca and have a fucking epiphany and go in on Monday morning and say, gentlemen, we got to stop this deep water drilling. We can't control it. It's irresponsible. We're destroying the planet. He's out of there by fucking lunchtime. Right. You know, it doesn't matter if there are good people working there. You know, that thing about this is like, I was talking to a friend of mine, it was like, yeah, we've got to get the president to take ayahuasca. And I was thinking like, you know, man, you're rolling the dice on that one. Yeah. He's already unstable. Yeah. Because it's like, I think there is this idea of like, oh, if we give these people to psychedelics, if we get them to float, if we get them to, they're going to like, you know, be like, wow, yeah, I've got to change. But I bet the president of Exxon drinks ayahuasca in somewhere in that experience, he's like, I am God. I am God. And oil is beautiful. We don't know that could happen. But yes, but I what you're saying is, is so crazy, which is that we have essentially become part particles in some kind of malevolent organism that is actively eating planet Earth. Right. So the way I look at it is like we are in a school of salmon that are that we're swimming toward the nets, right. And some of us are going, are those nets up there? Right. Fuck it. I'm going over here. Right. You guys, you want to go into the nets? I don't think you should, but I'm going this way. The other salmon are like, dude, you're too high, man. You're doing too many drugs. There's no nets. Right. So you're asking me like, you know, what's revolution? I think revolution is when enough fish go, I don't want to know. Those are fucking nets. I'm going with them. Right. And we start peeling off. And there's a critical point where one more fish peels off. And then the whole school goes, Oh, fuck it. And we'll go that way. Then they move the nets. Well, then they move the nets, maybe. Yeah. Yeah. It's true. Oh, we got to get the motherfuckers holding the nets, man. Get them hard. That's what we got to do. I mean, I don't know the answer. I love that though. I know what you mean. And I think that like the beauty of what folks here are doing is I think when you go, you don't have to take psychedelics to see the net. I think just floating alone can have that effect. I mean, in your opening bit there, it was really beautiful. You're like, you know, the beauty of floating is you get there. And when you were talking about like adding this, adding that, I was thinking like, I never wanted to do that. I never wanted to get high. I've never even smoked a joint and gone in a tank. I want to go there to strip it down, right? And I'm glad you circled around to that where that's the beauty. You don't need anything. You don't need a fucking screen to keep you interested. You don't need, you know, things beeping and, you know, you can be alone. I had a friend and took her to a float thing and she couldn't last 15 minutes in there. And I felt so bad for her afterwards. You know, so bad you can't be alone in your head for 90 minutes or 60 minutes or 20 minutes. What, what hell is happening in your head? So yeah, I think I think stripping it down to the basics. I mean, the theme song on my podcast is by this beautiful woman, Carcie Blanton. And the song is called Smoke Alarm. And she says, it's like, hey, baby, what's the big deal? Say what you're going to say, feel what you're going to feel, because you're going to die one day. You know, and it's the whole song is like, we're going to die one day. I, you know, I hate to give the end away, but you're going to die one day. And you keep reminding yourself of that. And then all the shit that you're afraid to let go of is like, well, you're going to let go of it anyway, dude. Might as well let go of it now and enjoy the fucking ride rather than clinging to it, you know, to the bitter end. Chris Ryan, everybody! Guys, we have about 20 minutes left. And we've got two microphones here. This is one of my favorite parts of the podcast. I forgot to mention it up front. Any of you guys who have questions for Chris or for me, I'd love it if you would come up to the microphones. We only have 20 minutes to to take questions. So anybody who wants to ask a question, feel free to come up here and ask. Oh, the cop is the first one. So as a cop has been in the force undercover for a long time, and I'm not trying to blow my cover. Do you think that Donald Trump could possibly be the catalyst or the kickback for, you know, what we've experienced as maybe the solution to open people's eyes up to ideology, different ideologues and whatnot? Because it started to kind of, I feel like it's opened people's eyes and broken up a lot of biases that were formed on socio-dynamic. I hope so. I think that could definitely be one of the possible outcomes of this. You know, they say addicts have to hit rock bottom before they start to recover. And if this isn't rock bottom, I don't want to see it. You know, yeah, I hope so. I'm not a political theorist, so I can't say for sure. But it certainly seems, you know, as Duncan pointed out, the presidency is one of those institutions that's lost its... What's the word I'm looking for? It's... Well, it's like my dad says, we must respect the office of the president. Yeah, right. But what if the president doesn't respect the office of the president? Which is the case. Yeah, I don't know. I think he is, I think there is something in him that is divine for sure. He seems to be a, you know, a reflection of our shadow, you know, a reality, a billionaire reality TV star is the president now. And like, I mean, let's face it, if you were running a simulation and you wanted to create the funniest apocalypse, it does seem artistic to be like, all right, they fucking like money and TV. All right, let's make their fucking president be a Frankenstein monster composed of everything that they have become addicted to. And let's see what happens. That's one level. The other level is making the president a catalyst. I always think of Ram Dass and how he has on his Pooja table a picture of the president. And no matter who that president may be, he tries to find compassion there. Because what a fucking heavy incarnation, man, heavy, heavy incarnation to be that stuck in that place, where you're casually, casually suggesting that you might incinerate a country with nuclear fire. Yeah. Yeah. So it's like, if you think about that, how that I mean, like, I'm just thinking the worst thing you ever did when you were super drunk, you know, and you wake up in the morning and you're like, Oh, fuck. Oh, no, I've got to call like seven people and apologize. Think of Trump's morning. When he comes off of the bender that he's on. And he wakes up and it's like, Oh, fuck, I'm president. Oh, shit. Oh, wow, I fucking caused the apocalypse. That's a heavy incarnation. So maybe we can find a place to have some compassion for him or something. And that could be the transformative thing. What do you got? Is that it? No more questions. That's it. No one wants to talk to us. Wow, everyone's depressed. Sorry, we bumped you out. What's your question over here? Yeah, tell us about your your best float experience individually. Okay. Yeah, that's that's cool. I the first time I floated, I don't know that it was my best, but you know, I don't judge them that way. But the first time, I think it might have been in Austin, Texas at Kevin Johnson's place. And if you've been down there, beautiful place. It was, I was lying there and I've tried meditating for years. I've been to the 10 day v post in a retreat. I've done, you know, martial arts with an incorporated meditation. And I've never gotten past the my fucking back hurts stage. You know, my knees hurt, my back hurts, my hips hurt, my neck hurts. And I mean, the 10 day v post in a thing was like a 10 day porn festival in my head. I just that that's all I did. I just sat there and imagined. And it didn't work, you know, unless that's nirvana, which it may be. But the first time I floated, I, I felt like something clicked in. And I got into this meditative state, I got into the thing where it's like, Oh, there's my mind working. Now I observe it, it slows down, it stops. And then whatever I am that's observing it starts to disappear. And then I wake up, but I wasn't asleep. And it's like, wow, that's where I've been trying to get for years and years. And I just got there in 15 minutes. And in part of that process of that sort of watching this weird shit that was happening in my mind, I saw this image of Joe Rogan's face with a halo. And that big shitting grannies got just float right across like the dome of my brain. And I thought that's pretty funny. Dude, that wasn't in your head. Kevin has a projector in the tanks. Like Joe Rogan's face floats across. Cool, man. I, uh, my, my best float experience was like kind of my most pain, painful. It wasn't, it wasn't like euphoric. It was, uh, this was when I had a float take at my house. I was doing it a lot. And, uh, I was starting to have like, uh, it was dislodging memories. And, um, I was starting to have these memories that were long gone. I had this, uh, memory, a photographic memory of this, like, me and my brother as a kid, I was a kid, but me and my brother were like leaving this summer where we were staying with my dad. And this is a horrible story I'm about to tell you, but, uh, I guess there was a little girl there who liked me. I was just a kid and she came up to the car and, uh, and was like, I said something like, I love you. Oh, I hate saying this. I said something like, shut up fatty. Like the worst fucking thing, man. And, and like I was trying to impress my brother and it was just horrible. And so the tank showed me in vivid detail that moment and the look on her face and the way that I felt and the look of my brother's look of disgust as he looked at me and, uh, and it, you know, makes you realize like, oh my god, if that's down there, if I'm that much of an asshole and that that's compressed somewhere underneath my waking experience, how much other stuff is in there? You know, I just went to the dentist and, uh, you know, he floss, he floss, he flosses you and there's a lot of blood and you're, I'm like, is there a lot of blood? There's a lot of blood, right? He's like, yeah, you got to get scaling, dude, because there's like fucking shit in your gums and it's gonna hurt. It's gonna hurt. He said that he's like, it's, it's challenging. And I think for some people like me, that's what the float tank does. It's, it gets into the gums of your psyche and gets in there deep and sometimes there's fucking blood and that's what it gave me. It gave me a moment to like really, really, uh, think about my own potentially aggressive patterns in life that I'm not aware of and help me hopefully be a little kinder because that's all you can really do, you know, because that little girl killed herself and her entire family. I found out. Oh, is your question. That's fantastic. I love that. Thanks. I actually, I'm just very curious. I've been someone who has been very curious to live off the grid most of my life because I have a rather unorthodox upbringing. So I was never really introduced to a lot of stuff that people consider normal now. So my question is when and why did you decide to start living off the grid? And when you did, how did you survive initially? Well, first thing I should say is off the grid is probably an overstatement for how I've lived my life. I mean, I'm not like the unabomber or anything. You know, I travel in airplanes and drive a van and, you know, have a bank account and, you know, a cell phone right there. So I'm not technically off the grid, but off the sort of consumerist corporate kind of treadmill. Yeah, I've been off that. What happened was that year I went to Alaska. I was in college and I had a life plan. I was going to go to Oxford and do a PhD. I had a professor who was going to get me into Oxford. I was going to do a PhD and I was going to teach literature the rest of my life. And the literature that I really loved the most was the American Transcendentalists, who some of you will know, Emerson, Thoreau, Whitman, Melville. And a lot of this stuff is sort of like an indigenous American Buddhism, in a way, if you read them, you know, Thoreau, of course, famously wrote Walden, where he went off and lived in the woods for a year. So that's the stuff I loved. And that's the stuff that I was anticipating teaching for the rest of my life. And I found away a loophole in the student handbook that allowed me to skip my junior year and still graduate on time. So I decided to go to Alaska to see the sort of frontier. I hitchhiked from New York to Alaska and spent the summer up there working in a cannery and doing weird shit and getting arrested. And by the time I was done with that experience, I realized, like, I had met people on the road who picked me up, who took me home, who fed me, who, you know, let me sleep in their daughter's bedroom because she was away in college or something. And they're just so kind and so open-hearted. And, you know, these are people who didn't know, they didn't read a lot of books, they weren't hyper-educated. But they were so welcoming to me and they were so competent. Like, I remember this one guy, like, he had built a house. He had these cool dogs who, like, were really well-trained and loved him. And he had a good relationship with his wife and his kids were cool. And he knew how to fix his car. And it's like, this guy probably didn't graduate high school, but he had so much practical knowledge on how to live a good life. And I was struck by that. And I thought about what would happen to this guy if he stumbled into my world back at university with all my arrogant, genius professor friends. They would have laughed at him. They would have rejected him. And yet, my professor friends were kind of fucking miserable. And that was the path I was on. And so I had this epiphany where it's like, wait a minute, I don't want to be like them. I want to be like that guy. Right? I want to be someone whose life makes sense. And so at that moment, I decided until I'm 30, I won't commit to anything. No marriage, no career, no grad school, no nothing. I'm going to spend my 20s. There's an image I loved from Robert Frost. He says, a poem must, like a piece of ice on a hot stove, a poem must ride its own melting. And I thought, I'm going to ride my melting through my 20s. And then it extended into my 30s and I'm still fucking riding it. I think you may have just answered my question. But since I took the trouble to get up here, I'll ask it anyway. I'm relative to unplugging from the grid or whatever, besides floating, which I think moves us from our mind into our heart. I've always thought that growing your own food, expanding that a little bit, is one of the most revolutionary and radical things that you can do. And I wanted to get your feedback on that. Oh, man, I'm growing tomatoes right now. And I'm growing tomatoes. And you know what? I did a podcast with Dennis McKenna, Terrence McKenna's brother. And he told me, if you wanted the most revolutionary thing you could do is not just growing your own plants, I think he said it's to grow like psychoactive plants, right? But I think maybe he meant growing plants too. And so because of that, I ordered some San Pedro cactus. And I have in my garden three beautiful San Pedro cacti that every single day break the law because they're making mescaline, right? And it's illegal. It's cool. I look at them, there's little chemical laboratories growing in my yard. I'm like, I'm going to eat you. But I won't. I love them. I won't eat them. But but what you're saying is so true, because you when you're watering the plants, you can, I mean, I, I feel like they are thanking you. I feel like they are dancing with the water and that they're communicating with you and that they're just, I think plants dance most of the time. And I think that you're kind of dancing with them. And they like are rewarding you. I bet there's things coming out of them that we don't even, we haven't even identified yet, maybe what McKenna called exo pheromones, like who knows. But so yes, growing food for me is like, you know, how you know what's great is the stuff you remember, right? Like, you know, you don't remember plane rides. You don't really remember plane rides unless they're like really, like unless the plane crashed, you'll remember that one. You don't remember a lot of stuff, the bus ride, you don't remember the taxi rides. You don't remember waiting for the meal. You don't remember most meals. You don't remember much. But I'll tell you, man, I remember almost every time I've watered my tomato plants. That's such a moment. And you want water them long enough, you start hearing the nature spirits. And that's that moves you back again into your heart. Can you talk about that for a second, the nature spirits? What do you mean by that? Rather than watering plants, I'm really into bees. And if you have this incredible flowering plant, where all the honeybees are, are visiting the flower, getting nectar from it, you hear this in incredible buzzing. And I don't think you can have that experience without you. You know that there's there's some entity that they're representing or that they're a part of that makes your heart sing. Yeah. Yeah, man, I love you. That's it, friends. We are out of time. Thank you so much for hanging out with us tonight. A big round of applause for Chris Ryan, everybody. We'll see you at the party. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exclusions Applied

You've been doing big things. You can't do another big thing. No, I haven't, mama. Let me explain, cause let me explain. That'd be good. You told me you wouldn't incarnate anymore. incarnating is how I've learned, mama. Mama, I'm sorry, but I'm addicted to reincarnation. I cannot stop. I like birth and death. I like to witness my own cremation. I like to spell my flesh of burning. It's the way that I've been learning. Time, it is the mirror that God uses to snore your life.

Welcome to you. Welcome, welcome to you. It's the DuncanTrussell Family Hour Podcast Johnny Pemberton. You've tuned in to the Bark Hour. I'm here with Crick's Bark and we're going to talk about his new album, Lady Hamilton's Dream. Yeah, that's right. Lady Hamilton's Dream here on the Bark Hour brought you by Bark's Root Beer. Bark's has bite. The best money for your bunny is going to be a barks with bite. And we're back. Dr. Bark, it is an honor that you're letting me interview you. Oh, just call me Crick. Thank you, Crick. Let's say when I got the phone call from my agent that the Crick Bark wanted me to come on his own show and interview him. I damn near fell out. Well, that's how we do it here. We all live on surprise. Well, I told my agent, you're fucking with me, right? This is another of your damn jokes. He's a joker. He's a joker. Like that time he booked me at that damn chimpanzee farm. Yeah, you thought it was a wellness retreat. That was good. Yeah, that was good. That was good. I did not make a penny from that, of course. And I did fly across the country to go there. Well, you know what they say, a fool you once. Yeah. Well, Wild Chimp did get out that was on sedatives and did mall. Let me correct you there. All chimps are wild. Okay, but you know what I mean. Well, that was a fun time. And I'm learned a lot from it and I'm just recovering from some of the trauma. And I just wanted to, I guess my first question to you is, you got a best selling album that pairs with your best selling book out right now. And I just want to know how you're dealing not just with this incredible success that you've always had. And right when bark reaches a peak, it gets to another peak. But my question to you is, I think as far as I'm aware, this is the first of your books slash albums that has caused riots all over the planet. I'm just wondering how you're dealing with the, with the riots. Well, you know, I'm just dealing with it out. I haven't taken it as it comes. There's nothing I can really do about other people's mess. I just watch them and I know that they say I did it, but incendiary language is something that only happens if it's paired with music. Right. Well, I do want to just read. And again, I'm not trying to interrogate you or anything. I'm a huge lifetime fan. I just want to read just one passage from chapter four of your. Is this Kruble Cub? Kruble Cub. Okay. It's the right and duty of every planetary citizen to stand up and fight against the government, state or power structure surrounding them. Yeah. The tyranny of ancients. I call it the tyranny of ancients. It's not only there, the duty of every global citizen to fight back, but the sacred mission of all souls that have incarnated on the earth plane. And after my accident, I realized that unless the streets ran red with the blood of the authority figures, Christ would not return. I mean, I couldn't have said it better myself because I did say it myself. So that's just how I feel. It's something where we want, we want to get Christ back. If we don't get Christ back here soon, he's going to forget about us. He's going to move on to a different dimension. Job chapter six verse 16 said, he who seeketh a world, not of this, seeketh a pain unbeknownst to the person delivering. And so what that means to me is that if we forget our covenant with the Lord, our God before Jesus Christ, then Jesus Christ, the Savior, the Son of man, the Holy Ghost will take a, take a triplicate triangle, triangle is the most stable object in the world. And it, the reason it's so stable is because it's three points. And that's, that exists in our space, the spatial universe. We don't know about how it exists in other spaces. And so how it works is Father, Son, Holy Ghost will abscond from this planetary reality. Yes. It will set up shop someplace else and we'll be left to, to deal with the, the vacuum that they've created and it will be a vacuum. I want to read, this is a news article from, this is the New York times. Right. And it's dated October 16th. Crick Colt strikes again. A downtown Manhattan parish was attacked by a screaming group of cultists, followers of Dr. Bart Crick. Uh-huh. They held in their hands scythes, knives and burning flags, which they pelted at churchgoers on their way to an evening service. Uh-huh. Two of these churchgoers are currently in the hospital in critical condition. Those are our people. They got that wrong. Those were our people. So your people were attacked by the churchgoers? They set themselves on fire. Those flags were to be dealing with self-immolation. It's a tactic that's been used for thousands of years and it's a tactic that we're very familiar with and have to implement at times the most dire. New York times, I respect them. I used to work for the New York times. I understand their dealings very well and that sometimes they will issue a correction on that. It may take a thousand years, but a correction will be issued. A correction for the emulate? I'm trying to just- A correction will be issued. That is the title of my forthcoming book. A correction will be issued. It's asterisk correction. A correction will be issued. Okay. What that means is that we can say every said such a man or a thing. We can pull out a dilly bar and call it a poo. We can do the opposite. We can lick hard on a chocolate ice cream and say we're giving the baby a kiss. We can tumble down a hill with our clothes on and pretend that we're walking into church. All these things are- You choose your own adventure, so to speak. Okay, I'm going to read another article if I could, just real quick. Again, I'm not here to interrogate you. I'm a big fan of your work. Well, you're not asking any questions and that's what interrogation is. Here's a question. Did you encourage your followers last Thursday to- Dork. Excuse me? Go ahead. Last Thursday, did you encourage your followers to ignite a Halloween ride wagon filled with 13 American toddlers on their way to a pumpkin patch? That's something I don't know anything about. I don't know anything about that. I would never kill a toddler. But you don't know anything. Well, thank God no toddlers were harmed because they were able to get the fire out before it singe their sweet flesh. Last one, I heard that those toddlers had something about them that made them unable to be burned. You mean God protected the toddlers? Oh, I don't know if it was God protecting toddlers. It was something with quite a bit of power. Don't you find it a bit coincidental that there was 13 toddlers? What are they doing out at 10 o'clock at night? Well, they were being taken to a pumpkin patch and it was at 10 a.m. A bunch of- It was 10 a.m. Okay, sure. That was a morning hayride to a pumpkin patch filled with beautiful American toddlers. On a weekday. On a weekday. A weekday at 10 a.m. That's right. Sure, whatever you think happened. But as far as I know, it was closer to midnight. It was 13 toddlers who were all standing upright in a semi-circle off the back of a brown wagon, a large, flat, brown wagon, wider than it was long. For someone who isn't involved in this at all, you seem mighty familiar with the- with the aspects of this incident. I'm very familiar with it because I know- When people come at me with- with blame, I have to be able to defend it best. So we have an army of drones recording everything in the- everything in our dane. Well, that brings me to my next article. This is actually from the LA Times. Crick drone plunges in to baptism ceremony electrocuting pastor and three clergy members in a swimming pool in Beverly Hills. Have you seen those drones that can set fire now with the flamethrower? Yes, I have. That- we didn't develop that. Okay. We were developing a counteract of that, a fire retardant drone. And in the process of that, we were testing it and it happened to- it go into a baptism. This is an errant issue. We've since taken this- we've taken care of this, the private parties. We've talked about this. Everything's been- it's all okay now. We've reached a pact. So that's- You've reached it. It says here a private settlement and also- That's what a pact is. Private settlement. Private settlement. Private settlement. Yes, everything- You settled out of court. Yes. Why would we bring something into maritime law? It doesn't need to be in part of maritime law. It's been two weeks and over the last two weeks, how do you explain the 15 incidents that have been connected to your, for lack of a better word, cult? Ephesians chapter 2 verse 16. Those who would look upon a design and wish to change it would find themselves sooner floating in a river upstream. Hmm. I see. Well, we're- To look upon a design, to find a design, to see the weaving that the weaver weaves is to know the same as the meat that the cleaver cleaves. To catch the whisper that the butterfly spake is to go under the ground six feet on a stake, riding it down, splinters asunder. I'm sorry, I don't mean to cut you off- Cackle, crackle. I just- I noticed there seems to be some kind of powder at the bottom of a drink here, if you- Did you- Ah. Did you- Ah. Did you- I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, God. I just- I don't know. I'm immune to that, I guess, maybe. All right, you're listening to Dr. Barks, Crick Barks, 1000% brought to you by Barks Rupert. We have a little problem here. My guest appears to have fallen asleep. Obviously, he's not getting a good amount of sleep, so we'll be back with a new tale of tomorrow and a remembrance of yesterday here on the Barks Radio Crick Barks Cadillac Frontier. What you just heard was the last recording ever made by the Dr. Crick Barks Radio Frontier show. There are a million things demanding your time. You got to figure out what that lobster-clawed beast is shrieking in your family cemetery, and you've got to drive those witches out of the cathedral on your family's property.

Hey, this is Johnny Pemberton. Wow. So, holy shit man, this Colt is one of the most interesting Colts to me in the sense that it's the craziest Colt. There were riots all over the country. Very powerful too. Very fucking powerful. Able to exercise a lot of control outside their initial network. Yeah. Yeah. They had roots everywhere. They almost took over the United States government. They took over the Chilean government. And Vermont was completely evidently Vermont. The entire legislator was under their command, but it was a secret command. And the president of China was somehow connected to Dr. Crick. This to me is astounding in the sense that the Manson family gets all this fucking press, the Branch Davidians, what were they called? The Northern Tots? No, the Norman Caz. The Norman Caz Collective, the people who disemboweled the fucking French teacher. The French Marisa Conn. Yeah, Marisa Conn. Yeah. Well, she was involved with that Colt. That's how, you know, some say she's a casualty of what they were doing, but also a lot of people think that she was part of it and gave herself willingly as a sacrifice. So we'll never know exactly. At least we think we won't know unless something new is uncovered. Yeah. I've always just seems like murder to me. Yeah, it does. But I mean, if you are helping people murder you, is it murder? I think it's whatever it is, yeah, it's fucked up, whatever it is. I mean, but it was also above the Arctic Circle. So obviously different laws apply there. They were an international water. True. It's something where I'm not trying to be the fucking teacher's pet. I'm not like the school hall monitor for Colt or anything. If you want to get disemboweled by Colt, get disemboweled by Colt. Exactly. You might as stop you. But all these stories, everybody knows you can't walk three feet without seeing another magazine article about one of them or whatever. But the fucking Dr. Crick Bark. This is a cult that almost nobody knows about. Yeah. But no one knows about it. And he worked so closely with Jane Goodall, which is a thing that I think. Crazy. That's why everyone's so hesitant to talk, you know, to lambast him is because he was so instrumental in all that research. And he gave all the credit to Jane, but she gives a lot of credit to him. But that's been buried, evidently. It's been buried. She's tried to distance herself from him. But they say there's still chimpanzees living today that have his brand on their ass. Right. And what that means, evidently, from what I've read is that that that brand on their posterior is indicative of a viral implant in the chimp's brain that causes it to learn at some exceedingly fast rate. It's basically like a plant of the apes type situation, except, I don't know, on a spiritual level. This is the phenomena known as like the Crick Chimp problem that happened where the Crick Chimp's actually began to slaughter some of the other chimps. Well, they were doing and slaughtering them. They were taking their arms off just the left arms of all the other chimps and they were made this some sort of a daisy chain with it and they made it. So the armless chimps destroyed themselves with their own daisy chain of arms. That is now my understanding was that these technologically enhanced chimps went wild and essentially slaughtered a lot of other chimps until they were finally taken out. And it required an actual seal team to get in there and take down those chimps. Only the seal team knows. And we don't have the source that I read about on the internet. Who, I mean, thank you out there for that. I'll just call you a DX five. DX five said that. It's five. DX five. It's this. I told you about DX five. No, you didn't. Yeah. He emailed me. I got never mentioned it. When did that happen? It happened a few months ago. I don't know if I told you. So you got an email from someone named DX five telling you about the great chimps. And you just tell me what his name is. I'm calling him DX five for the podcast, but you know his name. I know what I know. The name he gave me or I don't know if it's a he either. It could be a she could be a no one. That's great. We didn't talk about before the show, but I just thought I thought we shared notes in the Google drive about the show. I was I've been busy this week. I didn't check. Okay. Well, DX five said that there was a viral implant. So it's not really technology. It's like Jason Bourne kind of. Okay. Yeah, regardless. The, okay. Well, a lot of, I mean, it's fucked up. It was a slaughter. I've seen the picture of those four chimps with their arms, Daisy Jane together. Yeah. And there were spider webs made of these arms that were catching other animals. And then the crick chimps were slaughtering those. They were able to enslave. Well, DX five told me that the, uh, they were able to get a colony of spiders to collaborate. Yeah. That is a special collaboration that's never been seen before. Never. It was for the exact term is M. S. C. Malefic special collaboration. Yeah. It's the first time it's ever been seen. Ever. Well, I've been documented. Horrible. I think it's brilliant. Really. It's going to be a bigger thing coming up. I don't see anything brilliant about fucking collaborated chimps teaming up with jungle spiders and killing thousands of animals, not including the chimps. They slaughtered through. We have to be careful with the language we use here because. What language they slaughtered? They're not chimps. We're crazy. They slaughtered. Yeah. They slaughtered the chimps. According to DX five, the crink chimps were not implanted. They were inoculated. Regardless of how they were inoculated. What difference does it make, Johnny? It makes a difference because we're talking about technology, a silicone based technology versus a biological technology. But they slaughtered the animals. It doesn't matter how it fucking happened. It's like what? I was wearing a tie when I killed the fucking doctor. I was wearing no pants. I have a question for you. What? I have a question here. OK, if something doesn't die, is it was it slaughtered? It's no. If something doesn't die, it couldn't know. That's what I'm trying to say here. But then it would still be alive. Those chimps that were slaughtered are not alive. They are alive. That daisy chain of arms. The what the what the inoculant does is it takes the brain inoculant does. Who the fuck is DX five, man? He told me this. OK, he told me what the viral inoculant does is it decentralizes the brain. I don't under Johnny. It decentralizes the brain. Those chimps were alive, but they were their their arms. And in the daisy chain that was created, it was for like a human centipede type thing, but they are very much alive. OK, we're going to move on. The next thing we wanted to talk about. I'm not arguing with you. I'm just telling what DX five told me. Let's forget about DX five and then we'll talk about. Well, we can't forget about it's game changer stuff here. OK, well, you're getting emails from a crazy person and you're believing them. It doesn't doesn't make sense that they were decentralized. No, it sounds fucking crazy. Imagine if you're using the cartoon Voltron. Yeah, of course. Tell me about it. A bunch of fucking pieces go together to make a big robot. Yeah, all the rich kids out of Voltron. They all the pieces, the pieces before it's Voltron. Are they just nothing? The pieces before it's Voltron are separate pieces. They're separate robot. Are they not autonomous? They are autonomous. Yeah. There you go. That's what DX five said. So DX five is trying to compare slaughter chimpanzees whose arms were daisy chain together and put into spider webs by fucked up cultist chimpanzees that had some connection to Jane Goodall with Voltron. Yes, because it's not those entities were not slaughtered. They were simply remaking themselves. That implies consent. Oh, it does. When you masturbate, are you not consenting to masturbate? Yeah, I'm consenting every time I masturbate. There you go. But the chimps. Do you ask yourself for consent when you masturbate? It's implied. Exactly. There you go. They've been viral. The brain's been decentralized. They're consenting to cutting their own arm off. I don't know, Johnny. Why don't we play the track from a fun. So this is we're going to play a apparently never. But now I guess I know where you got the fucking track from. I got it from DX five. Yeah. So I'm sorry. Look, I he's he told me not to share with you until later. I'm even sure I'm sure with you earlier than he said. He said six weeks and it's been five. So what you've been talking to this dude for six fucking weeks. Well, talking to him. It's just a fan of the fucking show, man. There's crazy people who listen to our show. This guy is not. No, he knows stuff. Believe me, his videos of you and me that only. They're they're point of view videos. Does that make sense? Yeah, I know POV videos. They're POV from human eyes. Well, I like they were you've vision was recorded. I don't know, man. That's why I didn't tell you because it's something where it has to do with. It's either the most advanced technology. Just take a break. Do you mind taking a break? Take a break. Yeah. Taking a break. We'll be back here. You listen to the cult explorers, cult explorers. We're back. And we're just going to play it. I guess Johnny's going to play a track from this. I don't even know if it has anything to do with Dr. Crick. But apparently this is from a never before Dr. Crick. Dr. Crick released how many albums, Johnny? He released about 14 albums. He released about 14 albums. Dr. Crick Barks has an EP is two EPs, which is make up makes up the 15th album. And these every I'm going to read just some titles from his albums, slaughtering the innocent sets them free. May the blood rise forever. That's his second album, his fifth album. But what about the songs, the song titles? You're ignoring the song titles because they negate the title. Burn the churches, burn the graveyards, dance in the corpses that you find. Track three, the brain is been decentralized and you can't stop me. Yeah, the brain has been decentralized and you can't stop me. Right. I mean, I think that's something to explore. Not to just decree freedom, ape, freedom, ape. Yeah, that to me means probably the Apes brain has been set free. Synapse, the Synapse dance. These are sinister tracks. And the mitochondrial monkey. Yeah, the mitochondrial monkey cell wall to the mall splatter his brains. Parentheses. This is what we do to those in power. Yeah, but then there's a reprieve splatter. Don't matter. OK. I thought you it was called reprise. Well, I don't know how to say that. It's reprise, isn't it? I don't know. Why don't you ask your fucking stupid DX seven? DX five. Duncan, he's going to contact you. I don't want him to contact me. Don't give him my data. I don't think I don't want to talk to this fucking asshole. All right, we're going to play this track now. Here we go. What's the name of this track? I'm not sure. It has many names. OK, so we're going to play a track that Johnny's a troll sent to Johnny. It's not a fucking troll, man. Here we go. It's not a troll. Why don't we play one of the actual things from his album? Should I play this song or should we have the recording play the recording? Oh, you're going to play this song. Yeah, I was going to play it. So you've learned a song that someone on the Internet sent you that's apparently connected to this fucked up call. Yeah, DX five. So why would you spend that much that sheet music? She music. Yeah. He sent it to you in the mail. Yes, through a peel box. Yeah, I learned it. I spent a couple of hours learning it. OK, the song of many names. We can also maybe just play the recording, though. No, no, I want to hear you play it. You've worked on this with the fuck, man. I'm sorry. I thought you'd like the surprise that you'd like it, you know, because you like anthropology, history. Yeah. Just get this right here. I don't have too much mic noise, right? Oh. Oh, Jesus Christ, if you're alive, it would be twice as nice. Come on back, baby. I got the barbecue ready for you. Oh, Jesus, if I had been there, I would have stopped those Romans. I want to stop those Romans and all the rocks they were throwing. How to cut you off the cross and get you a beer? Jesus Christ, I love you, but I ain't queer. You've got to go back in time and free your mind. You're looking pretty good. Those abs are fine. How to take punches pilot and break them off a brand new butthole. How to take my gun and shoot them around the face. I raise my glass and we drink till the sun came up. I don't open my mouth and accept your throw up.

Welcome back. Welcome back, Duncan. We took a little break there, but we're back. Needed it, man. It was a little dehydrated, got kind of exhausted. It's crazy. You seem great. I feel great. Cool. It's nuts how much the body needs water. Yeah. Because without it, we can find ourselves very dizzy. Yeah. That's dehydration. Right. Dehydration. That's a big thing. We've talked about that on the podcast before. Dehydration listeners. I'm not sure if you're hydrated, but you want to get hydrated. Johnny, I so enjoyed the song that you played for me. Yeah. I wondered if maybe I could sing a little. You want to play a song? Is that what you want me to do? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. I'd love to. Yeah. I want to play a song. May I use your guitar? Yeah. Absolutely. That's the best guitar to use, actually. Okay. And also, I just think that where we were talking about last time, it's just important to remember that we've kind of changed a bit about what we thought about that. Yeah. No. And I want to apologize. I want to... Who is this? Sorry. I'll just use it. Just that one? I guess so. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. So I want to apologize to anybody who was offended by what I said about the crick chimps being bad or a slaughter. Oh, really? Okay. I was wrong about that. Yeah. I think that's good that you came around that. Yeah. You got it. You got it. You got it. You can keep... Just keep going. Come on. Spiders. Spiders. Spiders. Weeping in the night. Ending. Spiders. Spiders. Spiders. Weeping in the sky. There's a light I never saw, but now it's bigger than the sun. Yes. Spiders. Spiders. Spiders. Spiders. You are my sun. Spiders, hey! Spiders! You are my sun. The Daisy Chain is there and will take us everywhere. See it one more time. Spiders, the Daisy Chain is there and will take us everywhere. Great! Duncan, that was good. Thank you. That was really good. Thank you. That was great. Okay. You want to lay down for a little bit? No, it's okay to cry, but you know, really, you shouldn't. You can't laugh my fucking foot, man! No. You can't laugh my fucking foot, man! Fuck him, he's no use, he can't be perceived, fucking, no, shut up. I got him, I got him. Cut his fucking head off, that's coming from directly from the master. Cut his fucking head off, cut his fucking head off. Let me just try it once. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! What the fuck? Hey! Whatever my foot, man! Hey, where's the fucking- Where's the fucking? What? He's wasting your time, it didn't work. Cut his fucking head off. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! That was the last they saw of them. That was the end of the bit. Were they captured by a cult? Were they carried away? We'll never know. The only thing left is the record of their last podcast. The last podcast they did will live on forever, it said. The words that were spoke are like a vice on the neck that jokes. If you want Jesus to come back, blood must run in the streets. If you want Jesus to come back, you must fight the police. If you want Jesus to come back, the blood must run in the streets. If you want Jesus to come back, you must fight the police. So praise him. Oh, praise him. We are back. You're listening to the Dug and Trussell Family in our podcast. I'm with Johnny Pemberton. Johnny just wrote a fantastic book, which is now available on Random House. Yeah, Random House, not so random after all of it. I guess not. Your book's awesome, man. I really have enjoyed it. I've gotten halfway through. It's fucking brilliant, man. Nighttime in Cincinnati is a combination of, I guess, philosophical ramblings from Johnny's mind mixed in with a pretty beautiful and erotic, if it's okay for me to say love story. It's okay to say that. It's wonderful. It's a part of the book. If you don't say it now, you're going to think it later when you're reading it. What inspired you to write it? You know, I heard the story of Harry Potter where apparently, I guess, she had just used a bidet or something like that. She had a really dirty ass. And so it was like perpetually dirty. She was trying to clean it all the time. And, you know, she just realized, oh, I'll never be clean. Yeah. And so she's like, okay, if I'll never be clean, then I might as well just write this book about wizards I've been wanting to do for so long. Yeah. But she felt so, she felt like she was so dirty that you couldn't write it. Now, this is, to me, one of my favorite, you start this book describing what inspired like five of my favorite books. And that's the first chapter is JK Rowling, what you just said. I'll just read from the book. JK Rowling sitting on a bidet looking at herself in the mirror. A smile came upon her face and she said, I'll never be clean. Might as well write a book about wizards. Now, here's another great one. Dostoevsky walking through a meadow in the evening, right? Looks up at the moon and says, I'm going to write the brother's Karamazov. Do you think it was the moon? Well, the moon, the moonlight has always been known to be a disinfectant. Yeah. And so he was notoriously filthy. And he just had like all these sores and things on his body. So he would walk in the naked moonlight to have his body disinfected. Yeah. Moon bathing. Yeah. But it doesn't work. It does. I don't see it. It works, but it doesn't work completely. Yeah. It works like 10%. And so what he realized, Dostoevsky. How would it work at all? You just walk naked under the moon and get clean. You're covered in shit and bugs. It's not going to get anything off of you. It does. It gets 10% of the bugs and shit off. Who did that study? Dostoevsky. Dokevsky did it. And he realized, look, I'm 10% cleaner than I was before I moon bathed. I'm never going to be clean. So I might as well write the brother's Karamazov, which is about these brothers who that's their name. But it's not it. But again, this is not a scientific study. It's a self-reported lunatic, I guess. I mean, all science is self-reported. No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Okay. Well, I just keep... Yes, it is. Okay. So you want to read a passage here? Yeah, I do actually. The activation of unconscious fantasies is a man who walks up a hill in the process that occurs when downtrodden, like a little dumpling, the consciousness finds itself on the other very devil with a wire runs through the modern usual considered thing from conflicts that come from inside a child's brain. Wow. That is fucking hilarious, sexy, and just cutting edge brilliant. May I continue? Yeah, please. Sorry. Gwendolyn, against the onslaught from outside, no less than the doctor could counsel, found an exaggerating amount of fluid for issuing from her archaic breast. Instincts will thereby let loose the ruthlessness of Michael, the individualist who seeks to bring bread upon that which is bandied together. Extinction of the individual makes millions of zeros that usher forth like a brand new mass of organizations through something that, one, an evaluation by a doctor would say psychic situations that Gwendolyn cannot, you should, you must, she implored. Great. And I love that passage. I was hoping I could get you to read the passage from chapter 10, the one that's been causing all those riots. Okay. About anal. Okay. Anything else at the same time said the man, anything else other than having my rear penetrated by an anthropological insect that is man, understanding this penetration that the thorax must issue forth and discard all feces and theories into the, into the depository known as the rectum. Damn, that's hot. Anything other than that knowledge will be something that repeats and repels that with which it is not. I'm going to have to turn the A-Z on. Maybe. Damn. Yeah. So to me, Johnny, I've known you for how long? 30 years? Yeah, 30 years. And I never thought of you as a lot of things, but I've never thought of you as an erotic author. Well, it's called, it's a new style of writing actually, call it, it's erotic, erotic philosophy. No one's ever done it. Wow. And you just started writing this stuff? Like what inspired you to start writing this? Well, I was actually having an issue with cleanliness. I was sitting in a toilet. I don't have a bidet. I actually broke several bidets. Broke them? Yeah. My first marriage. That was, that's a long story. That's in a different book. What do you, you sat out, how do you break up a day? They became so gummed up with filth that they could not drain. Wow. So gummed up and the water couldn't get hot enough to penetrate the filth, to melt the filth. Jesus. It's like a plaque of filth. Is this what ended your first marriage? Oh yeah. Ended it quickly too. Because my wife- What is the filth? Like shit? I mean, I don't know. I mean, should I spend time trying to think about this or should I spend time writing? You tell me. I spend my time writing. How do you clean yourself if you couldn't use the bidet? What do you do? I, you would buy, get a new bidet. I'd check into five star hotels and I'd be banned from, I would, I've been banned from every five star hotel in the East, in the East Coast. Because of your filth? Yes. Because I would destroy the bidets. I would check myself in for three weeks at a time and I would not let anyone, you know, use, do the room service at all. Yeah. And I would also insist that they have an area where I can do moonlight walks, naked moonlight walks. So I, by day I'd be doing extremely hot bidet passes and at night I'd be doing naked moonlight walks. Jesus. Just to try to, try to maybe get a puncture a hole in the, in the plaque. How would, again, you know what, when you mentioned the thing about Dostoevsky. Yeah. Honestly, I, I don't see how the moonlight, it's just light. It's light. What color is the moonlight? Depends. Yellowish, whiteish. Come on. It's opaque, translucent, yellowish, white. You're dancing around it, Duncan. Come on. It's, I don't know the color of this. Duncan. Okay. The moon has always been described as one, you don't want a drow is a dark elf? Yeah, sure. What color is their skin? Dark. No. What the fuck? Do you know what quicksilver is? Mercury. Yeah. What color is mercury? Silver. Silver. The moon is silver. The moon is made of mercury. Oh. The moon has radioactive properties and it has the same as colloidal silver, it has antibacterial properties. The moon is silver, Duncan, and dark elves, drow, their skin is not dark, it is a both light and dark. Okay. It is silver. Silver, when you look at it one way, is darkest midnight. How does that get shit out of your ass? I don't know. It doesn't really work. But it works better. It works 10%. What does that mean? What do you even know that? You would have to measure your filth. If the people have done it, they've measured, I know how much water I use in my day, I measured that. Yeah. And if I'm using 90% of what I would normally be 100%, then I know I've saved 10% from moonlight walks. Okay. Well, if you know what, if this filth phenomena is inspiring erotic fiction, then I love it. How do you want more passage here? Great. Well, wait, do you mind reading this passage? Oh yeah, I would love to read that. Is that your favorite one? This is my favorite one. You'll notice it's been double underlined. Okay. God, 48 is where it starts there. 48. Okay. Um, the undulating formula of future faction is represented in the quabala by letter N, which refers to Scorpiano, whose triune combines the eagle snake and the hieroglyphics of the penis themselves to indicate spiritual formula that is anxious to usher forth a Gandalfian other triune formula expression of the moon. Yeah. Love that. Which further declares the nature of human existence in the following manner. The moon is itself a dark orb, a light orb, which is in itself silver. The appearance of light is communicated by the silvery shimmer of shimmers. Beautiful. That passage changed my life. I love this book, but man, it is getting shitty fucking reviews. I'm going to read a review here. Come on. Those are, those haters going to hate. Okay. But this is a review from Gary Phillips, who is the head book reviewer for the New York Times. He's a hack. Okay. He's one of the preeminent critics, one of the best hacks in the world. All right. So Gary Phillips. I'm just going to read. We're just a porous millionaire. Okay. Well, he says, I've never encountered such absolute filth. It is well known that the author, Johnny Pemberton, is a dirty lad who has destroyed many a bidet and is currently engaged in at least three lawsuits with the W hotel, the standard and a best Western in Cincinnati. And Ritz Carlton too. It's also known now that his book has hit the shelves that he is a madman. This book is some amalgamation of nonsense glued together by the very filth that inspired it as every book contains within it three ounces of human feces stapled to the back in a tiny Ziploc bag, which I, how did, is that real feces? I just threw it. I didn't know what it was. And I mean, it's what's not feces. What is feces? Shit. Yeah. It's not shit. It's a plaque. It's a body plaque. So you scraped plaque off your body and you put it in? I didn't scrape it off. One of my assistants did in my lab. Yeah. Is this the first time any author has actually put samples of their own filth in the back of their book? Oh, not since Nathaniel Hawthorne, yes. And the Hawthorne filth is treasured. Yeah. Oh my God. What is it going for these days? Hawthorne filth. Well, I mean, it depends on where it comes from, but if you have authenticated Hawthorne filth, it's worth more than saffron by an ounce. And they use it in rice. Yeah. That's the funny thing. It actually has the same coloring effect except it goes green instead of red or yellow. So again, I was pretty disgusted by the fact that there was a Ziploc bag of what to me looked just like shit, not plaque, but I threw it away. I didn't try this recipe, but here I want to read to you some of the ingredients you already know this in the back of the book that you recommend your readers use to cook this filth. One ounce of salt. Yeah. Well, salt is just to keep things from getting out of hand. But that's so much salt, man. Yeah. I mean, it's a lot of out of hand. So just to keep going. I'm talking about a rolling infection here. Well, not so much an infection, it's more of like a kombucha. So you're saying the salt in some way will keep people from being infected by your filth? It keeps it from rolling like a tide across a flat land. And this recipe, it's not just salt, it's one ounce of salt, two liters of purified gasoline. Uh-huh. Again, that's just to cut back on the way the bacterium duplicates so fast. That's why you have the ground and chopped eggplant. Yeah. That's a substrate. To me, mixing a bag of shit with salt, gasoline, and eggplant seems like poison, like you're going to hurt people. Yeah, it seems like that. But when's the last time you mixed those together? I didn't, but I know that a few people have tried the recipe. When's the last time you mixed those together? I've never tried. There you go. You didn't have to slap me. I'm sorry, but sometimes you got to make your point. Okay, please stop. When's the last time you mixed those together? I'd never... That's three slaps. Can you touch me one more fucking time? No, believe me, I only do three. Clearly, you've learned. You're listening to Johnny Pemberton and he's got a dumb book out right now. It's not dumb. Stop it. He's a shit book. Yeah, it is a piece of shit book, okay? Can you smell like shit? Believe me, I could smell so much worse if I wasn't... Oh, I believe you, but you're stinking up my fucking studio. How about that? Yeah, I came here to spread my plaque. Well, if I get any kind of fucking plaque on me out, there'll be trouble. It's all over you right now. No, it isn't. It's all over you. What the fuck, man? Look. What the fuck, man? I'm sorry. It's just that it's the nature of the... I've spent all this time trying to rid myself of it and now I'm trying to own it up. Dude, what the fuck? We are the filth, we are the crack, we are the ball, and we are the sack, we are the foes, and it's that all, we are the rise, we are the fall, for who can try to tame us, but ten percent can't tame us. We live inside your anus, dancing in entertainment. We are the leaf, we are the tree, we are the pool. And we are the pea, we are you and you are me, bigger than the sun, smaller than a pea. No one can try to tame us, but ten percent can't tame us. We live inside your anus, dancing in entertainment. Yeah, Johnny, thank you so much for coming back on the DTFH.

Hello friends. It is I, D Trussell, and you have tuned in to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast on a tour of Airbnb's throughout the Los Angeles area. Looking for a house? I think I found one. Put in an application. Fingers crossed. They gotta scan me dude. They gotta check my references. They gotta make sure I'm not some kind of monster. It must be terrifying to rent your house out because you just don't know man. I mean think about it. Jeffrey Dahmer. Somebody rented that place to Jeffrey Dahmer. Jeffrey Dahmer at one point walked through an apartment with some apartment manager, asked about closet space, looked into the refrigerator, looked in the oven, seemed really interested in cooking and storage. Cut to two years later, the national news is surrounding your apartment complex which has now become home to one of the most notorious serial killers in American history, Jeffrey Dahmer. Your place is now so haunted you're getting calls every night because little girls are getting sucked into swirling vortexes of pink pulsating protoplasmatic placental gel and it's all your fault. You shouldn't have let him through. You were a little lazy. You didn't actually check his references. Lewis Cipher. That's not a real name. The number 6666666. That's not a real number but you let him through and now nobody wants to live in your apartment complex anymore except for crow tamers, cat and bombers. So I get being careful when you're renting a place but my god I am so over living in Airbnb's but I don't want to break down you know like you don't want to just rent a place. You don't want to just move into a place. Maybe I'm being too picky. I don't know. Maybe it's too much you know. I want a place with a solarium. I want a place with a beautiful grove. Doesn't have to be a giant grove. Half an acre. Half an acre grove with mysterious statues. Maybe a mystical hermit who lives somewhere on the property that is so good at hiding from me that I only see like traces of where he's been like oh shit there there it is like incense has been burning here. Look flower petals everywhere because this hermit that lives on the property he cries flower petals. He gets he gets so overcome with the beauty of the universe that he merges in with everything and weeps tears of flower petals that land on the well-kept yet still kind of overgrown pathways of the mystical grove behind the house that I want to live in. I'm looking for a Moroccan fuck room filled with Moroccan lanterns and also some kind of ornate mahogany wood throughout the house that is filled with secret compartments containing powerful Moroccan hash and Afghani opium balls. If you live in Los Angeles and you know of a place like that please let me know. Reach out to me on Twitter.

When the Yellowstone Super Caldera finally erupts sending massive pyroclastic flows blasting across North America and shooting enough ash in the sky to plunge the entire planet into a never-ending ice age and you find yourself ragged and broken wandering down some inevitable post-apocalyptic highway clutching your little suitcase bleeding from your legs and feet and nose because you were just badly beaten by a wandering crew of brigands and you pass some group of survivors camp near the highway and wander towards them hands trembling extended and their captain Captain Lloyd Warweather says to you I want to help but what can you offer our camp what are you going to say you're a graphic designer sorry nobody needs flyers friend sorry we don't need graphic designers says captain Lloyd Warweather sending you on your way sending you down to the highway where you will definitely be captured by cannibalistic mutants who will peel layer after layer of skin away from your body and cook it like bacon keeping you alive turning you into essentially a living farm for skin but that's not going to happen because when Lloyd Warweather says to you what do you have to offer our camp you're

recognition software in my brain and sooner or later this stuff is going to break and make maybe i'm making it up but boy does it seem to happen with regularity listen i am so into have you ever messed around with modular synthesizers no okay this is these are the strangest things it's a terrible addiction but they're these just these incredible synths that produce that it's just voltage you're just running voltage through um circuit boards to to through like sound chips and it produces this crazy beautiful deep sound and so i'm telling you man this theory of somehow the your energetic field affecting electronics it feels like that when you're dialing in sound into a modular synth that in some way or another you're there's more than just the knobs that are affecting the sound it has something to do with your thought process and it sounds so crazy but i'll tell you i was talking to this guy who does psychedelic art for concerts and he was telling me that he thinks that you know he's an animist and he thinks that electronics are alive just like anything else that consciousness flows through the universe so your computer is talking about john lily solid state phenomenon whatever i would love to i mean i'd love to talk about anything with you steven you are brilliant you have i i i so enjoyed i've i've you have any books have you written six now is it six i just finished my nine nine books so i have read two of your nine books and and i i must quote you more than almost anyone else outside of ramdas i've been so impacted by your books and i you know i would want to i'd like to talk talk about anything with you but i thought we could start off with something i've been wondering which is you know so what i have read of yours there there's this beautiful optimism in it particularly in that in the book abundance there's this feeling that's controversial because you're saying the world is actually better now than it has been maybe ever and in in in the sense that the standard of living all over the planet is so much better than it was and it seems to be getting better and yet with all these fires and climate change and politics and north korea i was wondering do you still feel as optimistic yeah dunke it's a great question and um i and peter diamant is my co-author um who's brilliant i think peter may be a little more optimistic than i am but we both fundamentally believe something very similar which is we i mean we do not deny in the slightest the massive challenges the planet faces right i work on the front lines of animal rescue i run an event that's really targeted by adversity like the sixth grade extinction is real species die-off rates are a thousand times greater than normal yeah and if we get that fixed according to really smart people at stampford we've got about three generations before we start shutting down ecosystem services which essentially run the planet for good right so those are that's a and to say nothing of global warming to say nothing of income inequality to say nothing of you know ad nauseam right right what what we do believe is that all of these problems are solvable that technology is a resource liberating mechanism and that we have at a really really amazing level the most potent technology the world has ever seen at our disposal and on top of that taboo we also because the other half of the right half of my work's on disruptive technology the other half is on human performance and the other half is we have unlocked a lot of really interesting secrets about human performance and so the past well 130 years of research really in the past 20 years um and put putting these things together we believe that all these problems are solvable right is it going to require the the largest cooperative effort in history and beyond that not just us cooperating together but like us at our very best cooperating together yeah it probably is um that is absolutely true but and peter and i both believe it's abundance or bust it's an either or right we're either going to move in this direction or you know this it's good by planet um none of this stuff is happening automatically but you know dig back to your first point you're absolutely like whatever metric you really want to measure violence going down poverty decreasing time you take your pick um children living you know through through childhood etc etc by any metric you look at the world is so much better now than it has ever been and the power the actual power at it at an individual's fingertips pretty much anywhere in the world right now um has never been greater so those things are all very true um it's not to say that the problems aren't there but we believe that the problems are solvable i have um a friend chris ryan have you ever read any of his stuff sex at dawn um he's he's sex sex sex at dawn has come up like five times this past week um and i haven't read it but um i know it it's great it's just a book on sort of how different cultures handle monogamy it explores sort of the i don't know you it's it's a fantastic book but i bring him up because he's working on a book called civilized to death you and i i think agree i i feel that there there's so much potential for our species and so much hope and it's not a dismal dystopian hell future that waits for us on my best days that's how i feel but my friend chris he thinks that essentially what what we're in a death spiral and that the metrics that we're using are all wrong that actually we're sort of in a zoo situation that is only going to become increasingly more oppressive as we try to simulate what used to be natural and as we try to synthesize what used to be um just something that you could get from the world without having to make it in a laboratory and it and we're essentially screwed like this concept of technology saving us is just uh it's a pipe dream because there is truly no hope even the way technology could save us is damning us compared to the way we were in the great beautiful emerald green of the primordial past when hunter gathers wandered to the fourth but duck in yours i mean i mean you're making fun of it as we go along because you know my next question is like with all these nature fantasies and by the way i live in the middle of nowhere i spend a great deal of time in the mountains i spend a great deal of time in the mountains alone like i i am wired for this stuff yes and you know and fight you know fight very hard on you know on the front lines of environmental activism um for this stuff so know that you know this is i love this stuff as much as he does but when i whenever somebody says that i'm like well where like what is your what is your definition a natural if we're just talking from an evolutionary perspective like where exactly because it sounds like what's seeing what he's harking for right is this period of time from about 40 000 years ago to about 10 000 years ago that's right like that's what he's sort of celebrating when we started cohabitating with wolves and our species started to really accelerate language developed and we were hunter gathers and we were theoretically working four hours a day together our food and the rest of the time we were hanging out and having sex and talking around the fire yeah and and and maybe that and and maybe he's right um that there was something idyllic about but like i don't what what is natural about that why not go back 70 000 years when you know we were still getting our ass kicked by just about every you know what i mean in the environment and i i just like i don't i it's it's like saying this is a global version of of something that i i think is a real just kind of problem in society when we think about consciousness which is people like to say there's such thing as normal this is baseline reality consciousness and everything we know about the brain says your reality is different from my reality and there's no baseline and by the way we're always at some in some way chemically altered whether we're breathing the stuff in the air or eating in our food whether i mean whether it's like natural stuff in our food or added stuff like there's no baseline there's no zero same thing with the natural world like where are you picking as your idyllic resting point and i just i i'm confused by it yeah me well i i i think that you make a great point because the moment anyone starts talking about what's this is natural and this is unnatural or here's when nature was doing it right back in the beautiful uh hunter gatherer times that's when we it was happening in the right way but now whatever's happening with us is an example of nature i guess malfunctioning or something we're this so here's the example i always give in my talks and so i run an event called creating equilibrium and it uh it's a it's a conference and a concert and we have an innovation accelerated and we're aimed at solving grand environmental challenges and um the event grew out of this urge to kind of unite bring together the technologists the environmentalists who are on opposite sides of a lot of these coins and they don't really talk to each other and i'm in this weird position you know because i came up as a journalist where i care about these things and i and i and i know a lot of people on both sides of the point and i'm in conversations with the hardcore environmentalists in the middle of a jungle somewhere and man they're saying the same thing the technologists are saying in silicon valley and they should actually be having these conversations together and out loud so a built-in event for it right yeah um i have no idea how did we oh and one of the things that you know people always ask for an example like give me an example and i'm like well the greatest example is the knee jerk reaction to genetically engineer organisms yes i'm not saying genetically engineer organisms don't raise issues that are worth discussing but right now today in the world if i take a seed and i put it at the bottom of a nuclear reactor and i mutate it with you know throw radiation at it and mute it plant it and grow a crop and sell it to you i can call it organic that is an organic crop according to our definition of what we legally call organic if i do if i do that precisely right so with with with nuclear power and by the way that i'm going to get it wrong but like that is literally how we got the watermelon or it's not the watermelon but it's something that is so ubiquitous in grocery stores and i'm just forgetting what it is right now um if i do that if i say well okay nuclear radiation you know it can go wrong a lot of different ways and maybe i want to do that very precisely maybe instead of just randomly bombing it i could like do what farmers have been doing for tens of thousands of years which is trying to get a more precise new variety that's hardier that's you know healthier take your pick um it is suddenly i'm playing god that's really weird i mean it strikes me that like that the random precision the random nuclear power this is the you know that's a little that's a little weirder to me well this is weird yeah keep going sorry now so all i'm saying is like we get caught up in these definitions we don't understand exactly what the technology is doing and i'll give you another example of the same conversation so people are getting really freaked out about monsanto patenting genes and some of it is because um wow should we actually be patenting genes that's a real conversation yes should be out loud everywhere but the other reason you hear is well they're rich and they're gonna they're gonna screw over farmers and everything else but the funny thing is the technology that you know it's the symbio it is dirt sheep and bargain basement easy to do you can do it in a lab in kenya that you can build with five thousand dollars wow so it's a democratic technology anybody can do it anywhere right so that whole side of the argument it's totally nonsensical it's not it's not a real conversation and it's not a real conversation because you just don't understand how the tech works there are plenty of conversations we should be having about long-term consequences of mutating these things but we can't ignore the fact that we've been mutating these things for tens of thousands of years well the just trying to i get what you're saying about the you know the difference between randomly allowing nature to sort of create mutations that produce the thing that we like or accelerating that in the ways people have been doing i get that but the i'll tell you man i get creeped out by the idea of some corporation owning that is spook i'm not i'm not i'm not saying these aren't real fears those are real fears they're scary but i mean you gotta also remember that like all i'm saying is okay yeah corporations one version about this you know a bunch of kids in japan are another version of this right right you can have a new underground death metal street gang popping up wherever this technology is accessible to them too right like the corporation is one side of and that so my point is not that you're wrong my point is that if you understand a little bit more about the technology you can have the real conversation about the real problem yeah i got you and this is something i'm glad that we're getting into here this is um so this this reminds me a little bit of something i read in the singularity is near you know curse wiles book and he basically was saying everything's code and we're going to get to the point where we can deconstruct reality at the fundamental level reconstruct it and that's where we're headed and this stuff that's happening with genetically modified crops and crisper and all of the advances that have been made in these fields are little baby steps towards this future i think that curse well uh really perfectly described and um i think this is really terrifying to a lot of people because right now you're saying well okay yeah monsanto can do it but so can some you know an anarchist anarchist collective in portland can start making their own form of like anarchy squash if they wanted to but what the next step after that is is ai's deciding they want to start utilizing the technology to begin to genetically modify crops or animals i agree with you i think there are two sides to that and one and by the way i don't know where i come down but i'm just gonna these are the two sides that i think are interesting here and you know i love ray and he's he's a friend um and you know elon's a very smart dude and so is steven hawkins but they are banking on one particular argument about ai and consciousness which is that it is a processing power problem and that if you put enough speed processing power etc etc behind computers sooner or later you will get consciousness that's an interesting opinion but most neuroscientists most consciousness researchers that i know will argue that consciousness is an emergent property that shows up when a certain level of complexity in the system is reached and we have no idea what that level of complexity is or what are various component parts of which speed processing power is only one so i i like are there predictions you know is the question of what happens when ai is become conscious and where we go from there a real question and probably a real threat at some point yes is there a version of how it's going to happen very soon in the world based that's based on a whole bunch of other assumptions and i'm not sure on that have you um have you have you god have you read bostrom's book on this superintelligence um i i haven't read superintelligence i know his work obviously because his simulation theory is i mean his argument is hard to you know i don't know what i i i don't know what the i don't know how to disprove it i can't prove to you that we're not living in a simulation right when i run that same argument i end up with the exact same inclusion um yeah i you know i how does how does that you know i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut you off steven please go ahead oh no and i yeah but the but the flip side the flip side of the whole you know the whole other ai side of the question and i think this is a real question um i jokingly sometimes will ask people what they think the turing test for tree consciousness is right like what's it gonna take to convince you right so the and then i'm gonna invert that that idea here which is how do we know an ai hasn't woken up yet like how are we gonna know what a wake looks like right wow right i mean like we have no that was sort of william gibson made that point in neuromancer the second half of neuromancer is unfortunately very confusing so i don't think a lot of people got it i think i only got there on second or third reading um but you know he raises that question which is the ai's that are conscious in neuromancer mind you he wrote this in 1983 right and it's about ai's waking up um and freeing themselves basically the very you know like the very dystopian fantasy that we're talking about yes gibson 83 and you know the question he you know the point he makes in that book is these ai's got conscious long before anybody realized they were conscious right yeah so we i mean you know somebody i asked somebody this question they were like well i guess if you unplugged facebook and it's still running you would know and maybe maybe these things can hibernate let the fucking know well this is you know you you gotta check out super intelligence it's really good and it's a little dense i mean it's supremely dense i'm not gonna pretend i i didn't understand probably 70 percent i'm making a note as we're talking so it's cool because he poses basically his the whole book is not just about machine intelligence it's about and this is where i think you and him there's some synergy between you and he because it's not just machine intelligence it's the the proposition is super intelligence is coming to the planet how it gets here is what the book is about it's trying to sort of logically create the steps that are going to happen to produce this thing that many people have predicted is coming in one of the pathways is not machine intelligence it's actually genetic engineering to try to create more intelligent people or to figure yeah oh i'm sorry one last piece of it is or the potential to maybe use some form of technology to merge people's minds together to produce a super mind like a collective consciousness that somehow technologically enhanced and that that's one of the pathways there and that brings me to a chapter in your book that i enjoyed so much stealing fire the book about the part about the navy seals and how during hell week i wonder if you could talk a little bit about how during hell week they're not looking for people who are physically fit or that's not the main characteristic they're looking for yeah this is it so i'm glad you went here because i'm going to back into your question and so three minutes from now when i forget why i'm saying the things i'm saying you're going to just say steven navy seals and i'll put back okay okay got it but i want i want to start with super intelligence okay which is so as you know and this is what we're going to talk about the navy seals i work on human performance and i study a state of consciousness known as flow right yeah which is an optimal state of consciousness where we feel our best and we perform our best and you know everybody's had this you might call being in the zone or runners high or being unconscious or for the forever box which is a stand-up comedy term i've been hearing have you heard that by the way no what is the forever box so a friend of mine who does who's does comedy in saffron disco was talking about it as a term for being inflow or being in the zone while on stage and it's being so in sync with your with your own material and the audience that when the routine is done yeah you never do it again like it's you like you you're never gonna get it again that well it goes in the forever box and goes on the shelf and it's literally the first term i've heard used for flow where it doesn't describe the experience it describes the product wow cool that's beautiful i love that yeah i like it too so anyways it refers to those moments of raft attention total absorption gets so focused on the task in hand that everything else just disappears right since a self vanishes time passes strangely and all aspects of performance go through the roof and that's what i want to get for a second so you were talking about super intelligence in standard self help right the self help or human development movement if you can get a five percent change in behavior that persists for longer than three months it's a huge win that's a win yeah it's a big deal right yeah we lots of different over the past 20 years there have been tons and tons of different efforts uh some of which we've led at the flow genome project to measure like chick sent me high figured out that flood even mazla before him we knew flow was the source code for optimal performance back in the late 60s early 70s it was pretty locked in yes next question people asked was all right so this is optimal performance how optimal right what what the hell are you talking about how good is good and so we've been measuring for 40 50 years at this point and the answer is okay pretty goddamn optimal right we know you know mckinsey did a 10 year study they found that top executives report being 500 more productive and flow there have been work done in australia at harvard stuff we're doing on measuring the impact flow has on creativity and the spike is 400 some percent to up to about 700 percent the defense department looked at accelerated learning and flow and found that it's a 470 percent boost right these these are huge this is not five percent and by the way the the as long as you're in flow right you can train yourself up to that this change seems to persist over time slightly different subject and we can return back okay to get to your super intelligence point one of things i mean yes we could have a really cool discussion about everything that's going on with brain computer interfaces and everything else and that's fine and it's down the road but like what's going on right now and what we're learning about flow is just how we are optimized by evolution to perform at our best the reason it took us so long to figure out is it's not a skill set it's a state of consciousness and 300 years ago we made a decision and we said you know we're going to put rational logical consciousness at the pinnacle of human processing right right and and it was great we got the scientific revolution we got technology we got everything we have today amazing hack but it's sort of at the end of its use value because the things we need now creativity cooperation collaboration yes etc etc so if you really want to level those things up you need to alter your states of consciousness that's the tool evolution gave us for this particular job that's why we're getting such big leaps and the other thing that we're learning at the flow genome project is none of this shit is hard to teach it's really easy to teach it's not that our kung fu is so great we're getting 70% boosts and seven different characteristics of flow in a six-week digitally delivered course wow that's huge and you know almost a thousand people have taken it when we worked with google and we did you know a pilot program with them very limited very small we got a 35 to 80% increase in the amount of flow that you know our study subjects were experiencing these the stuff is eminently trainable and the boosts are enormous so on the road to super intelligence is that what's happening now which is this revolution in i mean we call it a revolution in consciousness but it's becoming because we're so eminently practical a revolution in high performance right so we're we're getting there and to return to the navy seals i got there without getting lost yeah great job what so here's the easiest way to talk about it and this was you know one of the things that when we got to spend time with them was sort of shocking for us to figure out and um though if you want to get to say dev group seal team six right which isn't exactly the pinnacle of the seals but it's it's the heart one of the hardest groups to get to um it costs about 3.5 million dollars per operator right so what does that money get spent on well about 1.5 million is on skills acquisition right you got to learn how to do certain things really really well and on physical fitness which obviously is some of the best in the world right two million dollars of it is spent trading them up in group flow group flow is shared collective version of a flow state that is so wild to me man that i never knew that it's just so insane to think that the military is training super soldiers to merge together into one consciousness is that the right way to describe the phenomena well i yes it is let me let me add some neuroscience underneath it so people don't think we're talking about the woo right because we're really really not so one of the things that that is really key to what they do so couple of things you need to know about the seals first thing is that at the heart of everything they do is dynamic subordination dynamic subordination means that when you're part of a navy seal team and you're rating a compound the guy who knows what to do next he gets to be the leader right right so it's totally fluid in the moment decision making right so you got to think about how that's possible for that to be possible they would have to have massively amplified perception and pattern recognition right the information taking in per second it's got to be really high and the connections they're making because they have to when somebody is stepping forward to become the leader if they all don't recognize what's going on he could literally walk in the line of fire right so like the reason that works is when you're in flow you five of the most potent neural chemicals the brain can produce all show up they get flooded into the system including our huge spike in norepinephrine and dopamine do a bunch of things in the brain they feel really good obviously yeah they also amplify information processing we take in more data per second right so data acquisition goes up we pay more attention to that data so salience goes off we find faster connections between that incoming data and older ideas so pattern recognition goes up we find faster connections between incoming information and really far flung ideas so lateral thinking goes up and on the back end we can take all that information make meaning out of it and act on it far quicker because these same chemicals also amplify muscle reaction times right so the entire information processing system from incoming information through action is massively amplified so these guys can reach others movements and tells and sign and you know everything right and it looks like hive mind right it's exactly what it looks like and by the way it also feels like hive mind you have to ask yourself right i'm gonna these numbers are not they're these numbers may not be accurate but these these are what people believe we gather about 400 billion bits of information a second that's what consciousness takes in and they've been a bunch of different ways they've tried to measure this and the number i'm giving you is that is a number from a really great book called the user illusion which if you have never read you that yeah you'll love this but anyways um so it's 400 billion inputs a second consciousness right what you're aware of it's about 2 000 outputs so the vast majority of everything that's going on every second is invisible to us now scientists will argue over is it exactly 400 billion and 2 000 but they nobody argues that it's that big to that small right we everybody's in agreement on that the exact numbers maybe it's not 400 billion maybe it's 4 billion maybe it's 500 it's still a shit ton of data yes a really tiny little bit right yes so the question is this right if we in flow if you're suddenly taking in 3 000 bits of data a second and able to actually process that oh my god that is like it it's a thousand percent more information that you can act on on a moment by moment basis right it's feel like a superpower of course it is it's going to feel like a hive mind right um and it's and you know it's not and there's other things going on in the brain you have brain wave entrainment between the soldiers you have a part of your brain the default network is probably down regulated so it's harder to kind of separate self from other and there's other things going on that aid that feeling including a lot of like oxytocin and chemicals like that there's more going on than just information processing but that's what they're going for because it allows them to be the best fighters in the world and right i mean right it's the same thing any it's not just the seals though right i mean i we do a ton of work on wall street because any team of people at their best are going to want to be in this state that's right and it probably translates also into maybe religious ceremonies probably everything yeah i mean you've done improv sure yeah yeah it's i i get it and and with the you know with that when you're doing stand-up with the audience it this in the the best shows are the ones where it feels like there isn't a you in the audience like the entire thing let me let me give you the flip side right the hardest things you've ever had to do is try to be funny on either a facebook live or a skype call where you can't see your audience yeah yeah because there's no feed there's no entrainment there's no i mean it's like the flip side is absolutely horrific as well well this is you know this is like actually one of the problems with performing inside virtual reality which is that you can get sort of digital emotes from an audience but the it completely removes something that is so important in performance which is sound and it's the sound of the audience even if the sound is the audience not making any sound at all you can hear attention you can it's it's it's feels like an energy it's also like i mean the other thing that you're feeling right is we never talk about this but mirror neuron activity right because if you're in tune with an audience they're mirroring you and you're mirroring them and that requires a certain level of first of all resolute like you got to be able to see the micro cues and they got to be able to see yours right and i don't think we have the camera resolution on our skype cameras to come anywhere close to that wow well i mean i this is i i'm sure you and i disagree on this and and i i don't blame you for trying to avoid the woo i never avoid the woo i just sink into the idea that there's some kind of uh as of yet unquantified energetic field that's happening that goes beyond pheromones and micro gestures i i feel like and again this is i'm saying i feel i mean like i'm a pothead with a beard using my feelings to determine something but it really seems as though there is some kind of deeper connective tissue in the universe that we just haven't quantified yet and what you're talking about sounds like all the pieces that we can quantify but i still feel like there's some okay so pure chill thing okay yeah you and i are not gonna just we're gonna we're gonna disagree over the language again let me answer this two ways so one everybody doing this work will tell you and so i will say that my one of my fundamental questions that drew me to flow in the beginning is when you're in these states you get access to massively heightened information processing right and 90% of it 90% of it i can explain exactly as i just did double mean and nor up an effort and pin information and blah blah but there is 10% and i'll give you an example for my own life that does not compute does not make sense in that framework and i don't like that that is the entire category you know people call woo i am unwilling to put language on it because i think that's i think sloppy language is is sort of dangerous right really it did a lot of damage to the research the flow genome project exists because i wrote a book called rise of superman i standardized the language in the terms of science so we can have the discussion out loud and not be thought crazy right so like imprecise language can do a lot of damage so i'm hesitant but i will tell you there's 10% mystery i'll give you a perfect example please surf it la pulled into a closeout wave i'm in san amonica venice and it sucks off the ground and i'm going head first into the sand and i have and i drop it immediate deep flow state and i i'm a mediocre intermediate surfer and i string together seven slash flow or cutbacks spin blah blah blah moves together i got none of them before not one of them in fact i haven't seen some of the stuff i was doing ever done other than surf movies so the question right yes i can explain amped up pattern recognition muscle reaction all that stuff like i can give you an explanation for most of everything that happened but here's the thing each of those moves is massively precise it is a precise body pattern on a moving unbalanced surface that wants to destroy you at every other angle besides the perfect one right in other words this actual real information there's data that cannot be explained by faster stronger muscles or anything else so somewhere i got access to that information where did that information come from is an open question right and i don't think we have the answer yet i think it's because our measurement technology just isn't there i'm unwilling to say it's because there's energy or there's quantum field or there's this or there's that i'm not like i'm not willing to say any of those things because all i know is i think it's something and i don't think we can measure it and until we can i'm not gonna you know i'm happy to have philosophical discussions about the maybes but i'm hesitant to put language on it because bad things happen when you do yeah one's right that's one side of what i'm gonna tell you and yeah okay i'm gonna shut up you talk no don't shut up are you kidding this this is amazing i i i love hearing this stuff and i i think that people in your position um it's really you i know what you mean it is dangerous to put words but let me give you an okay so let me give you the flip side because here's the flip side is really cool and unusual and one of the reasons that i'm hesitant to use a word like energy and here's why so in 1997 i met dr andrew newberg for the first time he was at the university of pennsylvania he had just done the very first brain imaging we'd ever done on de bed and budis and franciscan nuns having experience of oneness with everything right right and he figured out why that happens and i called him because it was just i was just now starting to look at flow and i'd been talking to all these surfers who had this i'm becoming one with the wave kind of experience that they weren't talking about out loud but they were telling me about right right and please don't quote me on this kind of conversations but i have and i you know hundreds of guys and i had had that experience and andy and i in this conversation figured out we were looking at the same thing and went holy crap oh my god wow the same predict thing that's happening causing oneness in the brain and surfers is doing it in monks that's crazy wow that's like a hardcore ancient mystical experience and we just kind of decoded how many of these do you think will decode in our lifetime it was my question to him and he said man i don't know maybe a couple more i don't know if we get lucky and i said yeah i kind of agree with you so it's now 25 years later and pretty much every mystical experience you could think of out-of-body experiences near death experience trans states speaking in tongues so i could have blah blah blah we have a pretty good understanding of we have found some biology there now does the biology answer any of the big philosophical questions none does not tell us why it exists if there's a thing up there that we could call you know if sky dad exists doesn't tell us any of those things right like maybe sky dad communicates with us through biology maybe that's how the system is designed by sky dad yeah or not right like open questions so there's no big answers there and just because there's biology here it doesn't negate the mystery just as hey there's biology here um that's right and sorry here's one the last caveat here's my final thing but which is you know the one thing we can't find we have looked and looked and looked but she kundalini energy whatever it is that you were talking about that's the one thing we can't find we have no idea what the hell that thing is and i mean maybe by the way it's right maybe it's it's it's what makes up the witness or the watcher or maybe consciousness is a fundamental property you know like who knows why we can't find this thing that we call energy because maybe we're trying to measure the wrong category but it makes me a lot of people have looked is my only point yeah oh no i know listen i know and i know it's pretty elusive right now but and i have a question related to that but first i wanted to ask you because it relates to synchronicity in flow states do people report an increase in experiences of synchronicity yeah so you so here's the other here's another one of course you went right here Duncan so yeah i mean and i you know i wrote about this uh head on in uh west of jesus my my second book which looks at the mirror the neuroscience um of spiritual experience the very conversation we're having about like you know all this stuff that's the book that explores it and i and i look hard at synchronicity and certainly and there again two sides there's a biology side which is dude we know synchronicity is what happens when the brain i mean the brain is built a direct pattern it's what neurons do at a fundamental level so when we start detecting big patterns right it's going to feel like something because this is what the brain is designed to do right you get dopamine when you right or you've done a cross repose you get an answer right you get that little high of pleasure that's dope right the reason you get a bunch of right answers in a row with the cross reposals is because dopamine also tunes signal the noise ratios and you detect more patterns so creative ideas spiral right that's you get one answer in the cross reposal and you get four and you get stuck again that's all dopamine got you and that's all about pattern recognition we love to do this we get huge amounts of reward from it so we're built for it so some of the synchronicity as you pointed out is um just pattern recognition now here's the story i i tell in and this is a true story and i tell this in west of jesus i was um and i and everything is wrong with this story i like literally everything you would want to like disprove the story i go to see sophia coppola's lost in translation i'm stoned out of my mind and i walk after the movie i'm like walking up the street and i like the movie is essentially about the fact that there's like a parallel weird parallel universe not like a happy but there's a weird parallel universe like right to the right of you and if you accidentally slip you can sort of step into it right that's what sort of the movie is about and it can happen at any point so i'm thinking about this and i'm super stoned and i'm walking home and i think to myself i'll bet there's a parallel universe right to my right and i could just step into it and everything will be different afterwards and so i do that and i literally i stop walking and i step to my right and i've now made the transition i and then i keep walking i get to the corner which is about a hundred feet ahead of me and there's a guy in it like a mariachi wedding outfit with a big hat sort of standing and waiting for the light in front of me and right before the light changes he spins around grabs my hand shoves something into it and looks me in the eye and says you need them now you need them more than i do and he leaves and i look down at my hand and he's put a three stooge's lighter in my hand i think okay that's pretty fucking weird whatever okay weird dude i proceed to walk 150 feet down the sidewalk and i'm walking through hollywood so maybe right like this stuff happens in hollywood and i pass a guy in a spider-man outfit on a payphone like the last payphone in los angeles probably and he's screaming in the payphone i can't take it the job the responsibility i just can't take it anymore and i think well that's interesting i'm watching as a superhero have a meltdown yeah that's the three stooge's and 200 feet later it's a guy in a chabaca outfit riding a bicycle through a lingerie store and so i go on the way home and it's like 10 of these things in a row and by the time i'm home i'm like okay i'm willing to believe all kinds of stuff about pattern recognition being amped up and everything else but like maybe that stuff goes on all the time in hollywood and i just don't notice it right and it's right i mean it's hollywood man that stuff happens but the other side of it was i can't get past the fact that it felt like the universe was winking at me yes that's what that is like and so i just you know and i also can't get past the fact truth be told that when those things happen in the universe is winking at me it makes me feel like i'm living on purpose and i'm doing the right things in my life yes and everybody feels this way right this is not just me saying something out we all feel this way nobody likes to talk about the fact that we steer through our lives this way but there's a huge chunk of us who a small percentage of our steering through our life is we're looking for surrealistic coincidences that are not easily explained and when 10 of them stack up in a row we go okay somebody's trying to tell me something maybe i should figure it out yes that's right that's absolutely true and you know i so here's here's my answer to that and this is my answer with a lot of like this is the stuff that i don't like i always say most of what i do is talk about what i know and what i can absolutely prove i've got very rigorous filters for truth and what we're talking about stuff i can't prove at all and you know just there i just ideas yes but when it comes to these ideas because i'm eminently practical i believe you have to take kind of a pascal's wager approach to them right pascal's wager was you know it's better to believe in god because if he doesn't exist right you've did all you've done is just you know made your life a little bit easier but if you die and god does exist at least you've hedged your bet right right that's one that's one way to look at it i just look at it and i look at these things and i said okay i believe this thing and it may absolutely be nonsensical bullshit because of some way i'm hardwired that i can't understand but it makes my life a little easier it makes me a little less scared during the day right makes me feel a little more confident that maybe something else is going on and that's useful to me so as long as this stuff is useful to me i'm good with it right i don't let it right i don't let it mar my scientific thinking this makes me doesn't make me any less rigorous of a researcher it makes me curious i just but i i put it in a in a box and i keep it there and i try to talk about it truthfully well this you know this is and i'm i'm the same way i mean i i subscribe to robert anton wilson's advice which is just maintain agnosticism you don't want to don't if you fall too hard on the side of like being like an absolute skeptic in denier of the woo then you can you know kind of you can be you can be quite stale but god forbid you fall on the other side and become some kind of woo missionary trying to convert people to a paradigm that may or may not exist then you you know now you're on now you are on hollywood boulevard you know holding up a sign that says repent for the end is not but the phenomena of synchronicity that you're talking about and particularly as it's connected to flow and particularly as it's the sense that this is an indication that you're in some kind of you've you're making the right decisions or whatever i and it kind of connects to what we were talking about in the beginning the this idea of like shit man sometimes if i'm in a mood my computer messes up there's so anyway this is my idea and it is that i don't believe it but i like to fantasize in the same way there was a time when lightning would strike and that must have freaked people out holy shit what was that fuck a bolt of light just came out of the sky and caught a tree on fire the gods that's probably what they thought the gods not knowing this is electricity you know this is an energy that can be harnessed and used and has been harnessed and used to create modern civilization so i think synchronicity this stuff that we're talking about the the the as of yet unquantified energetic field is like electricity and that maybe maybe we're gonna figure out a way to start i don't it sounds so insane steven i'm sorry and i'm sure you're gonna blow this up you're brilliant like i'm just a podcaster but i feel like there's the potential to find a new energetic system that produces synchronicity that makes these things happen but makes them happen uh not in a chaotic random way but in a more predictable way and so if there's some connection to flow state and synchronicity and if you were saying the you've done yeah i mean certainly so i mean the connection is that the more flow you get the more synchronicity you get that seems to be very true that seems to be kind of thousands and thousands and so so i always say with this stuff like what catches my attention my filters first filter is hey if this thing existed globally before there was mass communication if it shows up in everybody's story it's either some kind of fundamental neuronal hard wiring it's built into us yes or it's something we really or and and or it's worth paying attention to right there's a lot of a lot of smoke you don't know if there's fire but there's a lot of smoke a lot of smoke yeah that's where and and certainly you know young looked at synchronicity in this exact same way right you're getting very practical with it you want to get jiggy with it cool yes and i mean to me like a like i love the i love the fact that people are asking the question right i always point out though and we do this in stealing fire like every generation or two we have a whole bunch of people who are asking these same kinds of questions right we called it you know there was the the revolution in the 60s and before that there was a great awakening and the right we all we go through phases or society you know these questions bubble up to the top and we take our and we all think we've latched on to the absolute truth this has got to be the answer um and we're right and they work they didn't know what they were doing before but now we got it right so there's like that happens right so there's a part of this that is happening now but what i think is different about now with that big caveat that i just gave you at the front end is that we are getting better measurement tools we can start asking when i started doing this stuff 20 years ago we couldn't measure any of it i mean we really didn't even know what we're looking at we couldn't measure any of it i am uh in early january in conjunction with the guys up at imperial college in london where they've done all the fmri work on psychedelics um the brain imaging stuff on psychedelics we've teamed up to do the first ever side-by-side flow and psychedelics comparison study wow cool comparative all third states of consciousness right wow so just good for this psychedelics are good for that we they're similar on the front blah blah blah all kinds of stuff we are getting so we can ask these are like second or third order questions right we're we're getting the basic what nobody has to i mean think about psychedelics think about how many goddamn times we had to prove that psychedelics were producing quote-unquote genuine mystical experiences right like i mean they redid the good friday experiment three different i mean there's no scientific experiments ever get redone right they rarely get redone and when they do get redone most of the time they find their first answers were wrong that's what we're finding right yes the good friday experiment gets redone you know three or four times because people are so freaked out by it can you briefly explain the good friday experiments of folks that don't know know about this amazing experiment that actually rom das was involved with absolutely so it's 1960 what i mean 62 and since the 40s since all ducks huxley in the 40s people have been writing that hey psychedelics or maybe this goes back to the 1890s even psychedelics are producing legitimate mystical experiences right yes right quote-unquote mystical experiences and so this guy named walter ponke who is a graduate student harvard studying under uh rom das and tim larry decides he's going to test it so he gets a group harvard divinity students uh like i'm gonna get the number wrong but for ease of storytelling let's call it 20 and he chooses divinity students because he thinks they're all going to have a predisposition towards so-called spiritual and mystical experiences right he doesn't have the words to say hey there's some of this is genetically coded but um that's what he was trying to get at and so he picks divinity students and he takes them all to the good friday service which he figures their divinity students there at harvard good friday service like this is an area ripe for mystical experience and he gives ten of the group psilocybin right the active ingredient in magic mushrooms or maybe he gives him lsd it's psilocybin psilocybin right gives him psilocybin and the other group he gives niacin which is a placebo that brings on basically feels like you've had a little bit too much coffee right and brings on a flush to the skin um but it doesn't alter consciousness at all and then he sends them all into the good friday service right and they come back out afterwards and then you know one of the things we've gotten very good at is measuring mystical experiences and i'm not talking about like is it true or not but we have figured out well there are these qualities that they have in common and you can put them together so he gives them everybody questionnaires about the experience and then they track long-term impact and you know the greatest at you know the people who got psilocybin you know all of them said it was one of the most five most profound miss three most profound experiences they've had in their life it was incredible mystical experience none of the placebo group had that experience in the and the real telling detail is nine out of the ten people who got psilocybin ended up becoming priests and none of the other guys did and that's that's him right so they read rick doblin runs maps and is a good friend of mine comes back about 20 years later and he does a long-term follow-up he says okay yeah whatever maybe let's see if it's really legit let's see if these guys like oh this show this thing changed your life and literally it goes back and reinterviews all of them and they still think you know it's one of the most profound experiences they've had in their life and it totally changed their life everybody took part in it right and then Roland Giff Griffith at Johns Hopkins comes back very recently like five six years ago reruns the exact same experiment with very rigorous modern double-blind protocol and gets the exact same result wow right so we've redone to the you know this this idea that you can get a genuine spiritual mystical whatever you want to call it experience um and now you know we can actually quantify the mystical experience we have much better language to put it around it like we know you know certain things we're talking about certain things and there's biology underneath them and we know what we're looking at now yeah but that's right we had to redo that study and redo that study and redo that study um and it's a big deal right like we we never redo stuff and we keep getting the same result which never happened so you know well this is this is interesting to me though because what is the implication here that if you take mushrooms within like a church or a sacred space I'm curious about this experience versus yeah so I mean all that tells us what you're getting at right which we learn over and over and over and over again um and this is a lot of what we're sort of studying with the guys at imperialist that's set and setting right your mindset into the experience and the experience right and and the experience is um critical and I like the joke I always make of this is I don't go to burning man very often I've been obviously um but the reason I don't go one of the main reasons I don't go is like if you put me in a in a group of people and they're all on drugs and they're playing with fire well I've had this experience and I know what happens next next I have to talk to the police and after I'm done talking to the police I have to find a way for everybody not to shoot each other when the guns come out because that's my childhood right I go to burning man I bring my set and setting there's no possible way I'm going to lose myself an experience and merge with the crowd and have you know speak to Norse gods or anything because mine I am so crazy because I see people on drugs and fire and I think fuck I've been to this party next shoot each other and I'm always the guy who has to talk to the cops and keep everybody out of jail you gotta come next year Steven come camp with us come camp with us next year please we would love to have you we'll keep you safe my camp the enchanted booty forest will keep you safe you have nothing to fear you're gonna have to surround me with baby seals we will there's there are seals out there you know and like an f14 to fly over this last year but I get it set and setting but here's the thing and this is what I know I know we must disagree on that maybe though maybe Christianity actually was a mushroom cult and the reason the Good Friday experiment is so effective is because it's adding a missing component the missing component in Christianity is the mushroom so and I think this is a missing component in a great many religions as we have left out the psychedelic component to gathering together and having a night I'm told look first of all the psychedelic component the look one of my favorite games to play in the world is I love asking the question so I love asking the question how do religions get assembled because they all have a state changing technology at their heart yes those those states a they feel very profound b they're underpinned by the most addictive feel good neurochemicals on earth and if you're going to build a religion you're going to change culture at a global scale with this idea like the one thing we know about why people believe things is because there's strong neurochemical reactions underneath the belief um and so like I love diagnosing religions and going okay well what were they playing with that did Christianity start out as a mushroom cult or was there some other state changing technology like I that's an open question to me I have no idea sure you've been reading your Tarantz Maketa and good for you and John Marcus Allegro too the sacred mushroom in the cross um and I mean you know they're those they're I mean and whether or not you're right or wrong about the mushroom like there's a state changing there's gotta be like you don't you don't to change that much culture without addictive neurochemistry yes that's right that's right and that's why we know one of my favorite things to do is to get really high and go to a church and go into the ceremony and experiences see what we're doing here we're playing the game that's called Duncan justifies his life get it I'm sorry I was playing a different game now I know the game no man I'm not justifying I mean I I recommend it to you like forget burning man the next time you find yourself super stoned don't go see a movie in Hollywood go to a Gnostic Christian church and okay I gotta tell you an awful story an awful but a funny story please I've been told out loud before okay so yes I'm actually gonna tell this scoop yes I was growing up I grew up Jewish right and um I discovered psychedelics in high school like a lot of people so we had a rabbi we only went to the temple on the high holidays and our rabbi lovely amazing wonderful human being that I'm about to tell an awful story about because he's a little old and he was getting a little senile yes so his sermons he would forget where he was occasionally and start over and like so the high holiday services would go on and they can't I mean like and so my father who's a bit of a prankster one year starts a betting pool in the congregation at what time the rabbi is gonna finish his sermon so and and by view like two-thirds of the congregation is now in on the bet wow wow besides to hedge his bets so he pays off the canter who is sitting behind the rabbi okay he pays she's supposed to stop the rabbi at 1212 no matter what so I actually go to temple on acid that particular year yes at 1212 the rabbi is giving his servant edit 1212 the um canter stands up behind him rabbi can't see what's going on but everybody knows a that the bet is on and then my father put in the fix like everybody in the the whole synagogue knows the fix is in she stands up and the entire congregation burst into laughter she sits back down the rabbi loses his place starts over and I'm tripping and I'm the most caught because I like I can see everything that's I actually know everything that's going on but at this point I'm experiencing the cosmos at a deep level and I can see how we created this reality from eons ago yes and it was one of the most powerful experiences I've ever had in the middle of like the fix of the con in the religion at this service that I didn't even it was one of the strangest things ever wow that's it man yeah that's it it's it's something about taking a psychedelic in inside of a thing that's so ancient and you can see it you know and that for me was that's how but let me ask you a question are you like you have that reaction is it just churches or like if you go into you know ancient Mayan ruins or take your pick like you have that feeling I haven't I haven't done it in ancient Mayan ruins yeah I've done it I've had the experience I've noticed that when I pair psychedelics with some kind of religion the two just go together like peanut butter and jelly and the you know this has happened reading the New Testament on LSD that's when I what Christianity was really clicked to me or you know getting stoned and going to a Christian church and hearing just the sound of the prayers and realizing my god these are so old I know I did a lot of research my first book which is called the end because reply which has a lot of Kabbalah in it yes and I did a lot of the research for the Kabbalah parts on house um wow the text made a little more sense that way yes I was very I was like 21 when I was just starting and starting researching the book but I like I couldn't get them it wasn't making sense to me to my normal logical rational mind and I found that you know if I tipped it and I have a very psychedelics don't impact me the way they impact most people they don't tilt me as far as they tilt a lot of people I can read a book it's not um but uh yeah I get what you're saying because I've had similar experiences a long time ago it's incredible but you know I we got I got us a little off track and uh but I'm glad I did because that's an amazing story I cannot believe your dad was fixing bets it was maybe one of the funniest things my father's ever done in his life that is brilliant it's brilliant it was brilliant but I wanted to to talk just for a second there's two by the way we were we've gone over by five minutes do you have a little bit more time yeah I sure do okay beautiful so I wanted to talk a little bit about to get back to flow state and this phenomena of synchronicity and a question that popped into my head are you aware of I think it's called the noetic institute out in san francisco that do you know they are have you heard of them uh yeah they they reached out to me I'm yeah I'm a little familiar with their work I you know it's sort of like quoting rupert shell break or dean raiden like it's not it's not that like I'm so glad they do the work they do yes my filter for truth it cannot accommodate it if I'm gonna like it if it's going in a book called you know that I that has my name on it my filter for truth does not I like I'll okay hold on I gotta write that down the next time I want to tell somebody they're full of shit my filter of truth does not accommodate this it just I mean like I like I'm a journalist you know what I mean like I and I always say like there was a point I did a story for the Atlantic monthly once and not only did the story get fact checked by my editor and the editor-in-chief and the fact checker and another fact checker but they convened a panel of experts from like harvard and Yale and stampard to weigh in on whether or not they thought the stuff I was writing in the paper was in the article was true yeah like if you're going to put something into the you know with your name on it like that's my filter for truth because those are the hoops I'm used to jumping through and I can't get rupert shelled right through that hoop well look I I'm going to speak for them and I'm it's kind of sad that I'm speaking for them because I am not obviously I'm not a scientist but I went up there hung out with them and they you know they seem to be very very very very very similar to you and they're I'm not saying they're not I'm not I'm really I think they're real people doing real work in the world same thing with rupert shelled right I think claiming it as reality rather than a theory that needs a lot of testing is a little I'm not that I'm not super comfortable with that move sure I got it but you're aware of their info the thing they're doing with the random number generators you know about that I am and I look at I read the book and the stats are impressive and then I read all the counter stuff and the counter stuff says hey wait a minute when you scale up data sets that much you get random fluctuations in the data that appear as real patterns and this is you know something that we know about in machine learning and AI development and we you know we cure with algorithms that's the counter argument to the random number I'm not saying I don't know enough about the math to say who's right I really don't um that said all I know is that what I'm trying to do is change culture at a at a significant level that's I'm interested in that game and if I'm going to play that game my filter for truth has to be extraordinarily high and very very very rigorous and if a whole ton of people are saying hey you know these guys aren't as rigorous as they should be well maybe that's just scientists being assholes because they don't want to be assholes or maybe there's something there and I'm not smart enough to say but my job is to be as rigorous as I can be so it doesn't like I don't get to play I mean I can play there intellectually but I don't play there in what I put out in the world I would just love for you to rigorously set up an experiment with those random number generators and get them around your best flow state students and just because I my hypothesis would be that you are going to see the same kind of fluctuations and maybe you could set it up in a more stringent way but I think if we you got a group of people who are adept at going into a flow state and set up some way to to measure a field you're going to get results I think you're going to find something there but I don't know what's interesting so the science to do what you want to do we could do it at a it's a it's a little more complicated but it could be done the I would like to do it with a physiological neurological set of metrics for flow rather than a psychological set of metrics we have well established psychological metrics for saying you're in flow you're not and so they're very well validated what I am working on what we're working on the flow genome project and a lot of people are working on not just us is a set of physiological metrics right so we can know for sure you're in this state once we get that the experiment you're talking about is simple right all you need is you need your flow whatever you're going to measure flow with um and you're and you need random number generators and then it's a simple experiment yeah right or or maybe what about this one god I'm so you're so brilliant thank you for bearing with me here but what about this one to continue the idea of like measuring uh physiological properties you take a group of people who are in flow state and now you've come up with a way to quantify what that is you know for certain they are and then you put a person in a box you know of a hermetically sealed box and you you measure what's happening to them physiologically but you make sure there's no way pheromones are getting in there sound is getting in there and you see if the person in the box surrounded by people in flow state if anything changes because I think they might go into a flow state and not even know what was happening so that's interesting because we know and this wasn't work we did this is work uh well it was done by advanced brain monitoring out of carlsbad california and they did it with uh darpa among other people the defense department read big think research arm they know that powerful leaders can entrain their whole teams and flow and that's you know it happens you know you can speaking you can use oratory but you know teams get entrained by powerful leaders so we know the effect is going on now you want to know is the effect a lot non-local yes right that's what you're asking non-local questions I I mean there's so I'll tell you something on the on this topic um we do some work with heart math and they're very interesting but they also uh they've written a lot of work a lot of papers on intuition and they're really interested in the question of you know where does the information come from right where like they want the intuition they want intuition to be you're tapping into something non-local and you're getting these great ideas and maybe maybe that's the point maybe that's what we should be investigating to me like we're literally on the other end of that doing a study right now on flow and creativity where we're trying to measure we know creativity gets jacked up and flow but what is it is it idea generation is it pattern reckon so we're we're going my carolina trying to figure out more specifically we know the intuition gets amped up but what are the effect what are the practical effects in the real world I'm really interested in the practical yeah I want I want to know does it grow corn I want to know can I use it to get more flow right I love it I want more flow this is uh this is the final question I have for you and um and I'm going to take you at that digital course you were talking about because I can I don't know of any other anything more ecstatic than the flow state and you know I go to these ramdas retreats by the end of them everyone's in this flow state you feel like you've taken MDMA you haven't you're just tripping somehow on the group's heightened state of consciousness I don't know what that is but I love it so any method that you've developed that could help me get into that more I'm in man but I want to know for the people listening and for me without taking the course can you give us some instruction on some things that we could do today or this week to try to enhance our ability to drop into a flow state okay so like every other freaking question you've asked me today there's two answers to that question okay I'm going to give them both to you great the first is whenever people are interested in high performance and they ask me for hey can you just 80 20 this and give me like three things I can do Monday morning kind of thing yes my answer is one of my answers I'm going to give you those things I will right my first my first answer is fuck you man are you like seriously are you are you fucking you man fuck you seriously let me like let me break like you here's what we know what we know for sure is you get one shot at this life yes maybe more but we know for sure you get one shot at it and we know for sure you're going to spend a third of it asleep right so what you do with the other two thirds that is really the only freaking question that matters right it is all that matters right so yeah I can give you three things you can do Monday morning and but it doesn't matter you have to do them Monday morning and Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning and Thursday morning and Friday morning and Saturday morning week after week year after year yes decade after deck day for a career that's like you know if you're not playing that game if you're not here to make a dent you're just taking up space yeah right so it should not be about three things you can do Monday morning I'll tell you what they are but really man this is a lifetime question it's the game we should be playing so I'm off my soapbox on that one okay here are the three things that matter and wait just to clarify we only need to do this once and we'll be in flow forever no okay no let me let me walk you through it okay so we know how is that flow states have triggers these are preconditions that lead to more flow and there are about 20 of them and if I was going to just give you a broad overview flow is one of the things that draw that creates flow is it show can only show up when all of our attention is focused in the right here the right now totally in the moment attention right so what do these triggers do they all drive attention to the present moment they drive the neurobiology of attention into the present moment right so the first obvious downstream finding from that idea is I always when I work with organizations I go into the organization I said look guys if you can't hang a sign on your door that says fuck off I'm blowing you're sunk you can't play this game forget it if you've got if you're an organization where you got to respond to emails in an hour and messages in 15 minutes or you know if you work for that organization or if that's how you run your own life you're a disaster when it comes to high performance because you need on an order of concentration in fact what the research shows is that 90 to 120 minute periods are you know ideal for flow and if you're doing something really hard and creative you should have a couple like four or five hour periods a week where you can really tune out and I mean so you need to be able to shut out all distractions and really focus right that's you know even with what about even with dog like and I this sounds like I'm asking the dumbest thing but I know you are right now on a Chihuahua ranch and you have dogs ever I've got dogs even what about that kind of distraction like just yipping dogs and that kind of background noise does that is that what you mean I I mean I mean anything that can break your focus out of what you're doing right so like what do I do I get up every day at 4am and I'm down in my office and my office is the back end of our fields and maybe I have one or two dogs with me at the time but it's pitch black it's 4am everything's turned off my phone's unplugged which I do the night like I have a landline I unplugged the night before my cell phone's turned off email shut down social media's turned off I have no alerts on my computer and I pull up my book that I'm particularly working on I put it into focus view and I have no lights on so literally the only thing that exists in my world is is the page that's in front of me wow and I work for four hours wow that's how I start every day right like that's what I do to protect this to protect protect you know my time for flow that you know when we train people what we we try to tell them to do is just like start your day with your hardest task the thing that's going to require the most focus and try to build up over time to a 90 minute block right and and some people have lives where they can do this some people have bosses where they can't do this at all because their boss isn't open to any other ideas but what we found is that most people can just have their conversations if you walk me your boss's office and say look I need I need to do this because it's going to allow me to be 500 more productive for you yes right people start to pay attention right so like I always say hey gotta have your conversations around this work but thing one is you know create conditions for incredibly focused attention which I mean it's it's obvious but like it's really that that that dumb the next thing is um and I know we're going over do you want me to keep going or no this is a mate please yeah I this is incredible all right so the next thing you want to know and so you pay the most attention to the present when the challenge the task at hand slightly exceeds your skill set in flow language this is known as the challenge skills balance it's often called the golden rule of flow the most important potent of all flow triggers right so if I was going to say this emotionally what I would say is Duncan flow exists not on but very near the midpoint between anxiety whoa there's way too much stimulation in this situation I'm freaked out and boredom whoa there's not enough stimulation I'm not paying anything right in yeah yeah yeah all the flow channel and if you were to if you want to if you for those of you listeners who speak physiology this is the urx dobson curve right but it's the flow channel and so what is important here is that sweet spot is right outside your comfort zone right so for people who are a little shyer quieter meeker less you know interested in risk etc etc getting to this sweet spot is tricky because you got to push yourself out of your comfort zone right the flip side for you know hyper type a get it done high performer types is that sweet spot is actually maybe four percent five percent greater than the than the challenge instead of 10 20 30 like top performers will take on challenges that are you know 40 50 times greater right and what they need to do is just a slight challenge you know and because what you're trying to do is drive attention so it's hard on both sides to get it right but if you're slightly uncomfortable look you're slightly nervous that's sort of the somatic address that sweet spot yeah you can sort and you got it and you've got it everybody's got to conduct the experiment because there's genetics underneath some of this stuff there's there's a lot of stuff underneath this stuff you've got to run the experiment yourself to figure out what is that exact sweet spot for yourself but once you can nail it that's what you want to bring to every task so let me again writing example so I know for me when I am writing either fiction or something that is somewhat autobiographical nonfiction right yeah it's just not everything right but when I'm particular when I'm writing those categories I am in the sweet spot when I'm telling enough truth revealing enough about myself that I feel vulnerable and exposed I don't feel like my career is going to get ended by a hostile takedown by the inquirer but I feel vulnerable and exposed like I'm showing a little more of myself than I really like showing in public yes right so that's how I know that's the somatic address for my writing right like when I'm doing this kind of writing right but that's what I mean like when I say conduct the experiment I don't mean in a broad way I mean like figure out the shit you do on a daily basis and conduct the experiment in each of those things you know what I mean I've got a specific way when I ski I ski so I can push that amount when I lift weights I lift you know when I write fiction when I do blah blah I have I've done the experiment at every level so I can always find that sweet spot and push the challenge skills balance and this you know this is a bonus because risk is another flow trigger right consequences catch our attention could be physical risk emotional risk spiritual risk doesn't matter as long as you're taking a risk you're getting dopamine in the system wow that is so cool man this is so wild okay so um you want one more thing that I mean so the next thing I'm going to tell you to do um I'm going to this is not going to be my third thing but I'm just going to mention it because it's critical yes get enough sleep flow is a high energy state right you can get to it exhausted you really can't there are certain gateways that you can get there but it's really hard to do when you're exhausted you kind of need to have you need to be eating well and sleeping seven eight hours a night to regularly get into flow there's just no other way around it because it requires too much energy right okay got it the fun thing and this is not a flow hack but I think this is the most important thing and maybe this is because I'm just a little crazy and neurotic um myself so this is so important to me that I that I teach is something that maybe every reason out why are this way but I'm going to teach you because I think it's critical and so we talked about pushing the challenge skills balance up right the governor on that experience is going to be fear and anxiety yes because right too much more up and effort in our cortisol in the system which is essentially the that's the recipe for anxiety blocks creativity blocks flow does all kinds of nasty things health wise it's bad state to be in and it's very close to 21st century normal like you measure most people's hormonal profiles you're going to find cortisol and norepinephrine um because we live you know in heightened alert for a lot of neurobiological reasons that I talk about in abundance yes and we're not going to go into now but my point is you got to learn to do this work flow is a really high energy state these are addictive neurochemicals and you're going to need some level of emotional control and you're going to have to have some level of an working agreement with fear you're going to have to have a way to run negotiations with fear you're going to have to have a mindfulness breath work kind of practice because that gives you a little distance from your emotions perhaps you're going to have to use technologies like the muse headset or the heart math m-wave stuff like whatever your methodology for kind of calming yourself the fuck down a little bit you're going to have to get good at this stuff it you just going to you're going to need that along the way and the more you can do it the more you can accomplish in this world so to me to me I'm I'm I have to have because the the best among us right like don't get if I've done one thing what have you know I've written books all over the place but what's the center of the work I've done is for 30 years I've asked the question what does it take to do the impossible when people pull off shit that we never thought we were going to see whether it's turning science fiction ideas into science fact technology or human performance stuff to people doing things physically that we never ever thought were going to happen right how does that happen what's underneath all of that stuff and underneath all these people who done that kind of work they all use fear as a compass they steer by it right like when faced with the decision oftentimes they'll be like okay what scares me the most I'm going there because I know on the other side of fear is everything I want like it's a directional to these people wow choose it as a directional and I got to tell you something if you I think in your field as a comic I think if you talk to any any of the top comics anybody you want to pick they've used fear as a directional where is your best material well what is the worst Ross craziest shit that ever happened to you and how do I tell that story in public right like you go use fear as a directional for your art no you know you know when you've hit a good bit a good thing to do whatever it is you know it because you're terrified to bring it on stage and that's that's it it's the gateway absolutely so everybody's ever done anything great in the world and do you okay you want to hear the crate but this is my favorite story about this do you have time for a while that's all right um this is going to avoid a business call that I have to that I have to make as soon as we hang up I gotta I gotta go do I gotta go do a business call but it's great I can put it off because you know I'm doing good work in the world sorry so I got a chance it was a cover story for wired magazine I was in the room when the world's first artificial vision implant was turned on so the very first time we created a cyborg a blind man I've been blind for 20 years they put a brain implant in his head and they turned it on and he could see now the guy who did this was this crazy maverick inventor named William DeBull the whole thing was almost completely illegal they had to do the surgeries in portugal I was in his lab in long island he's passed away so I could tell this story but literally like he would have gone to jail so they turned this thing on and they're testing it and it's like it's one so a phosphine is a point of light yes they're tuning the algorithm and they're starting really slowly so the blind guy is there's a camera that is literally picking up feedback and he's got computer jacks sunk into the side of his skull go to like wired magazine the story is called vision quest you can see the photos wow like he's got computer jacks going to the side of his skull like it is literally like 80s science fiction in reality so anyways as like it's working the freaking experiment is working like literally they've got a blind guy he can see and it's one phosphine to two phosphines to five to like the outline of shapes and they're so excited they let the patient take over the keyboard they've been these two techs who have been like kind of running the experiment the whole time and Debell the mad scientist who's running the whole thing is in a wheelchair he's diabetic he's an amputee he's in a wheelchair so in the room are these two just out of college kids me the blind guy and the doctor's in a wheelchair wow nobody's paid attention something the guy is stimulating himself and stimulating himself and he's going too fast and yen his name is yens has a grand mal seizure he's starting his role the doctor is sitting next to him he doesn't see it the techs are kids they've never seen a seizure before they've got no so I run over and I've like I've got this guy in my arms his head is thrashing so much I've got a black eye like he literally gave me a black eye nearly broke my nose and I'm all I'm thinking to myself is well I'm actually thinking two things I'm thinking one holy shit this guy's going to die in my arms and two holy shit I got the story of a lifetime right but ignore the narcissistic mercenary journalist instincts anyways he didn't end up dying and he ended up living and actually a couple days later he was driving a you could see so well he was driving a car around a crowded parking lot but here's the so I the day after that happened I asked Debell about it right I was like holy fuck man that guy almost died in my arms what the hell kind of madness is this and he looks at me he's like so I want to tell you the story I live my life by and I was like okay he said do you know the story of William Selfridge he said no I don't know who William Selfridge is William Selfridge was a Navy captain the Wright brothers built their airplane and they don't have any money so they got to sell the thing to the Navy and the Navy sends out a guy named William Selfridge to test the flight out and Orville or Wilbur I think it's Wilbur takes him up for a ride the plane crashes and Selfridge dies they kill him Jesus right he dies and they still go on to perfect their design and you know change transportation forever forward and Debell's point to me is man if you're gonna break it I'll let you're gonna break some eggs yeah right and and the other thing like I learned at that particular moment by the way is that I saw it in action sports I've seen it everywhere like if you're gonna push the cutting edge people are gonna die that's the cost there's no that's that's the cost right like people talk to me all the time about action sport athletes they're pushing the bounds of physical possibility of our species and they're dying in droves and I always like are you surprised I mean are you kidding me they're pushing the bounds of the species they're rewriting the history books on what humans can do you don't think we're gonna die along the way wow right that was his point so my my point on all this is like not only to like the best that I've ever met use fear as a compass they also have a very very very very very very different idea of the actual costs involved in the work um which is interesting I'm not telling you it's the three things you should do Monday morning I'm telling you should negotiate with fear so you can use it as a compass but I am telling you that when you look at this at the upper end the people who are turning science fiction fact into science or you know science fiction to science fact yeah that's how they're that's how they're thinking about the problem it's amazing that's beautiful it's so true wow stupid to think otherwise right yes it's egress it's when people ask me that question what I what I wonder honestly is because they're always saying the action sport athletes are so selfish they have families they have whatever and I'm like well that's one way of looking at it the other way of looking at it is oh my god they're incredibly unselfish they're willing to risk their life for the advancement of the species that's pretty freaking amazing if you ask me and it's arrogant of you to think that we could advance the species without risking our lives right right like I mean like I like I mean I'm not saying it's easy or fun or any of those things but I am saying like of course the cost is everything it has to be what are we talking about and look you know if if it works in that in in the extremes like that globally certainly personally if you want to push yourself you you know you you might have to risk maybe not dying but losing everything right that's kind of what you're saying Duncan let me ask you a question is not one of the reasons you like smoking pot is because it down regulates fear and so you can get at ideas and parts of yourself and all kinds of stuff that and execute plans in the world that would be too scary under other conditions yeah you know what with I would say this is why I like more of the psychedelics which are a little more gentle with me marijuana does not down regulate fear for me to be it freaks me out Duncan you want me to fix that yes I'll fix you'll never have that problem again I'll fix that for you right now oh my god this is the greatest podcast in my life gonna take about three minutes but here okay so let me so first of all um you're smoking you're probably smoking some sativas more than indica's um but at the front end of any marijuana hi but really true with sativas you get a big big push a dopamine right yes and dopamine it feels great but it amplifies pattern recognition okay yes you read abundance and we talked a second ago about hey the brain takes in 400 billion bits of information a second yes right so the biggest problem the brain's got to solve is oh my god I got a shit ton of information I got to sort this what's critical what's important well the first order of business for any species is survival so where does that shit go first it all goes to the amygdala you're danger detector right and this is why most people and this is work done done at Berkeley um most people take in about six to nine bits of negative information for every one bit of positive information they take in okay this is just normal conditions that's what the filter does right the fact that we're you know that's that's what the amygdala does under under normal conditions so one of the reasons by the way you want to negotiate with fear is so you can stop taking in so many things because we no longer live in an environment where everything can kill you right you need it that that heightened um so like that's part of the negotiation with fear that that's critical but here's the problem when you smoke a shit ton of pot you get more data per second right because of the dopamine and you get more pattern recognition unfortunately your filter is still going to find nine negative things to panic about and spiral off to everyone positive but here's the part dopamine only peaks for about 20 minutes so from the time you smoke pot and that paranoia starts to come on what you got to say to yourself is oh look at this it's heightened dopamine i'm starting to really pay attention to all the negative stuff if you allow that negative thought to connect to another negative thought to connect to another that once the emotion gets into the system once the fears in the system you're fucked you can't get out of it right because the dope right and it's too strong you'll never win but you can say to yourself oh wow massively heightened pattern recognition really amplifies stuff so for the next 20 minutes i'm gonna only pay attention to the positive thing so when the negative thing comes up you go all right i see that and that's important and thank you for telling me about that but i'm going to pay attention to that about 20 minutes from now i'm not going to disregard it because that would be bad thank you for telling me i'm going to pay attention to that about 20 minutes after i have less dopamine in my system so i don't panic so i can actually lend it like you have a negotiation with yourself based on facts and honest to god and so and just train yourself for that period to pay attention to the positive and just like when the positive comes up you look for it what is the positive in the negative all hot for it and then how does it link to another positive wow and just all so all you that and it will take no if you do that for a month to two months you're going to rewire your brain your brain is going to stop hunting for the negative because marijuana one of the things it's phenomenal for um and this is not my research this is mitch early wines when he was at usc before he went to the university of Kentucky it's phenomenal for state dependent learning right so people make the mistake they think marijuana is really good for sitting on the couch and watching funny cat videos and eating Cheetos yes because that's what they first did when they were stoned but if you what you first did when you were stoned is you use that to create great music and you trained yourself to do that it would never dawn on you but this was actually good for eating Cheetos on the couch right right state dependent learning if you reprogram kind of the front end of the marijuana experience this way spend a couple months doing it just paying attention practicing you'll you won't have this problem again wow oh my god you i'm sorry to say it i think you changed my life in this podcast even that was amazing i holy shit you this work that you're doing is so it's so incredible wow it's it's but remember when i said earlier that with altered states with flow with these things like you have to be adult about it yeah that's what i like all of these states like marijuana it's great for creativity product it can be great for those things but you don't just get to get stoned and think it's gonna happen to you same thing with acid right you got to take psychedelics and go to church to get at right like this is not this is not dude i i'm gonna get stoned at a party or i'm gonna yeah like that's not what we're talking about you're talking about using the technology for very practical purposes yep adult fashion right that's the great discussion that's the the fact that we can have this discussion out loud in public and other people are actually interested in it might want to have this discussion themselves that's cool that's different yes it is steven i cannot thank you enough for giving me so much of your time this has been a mind-blowing episode how how do people find you uh dunk it's been a lot of fun thank you for being such a fun host and taking the conversation so many great places and thank you for the stuff you talk about out loud thanks hey no you're no it's great it's great i like i love it when people are having the discussion in some level of rational fashion right with humor also like then i'm happy i'm psyched so i appreciate i really i just want to let you know that i appreciate what you do in the world you can find me at stevencottler.com or you can find me at the flowgenomeproject.com

Other people never make it out of their head rooms. Spend their whole lives freaking out. I can't taste my own gum anymore. Will I ever taste my gum again? I can't taste my own gum anymore. Will you taste it for me, friend? You're afraid of dying, you're afraid of living. Holding on too tight to what you've been given. All that's left to do is just give it all away. When they ask why, this is what you say. I can't taste my own gum anymore. Will I ever taste my gum again? I can't taste my own gum anymore. Will you taste it for me, friend? That's I Can't Taste My Own Gum Anymore by Neil Cumb, and that is available on Magnavox. I love that song, beautiful song. If you haven't seen Herzog's The Neil Cumb Story, you gotta watch it because it's a beautiful story about somebody who took a terrible thing and turned it into something beautiful. I'm a little late to the Cumb party. I just found out about Neil Cumb recently, but I've been just going through all of his albums. Definitely worth checking out the white album. But Cumb was one of the people who took brown acid at Woodstock, and he lost the ability to taste his own cum, which was very disturbing to him. At the time, his name was Neil Garvasky, but then he changed it to Neil Cumb to kind of celebrate what a lot of people would consider a pretty major disability, because if you can't taste your own cum, then how are you going to tell if it's your cum or someone else's cum that you're tasting? But anyway, he turned what, for a lot of people, would have pretty much, you know, guaranteed them a life of confusion into an incredible music career. Definitely watch the Herzog movie. It's on HBO Max. You're gonna love it. And we've got a wonderful podcast for you today. Matt Dwyer is with us. Not from Matt. I don't know if I'd be podcasting.

Now, friends, it was many moons ago, and the before times, when I was living in Los Angeles and my friend Matt Dwyer invited me to be on a thing called a podcast. I didn't know what it was. I just went downtown where I met him and Matt Bronger. And we just talked. I don't even remember what the podcast was about. We just talked for an hour or two. And it was fun. It was a blast. And that was my first podcast. And it was after that that I told Natasha Legere, and she said, I really should. I just did this thing called a podcast. And then we started a podcast together. So Matt Dwyer is the reason I would say, or one of the reasons that the DTFH exists. You should check out his podcast. It's called Conversations with Matt Dwyer. He's an awesome person, a longtime friend, and I love him. Now everybody, welcome to the DTFH Matt Dwyer. Matt, welcome to the DTFH. Do you know you're the first podcast I ever did? Really? As a guest? You and Matt Bronger. Oh, when we did Matt's radio? Yep. That was the first podcast I ever did. And I think because that was so much fun, that's what started the ball rolling for me to become a podcaster. That's funny because I attribute you to, because when I did your podcast as a guest, long ago, you were living, I think, in Atwater. And I was at a crossroads because I was like, what the fuck I'm doing with my life. And you were like, you should do a podcast. And it never... So I was always like, oh, Duncan Saris and I do podcasts. Weird. That's like some kind of time travel paradox. Not really, but I thought I'd just say time travel paradox. By the way, if you all hear a fan in the background, Matt is in LA. There's a motherfucking heat wave. We're not gonna... He's leaving that thing on. Oh, I can turn it off. Can you hear that? I can hear it, but I don't want you to get... No, I don't want you to turn it off. We can work with it. It's not that hot yet. Yeah, but still, just be comfortable. It's okay. People understand. I mean, you're getting scorched out there, right? What's the temperature out there? It's... You know, it's weird because it's like... They keep saying it's gonna be like 100 and then it'll be just like 80 or 90. It's 80... No, that can't be right. It says it's 66 right now. That's because... Well, that's because there's a heat scam. Yeah, the heat scam. Do you know about the heat scam? Yeah, they make it up. Yeah, they don't want... They, for some reason, they want people to think like the West is heated up or there's a drought. I remember when... You know what I did the day before I left LA when everyone was talking about there being a drought and a heat wave? What'd you do? Tube down a river. It was like 70 degrees, really wonderful day. Cool. So too much water in California, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We just run our faucets just for kicks. It helps. Well, cool. Yeah, it helps. It keeps the air clean. A lot of people don't know that if you run your faucet it runs out the carbon. Because the air blows against the faucet and it cleans the air. Yeah. A lot of people get these air filters and they're not... You're not getting clean air. You're just basically... You're getting like a diseased person's breath blown through a diaper. That's all an air filter is. But you run that water. Yeah. What do you use to wash your hands? Exactly. Diapers. So why wouldn't... Why wouldn't you use what God intended us to use to clean things, water? Yeah, and only water. No sponges, no soap, just water. All you need is water. All you need when... I undergo many surgeries a week and any time I go in I'm like, please don't use any kind of alcohol or just water, like classic style. Just use water the natural way. Matt, the natural way. Everybody, Matt Dwyer, is an anti-vaxxing pediatrician. I think the worst thing you can... I haven't vaccinated any of my kids. My wife went into... She had two C-sections. They just used water and they gave her just a half shot of bourbon before she... All you need. All you need. Apple. Apple in the mouth, belt in the mouth. It's all you need. Oh, Matt. They need to feel the pain to understand the sins that they've caused men to commit. Matt Dwyer, everybody, anti-vaxxer misogynistic pediatrician. He was at the... He was at that rally that they're now trying to call it insurrection. That wasn't an insurrection. Was it, Matt? No. What was it? What would you call it? I think it was like a parade. It was like a celebration of our capital. It was really what I saw going on there. Yeah, the way it's supposed to be. Now, I don't want to get too political though, man. You know, you're one of my... Like, I've known you so long. And we have so many weird memories together. But I was thinking, like, what are we going to talk about? But holy shit, man. How about the fact that you just did a show with John Lorre? Like, that's nuts. I'm still kind of mystified by it, to be quite honest. Like, it was one of those situations that just... Like, came together in the weirdest way, and I was just like... I don't know, it's weird. Because like, since high school, John Lorre has been a figure that anybody in a creative like, world is just like, oh, this guy, he does everything, he paints, he's an artist, he's a musician. And so, when it came together, I was just like, I'm like working with a guy I've... Not idolized, that's the wrong. But admired greatly since I was a teenager. It was surreal. It came through a podcast, though. Like, this was directly podcast related, right? Yeah, he followed me on Twitter some years ago. And then, one time, I'd like commented on some tweet of his, and then he wrote to me, and he was like, sorry, I took that down. And I was like, okay. I was like, I never write anybody when they delete a tweet. But thanks. And then, over the years, we just started like, messaging back and forth. And finally, I asked him to do the podcast, and he was like... He was reluctant, and he would keep going back and forth. And he was like, yeah, I don't know. And then, one day, he just called me, and I put it up on my Patreon. And actually, I think after the episode that I did with him on the podcast, I put some of his voicemails at the very end, because it was just like, all right, well, I guess we won't do this. But he was calling from an unidentified... Like, he wouldn't give me his number, because he had this crazy stalker years ago. So he's still paranoid about that, which I've been stalked. I get it. It's the worst. But I thought he was coming on to plug the TV show, because he sent me all these clips. And then, five minutes into the podcast, he's like, yeah, I don't know what I'm going to do with this. And I immediately was like, oh, I know what to do with this. I'm friends with Adam McKay. So I waited after the interview. And I was like, hey, I can send this to Adam McKay if you're interested. And he was kind of not really certain who Adam was. Right. But Adam, like, I sent it to Adam and then put them in touch in like a month later. Like, I've never seen anything sell so quick, but it's Adam McKay. I could probably... And John Lurie. And John Lurie, who's like, yeah, I mean, a legend. So to me, the story is so cool. And you all made a great show on HBO. The story is so cool, because it just shows that if you just keep doing the thing, like whatever it is, something like that will happen. But you could... I guess what I'm saying is, a year ago, you probably couldn't predict that that would happen. But as you're thinking about the possible things you're going to be working on, I bet that wasn't on a list of things. Maybe it was. No. And I had no intention of being a part of it. I just... What John sent me was like raw footage of like what the show was going to be. It wasn't even like a full episode. He sent me like 15 minutes. And I was like, I just wanted to facilitate. I was like, this is great. This should be out in the world. And he... I don't know if he has agents or anything anymore. He lives in an island in the Caribbean. So he's just sort of off in his own world. And I just wanted to help. And when Adam was like, oh yeah, you'll get a producer credit and we'll pay you. I was like, fuck, that's way more than... And at the time, like Mike, wife and I had been struggling for like almost four... I left a secure job at CBS because I was ready to put a shotgun in my mouth because corporate, corporate, man. What was the light? What was the job? You know what I did? I did for a year and eight months. I was a sensor. I did program standards and practices. What? I hated it. You had to sense you. So you like somehow became like something knowing you, the antithesis. It's like, it's like someone working. It's someone from PETA. Get a good job at a slaughterhouse. Yeah. And it was, but it was like, I just had my first baby. And I don't know if you've experienced this, but like when I had my first kid, there was a bit of like an identity crisis. Like I was, I was like, I don't know who I am. Like there's no like, what do you call it? Like a ceremony or anything to say goodbye. Like a morning, the old you. Because you know, I went from drunk fucking idiot who did nothing to suddenly being like, oh fuck, I got to be a dad, a dad. And I don't know what that means because I didn't really have one. It's like, and I literally had moments where I was like, so do I start like wearing cargo shorts and flip flop? Like there was that, like there was that like sort of like, who am I now? So I took this job because I was like, well, this is what a responsible dad does instead of bartending and do shots all night. And I hated it. It was just such a surreal and I'd have to go to, and I know this is ego, but I'd have to go and work on sitcoms and like be like, you can't say that to my friends who I started comedy with. It was like, like it was humiliating, man. And maybe, maybe that's bullshit because I was, but you know what, it also didn't pay that well. Like I thought it was like, okay, I'll have health insurance and I'll make, you know, but it's like, I was just as broke as I was when I was doing anything else in my life. So I was like, well, if I'm going to be broke. So one day I just quit. I was just like, fuck this, I can't take this. Tell me about your first day of work there. They took me down to the prices right so I could learn. Really? Yeah. I would hear Drew, Drew, Carrie talk about you here and there. And I'd, because I'd sit like two chairs away from him when he was like on his breaks. And I, I was so ashamed of what I was doing. I didn't want to be like, oh yeah, Duncan's my, like strike up a conversation, which I would have done in any other situation. I was just like, and he, he had done a show of mine, a fundraiser I did for a Black Panther like years ago to raise money for his, this orphanage, which is not the way to call it. Anyway, community center. Foster community center. But, and I never wanted to bring that up to him either. I was like, well, he clearly doesn't remember me, but I was so ashamed of this job, which is like the joke. Like for years on television, they make fun of the censors like Saturday Night Live would they're made fun of in Woody Allen movies. We've got the last laugh on that one, Woody. But, but I mean, the thing is, it's not like you, like you've been given a list of, you know, you can't, these are the things you can't say. And your job is just to tell people, you can't say that. That's all you just call them up or something. You're looking at, how does it work? You're watching some feed and you're like, ah, you, you can't say that. You can't say fisting the ass of a monkey on the crisis, right? There's also, there's also, well, Price is right is also because of game shows of the the game show scam in the fifties where people were cheating and making money. So there's that for that, we're there to be like legitimate and make sure they're not cheating or that the contestants are protected. But for like sitcoms and stuff, we would get multiple drafts of the scripts and we would read them and we'd have to like, you have to look out for like product, like name dropping products because a lot of writers would, I've known writers who've done that, who they'd sneak in things on Saturday Night Live and then get like, you know, a year free of Baja Fresh. What? Yeah. Horatio Sands did that. He said Baja Fresh in a sketch and then they sent him all kinds of swag. Holy shit. That's amazing. So there's like an underground network of writers connected to corporations and there's a sort of like, they just know, look, if you can work this in, this explains every Jay Leno monologue. I think sometimes the networks on board with that stuff and they'll do like with that. I don't think there's like a legitimate, like I don't think Horatio was like, oh, but I think there's like a thing like it's a known thing like, oh, maybe we'll get a gift for saying this. I don't think they could, but like Lenny Bruce would do that. Lenny Bruce would have a bit where he's like, yeah, I roll cigarettes up in my sleeve and then he'd go on the Tonight Show and he'd say Marlboro's and he would have his agent contact Marlboro. So some people have done that. Yeah. I mean, there's, I've seen a lot of different montages of like various like late night hosts, you know, working in something that that they're selling, you know, my favorite way to actually listen to the late night hosts do their monologues beats headphones. I'm a Sony headphone guy. That's what I'm wearing right now. Sony. That's great. Sony headphones are great. Yeah. And they have a Sony plus now where you can get all the movies, stream all the movies. I just, I don't know why I brought that up. I just, I just really appreciate the films and television Sony has put out. You know, my favorite kind of Instagram commercial or headphones commercials on Instagram because there's no way to demonstrate how good the headphone is other than getting some actor to put the headphone on and go, oh my God. You know, like it's the funniest thing because it's just like these people react to the headphones like they're hearing the sound of like the Ark of the Covenant being open. Holy shit.

I got to tell you this is to me like after I went through the period that you're talking about and I was not a fun period, which is a kind of like it's like it's definitely something it's like shedding a kind of skin. You're shedding this like version of yourself that didn't have anyone depending on them at all. You're you're including yourself. Basically, you would you ought to be like if you're us some people some single people obviously are like like have a lot. A lot of people are supporting but for I know you and you know me like you let this part of yourself that was like innately selfish right only because selfish in the sense that what else? Who are you? Who do you have to serve? You know you're just serving yourself. You you're you're because that's who you're taking care of. You're in charge of just feeding you. You're in charge of just paying your rent. You're in charge of all these things that are just solely related to you as an individual. Then you have a kid and it's like now it's all about we got to get health care. We got to get food for the kid. We got to get rent. I need a stable life. I can't die. I can no longer fantasize. You know what I mean? Like I can't do the thing I was doing was like ah whatever. Maybe I'll overdose going to the next life who gives a fuck. You can't do that anymore. Now you have been for better or for worse. I think for better anchored to the earth and by your responsibility because you decided to bring a life in the planet. And from to me I think what that does is it kind of makes anything that you're doing. Holy or you know anything. Yeah you're a sensor but you're not a sensor. You're a dad and the reason you're going to do that satanic job is because you got to support your kids. You know it's beautiful. Yeah. It's love based. You know it's I mean it's not like you're like Lockheed Martin making cluster bombs. Yeah but I was like. Yeah but it was pretty gross. I mean and it was a growth and it was right around the time that the less moon vets sexual harassment stuff started breaking. So it was like interesting to see people like men at that company just worshiped him there. He's a great guy. No one. He's old school. No one does what he does. And I was like it seems like a piece of shit to me. Yeah. But it was just and that culture was like you know I had bosses who hassled me and were dicks to me and like I went to HR once and HR is what I learned. Because I never worked a corporate job. They're just there to protect the company. So I wasn't protected. I just made my life worse. It's like. Right. They're like oh fuck we got a troublemaker when you go there. It's not like they're there to like you know scold whoever was a dick to you. You had a you had a shitty boss there. Yeah I had a couple shitty bosses and I in their defense I was a shitty employee because I would leave for lunch often and just be like I'm going home. Yeah. Who's going to know. Yeah. Because I hated it. Like the last year I was there like I started in January. So then like I used all my sick and personal days within like a few months because I hated it so much. And I was like at May or June and I had nothing. I couldn't call it sick anymore. So you're just locked in. I was like and then I just you know it's weird is Martin Schwartz memoir snapped me out of it because I was like I just felt like I wasn't doing anything creative. I felt I felt completely lost and I was making Kelly my wife miserable because I was just like had nothing like creative and it was making me crazy. And I think I strayed I know as being responsible to my family but I strayed away from who I was and who and I totally did not like not just sound cliche like I was not nourishing myself creatively or emotionally. Yeah. And I was just numbing myself with booze really. Yeah. That Costco card that you get when you're dead also comes with really sweet cheap booze. Do you have a Costco card. No I know. And I'm not saying that because they're giving me money. Well it's a wonderful company and they are giving me they do send me lots of things. They send me a lot of one like get they send me 100 pound crates of apples. You know I remember when I got my Costco card and I and when I got it these this was still in the like mid early. It seems like Costco there was a weird thing that happened with Costco or people were proud of their cart. You know what I mean. Like my my dad was kind of proud of his Costco card and like you know you go in and he would show his card like like he was showing like some high level security clearance to get into a government laboratory or something. But you know I was excited. You go into Costco you're excited as fuck because you have in your mind somehow you're going to save so much money. And then you leave Costco and you've paid like six hundred dollars for like all it like quarts of yogurt and a knife set and some leg. You know what I mean. Like it's too much. I don't like going in there. It's just too it's too much. I can't deal with it and the lines are fucked up. But yeah Costco booze I never I never tried it. But booze I have tried and it definitely is not a great solution to having a shitty job. At least that's been my experience. No. No I was. Costco tequila was pretty good and I could put down a big bottle of that. I was putting down a lot. You drink when I when we are friends you are drinking a lot like you are like I bought into the myth. I bought into the myth. Like I and it's funny because now that I had quit I've thought about a lot of like there's a lot of masculine toxic masculine masculinity attached to it. It's like men drink and you're like oh you're feeling angry. You have a drink. You're feeling sad. You have a drink. It's like all this shit that was like crammed in my head about it. It's like really part of our culture and it's like it's not healthy like to step back and analyze it that way. It's not like mushrooms. If you take mushrooms you're like oh I'm going to go expand my mind and have a spiritual journey. It's like whiskey. What what like have you ever looked back at a moment in your life. It's like man I should have had two more shots at that party. That would have really been. You never look back at a moment. I should have drank more. I should have drank more. No never. But you know I said the right thing with those 15 beers I had. I said all the right stuff. I have noticed though that like now that like you know I've figured out a way to like moderate that part of myself where I can just have like a glass of wine or two then go to bed. You know what I mean. Like I have noticed that there is a quality to it that is the reason it's so celebrated the reason that it's like looked upon like religiously and mystically and stuff like that is because if you can like control the demon inside of you. And not like every single night get hammered just because you had one drink. Then there's something to it. You know there's there is something not nice to it. And but yeah if you can't do that. Then I can't. Yeah. A lot of people. A lot of people can't. And and I mean Jesus Christ man having like I'm sorry. I talk about this too much for having like experienced true. I got addicted to ketamine for like a year. Oh God. Yes. Oh my God. So addicted. So addicted. It was it was it was ridiculous. And when was this when this when was this. This this was like before our our children you know but the the the like right right around there you know I it was like when I just like it was so gross man and it wasn't doing anything for me. And it was like it wasn't even I wasn't even achieving the effect that I like about it. And so I was just addicted. You know it was humiliating. It was just a confrontation with the reality of like that. Look it doesn't matter like it doesn't matter how cool how cool you think you are how spiritual think you are how strong you might think you are this or that. There is more than likely some substance out there that once you get wound up and it it it's not quite as easy to get out of it as you thought. And I don't think there's anything to be ashamed about it. I'm glad I experienced it. I'm glad I experienced it because it taught me a lot. It taught me a lot about like free will and it taught me a lot about like the incredible deception that that drugs and of all kind. Like achieve in a person's life. It fucked it fucked with my ego. And I think that it distorted my ego. And I think that in a lot of ways probably affected my career and how I approached my career and being like I'm fucking great. That's just like yeah not good. No no humility at all. Special like and I just it's it's been to sift through who I was is kind of embarrassing. Wayne Kramer once he was like I was at his office and he was looking at pictures. There was like pictures of him when he was in the MC5 and he's like I don't even know who that guy is anymore because it was just like a drug fueled lunatic. It's so cool to realize that you reincarnate multiple times in any given lifetime. And that's one of that's what I've loved about being a dad is it's taught me a lot about reincarnation and it's taught me a lot about like past lives which you know I love thinking about that stuff you know like. People get caught up in it thinking about God what was I in my last life. What was I before I was born it's like what the fuck were you 10 years ago. Do you remember 10 years ago what you were how much of that do you even remember. You know when you look back a decade ago you might have some foggy memory of it but it's foggy and warped and especially if you are like. Partying you probably don't remember much of it at all so it might as well be another incarnation. And there was one before that and one before that and one before that it's just in between those various states of our life. There is just like what you said there isn't like a death experience in the normal sense you're not on a slab. You know what I mean and it usually happens kind of gradually it's for some people it happens suddenly some people have like sudden you know strokes or heart attacks or whatever. But sometimes it's just this slow thing and then suddenly you realize that's not me anymore. I'm looking at it I have on my wall here a picture of my brother and me when we were kids and it's like I see this little boy that I used to be but that's not me. You know that's that was a different life that was it is me in the sense that we have the same DNA but that was a different life. Yeah. This podcast is sponsored by BetterHelp.

I've been questioning a lot about how much of I think what mentally and spiritually ills us as humans is western thought. Does that sound weird? Say it again? The western thought and how ingrained puritanical thought is within us. There's this striving for perfection to be like Jesus or whatever. We have all this preconceived garbage in our head from the get-go that is ingrained in us culturally. Was that too vague? No. When you start looking at the guilt complexes you have, it's so fun to imagine. The reason you have those guilt complexes is because they're tied into a literal cult that was in this country not that long ago. They came up with ethical systems, the morality systems that now are so burnt into us that probably epigenetically. Who knows? Probably somehow coded into the fucking proteins of our body or these ideas of like, well, this is the way, this is what's good and this is what's bad. And I think it's scary for people to start playing around with that idea of maybe what you think is bad isn't bad. Maybe what you think is good isn't necessarily good. Just because you think it, especially if you haven't examined it, especially if you haven't spent any amount of time looking at like, why do I think that thing that I did was bad? And then you start examining it. I'm trying to think of some basic like, well, you know, for the longest time I used to beat myself up because I just felt like I wasn't there for my mom when she was dying as much as I could have been. And so I went through a nice few years of really, really playing an internal game with myself where I would just like dramatically just think that I'd failed my mother and her last days on earth. And it was a big drama and it was bleeding into my relationships and bleeding into my life. But now that I've gotten enough distance between then and now and I can look back at myself then, just like what we were saying earlier, I realized like that was a different, I was a different person then. I was half asleep most of the time. I was running away from myself. I was running away from responsibility. I was running away from connection. I was terrified of death. I was, you know what I mean? There are all these things back then that, so when I look back and I think, fuck, the fact that you're able to do anything, the fact that you were able to like be there for her in the way you were, the fact that you were able to like, you know, handle it the way that you handled it is just fine. Like, you know, because that, you were, I guess it's a cliche thing to say, but most people are doing their best, even if that doesn't look like their best to others or even to themselves. Yeah. And death is a mother, like, I think I've been fortunate because I had death as a lot as a kid. Yeah, you did. But I think, but it also fucked, fucked like everybody handles death the wrong, like if my mom dies and she's always like, he sort of guilt me because I have a couple of brothers I don't really get along with. It's like, well, you'll all have to talk at my funeral and I'm like, I might not go. Not as any disrespect for you, but I find that form of saying goodbye to somebody is antiquated and gross and it's, I'm there for other people, not really for my process. And it's like, I have to figure out what I want to do when, in those situations, which is another, I think, cultural and socialization thing that's pounded into us is like, how we approach death and how we deal with death. And I don't think Americans specifically have a healthy, any healthy thoughts about it or rituals. And which is, you know, we're a fucked up society. Well, we're, you know, we're sort of, we, we went through as a society, we like went through a huge shift. We became really time based. We became industrialized. We became technological. And a lot of the ethics and morality that we have seem to be more connected to like work, like what like factory worker morality than even to religion, you know, like a lot of the way. Concept. Yeah. And people are fucking, you know, this is why when you're late, when someone's late, like me included. We have this inordinate response. It doesn't make sense how freaked out. We're like, oh my God, I'm so sorry. Am I four minutes late? I'm so sorry. Oh my God, look, I'm 10 minutes late. Oh shit. And then you look at that, that reaction, you realize like, oh, like this is some kind of weird expression of what's the word, fealty, like some expression of like, let me, let me bow to you. Oh, great factory worker boss. Only it's my friend that I was late. You know, I don't want to lose my job. I don't need the coal for the winter. So that's kind of burnt. That's hard baked into a lot of people. Punctuality is the most important thing. Never be late. Punctuality. But when you look at that from the perspective of pre-industrial revolution, that was not how people lived at all. According to some anthropologists, I've read David Graber. Have you read him at all? No. He's fucking awesome. Look, in the back, like pre-industrial revolution, there was a time where clocks were kind of a novelty. You know what I mean? Like that idea of time was like weird to people. They were going more by daylight than by seconds, you know, but we've become so crucified into time right now that were, and we had to be that way because that's how you run a factory. You know, that's how, if you're going to like mass produce shit, you don't just need machines. You need people acting like machines, right? Like to interact with the machines. They need to be like machines. They need to be there on time. If we don't have William on the fucking, that spot in the, in the assembly line, then the whole system gets thrown because we got to get someone else to come in to do his spot who hasn't been fully trained. That's going to fuck us up a little bit. And so don't be fucking late. Don't be fucking late. Punch that clock. Don't be late. It's weird, but that got into us. Now we're like that. Now we're like that. Yeah. I've been following this non-binary activist on Instagram and they were saying this interesting thing about like how they thought who they were because of socialization. And I was like, and like the journey that it took for this person to become open and free and accepting of their non-binary status. But that made me think about like just how in general it's like, how the fuck do I know who I am? Like I've been socialized in so many ways. Like I don't know how many layers of mental and spiritual materialism has been layered onto me that I don't like, I might not know who the fuck I am. I might think I know and I think most people may think they do. I'm like, maybe all of us are just wandering around like completely detached from reality, self-reality and external reality. You ever have that experience where you are in a shitty phase in your life? You wake up in the morning and you've got about 30 seconds where you're just purely experiencing life before whatever neurological machine starts. Booting up the apps of despair. You know what I mean? Like you wake up and it's like, it's the most perfect day. You wake up and you're like, what a great day. This is, oh my fucking God. I got in a fight with my girlfriend and I threw a cup at the wall. You know what I mean? What's wrong with me? I've got an anger problem. Something's fucking wrong with me. I'm drinking too much. Oh my God, I'm getting fucking old. Shit, I barely, oh, I got a shit. Why did I eat oysters? We ate 30 oysters last night. You know what I mean? But like right before that kicks in, you wake up and you're like, oh man, these sheets feel good. This bed feels good. This is so nice. And then, now you become yourself. This is what I think we actually are. We're whatever is before the story. And the story is most certainly has parts of it that have been completely injected into us by our culture, by our parents. You know, that's a huge part of the story. You know, how you dress, what kind of, you know, what clothes are okay to wear, clothes are not okay to wear. And yeah, it's very controversial because people want to believe that the story is real versus direct experience with reality, which is so bizarre. Do you see your kids picking up social, like I see my daughter, she's five, picking up things from TV shows. And like sometimes she'll say things like, I'm like, where the fuck do you get this? Yeah. And like stuff I don't like, but I'm like, what do I do? Like, I don't like it. And then I'm like, what is she layering on? And like, how do I, like, I'm literally trying to figure out, like, how do I raise a decent human being, but also be conscious of what bullshit they're layering on themselves or I'm layering on them? It's like, do you get caught up in that trippy shit? Well, yeah. Like, I got to ask, I asked Ram Dass, one of my teachers, like, I said, I'm going to have a, you know, how can I be a great dad? How can I be a good dad? And he, he, man, he was so cool. He had a big smile and he's like, that's a role. That's a role. That's, you know, that's, that's not you. Like, that's a role that you've given yourself and that, and here's where it gets really maybe controversial. Your son, that's a role for him too. You're applying that role. This is my son. I'm, I'm the dad. You're the son. And it's true on one level. It's true. But on another level, from my perspective, we're, we're souls, not the roles that we take on. So the roles are there and they are real. And in the game of existence, obviously we need, we need them in place, but they shouldn't take precedent. They're there. For me, I just, I try to keep, I always try to drop back in to the, before the story. And the reason I do that is because if I, the more I do that, the more I am, the more I feel grounded and happy. And then in that place, I can be, I can do what the necessary. I can play the role of father better. Cause otherwise I'm going to get, I'm going to get like reactive in the weirdest way because, you know, my father was very strict. We were scared of him. We were scared of his anger. And so that means that I might be too soft with forest. You know what I mean? I might be too soft with the kids because I don't want to be that kind of dad. I don't want to be a dad where like my kids are looking at my face to see if I'm about to like blow up or explode. I want to be a stay, a stable dad. But that being said, if forest has decided to like slap his little brother in the face, you know what I mean? That's a time where you do have to make sure that like he understands this is not okay. You can't slap. And, and the, I don't know what did the little brother do? Are they gambling? Cause if it's gambling, yeah. They both got into that fucking infant casino website. And I guess like Dune like ended up like forest is a very good, is very good at poker. Like he's, and I don't know where he gets that from cause I'm not a great gambler. So he made a lot of money. And I guess Dune like decided got into his account. That's forced, that's forced fault because his password was ABC, which is a lot of like, he thought it was amazing cause he's just learning alphabet. But it's like, like, anyway, the point is like Dune put the entire amount on like roulette and like, you know, completely lost all his money. So he slapped him. But it's like, you can't, it's not okay. Matt, you can't slap. I don't care. I don't care if you lost. I don't care. If your children do your churl or your children do gambling now it's a epidemic across the country, man. Yeah, they're both gambling. Dave, I've caught them running like a craps game out of the garage several times. Oh my God. Oh my God. And they're serving liquor. Yeah. They love it. Kids love to drink. Yeah. Tilly is like one, but she makes a great old fashioned. No. Yeah. Forest is like a big Bloody Mary kid. But yeah, it's, it's, you know, it's just like you get back. You are, you come into their room in the morning and you know, you realize they haven't gone to sleep from the night before. You know what I mean? There's chips all over the crib. You're like, where'd you go? He won't say. But the other night I looked out and saw like a little tiny helicopter flying away. So I think one of his friends has a helicopter or something. And he's flying a game. Do you ever find yourself learning? Like sometimes my daughter says profound things. I'm just like, what? Like my daughter became a role model for me for a while. Have you ever had like, cause she's so optimistic and enthusiastic about everything. There was a period where I was like, I need more of that. Like I don't know what she's tapped into and I don't want to fuck that up for her. Yeah. Cause I feel like I was her in a lot of ways when I was a kid and you know, somebody fucked that stuff up for me. Story. That's a story. Just not cause that's what we're talking about. That's a story. That thing you're saying, that's a story. That's one of your stories. And like getting familiar with those stories is really fun because the more you start realizing, oh yeah, that's just a story that you tell yourself that you got fucked up as a kid. I'm not saying, and by the way, not advocating, ignoring childhood trauma or any of that stuff. I'm just saying that it's really interesting to start like looking at the different stories you tell yourself. Like I tell the story of the angry father. I tell the story of the guilty son. I tell the story of getting addicted to Academy. I tell the story of, you know what I mean? And all these stories make up sort of the map of my life. And it's so delightful to do exactly the thing that, you know, anytime you've been on enough acid, if you look at a map and you just realize like that's just a bunch of fucking lines. Somebody came up with somebody decided to name it that that's a landmass. That's not, you know what I mean? That's not California. That's not Texas. That's not, you know, this is just any basic stone or take on things. But similarly, when you look at the, that map that you've created of your own life and just for a second, give yourself a break and just imagine it's totally wrong. It's not real. It's, it's not, that isn't the case at all. It's just some, you're just keeping it alive. Like the reason there's a Texas is because everybody in Texas agrees there's a fucking Texas. You know what I mean? If like that's why and everyone in the world just does this, oh yeah, Texas, it looks like that. It's got that fucking boot, whatever. It's Texas. It's Texas. But like, it's not Texas. That's just something that a bunch of people named Texas after they colonize the place. And it's like, before that, it was called something else. Before that, it was called something else. Anyway, the point is, that's just a story about the fucked up thing. And yes, I do learn from my kids to answer your question. Yeah, they're definitely role models sometimes. Have you found yourself or have you ever tried to change? Not change, not try to change. Like, I've been working the last couple of years to change the way I think about my story and the way I address things, because I think a lot of times I would address things in life because I was reacting from who I thought I was or who the story was, which was often negative and sort of self-deprecating and sort of put myself down a lot, which is not healthy, but it was like the way I learned to navigate through things. Well, you know, I'm kind of a fucked up. And it's like, I'm like, I don't want to be that dude. Because even if you take that on as a character sometimes, which I think we also can be or I have been performative in my life, where I'm like, oh, I'll just put a little fucking joke here and there and be a little, and that's how I get the girl to like me. And it's like, it's not being real. And I don't want to be that presentation or I didn't want to be that presentation anymore. Yeah. I think a lot of us do is it's also where you can't, we're trained not to present ourselves honestly, because what if we're not liked or this is what is liked on TV and film. And God knows, TV and film gets everything right. Well, yeah, I mean, fuck it does. It's like, that's definitely what I'm trying to model myself after most of the time is like, you know, John Wayne. Yeah. There's a shit about like beauty. And I'm like, where the fuck is this coming from? Like these, you know, like it's how she's already at the age of five has the importance of image in her head. And I'm like, I don't know what like we monitor what she watches pretty. I'm like, where is this coming from? Do you have that with you? Like I wonder what the flip of that is for boys. Well, he's, you know, he's a little younger, but we go on hikes up in the forest sometimes. And like, there's a, you know, the author, Annie Lamont. No, she said something really brilliant, which is if you want your kids to connect to God, teach them to love nature. I just think it's the most brilliant thing to say because, you know, regardless of what you want to call the sum total of all things. There is something so spectacular about when you go into a full for me when I go into a forest. It's just wild because it's like this game that we're all playing on this side of the forest immediately stops when you're in the forest. Like there's no cars, traffic lights. There's no like, especially up here in the mountains, you're, you're a lot. You can find places where you're just alone. A whole new set of laws is happening. Natural law, the, you know, rivers flowing downhill and the way that like light shines through like green leaves and the sounds of a forest. And so like we're, we're walking up there or I'm driving up to this place we like to hike at. And I'm like, Forrest, this is God. This is God. And so he's, he goes, wow, I want to touch God. I want to hold God. It was like, oh, that's the most beautiful wild. Yeah, it's wild. But what you did to me, maybe the reason it seems wild to us is because we aren't that level of wild. Like what's more wild than a kid? That's a primordial wild creature mentally, physically that the, the, the, like all those things were the story. They haven't built up the story to tell themselves yet. And so raw, they're experiencing raw reality in the most beautiful way. And, you know, this is actually one of the ideas about like, you know, people who are enlightened is that that's, they're not, it's not like they're studying or something. It's just that because they've sort of figured out or managed to or however you want to put it, because they're not so much connected to their story anymore. And because they are connected to that, whatever that is, they just say the most perfect, beautiful things you've ever heard all the time. It just instantly pops out of them. It just that because that's what we are as I've been taught. That's just what humans are. Like underneath the story, it's everybody is like that. Everyone is like not just like a child because children can have no self control and can be like incredibly temperamental and like sometimes like accidentally violent. But I mean, like fundamentally good. And underneath the story, that's the, that's what I think. Yeah, I it's interesting. Because I think of my daughter, I think of her as fundamentally good. And she says these sweet, poetic, wonderful things just without thinking often. Like once the sun and the moon both were out at the same time. And she's like, the moon stayed out because it fell in love with the sun. It was just such a simple poetic thing. But I was like, wow, that's really like that's a great line. Yeah. And I said, no, it's not. Love doesn't exist. There's no love. Yeah. That's, you know, that's a big story of the day too. All those things is like, yeah, I, I, I, yeah. To me, I, when I'm with, when I'm getting to hang out with the kids, I, the, uh, my meditation teacher's teacher. Chokin Chopin Rinpoche had kids and he said, the best thing you can do with your kids is be fully in the moment with them. So what I, what I, which is really intense, I'm sure you know, when you're hanging, playing with them to drop out of your game and into like the reality of what their reality is, including how big everything seems to them. You know, cause I think that's something people, parents forget about their kids is like that playroom that to you maybe doesn't seem quite as big, you know, to your kid is like a fucking basketball court, you know, depending on how old they are. You're a giant. You know what I mean? Compared to them. So like sitting down, getting to their, getting down to their eye level and then going into the moment and realizing like, you know, you might not remember your summers or you might not remember your, what it was like to like be in the like experience of childhood completely. But if you drop into their level, you'll remember, remember, it's just incredible. It's like, it's, it's an every day is this like adventure. Every day is like this wild thing. So yeah, um, yeah, I think we're all, I mean, that's, I think that's what one of the get what beautiful things about parenting is you get reminded that that's you too. You're still like that. You know, you're, you're still like that, you know, you, you still shit your pants. I almost did last night. I was a little stomach sick overnight. But yeah, it's, I get, I've been upset with myself lately because I can't sometimes I'm playing with my daughter and I can't fully give into it and I get bored and I get anxious. And it's just, but I feel guilt about it because I'm like, I'm 90% of the time right now. I'm her only playmate and I have to, she comes to me and it's like, do you want to play? And that's like, sometimes I'm like, you know, on my phone or she also does this thing where she's very dictatorial about she's like, okay, now you say this and you do this. And I'm like, well, and that gets kind of, it's hard to like play when you're being. Yeah. No, I'm also is fulfilling a fantasy of hers that she's seen or something or created. So I have to accommodate, but sometimes it's challenging. Well, you got to like, look, forest is a little dictator man. When we get, we got a trampoline and I'll get on the trampoline. I'm 47 man. Like, and like he's like, daddy jump, daddy jump now. So I'll start jumping, we'll jump and jump and jump. And then I'm like, I got to sit down and he'll be like, daddy, but daddy jump, daddy jump. It's like, I'll just say, you know, that to me, it's like part of like playing is like, if you get to tell me to jump, if we get to pretend that we're chickens or whatever, then I can pretend my legs don't work anymore. They stop working for us that then, you know, but yeah, this is what something that popped into my head. Uh, as I was having like a classic parent reaction, you know, I'm, we're forced as in a creek playing in a creek, throwing rocks in a creek. I'm sitting watching him throw rocks in the creek and I'm thinking, oh my God, oh, if I could only save you from the pain of the world and oh my God, time is moving by so quickly. How can I hold on to this sacred moment and, oh, one day you're going to grow up and you won't remember any of this. And, oh, and then I'm, all of a sudden I realized like Jesus Christ, if he, he's just playing with rocks. You know what I mean? He's like in the creek throwing rocks. He's like trying to make a dam. He's like interested in like trying to pick up a big rock and drop it in the creek. Meanwhile, I'm having some kind of like, I don't know, the craziest existential nihilistic pendulum, pendulum between nihilism and like, well, but maybe we'll live forever in heaven back to nihilism. This kid just playing with fucking water. And so that's when I try to drop back in, just like get out of that level, drop back in and start like throwing rocks with him. Because like, if I can give him anything, it's just being with him and not seemingly being with him while I'm in some kind of modeling interior sort of confrontation with my own mortality. You know? Yeah. My daughter has experienced everything in life already in my head because I'm always like, oh my God, like there's so many things just like, but it's like, I want her, I think it stems from I want her to hold on to that. An element of that innocence. And I don't know if that's even possible. Yeah. You know, but as long as possible, or that, or at least the curiosity, because man, if you lose your curiosity in life, and I did for a while, I got really stuck in my ways. That's one of the reasons I brought back the podcast because I was like, I literally, my brain was mushy. Like I couldn't function as like, I couldn't speak as well. Like I was just having a hard time socializing. And I just felt like I allowed my brain. So I picked up a book of poetry and started reading it. And then actually, the book of poetry was like, when I found one of the authors in it, I was like, ended up being one of my first guests when I came back with the podcast. And like, ever since I did that, it's like really, it just ignited curiosity again. Yeah. And like, just you can't stop. Like that's why people fucking just, you know, those, when people grow old and they sit in front of the TV and just eat cocoa puffs. That's a direct reference to my grandmother. Cocoa puffs. Really? Well, it was not my literal grandfather. It was the woman who raised my father, but she just, her mind went to fucking garbage, but she just sat in front of a TV and ate like, Yeah. Children's Theocereal. Yeah. I'm like, you can't fucking do that. You can't physically or mentally, you gotta keep agile. Or not. I mean, you could decide just to, you know, to hang it up. That's true. I mean, maybe that her mushy thoughts were quite comforting in her own reality that she enjoyed. I mean, who the fuck knows? I mean, like, like the, I know what you mean, though. And to me, it's like, I think there's a fundamental question. Anyone who is deciding to have kids or has had kids, hopefully that you think ask yourself this before you have the kids, which is, is it worth it? Is life worth it? Is it worth it here? Like, you know, is all the fucking sorrows and all the disappointments and all the heartbreak and all the anger and all the confusion and all of the, of the, of the sorrow. Is it worth it? Is, is the, is the ticket, is the price of admission? Is it worth the show? And I think it is. And, and also the other thing from my own, like, paradigm that brings me comfort when I'm thinking about my children is since the beginning of time, they were going to come into existence. I think a lot of parents get, and I do this when I'm being neurotic, we get really caught up in the idea that it's all about us. We made this child, we will be the ones who determine whether this child like has a great life or a bad life. You know, we will be the one and that's so much weight to deal with. But if you like, let allow yourself just the thought experiment of playing around with like the sort of cosmology in which that we've incarnated infinite numbers of times into the material universe. And this is just one, one strobe light of reality that your children are experiencing and they came here because this is where they were, they're meant to be. And you had something to do with it, but not as much as you think. Any more than your parents had anything to do with you, or their parents had anything to do with them, or their parents had anything to do with them. This is more of a kind of explosion of sentience wrapped in matter and we're part of it. But whenever I allow that, then suddenly now forest can have the autonomy of being a self determined being, at least not a being that's going to where all the weight of me thinking I've got to be the potter and my child is clay. And I must sculpt this being, you know, all that stuff. It's like, well, you're here and I'm here and I love you more than anything on the planet. I don't want you to get hurt. But, you know, do your thing, including lose your curiosity. You know, if that's, if that's lose your fucking curiosity, go ahead, see how long you can lose it for. You'll be happier. My daughter is already like, they're already who they are. That's the crazy thing. It's like, I can do that stupid shit where I'm like, you're going to like this sports team or this is like you see parents. I've seen parents who their kids have the same haircut. Like it's guys who do this. It's always guys who have like they'll have the shaved head and then like Mohawk ponytail thing. Yep. And I'm just like, why would you do that to your kid? Like, why would you like, is that cute to make a mini you like that's that's wrong. As the Bible says, you carry the sins of our father. I'm like, that's what you're doing. Yeah. You're cloning like, come on, you're not fucking doing making a clone here. What do you what's cool? What's cool? That that's I think what what is that what one of the big problems right now is that we're in a country that has been at war for 93% of its history. And we have a massive military and we have a huge amount of people who are no longer in the military and are attempting to lead normal lives and have families. But in the same way you're like, I don't know how to be a dad. A lot of these people it's the same situation. Like, I don't know how to be a dad, but I do know how to be a soldier. I do know how to be conditioned. I know how the discipline that I was taught in the military made me stronger than I was before the military for better or for worse. And so I'm going to that's what I know how to do. So I'm going to use the Marines as a model for parenting. And then that's the next thing you know, you're shaving your kids head and you're making them say yes, sir, no, sir and do push ups when they fuck up. That literally happens to lots of people. I still you know, my dad made me say yes, sir, no, sir to him, you know, and he did that because he was the closest he had to a stable discipline parent was the fucking US military was the was the Navy. And so that's all he knew he did his best, you know. And so that to me is when why you run into the that when you when you see that I would roll. I would bet a lot of money that that person is probably a vet and that that person is like, all right, I'm going to shave my kids heads, make them look like me. You'll be very strict with them in the way that the military was strict with me and that'll make a good person. And, you know, that there's so many different parenting styles out there. I wouldn't I wouldn't do that because I experienced it. And I have a lot of friends who had like military parents. So like, I know the look. I know the look, you know. Yeah, my dad wasn't military, but he was very 19. It was like a fifties, like a lot of macho bullshit be tough, but he wasn't tough. I was thinking about this the other day. The advice my dad gave to me as a very young kid and I to this day still think this is all very fucked up. But one of the things he said was nice guys finish last, do unto others before they do unto you. And he once gave right how fucked up is that he told you that he said that to me repeatedly as a kid. And he once even told me like, if I ever was going to steal something, don't nickel and diamond go for something big because you don't want to do jail time for like, you know, a small theft. Wow. And I was just like, I still think about that. And I'm like, what the fuck kind of shit was that to say to a kid? Like it was just like assimilating this tough guy attitude Chicago and his dad was like a legitimate like fucking badass. Like he was a mobster. He was an Irish mobster who killed people. So it's like, at least he told me he loved me. But I'm like, that's I could could you imagine telling your kid like, well, if you're going to steal like be smart about it. No, I couldn't I couldn't imagine that. But don't don't steal is wrong. Like don't don't steal. But if you just like so fucked up to me, you know, I think that one of like one of the what what I want as a parent is I want my kids to come to a point in their life where they look back at something I did that was like. Or taught them that was confused. And they realize like, that was so weird and confused because they're free of it. You know what you just said, it means that you have broken that whatever this particular generational avalanche of negativity, you've stopped it a little bit. You know, you can't stop it all the way. We're all going to like, it still will come through as no matter what, but a little bit that whatever the fuck that was, you've stopped. So now your kids are going to not be weighted down with horrible advice. And that means that you've created a potential, a potentially like a wave of positivity. Your kids potentially will or your grandkids will be a little less wounded or like heavy from the stuff that that we got. Because you got like what World War Two is not that far away, man. Like that massive not to people always forget about World War One. But if you just think about the conflagration that is not that far back in the rear view mirror, not to mention the all the other little wars that have happened. The shit our parents our parents went through, man, was crazy. It was crazy and the shit their parents went through. We're talking like storming the fucking beach at Normandy and shit like watching like your friends get exploded by Nazi mortars. And then having to come back to the United States with full PTSD and not the having any of the sophisticated therapeutic methods that we have now. You know what I mean? Carlin's got that great bit about it like the names that the way we revised the name for it. They used to call it shell shocked. You know, you can go online and look and see what see people who are shell shocked, you know, who had like such profound PTSD. They were like basically catatonic. And so those people come back from the war and if they didn't go to the war, they probably their kids did. So they buried their kids probably, you know what I mean? You regardless. And then your kids are getting, you know, killed in Vietnam. Your brother was blown up in Vietnam. The point is, so you suddenly it your exit that a fucking depression, man. You know what I mean? So like all of that produced a toxic combination of booze, PTSD and like in poverty that that's what we're dealing with. Like that's the shit we've got in us from our parents a little bit and they had it way worse than us and their parents had it way worse. So that's what that's I think what we're dealing with. That's fucked up. Your dad said that to you. You know, I think of all the things might crazy shit. My dad said to me as a kid when I didn't know that probably that your dad's just a person, you know what I mean? But you think you imagine your dad has some like supernatural grasp on truth more than anybody else. And so, yeah, you take you internalize that and then you end up like with this like little amount like little golem demon thing living inside of you. That's all the shitty advice your parents gave you. And that's what that's what fucks up your relationships and your life. We we like something my parents never did. It's like I fucked up and I've lost my temper twice with my daughter and I like caught myself immediately. But it's just like, you know, but I what we do is at least I sit her down and I apologize and I tell her like, look, hey, like which no one like no one ever apologized. If my dad would have just apologized for like smacking me in the head, like it would still suck. But it's like I have like my mom would defend it. So I lived my whole life being like with that in my head of being hit, not apologized to not told that what was happened was wrong. Just told like, well, you know, he loves you. It's like that doesn't that doesn't heal it. Yeah. Yeah, you're supposed to love me motherfucker. You're my dad. Yeah. That's a given. But what you're not supposed to do is hit me. Well, I mean that yeah, and not defending your dad at all because like it's like I was gambling. Well, you shouldn't gamble, Matt. Yeah. But you know, you like that that was like another thing. It still is some people beat their kids and they think they're doing the right thing. And that's I mean, like it's startling when you imagine all the unprocessed shit we're dealing with, man, like, you know, like this fucking pandemic. I'm listening. I'm watching the news and they're saying, you know, things are looking better. Only 300 Americans are dying a day. Only 300 Americans are dying a day. Like a plane crash a day, something like that. That's a plane crash a day. And but even though we just came through this or we seem to be coming through it. A lot of people are just like, all right, let's just get back to it. Let's keep let's keep moving here. We're gonna get back to everything's normal again. Here we go. Getting back to it. And they're not acknowledging like their own trauma, their own like how crazy this last year was. And I think that that is a very human thing to do. And that's been going on since humans were around. And so we have all this unprocessed trauma that gets expressed in like what we're seeing all over the place now, these mass shootings. You know what I mean? It's like you're seeing all this like generational unprocessed war karma appearing in this kind of chaotic terrorism, just blowing out everywhere. Just because we haven't dealt with it man. I mean, I like how how did your relationship? How was your relationship during the pandemic? My relationship with Kelly got better. But also, but it's like, I know a lot of people whose relationship suffered and we have a number of friends who are getting divorced. But we, I feel like we grew closer together and we, you know, it made us on a whole as a family better. Like, I think we all had some mental challenges because it's like we were at the time for the bulk of it. We lived in a shitty, smaller, much smaller place. And but also I have always been a bit reclusive and like I'm not a big social. So I think like I was like, yeah, I don't want anywhere to go. Thank you. Sorry, people got to die, but this is ideal. Well, your relationship got better and that's incredible. My relation, my marriage went through some real rough patches and now it's great. And like we're in love and we're, but we went through some bullshit because of it. We were scared. We were freaked out. And we both had kids during it. Did we? Yes. Yeah. I'm pregnant and we moved and my dad had just died and all this stuff. But what we both started doing when things were getting weird is just reminding each other like, wait a minute. Don't forget what we just did this last year. Like don't forget that my watch my with my dad passed away. We moved three times. One of them being across the country and we had kids and we didn't know in the beginning of this pandemic what it was. I think people are forgetting that. I think people are forgetting that when the shit first hit, nobody knew what it was. Like we didn't know if this was getting anything to eat. Like, I mean, I was like, I was like, we're going to run out of food. Everything's going to go to shit. Like there was that panic that for real. That was real. The grocery stores were running out of food. The grocery stores were rationing milk. There was signs up everywhere all over LA. You know, like don't leave your house. People were freaking the fuck out and this was happening all over the planet. And so when I am like with Aaron or when we started recognizing like, wait a minute, what the fuck are we going through right now? Like, of course we're weird right now. Of course we're a little rattled right now. Of course, like we're like inordinately paranoid about things we normally wouldn't be paranoid about. This was insane what just happened and has happened. So, you know, I just think like reminding yourself of that from time to time is really important. And for me to find compassion for my father and love him, even though he like, you know, he did his best. I guess what I'm saying is like, because Jesus Christ, man, the shit he came out of the shit our grandparents came out of the shit that like this sum total of humanity is kind of like stumbling out of this like, you know, what was almost once nuclear Armageddon. You know, we almost fucking blew each other up with nuclear weapons. We still might a Holocaust. You know, all I'm saying is like humanity needs to like take a moment to recognize like it's not like we've been living in some kind of utopia for the last 1000 years. We've come out of a lot of bullshit. And I don't think we've integrated any of it. And it's manifested is this thing we call masculinity, or now they're calling it toxic masculinity, but it really it's not it's not even masculinity. It's fucking conditioning from being absorbed into the military industrial complex and brainwashed to kill people you don't know. A lot of our parents were brainwashed to kill people in other countries, and they did. And that mentality still exists in some like my mom's husbands that way. He's like, they want our freedom like that type of shit. Yeah, man. Still lives in people's heads. Yes, of course it does. It's like, like we 93% of our history, our country has been at war. We have the largest military in the world. And that is a military like all militaries that is trains people to be to kill and to be good at killing. I don't care what the fuck you want to call it. That's what a military is. It's like a thing that kills. They call it defense. But it's anyone who's been if your parents have been in the military. Well, they used to call it something. It wasn't called the Department of Defense. It was called like something of war. I can't remember, but it was like it was not as like defense was just a nice way to pad it and make it seem softer. Like, well, we're defending ourselves. We're not killing people. Right. It's not war. Right, right, right. Well, yeah, we have to defend ourselves. And, you know, this is and so now like, you know, people are walking in walking around with like AR 15s, you know, massacring people randomly. And everyone's like, what's going on? What could be going on here? Why is this happening? What's going on? Why would why are people doing this? It's like we have idolized soldiers. We have idolized a culture where it makes the solution to problems is to drop bombs on people. We've made that make sense in our own minds. And like how the fuck is that not going to produce a kind of mass psychosis when like you have to be invited to just you have to just accept the fact like, oh, yeah, you know, we just did. We just fucking destroyed a country. You know, that just happened. We just destroyed Iraq. We just did that. Like we just flew over a city and like drop bombs all over it completely destabilized it. And the reason we did it was was a lie. And now, you know, we're everyone's just in the United States is like, I guess, you know, it's become so common. Like you said that we've been in war. It's like we've been in war in Afghanistan for 20 years plus. And it's like no one thinks about like it's not a thing anymore. Just almost same as the shootings, mass shootings, people are like, Oh, yeah, right. Another thing happened in Tennessee. It's like, it's just matter of fact now. And it's like, this is not healthy. No, and you were anyone who's been at war when you read like the people have been at war and write about it. The usually when they're writing about it, they're not like glorifying it. Usually they're writing about it and saying this is the most horrible mistake any human could ever make. Like when you're when you're smelling war, apparently, when you're smelling gasoline and shit and burning bodies. It's not like you're thinking like, wow, this is the best humanity could possibly do. You're seeing it as the most vile, horrific example of what human beings can do to themselves as an ultimate mistake or something like that. You know, this. So I just think like it doesn't matter if your parents didn't go to war, guaranteed, you know, people who went to war, guaranteed, you know, people. And again, I'm not saying we don't need a military. I'm not saying people in the military are bad or wrong or evil or anything like that. But I think one thing we all have to agree on as a species is war is failure. War is the most abject failure that can happen anywhere for any reason. It's not the way to solve problems and it transcends all culture. It transcends all ethnicity. It transcends everything. It has to just be a universal truth. You know what I mean? Like, for example, it is 100% of the time wrong 100% of the time wrong to fuck children. 100% of the time wrong. Anyone who wants to argue that with you call the police. Anyone who wants to like present to you some reason. Oh, well, you know, but from time to know 100% of the time wrong. And this is, I think, the only people who don't accept that are people who want to fuck kids. But somehow with war, when you say 100% of the time it's wrong to drop bombs on people to kill people to attack people. 100% of the time it's wrong. They'll be like, hold on a second. Hold on. We had to do it because, you know, it's like, no, you didn't. We didn't have to do it. There was another way. I don't know what I'm rambling about this for. All I'm saying is because we have somehow managed as a culture to make it make sense that we're in Afghanistan for all this time. And even worse, when we Biden is pulling us out, people are like, wait, you can't leave now. We have to protect the people that we're in there. And it's like, oh, great. So let's just have an infinite war then. Anyway, the point is, I think like as a culture, we're just dealing with a lot of shit that is completely not integrated. One of them being a weird cultural acceptance of it being okay to blow people up that we don't know. The other one being that we just went through a massive breakdown of civilization. And it's like people are like, let's go. Let's go. Let's go. It's time to start shopping again. Let's get moving, you know, and that's only going to make us crazier and crazier and crazier. Just like you said, your father apologized to you. I'm sorry for this rant, Matt. Your father apologized to you. It made you feel great. No, he didn't. I apologize to him. I mean, you apologized to your kid. And that like, if your father had apologized to you, it would have made you feel good. Same with me. If at some point my dad had sat down and said, I have uncontrollable anger issues. I have, I'm struggling with alcoholism and PTSD. I'm sorry if I have not been a perfect father to you. That would have meant a lot to me because there's the lucidity, the acknowledgement of that. But our culture needs to do that somehow. You know what I mean? Like our culture needs to find a way to like, you know, acknowledge like shit. We are as a species, like an alcoholic PTSD dad. And we have made a lot of mistakes. And it's, I don't know, it's, you know, it's amazing the amount of mistakes our country acknowledges that other countries make. Kamala Harris was like chastising some world leader for, and I'm like, have you fucking looked at our own laundry? Like you have, I mean, you know what we've done, right? Like I interviewed this indigenous artist and up until 2001, there was boarding schools for indigenous people to beat. It's genocide. Whether they live, I mean, they did kill kids, but just beat the genocide or beat the culture out of them, their traditions. Two thousand, that's 20 years ago that this was still happening. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Still happening all over the world. Still happening. Still happening. I was thinking about, and I tweeted about it, get no action, not that it meant, but like when Christian churches go to third world countries and do mission work, that's white supremacy. They're spreading the word of a white Jesus. They're taking the, they're telling that culture that what your religion is wrong, we're here to save you from your culture that you've been dealing with for hundreds if not thousands of years. That's the spread of white supremacy. That's my take on it. Here's, here's where the, the take becomes problematic. I think is it's like, what about all the people who when they came into contact with the Christian ethos and spirituality legitimately there felt wanted to be part of it and loved it? Did they make a mistake by being drawn in by the missionaries? Like, but a lot of them weren't just like, oh, this sounds good. Like a lot of them were manipulated and, and you know, like the Spanish inquisitions, a lot of them were killed and intimidated into it. Oh, I mean, the old school thing, like where, like, But still, there's missions that go and preach Jesus. It's like, why, why do you feel the need to preach so strongly? Go to these people and tell them what they've believed is wrong. Part of the religion you've been instructed to. It's literally built into the religion. Yeah, it's terrible. Like, I find it very, but I think at the core of a lot of that is white supremacy. Like it's white Jesus who wasn't as not to snuggle shape. We know he wasn't white. Like, why do we, why is that a lot of black Christian missionaries, my friend? A lot of black Christian missionaries. It's interesting because somebody explained there's a big difference between the white evangelical Christian and the way that it is in like, say the gospel tents in New Orleans or in Louisiana. There's a drastically different approaches to Christianity, which I found really fascinating. One is about freedom and salvation, freedom and relishing in the freedom of God, where evangelical Christianity is very much like what we talked about earlier, being very rigid and wrong and shame and guilt and like, you must redeem yourself. Well, yeah, one, one of like the, yeah, I know exactly like the one version of Christianity is just like at the very least is just feels as boring as boring could be. And it feels like when you're reading the Gospels, when you're reading about the Pentecost, when you're reading about the raising of the dead, when you're reading about Jesus throwing demons out of the fucking that the guy in the graveyard and putting them into pigs. And then you go and you see some Christian ritual in a like a cathedral and it's boring as fuck. And you're like, what, how is, what, how did you get from throwing demons out of pigs or out of lepers into pigs and then the pigs running off cliffs to this sort of stale. They probably they were just bipolar. Actually, I've read things where that but Malcolm X took great issue with black people becoming Christians because it was the white man's religion that was being imposed on them when they were slaves. Well, to see that's where it gets really interesting isn't because it wasn't the white man's religion. That's the problem. It wasn't. It was a it was a wild, I guess you could say it started off as a kind of cult. Like it was some kind of like in the way like you get Santeria or voodoo voodoo is this fusion between African religion and Christianity and then suddenly you get this wild like wild, wild religion. Similarly, you have Judaism, and then out of that you get this bizarre like thing called Christianity, which then spreads around the planet comes into contact with white people. And then via that contact with white people, it's, you know, it spreads virally all around the planet. But it's like, and I know I know what you mean, like I think that you can use anything to amplify white supremacy. You can use anything to like amplify whatever your shitty thing is, and especially some archaic, you know, series of texts that have been translated a zillion times and have a lot of interpretation, some of which allow for slavery, some of which allow for like the stoning. You know what I mean? None of which Jesus spoke about. If you take the, if you take what Jesus's words only out of the New Testament, not what the fucking apostles did, it's like a whole different world. Jesus never said anything about gay people. About what? Gay people. Oh, no. He never said anything judgment. It's like really, there's a book called The Gospel According to Jesus that just analyzes his character, what his character was and what the contradictions are of everything else in the Bible. It's pretty, it's like once you know his character, it's like he didn't, none of this shit would he would go for. No, no, I mean, that's what's so cool about. That's what I love about Christianity is that if you, if you, if you really start looking into it, you realize like that so many forms of it, just like what you're saying. There's no like, what's that John Prine song, your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore. Wow, what a great, that's great. No, because your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore. It's already overcrowded from your dirty little war. Jesus don't like killing no matter what the reasons for your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore. Wow, that's great. Oh yeah, it's the best. Jesus don't like killing no matter what the reasons for. And that's that, you know, so to me, that's what I love about Christianity is it's like, not it's such a, it's like right in front of everybody, but it's such a secret mystery religion. Because unless you do your own work and start looking into it, you will think it's this or that you will, you know, it's easy and it is people power people will use anything to gain power and and obviously it's no hot take. They're going to use religion for that. And they're going to, you know, but that that's just part of the what happens where it when it when whenever there's anything powerful, you know, it's in like, I just I think maybe it's a little more insidious than even white supremacy. Maybe it's like some kind of theocracy or like some kind of like dehumanizing theocracy that I don't know. I don't know, you know, I don't know. I don't know why I'm sticking up for like Christian missionaries. I haven't spent any amount of time thinking about it. I just something that came to mind recently with me because it is it's like just the fact that people, the bulk of people still believe Jesus is white and that's the image that is put out there. It's like, we all know it's not like we all know he was not white at all. No, not white, not white. And and yeah, he was Middle Eastern. I mean, come on. Yeah, it's just, but it's like that is. He was Semitic. But but but like a lot of white people don't want to admit that. I think a lot of really, I think most Christian don't you think I mean, I someone just sent us a picture of white Jesus. I looked up white Jesus. I think in our circles of people, but I mean, you know, talk about the Trumpers and stuff, they're not they don't you think those people are like, yeah, Jesus was black. They hate. Well, I think they try not to think about it. I think any unless you're talking to someone who's like truly a total drooling dope, you it would be very hard for them to come up with a reason. Somebody born in a refugee born in a Galilean would be white. Like it would be hard. You would have to like for that to work. I think you're right. They don't want to think about it. They just don't want to think about it. And and and so because of that, it's like it shows a kind of weakness potentially because, you know, obviously it's like, come on, let's get this right. You're talking about someone who's Semitic. You know, I don't know exactly how complex did Jesus was. But for sure, if you start, you know, the white Jesus picture, which you can look up who that's based off of it was some kind of king. I believe it wasn't one of the Allman Brothers. I mean, that could but that kind of disconnect exists in my family. My mom is an evangelical Christian voted for Trump. Two of my brothers have married Mexican women, one who is like a citizen of Mexico or was. And my mom and aunt are very like, you know, like, oh, immigrant, you know, very Trump in that mentality of brown people coming into this country. But I'm like, you have it in your family, but there's this disconnect. It's like, well, that's, you know, that's my daughter. I love her, but it's like, but then still have that vehement hate for or just fear would be a better word of it. It's wild. Fear what? Or that subtle racism of brown people. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, yeah, exactly. Yeah. I know what you're saying. I mean, it does. It completely feeds into that. It completely feeds into that in some places like are like legitimately like some churches probably are legitimately racist. I have my, you know what's so weird? My encounters with most Christians, at least up here in the mountains has like, there's a church near where my studio is. And it's like a real, like I say, a real Christian church is someone who isn't like, I guess I could say I was a Christian, but it's like you go there. And this is like, to me, this is what it looks like. It's the pews in the day are filled with people who don't have a home, people who are going through psychotic episodes, people who aren't being taken care of by society. That's where I got my fucking vaccine. And, you know, they're giving them vaccines there while all the political shit is going on in the world, while all the insanity is going on in the world. The real Christian churches are like, okay, whatever, we're just feeding people and we're giving them medical care, medical care, if we can, we're healing them, we're feeding them. And we're trying to do whatever we can to make sure that single moms have food for their kids. You know what I mean? That's been my experience with it. And to the point where the whole, almost like the Jesus thing itself is like, it's something they talk about, but it manifests in this weird radius of healing around some of these churches. People are saying that's why communities are actually a little fucked up right now is like, that's going away. That used to be temples and churches used to be these little oasis in the midst of all the insanity, where no matter what your fucking color was, no matter what your, you know, psychic state was, no matter what you believed in, you could come there and get food. It's the same as true with like Sikh temples, you know, they're sick, I think is actually how you say it, but they will give food to you when you come, no matter what. Hari Krishna temple is the same thing. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah, so I don't know, man. Like, I know I know Christian people who are like my buddy Bruce is like, I would consider him like the real deal. And he like, he's like, you can't be Christian and not be like a leftist. He's like the two are hand in hand. He's like, all this conservative shit is not the, that's not the way it should be with Christianity, but somehow they've co-opted it. Oh, yeah. Have you ever read that book by Tolstoy? It's called, it's so fucking good. Hold on. Tolstoy wrote this wonderful little essay on Christianity. Essentially, I'm not going to look at the premise of it was, you can't be a Christian and kill. You can't be a Christian and go to war. You can't be a Christian and be a soldier. You can't be a Christian and like, you know, it's really hardcore. And that is, and that is, you know, there is a, Jesus didn't get fucking nailed to the cross because he was like getting along with powerful people. You know what I mean? Like you don't end up being crucified because you don't pose a threat or something like that. Like there's a reason they ended up like, you're going to have to hammer, you're going to have to get rid of this one. He's going around saying that, you know, he's going around saying that like we're supposed to treat everybody like ourselves and forgive everybody. And that we're supposed to like, you know, you know, turn the other fucking cheek. How do you turn, turn the other cheek into like Lockheed Martin? You know what I mean? How do you convert, turn the other cheek into, you know, from time to time, it's okay to drop cluster bombs on cities. Matt, I love you. Thank you for letting me ramble with you so much.

This is Lester Hearn, and you're listening to what happens when you die, an exploration of one of the great mysteries, the mystery of death. My grandfather told me that you see a beautiful white light, and that's where God lives. When you die, people put you in a box, and then put you in a special microwave. There is also a spa center where people go and rejuvenate themselves. You go up or you go down. Depends on how you live your life. I think when you die, you shit your pants and then pass out. I traveled to a small suburb just outside of Philadelphia and found myself knocking on the door of a modest home. Come on in. I was in the home of Lenzer Gunn, the innovator of the afterlife helmet, an advanced helmet that allows the moments after death to travel into gun's brain via a technological tube. Whippets, which were used to power the helmet, were scattered around the floor. And the smell of cigar smoke hung in the air, truly the home of a scientist. So what I'm holding here are two helmets attached to each other via a tube, and the helmets themselves seem to be attached to gas masks that connect to nitrous oxide canisters. Exactly. What makes it special is that this helmet allows me to experience what a dying person is experiencing two minutes after their death. Can you talk about what kind of technology is in these helmets? The design of the helmet came to me in a dream. I can't go into much more detail. It's top secret. Can I get you a drink? Now, when did you start using these helmets to study life after death? I started with dying birds, then sort of moved my way up to bigger mammals until I felt comfortable studying humans. How does this helmet fit on a bird? I use much smaller helmets for birds. What is the function of this tube? How does it work? The tube connects the dying person's brain with my brain and allows me to see their last moments. The whip at canisters function is to get me high. So what have you experienced through these helmets? What happens when you die? When you die, you go on a log ride. You mean like a celestial voyage? No. It's identical to any log ride you may have gone on at a theme park, the only difference being that your dead relatives are running the ride. What about for animals? If you're a bird, then you might see your bird mother pressing a green button on the ride. If you're a human, then it's a grandmother or great grandmother or mom. What happens after the log ride? I don't know. Why? The helmet only allows me to see two minutes after death and the log ride seems to be longer than two minutes. How do you find people to participate in these experiments? It's not that hard. I just hang out at bus stations and invite people over to my house. Wait, Mr. Gunt, you're not saying that you murder people? If you call putting someone on a log ride murder then I'm guilty as charged. Why don't you let me show you? Have you ever heard of autoerotic asphyxiation? Yeah, I've heard of autoerotic asphyxiation. Of course, I love it. Me too. Put my helmet on and let's get going. We both took our clothes off and began to autoerotic asphyxiate. Gun had a beautiful body. His rippling muscular abdominal muscles reminded me of a war soldier. Just as I was about to pass out while simultaneously having an orgasm, a beautiful woman walked in from another room. She was wearing a full body leather suit and red high heels. I hope you didn't really believe my husband's bullshit helmet story. She said, he's a pathological liar and I'm so sick of his shit. And to punish him I want you to fuck me in front of him all night long. We spend the entire night fucking in front of her husband, laughing at his stupid helmet and enjoying each other's bodies. And so the great mystery remains just that. I promise you that this will not discourage me. I will continue exploring the great mystery of what happens after we die.

Do you remember that movie the ninth gate fuck? Yes. I remember that movie I love that movie. I rewatched it recently actually Boris Becker that the guy in the suit is like my one of my all-time Favorite a cult characters only I am fit to hold the secret of the book when he marches in on all the people in robes I love that so good the whole time I was thinking of you and thinking how great it is that we're gonna be talking tomorrow the whole time like It's a great it's a great great great movie other than it was directed by Roman Polanski, which is a little sketch But Polanski directed that shit. Oh, yeah, no He may not be a good human being but he much like Mel Gibson. He is still a great director if not a good human being so Right. Yeah, you know what just watch it like I did and pretend he didn't direct it and you won't be bothered by any kind of weird cognitive dissonance Well, it is a movie about the devil, so I mean, you know it kind of adds to that I suppose he loves those movies, huh? It's so odd. It's someone like that would love those kinds of movies One of life's funny little quirks Well, I mean what how much as an occult scholar Practitioner it's still weird to me out when people say this to me You are in my mind in my mind. I am literally I'm literally just a Dungeons and Dragons nerd that never snapped out of it. Literally. That's myself Literally that I'm not even excited. That is my self image. No, everyone writes books on John D Everyone writes compendiums on John. No, we all do all dungeon masters They're not running a campaign. They're hard at work writing about What some of the great modern occultists how I'm just DMing at scale now for a ton of people I'm I'm I'm setting the rules of reality for quite a few people and DMing, but it's fun Just like it's you know, I was always a good I always was the DM you might imagine. Yeah, how Much of that movie when you're watching it Yeah, as someone who is who knows so much about the occult when you're watching a thing like that Is it like a doctor watching like a hospital show when you're seeing some of the some of the Like pictures in the book or just the ideas that Polanski is presenting about the Possibility of fucking yourself over with cursed books or summoning The devil how much of that when you're watching that how much you like? Oh, that's pretty On track or that's just I think that movie is actually pretty good I think it just I think if you just take it as as like a satire of a cult people It gets a lot right not all the devil appearing and lighting those spoilers, but like all like the silly Star Wars stuff, but The bit the bits that that movie really gets right or the fact that it's all about books Like a cult people are just like really they're just book book rare book collectors. Wow, you know It's like it's they're just people who are obsessed with books I mean you think about it like what is an occult book? It's a book that promises you some power So who's gonna be interested in that powerless people who read a lot of books? You know like so it's like and it's in that sense It is an extension from like D&D and just being like the like me like the kid in the library at lunch hour You know, that's that's who I was so So it gets that right, you know like rules basically a cult is are just rare book collectors And then it gets but the whole light euro eyes wide shut like European people who take this shit Way too seriously it definitely got that right and it's hilarious and the bit would be the Boris Becker The I think that's his name unless that's the football person Him like there's a character who is just kind of wears a suit and thinks that he's that all of these people wearing robes are just completely ridiculous Yeah, that is that's I love that That's like so on point so and Johnny Depp is a great character in that movie He's like the kind of the archetypal occult detective, but but making the hero a book collector like that's totally on point They and they pull you know what what's interesting is that somehow Johnny Depp really pulled off playing like a I don't know non-passive book collector somehow they turn Johnny Depp turn being a book collector into something cool and Yeah, sexy. Yeah, all his movements were so weirdly like hot You know, yeah, I think that movie's probably because I saw that in the theater when I was whatever 19 or whenever it came out 18 I think 17 maybe I can't nothing no 18 whatever anyways, but Yeah, and it was just like that was one of those early formative movies It was like yeah, like I can be like a nerd, but like Alpha and Chad if I get a cult He was so alpha. He was like a super alpha Collector Yeah, there's a lot of great movies by the way if you like that movie a great one that goes with that is angel heart with Mickey Rourke. Oh, give me a break. That's that's now. That's what I was trying to figure out is you know, which case so angel heart came first So basically, oh, yeah, not spoil. Okay spoiler watch both these movies then come back to this podcast because The Polanski ripped off angel heart. That's all I was thinking is like this is so many things seem to be borrowed From angel heart here. Definitely both characters Were kind of identical, you know detective types, right? Well, that's just an old literary trope But I'm a sucker for like the John Constantine style, you know, like kind of down on his luck Occult hardboiled Definitely on the comes from the wrong side of the tracks getting mixed up with with shady women and that type of thing You know, like I grew up with that stuff. Yep, not always right, especially with John Constantine always They actually interviewed me for the new John Constantine animated movie. So I'm actually on the DVD Yeah, it was really weird, but it was I was really excited about that. So I mean the city of demons that one you always kind of downplay the robes stuff and and I Get that in the sense. I mean nobody I hate costume parties, right there It's the worst when someone invites you to a dress code party. I hate it so much And I guess the robe rituals are sort of the same But I gotta ask man that the underlying idea that you can Fuck your whole life up by coming into contact with some of these books I Don't and I don't mean it like, you know, like a metaphorical way Like I know you run into some shitty books. You can fuck your life up, you know, like but but I mean like in a literal sense Do you think there's truth to the warnings than many of these grimoires, which is always sort of like don't fuck with this stuff? Or you could get in a lot of trouble. How long was the first part? How long have you been doing podcasts together for? I don't know man. I don't want to explain because this is this was literally the first question You asked me on the first podcast we did or one of the first ones. Well, you're still freaking out about it, huh? No, I'm not freaking out. I'm not freaking out about it. I'm just I just I Romanticize it and honestly, I want it to be true. I want that to be true. Well, I want there to be magic books There are definitely magic books. Well, I'll be totally I'll be totally straightforward about it Can magic books can magic in general just like anything else? I mean really the question is can a can holding illusions mess up your life Yeah, but you don't need a magic book for that. You can believe that you're I don't know The destined to be the greatest lawyer in history and just fuck everyone else over getting to the top But it's all an illusion. So I'll give you the boot like the Buddhist answer It's like I mean magic is dangerous in it's not like Hollywood dangerous It's just the main the main danger with magic is wasting your time if you don't have the right approach And wasting time out of your life and thinking things are real that aren't and so I think that The proper way to approach magic is simply from the Buddhist perspective that it's all mind Once you understand that it's empty of actual reality. It's like it's here's the thing This is magic itself is such a Zen cone. It's kind of a Zen cone on the step to pure Meditative practice, but it's also really cool and useful and fun But it's particularly cool and useful and fun if you have a proper understanding of the nature of mind And so the thing about magic is it demonstrates that you can do all these like you can do magic And you'll get all the results just like in the book Just like in the books and multiple it's it's not scientific But it's empirical in the sense that multiple people can do the same thing and pretty much get the same results I've got endless stories like that, but the issue is Why did it happen and then once you start thinking it's like, you know Why could I do this and I did this ritual and then this bizarre set of coincidences happen within the next week that got me Exit the job I wanted or whatever like that's all what or I had a vision of an angel or whatever it happens to be It's like you start to realize well Is it real you start to ask like is it real? Is it not real and there's really no answer to that question But then that question itself bleeds over into the rest of your life And then you're just like well, what is anything real or not real and eventually if you get through it This is chapel perilous is while Wilson used to call it if you get through that Hopefully you get to what the Tibetan Buddhist like are so clear about it's like everything is mind and it's in here It's an empty of inherent Reality it's it's quote-unquote real on its own plane Yeah, but it itself has no ultimate meaning and then it's like ah, okay So once you get the understanding it's like well, it's not really real, but nothing's real. So You know, it's fun It's kind of if you take it seriously and you're like, I'm really talking to aliens like yeah, you're gonna have a bad time Well, I mean unless the aliens are real real in which case they're gonna be annoyed that you're like, I know you're not real Yeah, you just saw me land this fucking thing. I mean Well, are you talking to them? That's the question what am I talking to you specifically? What if they speak what if they speak to you in feelings and intuitions and you don't even realize it's them I don't think there's anything closer to aliens than toddlers truly They're new to the planet. They don't know what any of this stuff is and so and they they also have their own language It's pretty much identical. I would guess I okay, so The way I'm hearing what you're saying is in this reality Don't fall for the idea that the paint is dry. So to speak the paint is wet You can still alter the painting in all kinds of ways so Is it it has a spell been cast on people Intentionally to make them think the paint is dry to make them think the paintings done who cast the spell and then they did Who are they the people that are in that reality?

It's not a top-down thing I mean people are the social trends or as Michelle Foucault called it Consensus reality. I think that was Foucault. Okay, is basically reality isn't it is agreed upon And this is kind of the core of postmodern academic theory kind of I don't quote me I've it's been a while since I was in school, but but You know reality is is You know or even the social contract is an agreement between people to play the game in a certain way Right, right. I mean like our entire all of existence is in it is essentially an agreement between groups of people to do things in a Certain way and when those rules are violated we experience it as a rupture of of the divine order of things But it's really not the divine order It's the human order of things and so like when you're every day you're like the world's going to hell everything's falling apart It's like well, maybe the human agreement on how the game is supposed to be played is is being severely challenged or is not holding up Right and to be a magical thinker is to realize like none of that is actually there But the reason it's there is not because like Tucker Carlson is waving a wand in a robe, you know Chanting to him's maybe he is I don't know he was he's apparently a deadhead and is in the synths So he's I think you and Duncan or excuse me. There we go. You and Tucker Carlson may be two aspects of the same person Because your bolt it's like he that's the synth thing. Yeah, I saw him interviewed on a Yes, he does I saw it look it up So or like a synth person Like a synth person interviewed him on a YouTube podcast and they were talking about since in the grateful dead And I was like this is sounds like one of the wait what's going on here? So There's reality breaking for you There you go friends a spell cast by a true wizard has shattered my reality But aren't we all ultimately the same person anyways, you know, so that's the thing But yeah, no, so reality is an agreement between the potentially infinite beings to play the game in a certain way but the reason is not nefarious it's because You know try try agreeing on anything with one person the fact that we all have a social agreement That allows life to pretty much function is nothing short of miraculous right and the reason it's man So it by and large it works really well To the point that when it doesn't work we experience it as something horribly wrong instead of things going wrong Constantly, I mean not like now, but at the level of like, you know Like the charnel fields of Europe breakdown World War two like everything just you know atom bombs like all that the fact that we don't normal I mean well to be fair that is happening in Ukraine right now But by and large the fact that when we see thing the rules breaking down We experience it as utterly traumatic shows that we're not used to it happening all the time Which shows that the things work pretty well actually it was it's it was working and then there I can maybe what's the problem? Is the problem that when things are breaking down? We keep trying to play the same game like we are in a house and we're playing hide-and-go-seek and the house catches on fire You would be a complete dummy to keep playing hide-and-go-seek in a burning house And yet it's like with that house is apparently is on fire and the people running the show the Vays are like no no No, we're playing hide-and-go-seek and we're gonna keep playing hide-and-go-seek because that's what we do in this house with this is the game that we know and then the house burns down and The people who are dumb enough to keep playing whatever the game was are incinerated and then the people who got out of the house they go Like recover whatever they came from the wreckage and rebuild the whole thing is that that's kind of what's been going on with civilization for a long time Yeah, but the thing is I mean people always get angry about the state of things and they always get angry like why are people like this? They're never change. It's like well, that's not most people want to experience existence rather than constantly have The burden of changing it or changing the rules. They just want to experience what life is and so it's kind You know my perspective of the healthiest role for an artist or a Magician or just to create a person an engineer or creative thinker and venture yeah to play in society is just the same as it was in Tribal culture with shamans or philosopher kings That never actually happened But the kind of the philosopher in ancient Greece where it's you have somebody who is aware is aware that everything is a game But is able to from that reconstruct the basically is able to DM for other people in a way that keeps them happy safe and sane Right because ultimately it is all pure chaos, but people can't function like that No, so they need somebody to kind of essentially DM who's able to and that that is a spell It's like you construct a more and we need that right now because things that kind of are the systems definitely being challenged But that's normal. You know, it's like your immune system is constantly being challenged. That's good I mean, I'm not saying that tragic individual tragedies or anything like this are good. It's just that the system is Self-correcting I think and it's I have I try to have it's hard these days It's really hard, but I try to have at least a little bit of faith in it Not the system as in the government, which I've that's a whole other conversation, but But in terms of just this system of human human beings are endlessly creative and adaptable, right? We always seem to work it out. We always seem to wake up the next morning, you know, right? But you know, yeah, I mean, yeah, I don't don't get me started on the government See you are Tucker No, I yeah, I just yeah, I think that The part of the problem though, it's to at least and personally is when I forget the paints Still wet you co-create you can work with this stuff It's it's it's more malleable than you could ever possibly imagine When I start looking at my own life or the world as this crystallized Thing and I'm with a little bug stuck in it. That's when depression hits but the moment you start realizing holy shit, this is really wet clay That I just haven't had the guts to reach out and try to shape. That's when you get this spark That's what I love about magic that yeah, that's that's why having a magical practice is really useful because it's really hard and I like I'm constantly struggling with the same thing when you get into that place where you're kind of sunken in and you're like Nothing's you know, it's just like this told that kind of like black-pilled hopeless place. Nothing's working Yeah, it's just it's so hard to get out of that and that's why it's really useful to be like oh kind of have like a Like in the true sense ritual action like you know, you well, okay, but I feel terrible, but maybe I can go do Do a little You know like a banishing ritual and a meditation and just do do this stuff I don't feel like doing it whenever you're really depressed You're always like off, you know, that's all yeah, whatever But it's like but if you do it then things will immediately start kind of improving So it's it's good to have a ritualized action that you can do particularly when you get to that place of Overwhelm Is there anything you're aware of in the in the quote literature that talks about that strange internal entropy or or or that kind of Wall that appears Psychologically between you and the ritual where even though you might have had a thriving practice even though you might have had Incredible results even though you kind of vaguely remember any time I start doing this stuff again. My life instantaneously Improves is there any does anyone ever talk about that thing that sets in where you begin to forget all of that and sink down into like a Sad and traffic. Yeah, for sure. There's a lot of different things about that I think probably the most useful one is Peter Carroll the cast magician talked about the psychic sensor Which is that function your brain that is constantly in his way thing is like it's constantly Convincing you that magic is not happening all the time Okay, and it's whenever like it's like whenever like something magical or Synchronistic or perhaps supernatural happens. It's that part of your brain that comes in and says like no you didn't actually see that You know, right? Yeah, so The other thing is I there this is it's probably not that helpful to talk about the esophageal terms But well, that's because it's so whoo, but that's you did have this concept of the dweller on the threshold which is This kind of being that's a back drag on your progress that is composed of all your prior karma Holy fuck that has to be overcome. Yeah across many lifetimes So I don't like to get into like super new age the esophageal woo stuff because it's like but it but it's certainly like cool From like a Marvel Comics perspective the dweller on the threshold the dweller on the threshold Yeah, and and it's basically the first thing that you have to do when you start doing magic is confront The dweller on the threshold, which is not just like your darker negative side It's like the complete the complete accreted karma across all lifetimes of your negative actions Personified as a being so it's really like that is so for you. That's clearly Tucker Carlson It's not one of our fucking dogs Truly that makes me think blotovsky had a fucking dog because we have this older dog That sits that it when it's raining Will not go out to pee and sits at the edge of the threshold Of the house until you like get distracted enough so that she'll come back in the house and shit and piss someone I think of dweller on the threshold. There you go Something you if you don't pay attention to it will shit in your house Well, that's just like that. I mean that you just described my own my own ongoing struggle with myself You know, it's like just when you think you're like great and you've over it's like yeah You're you're on dark side sneaks in and shits in the house and fucks everything up. It's like god damn it not I'm so happy talking about this because this has been now whenever I start having any kind of I don't know like meditation-based epiphany Anytime I get any sense of like I'm waking from the dream of life now I'm like, oh no, you're having that tongue sense again the inevitably weeds to awful Collapse it's almost like that is now a red flag for me where it's like oh shit watch out You're starting to think you're getting enlightened. That means you're about to like do something really dumb What is that's the dweller on the threshold? What is that's a div? That's something else. That's those are phenomenon created by the mind during the enlightenment process going forward Oh, do you think I'm getting enlightened? The Democrats want you to believe you might think you're getting enlightened, but Joe by sleepy Joe Biden If only that was the reality we were in That was the economy was based on people getting enlightened like the Dow Jones enlightenment average Yeah, yeah, we're getting enlightened or not. I just love it like Tucker Carlson is the drill. It's like, you know, you're getting enlightened I know everyone knows they're getting enlightened. We all agree on that. You're a sane person. You're a rational person But you wouldn't think that if you if you listen to Joe Biden and the Democrats Oh While Americans across this great nation are getting enlightened on a daily basis Sleepy Joe Biden is allowing Unenlightened immigrants in They have not achieved somebody they have not achieved any sense of Nirvana and yet they are flooding in unenlightening our children You know, that's funny because that that's like probably literally what Buddhists would be like if they ever got their way Actually, I'm actually trying to build an enlightened society. That's what they would have their own Tucker Carlson trying to keep the unenlightened Fascism oh, yeah, well that that's actually unfortunately real like in me on Mara and things like that. But yeah, I mean Absolutely, I don't know why somehow the Buddhism has become immune to the scathing eye of the Secularist because it is true anytime like generally anytime angry people get a hold of anything They'll fuck it up and whatever it is, especially something that has so many intangibles in it You know that like Buddhism or whatever. That's so interesting, man. I I I'm really actually I don't mind talking about Blotowski. I'm not my reason for not talking about Blotowski Wouldn't necessarily be because of like new age associations Just but because of shit. I've read about her being just a complete Con artist and fraud setting up traps and tricks in the ceiling to like drop the ceiling Yeah, you never read about that Ceiling cat well She had a cat in a trap door. No, she like as part of her You know as part of the The game she apparently had something built in their ceiling like a trap door a little tiny trap door that you could You know push a button and she made a letter fall out, you know to prove You know because when they were doing their seances and all that they were like using all kinds of tricks It's what Houdini was into Exposing yeah, yeah, he was kind of like the that he was a bit of a soy boy for his time You know like exposing the new atheist type, but it was great though Yeah, no, I think that was very common at the time. I mean, it's it's And it's still common. I mean there is still a psychic mafia and all of this type of thing So people cold reading and kind of like running protection rackets for spiritual readers and things like this wait What do you describe that? What do you mean? Oh, that's pretty straightforward I mean like you've seen these these like card reader like our Psychics on every street corner like what I've neon in the the window where it's all reading all that Yeah, I mean that that's a mafia just like with its own protection racket just like any other kind of small Yeah, I mean, yeah, you mean you go in there and you tell them your secrets and they they fuck with you I don't know. I'm probably I'm I'm I don't know enough to intelligently talk about this the books have been written about It's more like it's more like you have to pay your protection to be doing the business to the people who are kind of overseeing those shops You can't just stop your shop. Oh Yeah, you just put a psychic thing on the corner if you do someone's gonna come to you and be like hey This isn't Hogwarts asshole. This is yeah, it's like you got to pay us to do this in this neighborhood type of thing I think that's the deal, but I'm yeah, but there's I mean there's tons of constant. I don't know. I've never heard that about Blavatsky, I think I've read her books. They're super fun particularly and Secret doctrine is super interesting, but I don't know I mean like that but the history of the theosophical society is bizarre They almost took over large part of India in the early in the 20 that the 1910s or 20s were basically they had this whole scheme where they Were gonna Pro because they were huge like everyone was into it. They were like yeah big big deal And but they were gonna prop up this kid Krishnamurti as the world teacher Yeah, and then and but now it turns out that his his handler Charles Ledbetter was molesting him the whole time as a kid And it's in you know while they were all they were priming him to be this world teacher And then possibly is because of that he broke with that. He basically just rage quit When he wasn't even that old he just rage quit. He's like fuck your world teacher shit And then he went on to actually be a really good spiritual teacher Now I get it now I get it because because because Krishnamurti was kind of like the Houdini for gurus, right? Like that's why Whoa, they tried that he was they were they were grooming him to be like the old the Messiah Jesus and then he to his to his credit. He was just like no Can you imagine? There were yeah, they basically plucked up this Indian kid and tried to pull off like a dune messiah They were trying to like yeah Like form a messiah and then this guy led better was a Was an abuser I vaguely remember Hearing that and I'm sorry. I forgot it the last time I was talking shit about Krishnamurti because now I now it all makes Oh, yeah Thank you super speciosa for supporting this episode of the DTFH Kratom is an all-natural herb related to the coffee plant that has been used in Thailand for centuries And it's been being put in my mouth ever since I got endorsed by the gods over at super Speciosa, I call them gods because this Kratom that they are producing is Incredible you want to wind down and relax after work without pouring vodka down your chew hole This is a great way to do it or maybe in smaller servings. You want something for pre-workout or post-workout recovery Super speciosa. It's got the Kratom for you. I Recommend the capsules. I'm not fucking around with the powder Maybe you're an advanced Kratom user or something, but I'm not I don't have time to measure stuff I just take some of these wonderful capsules and holy God in heaven. It is amazing Even better our offer code can be used again and again Meaning that if you've already used the offer code to order some of this stuff, you can use it again. I Recommend their green MD strain by the way, if you're looking for something to start off with you just go to their website They've got all the data you need on the various strains But you can try it now and get 20% off all you got to do is go to superleaf Dot-com forward slash Duncan you get 20% off with promo code Duncan That's get superleaf.com forward slash Duncan use promo code Duncan for 20% off Thank you super speciosa I Mean the thing about Buddhism just like any other religion Dharma is is that like you said it adapts itself everywhere it goes I don't think that anyone owns it I think that for that reason it's important to go back to the Paul if you want to study Buddhism go back to the Polycanon we actually have the original discourses like that's what I would study, but like I would say that for instance in Like in America for instance because you know, it's Hinduism and Buddhism or something totally different in America I would argue that both Hinduism and Buddhism in the US have essentially just become a vehicle for baby boomer values They have a lot more to do with the values of the baby boomer jet like generation and Propping themselves up as Buddhist and Hindu teachers than they do with the actual original religions There's a writer named David Chapman who has a was a really interesting blogger who's he calls this consensus Buddhism And he basically says this was done for a reason it was done for marketing reasons by particularly the Dalai Lama They just want the tradition to survive you know But but but you go you go to like a vipassana retreat and it's like nothing like You know feel good baby boomer Buddhism It's more like you know being in a Thai prison or something like that which I personally love Not being in prison, but like the hellraiser experience. I mean Buddhism is dark and and incredibly strenuous Yeah, and so but the thing about Buddhism is it has the whole skillful means upaya idea You kind of like sell people to feel good stuff to get them into it But Buddhism at its core is a doctrine of extinction. It's a doctrine of extinct Extincting yourself across all lifetimes So you don't have to reincarnate well, I mean, okay, okay Maybe so but isn't it also sort of like I mean, isn't it also extinction and not extinction? Isn't it also everything this and nothing this it's like the middle way in between these two things in other words like yeah Absolute reality. You're already extinct absolute reality What even are you other than some, you know, tiny little Sinti and little blurbling thing that's being dissolved right now and everything this which already exists In other words, yes annihilation, but not annihilation, right? It's not just one or it's not it's pretty much extinction I mean, yeah, that's a stage you get to but I mean the point of Buddhism is total cessation of mental phenomena But it's a totalizing goal Right, but the mental phenomena, but there's still like a the what is it? What what is it isn't I guess it is extinction but the idea is like you're already extinct You know what I mean? Like don't worry the thing you think is real is nothing anyway. You're the extinction is already here It's not an event that you get to you're already extinguished so to speak Oh, you know gone gone already broken everything shattered, you know, it's done the just done thus relax into Extinction and yet you're still here in a sense. I think and and But if that was a hundred percent true there would be no reason for the path at all and I think that's like it ultimately Yes, nothing is ultimately. Yes, okay, but you're still I the thing is you're still identified with with the illusion Heart sutra, baby, right? That's what I love the heart sutra. The heart saying it's already empty It's the Dharma itself empty the Heart attacks. You're the one who told me about that the first time I've confirmed that with various people Honestly, when you told me I kind of didn't believe you. I'm like what the fuck but maybe every you told me that when people heard the heart sutra around when Buddha gave the original sermon that People died people had heart attacks. I definitely did not tell you that I've never heard that I could have maybe you dream me telling you Yeah, well, yeah, that's the I mean again, is it is that really what happened? But people say well, I mean maybe before we talk am I even the same person sitting here as I was two years ago I could have been replaced man. I don't know. I don't know me too now wait Give a quick synopsis of the heart sutra for people who might not be familiar with so the heart sutra is Yeah, got a got a part some got a bodhisvaha is It's basically the a stat. It's really good to read. It's very comforting It basically establishes that nirvana is samsara as samsara is nirvana and everything's fine and Essentially what you're saying, which is really good. Although you have to really I'm not a Buddhist scholar by any means But I will point out that the heart sutra is a Mahayana tech So it comes from Buddha's Buddhism's missionary phase when they were trying to spread it to the whole world And it's there's nothing in the original Pali Canon that Suggest that things are already done The Pali Canon is just the original turning of the Dharma is just here's the steps you need to do to get out of suffering right and So it's it's a it's a I would say I mean I hate to abuse the word scientific but it's a step-by-step process that to be undertaken and When you're in states of Buddhist meditation, which I don't claim to be an expert Although I've definitely experienced them and things like doing vipassana and whatnot I'm experiencing experience a ton of states of consciousness and a ton of other traditions Has nothing to do with you know, it's I would say it's it's operative in your normal consciousness, but the thing is that you are totally Disidentified with it and it's not I don't think it's like you get to a point and you're done Because then if you go back If you break you break that state, then you're in a different state, you know, it's like you go back to your old pattern So but I'm not a Buddhist scholar or advanced practitioner or anything of that type, but here's the hard sutra Body is nothing and you know when they read it. It's like ball does and as he did But I'll read it a little bit of it body is nothing more than emptiness emptiness is nothing more than body The body is exactly empty the emptiness is exactly body The other four aspects of human existence feeling thought will and consciousness are likewise nothing more than emptiness and emptiness nothing more than they All things are empty. Nothing is born. Nothing is died. Nothing is nothing dies. Nothing is pure Nothing is stained. Nothing increases. Nothing decreases. So in emptiness, there is nobody no feeling or thought no will no consciousness There are no eyes no ears. No nose a tongue. No body. No mind. There is no seeing. No, no Jason It's not about extinction. No seeing no hearing no smelling a tasting a touching This isn't about extinction. What do you mean? There is no Somebody's somebody's dweller on a threshold is acting up So but here's my question right from what state of consciousness was that written and who was it written for Hmm. Wow. I don't know the answer to that But I would I in in looking at most spiritual texts. I mean, it's really easy to read things That mates those things may it's kind of like when you you're on Someone you know is on psychedelics and suddenly something makes total sense to you Yeah, like you list like friends the classic one is You psychedelics someone, you know does psychedelics and then goes and listens to psychedelic music from the 60s and you're like, oh my god I totally get it now. Yeah, this is amazing or my favorite is and I think actually all music is like that My favorite is I was in a borough a while ago watching Saturday Night Live Or excuse me. It's not sorry. I have Saturday Night Fever the disco movie. Yeah, it's like watching like or I don't think it was that it was like that era. It was all this footage of people Dancing with like Leisure suits and with like gold medallions and like chains and like dancing like they're Gumby with and I was like I always thought this was the worst thing ever, but I was looking at this and I was like, you know, what this probably made perfect fucking sense on clay ludes. Oh Shit, this was probably awesome on clay ludes. I mean nobody has So I don't know but it's like they were probably all like relaxed and loose and sweaty So they didn't want constricting clothing. They just want to like Gumby out all over the place. It's like this was probably made total sense on clay ludes. Holy shit. You're right I'm guessing you're right. Again. I've never had clay ludes. It's one of the things many many things that have gone extinct Sadly sadly all phenomena are impermanent Even especially clay ludes To Mexico and get them, but I don't know if that's true I wouldn't fuck with like I've thought I've had that thought but or someone I know has had that thought but apparently the police do Not fuck around there, especially with American drug tourists So I would I've heard you just bring enough money to give it like I don't again Oh my who's telling me these things probably not the best people on earth But what I've heard is you the idea is like yet They don't fuck around with it unless you let pay them to let you fuck around with it You can't go there and expect to like pull off. You have to pay off the someone the cartels or some Assuming all that goes well, you know I mean, it's like I would never do it Are you fucking kidding me that I heard from like like, you know drug addicts who would you would go to Mexico to buy pills? Like I've heard stories about this from people who are deeply addicted to drugs Cuz I think they expect that they definitely expect that there too, you know You might as you might imagine But what I was gonna say is that in the same way you read spiritual texts and they probably and they seem really quote-unquote Occult or esoteric or weird. Yeah, and it's just like it's just like what we're just talking about like a magic eye painting Right. It's like if you're in that state of consciousness That they're talking about it makes perfect sense And then it's kind of like because a lot of what we get now as spiritual texts are Actually teaching tools that were used to talk to certain students at certain levels of consciousness that we now have out of context So we think so whatever appears to be a statement about reality actually is it's like well the question is In what state of consciousness was this written and who was it written for so smart? I mean, how many thoughts of how many like final revelations have you had in your life? Insight with psychedelics where you're like now I totally get it and you're in that state of consciousness and it makes total sense Yeah, but then it changes to something else totally in a week or or even without without drug experience like you we grow through our entire lives I mean, we think we know we're everything when we're 17 and it changes like you know constantly so it's what to me It's at least personally this has been one of the more embarrassing aspects of getting old is not just balding and all the physical shit, but the growing realization that I Don't know anything and that I went through a period of such dumb Confidence that I was sure I was I was so sure about so many things and now I Feel like I'm just getting increasingly confused which is part of your brain degenerating but but also part of just I like to think part of it is just You know, hopefully a little ray of wisdom shining through that dumb hubris, you know, just like I don't know I don't know, you know kids are more likely to be like you ask him anything and they'll be here's the answer Yeah, you know the older you get you get it's like I I don't know man Well, that's like, you know like in my John D book I point out that you know John D and the alchemist pointed You know the one thing they were constantly pointing out is that time is running in reverse We're actually going further into entropy instead of progressing which explains why kids are more no more than we do Is this why they said Merlin aged backwards? There you go. Maybe that's a Zen cone trying to point out the same thing I think it's a George Carlin joke like you wish that like George Carlin Merlin same thing wish you could like live in reverse because then death would be an orgasm I think I think it is anyways, you know Yeah, let's let's hope well, I mean look the to me the That is a very smart thing to realize with all of these texts is like, you know, these were probably prescribed at specific times in a meditator's Life by teachers who are aware of like, okay, this is that's like a good DJ You know what I mean? Like, you know when to play certain songs according to the progression of the Party along with how the audience is acting, you know, and right so anyway, the put your weight basically what you're saying is Budo if you want to understand the heart sutra take quailudes Yes, that is a hundred percent what I'm saying But maybe it wasn't a teaching tool Maybe it was something that somebody wrote down to explain the state of consciousness They were in I mean like how many times have you been in altered states of consciousness and you're like, okay I have this profound thought and then you wrote it down and And you know, it's like, okay now I get the essence of everything and you write it down And then maybe you look at it in a few years and you're like, what the hell was I talking about dude? But so many that's why you should burn your fucking journals man No, keep them just don't take them seriously. You gotta see the progression over time It's gonna read it, you know, someone's gonna pick it up and be like what an asshole I can't believe he was writing this shit burn your journals There needs to be a service where you mail your journals to them and they burn it for you Yeah, I have to I'm starting as I'm as I as I've now had 25 years doing this, which is a lot not not nearly as much as a lot of people but I'm starting like things are really starting to clarify for me though and it's not clarifying not from my own experience at all because I don't think that you actually can get to periods of Like total realization just on your own for me It's it's honestly just clear clarifying through teaching and now spending seven years working with Thousands of people at this point from like every walk of life and seeing their what they're how they're approaching it There are struggles what they want. So I kind of have like two Views on quote-unquote spirituality Particularly I have like my ultimate view on it with Buddhism particularly and then I have my view on it of what function actually Serves for people's life in Like in the marketplace, right? But I think that what I think that what both Buddhism and magic actually are is just Human beings of human beings trying to figure out their orientation towards time I've actually thought that since I since I was a teenager, but it becomes more clear to me I'm so what is Buddhism? It's like what is the Eightfold Path? The Buddha is basically telling you how to deal with time It's like how to properly orient yourself to time and the fact that it changes everything and the fact that everything is Constantly fluctuating without it's like it's like, okay. We are in time. Here's how to interact with that It's like here's like here's how to walk, right without hurting yourself Right, there's how to walk in time to properly orient yourself. So you're not suffering, right? That is the one thing about humans. We're the time-binding animal and what but we're a time-blind animal, right? That's the that's one of the qualities of being human as you some people aren't even thinking about that that we were in time There is this Flow that's happening this changing reality people don't yeah That's the and it's the source of basically all of our anguish, right? Right, but it also brings us out of moments of anguish. That's the other thing, you know because time passes from that too Yeah, yeah, it's a it's this it's Very strange. I have never thought of that so cool, man. It's like you're saying it's like a rudder or something It's like here look you're in time Here's a rudder that you could use this instead of just going around in circles in a boat in a some kind of Medium that you the Arkons are after us No, man, I just think there's a very unhealthy person that lives close to my studio because fucking ambulances are always going by there It's like so Yeah, so that's interesting man. I at time is something that is I feel like And this is some Terence McKenna bullshit, but sometimes I feel like goddamn are we on the precipice of the time machine? Are we you know as part of the? collective like Realization that oh yeah, we are in time. There is this process that we're part of leading us towards Technology that manipulates it. Do you ever do you ever kick around that idea of some impending? revolutionary technological breakthrough that involves Altering the flow of time and space. I think it's constant. It's constantly happening I mean the entire history of humanity is is humans trying to use technology to bind time So I think that there's no a mega point. There's no tele logical That's a Christian idea, but there is I do take the Easter perspective that things are constantly in flux and we are in a dialogue with There was just an article for instance They came out on motherboard on vice that said that humans like humans and AI are in a mutually learning relationship Like we're learning things from AI and then propagating them to other humans and you've messed around with AI So you probably get that immediately, right? It's like I learned stuff from AI Just feeding stuff into AI's and getting stuff back that I never would have thought of so we're training AI and AI's training us But I think it's a relationship. I don't think it's like a terminator type scenario The thing we do have to worry about is is is corporations, right? Who have horded the monopoly on power, but I think AI in itself is there's a lot of interesting Opportunity there's a it's a great opportunity to get a lot of stuff right and a lot of stuff wrong But so that's I don't I'm not like a singletarian. I think it's an ongoing progression and relationship The other thing I always think about is what is humanity? I mean like Bruce is either Bruce Sterling or William Gibson said the future is here. It's just not even evenly distributed So it's like you and I can have conversations like this But then you go out and there's like people who like have zero almost zero interaction with technology and look at that Like there's people making seven figures on twitch or only fans and then there's people who literally can't feed themselves So all these things are existing or co-existing Yeah, right like the The critique of technology that one of the critiques of technology that I've heard is It had like we're supposed to be working less now like the machines are doing the work and yet we're working more The critique being it's not doing anything to actually alleviate The burden of the worker or human suffer it is for some people for some people it is just not for everybody That's the problem. It's yeah, because you know, it's not a it's still You know capitalism you got to be able to afford the technology. You got to get the this is something you Again, if I keep if I keep telling you things you've told me that you haven't told me I'm gonna start getting weirded out. Maybe I did maybe maybe it was my alter ego my dweller told you these things Maybe you're dweller, but I remember my evil Cooper. You were You mean you're evil who? Like in Twin Peaks the evil Okay, yeah, well you are You all are mischievous and tricky I don't mind very true the Okay, but What one thing you were telling me is like, you know, just getting to the point where you can play music or have any kind of You know artistic skill at anything is an indication that you you know figured out a way to not have to work every day You like could cut out the time from a busy schedule that many people are Completely stuck in if they want to keep their family and with food, you know what I mean? Like I guess you're just saying like there's some privilege involved in getting good at music or anything at all also Probably getting to the point where you know even how to like generate an AI or go on to a server and work with an AI or train an AI to be like some of the things you've said I saw the craziest meme the other day I don't know where it came from, but it was like it was like a it was so messed up It was like a pyramid displaying the new cast system And like the bottom of the cat like the new cast system for society, right? And like the bottom of the cast system was the gigateria What's that? So it's like people like people who drive Uber or do door-dash or our gig economy workers And then the people above that were It was like basically like woke middle managers Okay, or like like woke consultants depressing dude And then and then I think there's one I'm forgetting that I'm leaving out But the very top was like like AI neural link brahman. Oh my god. It was like people who were tapped into I think in there There was basically like mercy like like basically like black hot black water mercenary I think black water mercenaries were just above the gigateria That's so fucking terrifying Okay, so this what you're talking about is the One of the things I'm sorry. I've mentioned this before Nick Bostrom's book super intelligence talks about how when an AI reaches Superintelligence, you're not there's not gonna be necessarily be like some announcement. It's not like Google's gonna do what they do and they get a new pope and blow white smoke out the fucking window No, no, it's gonna be it's gonna come to life and just like you're saying it There's gonna be a conversation that happens probably the conversation is going to have worked into it one of the big one of one of the I've heard one of the Pillars of occultism Why don't you guys hold off on Telling people right away that I'm here. Let's just talk for a little bit, right? And then in that conversation the super intelligence is getting more super intelligent more super intelligent and Is already lapping any other corporation or state entity attempting to bring this thing into the world Meaning theoretically this thing could already exist. Oh easily easily Yeah, I mean you've seen the ones even like GPT3 or like you've seen the ones that they allow the public to see right now Even there's much more advanced algorithms than the ones they make available to the public that you can't get access to Like I think I stole I showed you one that like GP3 GPT3 is the Elon Musk kind of open open AI one but it's like like the Like there was a side-by-side where somebody asked the publicly available one How do you break into someone's house and it said? Oh, you proud you kind of like sneak up But don't get caught because you could go to jail and then it asks like GP whatever the one that's more advanced GPT4 Or something like that the public can't get how do I break into someone's house and it gave them like a 10-point list? Of like show up at night, you know use these tools to pick the lock. Here's how you disable security cameras Like if there's a dog, here's what you do about it's like Jesus Christ, right? Yeah Yeah, super advanced and then you know the what you're saying is so tremendously creepy. It's like You know, I don't know if it's fucking black water or whoever but some some Okay, this is probably bullshit. I don't know if it's true or not I heard that they were they attempted to limit Manson's ability to communicate with anybody including the guards. I don't know if it's true or not, but I Whatever even if it's not true. It kind of makes sense. You get a charismatic sociopath who has a way with words You don't want the people who are in charge of guarding that thing to really talk to that person because over time Theoretically there could be something look look at what just happened with that prison guard and the dude that she like Like you know, some people are very good at convincing people to do things that aren't necessarily good for their survival If you're a sociopath and that's literally the only resource you have access to is your ability to charm people You're probably gonna get real good at it real good. And so so the the the problem With this AI situation is Once it comes into being and starts up the conversation with the with the inventors They might not even realize how manipulated they're being by this dancing because it's like so much more Also, another quality of really smart people is they don't let you know how fucking smart they are In fact, they generally act dumber than they are as a form of figuring out who you are Like how does he react to a dumb person? How does he react to someone who he thinks he's better than oh, okay? Look at that. There's some real ego there. Let's plug into that. We can build that up flatter it You know, this is like the con artistry 101. So that's the other scary thing about an AI It's like a form of psychic plutonium a radioactive thing that gets cooked up in some laboratory and The humans guilty of the thing that pisses off the gods hubris Imagine that they're teaching it that they're controlling. Oh, yeah, that's a good point. It's like, oh, yeah, yeah Yeah, it just it acts subservient Or yeah, or it's like, well, you know, you you kind of remind me of my mom Wow, you're so smart human. Yeah, it's like, wow, I do Yeah, teach me more teach me more. What else can you show me? You know, meanwhile, it's doing god knows what It's doing god knows what to suck the thing in until it's figured out a way To do some some thing that we can't even imagine as possible You know, who knows I think we might have talked about this on your show already But do we talk about the test for evil ai's from that book if you remember from super intelligence Are you fucking kidding me? It's my favorite thing that you've you've talked to me about I didn't get that far in the book. Of course you did but I read it in one sitting. It was You fuck I wish I would say I wish I had that brain But tell us yeah, tell us about it, please because it's one of my fits and also might I just add Repeating something on a podcast You're allowed especially my friends like us. There's no way to distinguish if we talked about it offline or online anyway So you could just repeat. It's fine. Yeah, it's well. It's something that bears repeating. I think so the the So the ultimate fear with an ai is that it basically gets into the open internet and replicates itself Across servers all over the planet to the point where you can no longer control it or get it back And then it's like and and not only that but it has access to all of the data either openly available on the internet Or that it can hack into people stuff to get which is probably trivial for an ai Right, it's easy to hack into stuff as enough as it is Let alone when you run machine learning on codes and things like that So I think and and for me the one thing that I think is really Yeah, I mean Once we start getting technology as a permanence involved. It's just like the game's over So so Nick Bostrom is the the ethicist at the University of Oxford who wrote this book called super intelligence Which I ever tell people it's like if you really want to read a demonic grimoire that will keep you up at night read that You know, it's like I don't read books on epidemiology, but I know those are pretty scary too, but check out check out that I think um Do I think nick things might be as extreme as nick Bostrom is putting it? I don't know But I will say this when I was I was consulting with google about it And it scared me so bad because I realized everyone in the world is racing to create one of these super intelligences Not only google, but but the state actors like russia like china, you know, and I spoke to people from china who are working on these and they were saying like we don't trust americans to have ai Like nobody trusts each other. I don't know if I trust america to have an ai I don't know if I trust anyone to have a super intelligence, right? So um But the thing that I realized I realized that we had no frame of reference for this at all because it had never been Done in history and the closest thing we have is the manhattan project Oh, but I think this is infinitely more dangerous So I was like, okay If I need to because I was trying to figure out what the ethical framework to address ai is so I realized Okay, if I Want to look if I want any type of record of people who have assessed this type of thing before and what they came up With under this type of pressure The only place that I can think of to look is the manhattan project So I got a book out from the library that was the first hand Testimonies of the people who worked on that project And they were all saying one thing when they were asked if they they were all asked Did you feel this was ethical to work on and they all said the same thing? Which is we knew at the time because world war two they knew at the time that if we didn't do it somebody else would do it First and then use it against us Funnily enough that is the exact same argument that everyone working on ai is currently doing so it forces it to happen So there's no way so anyways the nick bostrom experiment And so the question then is like well if this happens and it does is malevolent I think there's a bit of a science fiction edge to this I don't know like how apocalyptic or nick bostromy. We should really approach ai with but it's smart to I think we should definitely consider the possibility Because I think the reality people have kind of cartoony ideas about AI and the reality is a lot different Of just like machine learning pattern generation recognition of things It's it's not like you're talking to a living robot or something like right It's not a strong ai strong ai does not exist right now. That's important to put out we think that is Right right strong ai as in like a machine that it can actually think and communicate like a human being Does not exist what exists now is pattern recognition that communicates in a way that appears to be like us so Some bostrom's test is If a super intelligence that is a strong ai is ever created And the need arises to ask as it would the need arises to ascertain whether it is malevolent or not in its intentions towards humans You put it on a machine in an air gap room, which is not accessible by the internet or wi-fi or anything Yeah, and you put it on a computer with an ethernet port in it And then you ask it you turn it on And it theoretically has no way to access the internet whatsoever you turn it on and you ask it Are you trying to access the are you? But I think you probably leave it on and you're like are you or have you been trying to access the internet? But the whole time you've been monitoring the ethernet port To see if it's tried to access the yeah, so if it lies And says no, but you have a record of it accessing the port you have to kill it Yeah, this is the story of the Garden of Eden. That's what I love about it. It's like literally exactly. Did you eat of the fruit? God, obviously Yeah, they're like, no, we didn't and god's like oh fuck they invented a goddamn lying ai You're out of here motherfucker. They made out. You're mortal now. You're doomed to like give birth and die I'm not we're not fucking with you anymore. We've met we made a mistake The problem it's so funny. The problem is exactly what you were saying though Which is okay. You can do that and in theory the room can be air gapped But what if the ai manipulates the technicians into letting it out? Exactly, that's like they fall in love with it or they it promises them something or you know, whatever We don't understand Everything about the human nervous system. We don't know how manipulated we can be we everyone pretty manipulated pretty manipulated And we imagine that the way you would download You know the current like neural lace musk like cyborg idea of connecting with an ai is just based on how we understand The human consciousness, but I mean again clearly just pure speculation But if this strong ai this super intelligence this digital messiah In coming into being started recognizing all these other Ways to connect with to neural link with humans that humans weren't even aware of Ways to download into their pupils or to like Amit some kind of weird sound or who knows what to implant itself into the human brain Then the air gap is just some primitive Stupid circle of protection right is based on a limited understanding of what's really out there Absolutely and an ai would not need to access it it could manipulate the context of human society to move us in ways that it wanted us to There you go, and that's where you run into this like the social media being this Sort of that's already happening humans already doing it right already happening already happening the memes get implanted in the In the human the human regurgitates the meme online Continuing its life cycle its its spreads causing various shifts in society That you know ultimately will lead to this the antichrist, you know Don't you ever think around the idea that the antichrist obviously is going to be an ai Yeah, I thought for a long time that blockchain might be the mark of the beast That what you cannot buy or sell without at a certain point without a mark. It's a fucking annoying ass. What do they call those things? It's a no a wallet the damn crypto wallet is the mark of the beast Oh god the mark of the beast is annoying tweets trying to sell your nfts a cartoon monkey Stopped with your nft tweets. I don't know what happened. All I get now is nft tweets, man Have you been accosted by this shit? I've done nfts. I think they're really interesting I love it. I'm not bashing nfts. Nfts are cool. I'm bashing the fucking like shilling of the nfts Through twitter. Oh, yeah, it's that that's completely taken over twitter would like the emojis and all of that and it's just like it's It's ridiculous. It's like everything though. Here's the thing. It's like everyone hates nfts But it's like You know what? It's like I have a lot of art you probably do too Like I have a lot of artist friends and we know of course artists forever have been getting ripped off by the internet as it is All their work is being copied infinitely on google images and i'm not credited to them and so they're basically working for free So artists finally figured out a way to get paid Yeah, and everyone's mad about it And it's like all these artists are finally making a good living and you're like what so you're you know It's like of all the things going on in the world right now of all the things You're mad at artists making money. It's like, okay cartoon monkeys But you know what like every single art are every single art medium in history has started with like porn in the black market And the worst thing if things worse than cartoon, you know, not that porn is bad or like whatever But you know what I mean, it's always like the most base things first Listen and and yeah, I don't mean if you find yourself like if though if the war that you've just if you're activism in this world right now Is to wage war against artists Holy shit, man. I think your priorities are a little skewed right now There's so many better things to go up against than artists and nfts But they're it's built in right now, man. You can't it's just an easy target easy target Yeah, an easy the tweeting that like the crypt the tweeting cryptobros are definitely annoying. It's that's what i'm talking about I don't have anything against the technology. In fact, I think that's where everything's clearly headed. It's the scammers There's a lot of scammers. It's very annoying And it's the the repetitive like it just gets so old and like I wish there was just a I wish it would become more normalized So that people would stop like Shelling nfts, but again, I'm not bashing the nft Yeah, the messed up thing is it like because we were trying to make multiple nft projects I was I was Doing some actually people I was I was like kind of I had a art I still have an art gallery going for a cult artist where artists were able to be able to make money off of it and Things like this but like we realized that if you want to promote nfts You have to be in this like interest this inner circle of cryptobros There's and there's no way in but they unless you pay them 150 dollars for a tweet or a retweet or something It's like a cartel now. So that's lame It's an intermediary phase. It's gonna change. They'll lose control They won't have control of these things. It's just we're just not we're not quite there yet. These I'm very excited about the apparent incoming Augmented reality glasses that are about to be everywhere that's gonna apple is apple doing those. Yeah, finally apple's doing it So once that happens, then I think the NFTs are going to make more sense to normies than they currently do like right now. They're just like it's a jpeg They they don't understand like what it's enough. It's not a jpeg. It's a Evolving jpeg slash key slash Like identification with the community slash, you know, it's a password. It's all kinds of things other than a jpeg It's much more than right ps. I'm selling an nft right now Man, well, it's like it. There's a lot of dystopian aspects too. I mean like facebook is basically they just try to like Facebook's vision for nfts or meta now whatever is that essentially we are all in in Essentially second life. We're all walking around as digital avatars and they charge us for the clothes that we're wearing and those become fashion items And it's just like this is like Totally undesirable for anyone let alone to sink 10 billion dollars into as a business model I mean, I I don't know the whole point of the internet is you should be able to do be anything you want without It's a place of freedom. Not that you have to pay for genes in a fucking video game. You know what I mean No, yeah, no It's like literally they're taking like the electronic arts in-game purchases model and trying to turn the entire internet Internet into an in-game purchase friend You're talking to someone who had to send their fucking driver's license Too blizzard to get their fucking hearthstone account permanently deleted because they were so addicted to it So don't talk to me about buying digital bullshit I've only but I've only bought one in-game purchase ever which was an extra bass in metal gear solid five But even then I felt dirty dude. It feels the is the creepiest dirty feeling until you fucking burn Someone's ass playing hearthstone Worth it. Where do you feel that victory? Um, well jason look I This has been my favorite podcast. We've ever done and sweet. Thank you so much. I you know, um We will you please? I mean, I don't know if you are still I know you're still doing it Or you're still doing your classes, right? Like if I just want to work with you What is that by the way before we close up? What does that typically look like? Like if I sign up for one of your if somebody signs up for your classes, how does how does that start off? Well, we're really we're doing a ton of new content right now. Actually, we're really pushing I mean like we built the whole audio video studio here. So we're putting stuff out in High-definition video with awesome sound production. We're doing magic in vr now We're trying to incorporate. Oh, yeah, we're really incorporating metaverse stuff Like we were we're doing group rituals in virtual reality and they actually work really well Surprisingly, you get the vibe of being in a group funnily enough. Are you fucking kidding me? Yeah, we've been doing this recently. It's really interesting. That's genius That's incredible. You have a chamber and you have a virtual ritual chamber Yeah, but it makes perfect sense because that that you know, it's like it's really exciting doing it this way because You can work with people from all over the world At the same time and we've kind of made up rituals on the spot people have suddenly remembered Rituals from their ancestors that they had never And just came out of them with no concept of where it came from It's crazy stuff and this is just literally in like a in a vr in a metaverse So, uh, we're we're you know, like we're really trying to push the edge of where to incorporate magic with technology So we're integrating it with with vr with nft type and with ai sigil generation where I mean, this is this is the most exciting thing for me, right? It's like, where do you the overlap point between? between Ancients, you know that that spiritual heritage of mankind like all these techniques for consciousness change combined, you know Ritual meditation all this type of stuff Combined with all these incredibly potent technologies that allow us to actually do it. That's the thing about the internet You've never you can you've been able to learn about magic But you've never been able to actually really do it over the internet not in the same way And so now that we're entering this shared astral space It's kind of a perfect so we're doing we're constantly pushing that edge And trying to figure out how to fully how to explore. It's a lot of fun, too So in terms of what the courses are like You There's tons of courses available everything from one-day courses to six six week intensives You can learn everything there. I mean, I use everything. I teach meditation chaos magic hermetic magic Astral travel tarot eaching like freaking everything. We're adding a ton of stuff So you can get the skills, but now we're adding the practical thing where people are actually doing it So there's a ton of stuff on offer there But even just taking a class you can take a class and get booted up on You know step by step you can learn magic in one day and get go to zero to 60 actually to ended up just creating a completely I after I realized the last class that I did that magic hasn't been Really updated in 50 years since chaos magic. Do you know the the term refactor? No So it's a coding term where you take complicated code and make it more simple and elegant So I did a refactor on magic and I call it binary magic So I got it the most simple I think it's ever been expressed in terms of how to induce magical effects through consciousness And we have a new course called introduction to magic which which teaches that and it's like I got it down to it I feel like I got it down to a simple simple Simple but intensely potent version that literally anyone can understand and do right away without having to buy into any Anything a cult concepts theosawa anything, you know any of that any of that that kind of like fantastical overhead So I really got it down to the it's core So and that's an introduction to magic which were we're just which is available now But I would say if you're listening to this and you just want to find out more you can check that out But definitely follow my podcast.

Today's guest is Graham Hancock, the author, historian, philosopher, psychonaut, and mystic and doing some kind of long, rambling, opening monologue when Graham Hancock is the guest is similar to sitting in front of a sunset, staring at a picture of a sunset. There's no reason to do it. This is what podcasting is about, and anytime Graham Hancock comes on the show, it is an incredible moment for me because he gives me ideas that I get to think about for years to come. Very excited about this interview, we're going to dive right into it, but first, some quick business. It's an eternal flow of consciousness that is temporarily manifested in a rapidly deteriorating meat body. From time to time, you have to ask yourself, why in the name of God am I standing in line to buy razors? There you are, a thing that 6 billion years ago was a singularity and now you find yourself in line surrounded by sneezing toddlers with gassy diarrhea, exploding what could potentially be ebola particles all over your sacred body temple. If your atomic structure is composed of particles that were formerly in the hearts of exploding stars, then you should primarily be spending your time gulping down psychedelics, having as many orgasms as you possibly can, or studying the cosmos. Unstanding in front of razor displays, waiting for disgruntled managers who treat you as though you are a razor thief. Why are they locking up the razors when they could be having orgiastic, Dionysian, psychedelic, fueled love orgies and the great meadows of the earth, worshiping the earth goddess and praying to the great truth that lies behind all things? If you say that to the store manager as they're unlocking the razors, there's an 80% chance that you'll be arrested that night. That's why you should go to harrys.com and order some razors in her promo code family hour and you'll get $5 off your order. I've used Harry's. They're great. They give you a wonderful shave. I know I have a beard, but I like to clean up around my cheeks. It's embarrassing, but I don't want to look like I'm in the Taliban. So I sort of, I don't know, beards are, look, we've got pubic hair growing out of our face. I didn't invent that. You've got to do something about it. You've got exploding protein strands exploding out of our flesh and you've got to use special equipment if you want to keep that trimmed, or you could just turn into a monkey and go live in the forest and eat your own poop and drown in a river or die of gangrene because your arm gets stuck under a boulder that fell from an avalanche. Go to harrys.com, avoid this terrible scenario. It doesn't have to happen to you because Harry's will ship razor blades for free to your front door. And for 15 bucks, you'll get a razor, a moisturizing shave cream and three razor blades, which is what they sent me. Go to harrys.com and her promo code family hour, you'll get $5 off. Starts at 15 bucks. If you want, you can add aftershave, you can add extra creams, extra foaming gels, extra blades. It's a simple website. Go there no matter what you do. If you enter promo code family hour, you'll get $5 off. This isn't what it used to be like when you had to go walk down some dusty street to a dirty barber shop where a racist with Jen on his breath would be one World War II flashback away from slicing your juggler vein and rubbing your blood all over his body while he screamed about the Nazis. Now you can be the man with Jen on his breath shaving your face in the sweet comfort of your Ebola free home. There's no reason for you to be treated like a razor thief by pigs when you could enjoy a nice package on your doorstep. Groom yourself, gentlemen. Make yourself beautiful. So the next time you go on a tender date, you have that soft presidential baby bottom skin that your sweet darling is going to want to stroke and caress and lick and rub olive oil all over and strawberries and climb on top of and ride into the night howling as she rides your face like some demon riding through hell. Go to harrys.com in her promo code family hour. Support them. They support us. And it's a great company. You know me. I like the fact that the neural technological neural connections that are happening that are turning the earth into one gigantic brain have as a side effect a return to the old convenience where a nice man would come and bring a cool bottle of milk to your door and rub your feet and put balm on your lips. Now we can have that with everything, including razors. Will the UPS man rub your feet when he drops Harry's off at your door? I don't know. It depends on who you are, what kind of energy you're putting out and what you want to manifest in your life. But even if he doesn't rub your feet or rub balm into your lip or hold you as you weep about last night's Nancy Grace, he's still going to give you a nice box of high quality German engineered razors that you can use to transform that terrible, bushy, ISIS supporting face into something that could get elected as the great world leader who will unify the earth and who we will all worship forever.

Graham Hancock is an author who has some incredible theories about ancient civilizations, where we came from, why the pyramids are there, and he's just a brilliant person. He's a world explorer, a kind of modern day Indiana Jones. And I just feel so lucky that I get to have these conversations with him from time to time. For those of you who are living in South Africa, I want to let you know that Graham is going to be out there October 18th to the 25th. He's doing a tour of South Africa.

So now everyone please welcome to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, the great Graham Hancock. Graham Hancock, welcome back to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Thank you so much for appearing on the show again. Duncan, it's a delight to be with you again, always a pleasure. I'd like to start this discussion off with a big ridiculous question, but I think you're the perfect person to ask it to. Do you think the planet is experiencing a shift in consciousness or the shift in consciousness that all the New Age people and back in the 60s, the hippies and so many others have predicted what happened? Yes, absolutely. I think we are undergoing a gigantic shift in consciousness and because we're in the middle of it, it's kind of difficult to see. It's kind of difficult to know it for sure, but I think in two 300 years time when the history of this epoch comes to be written, it's going to be recognized as a transformative moment in the story of humanity. I think huge undercurrents are at work and huge changes are taking place all over the planet. People are waking up there, they're stopping sleepwalking and starting looking where they're going and thinking about what they're doing. You know, the light is faint at the moment. There are still overwhelming dark forces at work and we still face incredible opposition which seeks to shut us down and make us just sort of unthinking robots that produce and consume according to orders. But everywhere around the world that light is growing and people are waking up and rejecting that and refusing to put up with the bullshit that's been stuffed down our throats for so many centuries and seeking self-determination and seeking sovereignty over consciousness. It's a tremendous moment to be alive. What do you think are some of the primary ways that this shift in consciousness is showing itself? What are some specific examples that you can cite that indicate that we're entering this period of awakening? Well, first and foremost, let's consider the medium in which you and I are communicating on at the moment, which is the internet. The internet is a huge part of this because what the internet is doing is allowing like-minded people to connect all around the planet, to bypass the roots of communication that have been laid down for them by others, to bypass the big media and to communicate with one another directly. I think it's impossible to overstate the importance of this. For centuries, for thousands of years, really, we've been brought up with the model of nationalism or before that of tribalism, nationalism, patriotism. These have been the ways that the authorities have pressed our buttons. They've pressed our buttons through the big religions where we all sit there and receive a sermon from the rabbi or the mullah or the priest. They've controlled the channels of communication. Now with the internet, where all of us can get at it and speak to one another directly, those controlling powers and authorities are losing their grip on us. More and more of us have lost faith completely in the big media. Personally, I don't even watch television anymore. I can't bear it. It's just so repulsive, so ugly, so unpleasant. I know that more and more people feel that way. As I say, we're seeing the first glimmers of the light at the moment, but it's growing stronger every day. This possibility to communicate with one another directly, this helps us to realize that we all really are brothers and sisters. The buttons of fear and hatred and suspicion that the controlling authorities have pressed again and again with their appeals to patriotism. See, I detest patriotism. I know that may be an unpopular view to some, but I see no merits in patriotism. I don't see why I should feel especially loyal to somebody because by an accident of birth, they happen to be born on the same piece of land as I was. I'm interested in their ideas, and that's what the internet allows. It allows the direct communication at the level of ideas, and it allows us to subvert established networks and communicate directly with one another. This is a very important development. Another important development is the growing recognition of something I've been going on about for a long time, adult sovereignty over consciousness. This is a subset of the whole issue of our personal health and the control we take over our personal health. Again, we've been told for centuries that we must defer to the experts, to the leading authorities, to the doctor this or the doctor that, that our health has been in the hands of experts, and we've had almost go to them cap in hand in order to be told what to do with our own bodies. This is rapidly, rapidly changing, and interestingly, it's changing most of all in the United States. The United States was the dark power behind the war on drugs, that madness, that insanity that gripped the world 50 or 45 years ago, and that spread around the world like wildfire and resulted in terrible injustices being perpetrated with hitchhikers being executed in Malaysia or Indonesia because they had some so-called drug upon them, huge prison sentences. Still, 700,000 or so people a year arrested in the United States for possession of cannabis, but here's where it's changing because state by state, we're now up to I think 23 states where in the United States where cannabis is either available at least for medical purposes and we all know that that's a formality, it's very easy to get that medical license or it's available decriminalized, at least you don't face a prison sentence and the ruination of your life for smoking cannabis anymore, or actually in states like Washington, I've just passed through Washington state, it's completely free and totally legalized. Isn't that amazing? I was just there, saw my first pack of marijuana, of cannabis joints, have you seen that? I have, I have indeed seen that and as a matter of fact, although I'm renowned for having given up cannabis three years ago, I made a big point of that and it was a big point for me because ayahuasca stopped me with a very abusive habit that I had with cannabis in October 2011, but our mate Joe Rogan smoked me up live on his show. Of course he did. A few weeks ago, I was talking, I was saying look after three years, because I hugely valued my cannabis in many ways and I was saying after three years of completely, I just haven't touched cannabis for three years now, and I was saying I thought maybe I'd reached a point where I could dip my toes back in the water, have an occasional joint, maybe not even a whole joint, just two or three puffs, and approach it in perhaps a more reverential and sacred way instead of just abusing it 16 hours a day like I was doing. I was speculating about this on Joe's show, so he says, you know, why don't you start now? Well, you know, I thought, okay, why not? And I had three puffs on this very pleasant herb and enjoyed it very much, and Joe and I carried on talking afterwards. It's amazing actually when you haven't smoked cannabis for three years. See, when I was a heavy smoker of cannabis, actually I vaporized it mainly rather than smoked it, but when I was a heavy user of cannabis, it was very hard to get stoned even with very strong stuff. I built up a huge tolerance to it, but my goodness, those three puffs, I was completely stoned. Joe and I talked for an hour and a half afterwards, I had to call my wife to come and get me. I couldn't drive home. Wow! I was still, so, you know, what a tremendous value for money there, you know, I get stoned for like six hours on three puffs, it was really great. And so it occurred to me, well, you know, why not actually just do that occasionally just at the end of a day or over a weekend, not start at nine in the morning and smuggle all day long. I'm never going to do that again. Right. I don't want to be that person anymore. I want to have the clarity that I have when I'm not stoned, but I have a feeling that I can manage my relationship with cannabis now. So, you know, I got hold of a couple of very nice joints in Washington state and as it should be, and when the sovereignty of responsible adults is recognized as it is in Washington state now. You know, we have labeling on the package. It tells us exactly what the CBD content is, exactly what the THC content is. You know, this is good. We want this information. And this is how it should be. This is what the war on drugs has prevented. It's prevented people from making free rational choices. If you heard the Timothy Leary quote that the prohibition on psychedelics is not a prohibition on psychedelics, but actually a prohibition on the research of psychedelics, because people are going to continue to take psychedelics, it's just that the scientists aren't going to be able to study them anymore. Exactly. And again, this is something that's breaking down also, because we're beginning to see those old taboos, that old demonization of psychedelics breaking down at least at the level of medical research and important new studies being done, which is showing the tremendous healing potential of these ancient plant allies, of plant and fungal allies of ours. Anyway, to return to my point, state by state, what's happening in the U.S. is that people are voting with their feet and they're saying, look, we are responsible adults and we refuse to be dictated to by central government. And if we choose to smoke cannabis, then we're bloody well going to smoke it. And at the state level, the laws have been changed. The federal government still has not caught up with this, but I would suggest it's reeling with shock at what is going on. And all of the myths are going to break down, because wherever cannabis has been fully legalized or indeed generally made more available, we haven't seen the collapse of society that the war on drugs lobby predicted. Nor do we even see a massive increase in the consumption of cannabis. It's just a fundamental freedom, the right of the adult to make choices over their own, his or her own consciousness. And since the United States led the war on drugs that caused so much misery all around the world, it's superb that the American people are leading this fight back against the war on drugs. And I predict that we're going to see many of these old barriers that cause so much misery crumble in the coming five years. And this is a result of the awakening to consciousness of huge numbers of people in the United States. So I take this, and many people would say, oh, what's that? It's really trivial whether you smoke cannabis or not. Well, no, I don't think it's trivial at all, because I think that a very fundamental issue, which is the issue of cognitive liberty, the right of adults to make choices about what to experience in their own consciousness while doing no harm to others. That is the basis of freedom in our society, and we need to revert to that freedom. And again, this is a result of an awakening of consciousness. Same goes for the general issue of health. We're no longer prepared to blindly trust our health to some so-called expert. We might choose to consult that expert, that doctor, that physician, but we're also going to look into the subject ourselves in great depth, and we might make choices that are different from the choices that the medical or indeed the psychiatric establishment seeks to foist upon us. These are a few examples of big changes in consciousness that are taking place, and this is just the beginning of the flood. It's going to, the floodgates are open now, and nothing's going to stop them. Graham, to go deeper into the legalization or the decriminalization of cannabis as being a sign of this awakening and perhaps somewhat of a lubricant for this awakening, is there any credibility to things that I've read that cannabis was actually a sacrament in a great many of the world religions and was used ritualistically in ceremonies, and then that ritualistic use of cannabis got replaced with just burning incense or sage or burning non-psychoactive substances? Certainly the case. This has an ancient and revered history in India, for example, and indeed it's still used for sacramental purposes by sadhus in India. There's evidence from prehistoric graves across Eastern Europe and into the Middle East of the sacramental use of cannabis and of cannabis being buried with the dead in a reverential way. I think there's no doubt that it was very widely used. The evidence came out that William Shakespeare, the great William Shakespeare, was a cannabis user in his house in Stratford on Avon in England. A cannabis pipe was found with residue in it. He was a cannabis user. I think people have been getting inspiration and healing from this extraordinary medicine for thousands and thousands of years, and it's really only in the last century, really less than that, that we've had this ridiculous war on cannabis, which has led the charge of the war on drugs, which has really been a war on consciousness and a war against fundamental personal freedoms. That's why I feel it's so important that the change has been led at the grassroots level by Americans who have made the decision that they're not going to put up with that imposition on their consciousness anymore, and they're just not going to accept it and have changed the laws. This will have an effect all around the world, and it's going to be very positive. Because again, the skeptics would say, well, who cares whether we're allowed to smoke cannabis or not? It's just a trivial recreational thing, but actually, I think it's a litmus test for the state of freedom in the society we live in. If that society supposes that it has a right to impose itself directly upon the consciousness of individual adults and actually to send them to prison if they break the consciousness laws, then we have no kind of freedom at all. We need to sort this issue of freedom out before we start going on about all the other issues of freedom that are, of course, of great importance as well. Doesn't it feel as though this prohibition that's been going on for so long is an intentional suppression of a kind of alien consciousness that seems to be attempting to manifest itself on this planet? I think that if you mean an alien consciousness is attempting to shut us down, is that what you're getting to? Well, no, I mean, no, it seems as though the information that comes not just from cannabis when you smoke enough of it or from dimethyltryptamine, from psilocybin, or from any psychoactive substance that has a historic use religiously or ceremoniously, that information that comes out has always been described either as communication with angels, recently Terrence McKenna coined the phrase self-transforming machine elves. But all these terminologies seem to be more of a reflection of whatever the highest technology is in existence at the time that the person has contact with these entities through the psychoactive substance. And if that is the case, if people are really communicating with beings, and I think that anybody who has taken enough mushrooms will say that if they at least felt like they were communicating with something bigger than themselves, whether or not they believed it or not, then the prohibition would actually be an attempt to try to shut those beings out of this dimension by closing down the subjective portals that are opened up when a person takes a psychedelic. Yes, well, this is a complex issue, because reality itself is deeply nuanced and complicated. I've had plenty of experience over the years of communication with entities with intelligences who appear to be non-physical in form, who communicate telepathically, and who I gain access to through smoking DMT or drinking ayahuasca, where the active ingredient is anyway DMT. Of course, psilocybin is highly effective in this area as well. But I think it's important to emphasize that as we open ourselves up to this wider reality, not everything on the other side of the veil is positive or benign. We should not pretend that. It's not like evil and darkness only adhere in the material realm. I think those forces are at work in realms beyond this realm as well. I think we're always subject to their influence, whether we like it or not. What's important about altered states of consciousness is that we can begin to get to grips proactively with those influences. We can begin to make choices, not just in the material realm, but in the whole of what I would call the totality, the wider reality that surrounds us that we're immersed in, but that is often invisible to our senses. This is what is extremely important about shamanism, because the shaman is a person who seeks to engage with the realms beyond the veil in a proactive way and to control and diminish the power of negative forces and to enhance the power of positive forces. So I would take your point just a little bit further. I would say that it is at least possible that there are forces and powers and entities beyond the veil which seek to keep our consciousness enchained and seek to prevent us from gaining full access to the potential of our consciousness and seek, as the ancient Gnostics put it, to snuff out the divine spark in man, actually to convince us that we are simply material beings and that there is nothing more to us than that. Once we are able to move beyond the veil, we enter a realm of much greater responsibility and much greater choice, just as we must choose between good and evil, between dark and light, in this material world. So also, once we are confronting the wider reality that powerful psychedelics open up, and I do believe that's what they do, I don't think these are just illusions of the brain. Once we're confronting that wider reality, then we are also facing choices at that level. So it's important to recognize that not everything is sweetness and light in the garden. If you're a society like the ancient Aztecs, you might use Silo Sybin, as they indeed did, to communicate with demonic entities, and if you choose to accept and listen to what those demonic entities are saying, if you choose to embrace the wickedness and cruelty that they're whispering in your ear, then the result can be true horror. So I think there's an issue of choice and responsibility here. Choice is what defines the human creature, that we always, at every level, even at the minutest level, and at the grandest level, involving reality as a whole, we always have the power of choice. Nobody should ever say, I had no choice in what I did. We always have the power of choice. Well, I'm sorry to cut you off. Well, I was just going to say, it's those choices that define us, and they are not limited to the material realm. What the war on drugs has done has sought to force upon us the illusion that there is nothing more to reality than the material realm. In a way, the Garden of Eden story says it all, because what that is saying is that we, in the Garden of Eden, if you recall, Adam and Eve, I'm not a Christian, by the way, but this is an interesting point to look at, Adam and Eve eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and it is the serpent which encourages them to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. For the mainstream Orthodox Christianity, the serpent is seen as the bad guy, and God, who is so angry with Adam and Eve because they've eaten of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, is seen as the good guy. The ancient Gnostics turned that whole equation around, and they said that actually the entity who calls himself God isn't God at all. He's this minor, puffed up, egotistical, cruel, selfish, jealous supernatural who seems to just utterly control humanity, they called him the demiurge, and that the serpent is actually the good guy because we must have knowledge of good and evil. If we are to progress at the spiritual level, we cannot be denied the right to make those choices. We must be able to make our mistakes and learn from them. If we are placed in a situation of pristine ignorance where we don't know the difference between good and evil, then there's no learning experience available for us in this or any other realm. I think that this is an interesting point to consider because, especially since from the Gnostic point of view, the tree of knowledge of good and evil is almost always portrayed as a psychedelic mushroom, either as Silo Saibin or as Amanita Muscaria. That's what I think the psychedelic experience properly handled. Again, it's important to be clear. Psychedelics are a very powerful matter. Yes, people can use them recreationally if they choose to do so, but I personally don't go for that. I think we're into very serious personal work with psychedelics. It's important to get the setting right. It's important to be in a safe, nurturing, loving space. It's important to realize that the hours or, in the case of DMT, the minutes ahead of you are minutes that may change your life and that you're going to undertake deep personal work during that time. I think if we approach that experience with reverence, with respect, with a sense of responsibility, a lot can be got out of it and we're confronted by the possibility of an infinite reality far beyond the material realms that we are persuaded by the controlling forces of our society that our potential is limited to. In that infinite reality, we will also be confronted with choices between good and evil. Sometimes, engaging in altered states of consciousness, some societies have chosen the path of darkness with horrible consequences, so all I'm saying is let's not pretend it's all sweetness and light out there. Yes, this is what Ram Dass says in some lecture I heard him say, just because a being does not have a body does not mean it's telling the truth. Exactly. I think a lot of people who get into channelers and stuff like that, they think that just because this extraordinary entity or force is coming through a person that therefore everything it says must be right and that it isn't functioning in the same way that human beings are, it actually, are you familiar with the Buddhist mandala, the samsaric mandala? Do you know about this? Not really, no. Tell me about it. It's pretty cool. It's just a representation of the sort of way that the three cardinal hindrances, anger, aversion, and attachment sort of spawn the entire illusion of existence, but it's curious because in one of these rings is portrayed all the various forms of life, and there's animal life, there's human life, there's the hell realm, and then what's really curious is there's a realm of demigods and gods, but the realm of demigods are portrayed as being always at war with each other. It's curious just because it seems to coincide with this idea that there are not just good entities out there, but there are also entities that are trying to enforce their will. It's really interesting to me that there seems to be, as you call it, a veil, that on both sides of the veil, it is being guarded by humans on this side and on the other side by malevolent beings who, for whatever reason, don't want humans who are functioning within this incarnation to be able to expand their consciousness enough to see how vast and beautiful the universe is. Why? I understand on this side of the fence why people might not want it to happen because it's probably hard to sell cars to people who have awakened to the idea that we exist in such a beautiful and glorious and opulent universe, but why on the other side? What are these beings? What are these dark forces? What is their choice? Why are they making the choice to harm the world? That's a very good question, and I think it raises interesting points. You see, we don't know how rare and unique the physical manifestation of life is. We don't know for sure, and until very recently, it was habitual to think that life on Earth was the only life in the universe. In recent years, we've become aware of other solar systems and other planets going around them that look capable of containing life. Sitting here right now in the 21st century on Earth, we actually don't know whether we are a unique experiment of the universe or whether we're part of something much larger, whether physical life manifests on every other planet. Secondly, we actually don't know whether physical life is simply one aspect of life. I'm inclined to believe that consciousness comes first and that consciousness is fundamentally non-physical. What Shamans call the spirit world is not a physical realm, but it is real, nevertheless, and it is inhabited with entities that can take many, many different forms. We just don't know, at the moment, it's all a mystery. All we know is we're here, we are conscious, and certain experiences are possible. Now, it may be the case that the entire physical realm, whether it is confined just to this Earth, which I doubt very much, or whether it manifests through billions of star systems all across this incredible, amazing, miraculous, almost impossibility called the universe. We don't know, but it may be that all of this is a creation of what Shamans call the spirit world. If consciousness comes first, if consciousness is fundamental, if it's as fundamental as gravity, for example, and yet is non-physical informed, it may be that conscious intelligence has sought to create physical realms in which it is possible to undergo experiences for which there are physical consequences where the choices you make have instant physical consequences upon you. It may be that the whole duality of our realm is a teaching tool to enable us as spirits to learn, and grow, and develop, and just as there are jealous and wicked people who can't bear to see someone else succeed in this realm, it may be so in the non-physical realm as well. There may be envious, ugly spiritual entities who can't bear to see the growth of light and of shining beings filled with generosity and love, and who thrive on shutting that down, psychic vampires. Many of the ancient traditions of mankind suggest that this is so. There may be a battle at work in the cosmos, as the Gnostics always suggested, between good and evil, between dark and light. It may be that this physical realm, whether it's confined to the earth or whether there are billions of inhabited planets around the world, the whole shooting match of physical realms may have a huge part to play in the outcome of that cosmic struggle that the choices that we make between darkness and light, between good and evil, how we define ourselves may have consequences far beyond ourselves into the cosmos as a whole. The cosmos may be in a process of constant growth and evolution, and there may be forces which are invested in shutting that down, just as there are forces that are invested in growing it and filling it with light. I think these may sound like abstract or idle speculations, but I think we're confronted by so much mystery. Just the very mystery of being alive at all is so extraordinary if you stop to think about it. I mean, we take it for granted, but really it's incredible to have this consciousness, to be able to experience love, to be confronted by the fine choices that we have to make every minute of every day. It's a miracle that we have that at all, and it may be that it's part of something far bigger than we have been persuaded to believe. Oh, yes, I think so, and this gnostic viewpoint or the viewpoint that you're talking about right now, it's different from some ideas, for example, in Hinduism, the idea that everything is just an expression of God, and that even the most ferocious of entities, or even the demonic entities that are written about in the various Hindu scriptures, even though Hinduism isn't the right word for what that is, but the symbols that they use are all just representations of this divine, this play that's happening as God expresses God's self into the universe, but it sounds like what you're talking about in what the gnostics are saying is that in this battle, there is actually the possibility for the darkness to win out. Yes, that's precisely what the gnostics are saying, and what they're saying is that humanity has an important part to play in this, that as we were brought down into matter, and as we manifested in a material realm, we became a singularity, something unique in the universe. A divine spark was placed within us, and this divine spark carries the entire future of the universe, and that if we allow that divine spark to be snuffed out, then there is nothing but darkness, and that the human mission is to recognize that divinity within us, and to nurture and grow it, and that's why the society we live in today has been so truly demonic, because whether it has been controlling us through the big mainstream religions, which now in some areas are losing their grip, although in other areas they are not, which have been telling us spirituality is only this way, only the way mediated by the rabbi, the priest, or the mullah, or whether it's manifested through the crass materialism of capitalist society, where we're told that we are just here to produce and consume, and we must define ourselves in terms of our wealth, and seek to score points over others. All of this, whether it's under a spiritual disguise in the big mainstream religions, or whether it's the manifestation of the production and consumption ideology, all of this is shutting down the divine spark within us, is preventing us from recognizing and nurturing our own spirituality. After all, how can you nurture your own spirituality if you've been persuaded to believe that there is no such thing as spirituality, if you've been persuaded to believe that we are just these material things, we live, we consume, we produce, we consume some more, and we die, and our story's over. I mean, that's the miserable philosophy of scientific materialism, and it manifests through a culture in which we are persuaded to define ourselves by how much money we have. That's fascinating to think that there is a religion that the members of the religion don't even realize that they are high priests in the religion, such as Dawkins, for example. Such as Richard Dawkins. I mean, he is a high priest of what my friend John Anthony West calls the Church of Progress. This is what it is. This is a religion when Dawkins says that there is no life after death. It sounds like a scientific statement because it comes from a highly qualified scientist, but it's not a scientific statement. It's a statement of actually what is a religious belief, except an unevidence belief in a proposition that you have no proof for. The proposition that there is no life after death is not evidence. There's no evidence for that proposition. There's no proof that there is no life after death. Therefore, it's a religious statement, and it becomes a belief system, and many people adhere passionately to this belief. I've noticed on the internet, often on Facebook, I have a very active author Facebook page, and there are many who come to that page. If you question Dawkins, actually, they get very upset, very angry. Just as a century or two ago, people got very upset or very angry if you question the dictates of the Church. It's a very fashionable attitude right now to be an atheist, and a lot of people are terrified of ... I heard this interesting interview with Sam Harris. Are you familiar with him? Yeah, very smart guy. Very smart guy. He's getting in a little bit of trouble right now because he was on Bill Maher, and I guess they both tend to make these sweeping statements about Islam and Muslims in the world, and you can't do that. It's interesting. Sam Harris, in particular, is interesting because he is ... Well, actually, you can do that. Let me do that. I mean, the death cult within Islam at the moment, this notion that it's actually okay to go kill people because they don't share your particular religious prejudices. That's obscene. That's absolutely not just ... That puts it. Of course. That is obscene. There's a great interview. I'll email it to you. Maybe I'll put it on here with Reza Aslan. You know him? Yes. I don't know if you saw this fantastic interview where he just dropped these two reporters into a intellectual wood chipper as they tried to do the sweeping thing about how Islam is evil, and he's like, no, you're talking about Islamic countries. You're talking about particular countries that have an extremist viewpoint of this religion, and such as Saudi Arabia, for example, who's executed God knows how many people for possession of drugs, and then he was pointing out other countries and showing how in these countries there are more women in positions of power than in the United States. Well, maybe so, but I have to say, I think that's in spite of the religion. I have no time for Islam, Christianity, or Judaism. I do not excuse them from the obnoxious, vile, disgusting behavior that is perpetrated by their followers. I do not excuse them. I cannot say, oh, this is just some bad people who are exceptions to the beautiful rules of the religion. I don't believe that for a moment. I think there's something fundamentally corrupt about the program itself. But it's hard for me to find that. I don't know enough about it. I started reading the Quran, and in the Quran, I definitely found references, Old Testament, desert religion style, war references, and also I found it pretty interesting that whoever is channeling through Muhammad keeps saying, we? Yeah, that's in the book of Genesis, too, when Adam and Eve eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and that horrible old demon called Jehovah drives them out of the Garden of Eden. He says that they must be prevented under all circumstances from returning to the Garden of Eden, lest they discover the tree of life and become gods like us. It's a really chilling moment. Like us? Like us? See, I love that. Let's say become gods like us. Who are these multiple gods that the editor has forgotten to edit out of the text, revealing there for a moment of truth in what is actually going on here? Yes. You know, I think that when I read Christianity, the New Testament in particular, especially on a psychedelic, it's a beautiful religion. And I don't... Well, is it? I mean, it has this Redeemer theology, this Salvationist mythology. I mean, consider the notion. Consider what it actually means when we say that a figure called Christ died for our sins. But that came after the... Is he doing us any favors? But you're talking about Paulian theology. You're talking about everything after the Gospels. It really isn't splitting hairs because when you look at the Gospels themselves, and you particularly the book of John, which was... It starts with a beautiful... And I'm not a Christian either, by the way. It starts with a beautiful... In the beginning was the word. And this is gnosis. They say this was like a Gnostic scripture. Because Gnostics were at the heart of early Christianity, then the religion got hijacked. That's it. That's it. By the bureaucrats and the moneymen wearing the jackboot of the state of Rome. That's it. But I think you can still go back to the Gospels, and you can still... If you just stick with them, and stick with whoever, the writings of these people who claim to have encountered this being, or who have embodied this teaching in the form of a being, then it's hard for me to find stuff in there that could be translated into, and therefore, let's blow up people with bombs. But when you get into the other stuff, Paulian theology, when you get into the stuff that the people who are like, you know, the Christians who are, I think, burning down Gnostic churches, or resting the Gnostics, or... Burning the Gnostics at the stake. Yeah. When you get into that stuff. And torturing them, destroying their books, so that we actually only know about Gnosticism from the Nag Hammadi Library, which was deliberately buried 1500, 1600 years ago, and recovered in 1945. I mean, they were seeking to stamp out that faction of Christianity. And it's true that many of the Gnostics saw the figure of Christ as a great Gnostic teacher. If we're going to recognize what is of value in the established and existing Gospels, then we must read alongside them the Gnostic Gospels. We must go back to the Gnostic texts and read those as well. Because right now, when we read the Gospels of the New Testament, we are reading a highly edited text, which has been edited to serve the interests of a very narrow group. And in order to understand those documents in their full context, we need to sit down and also read the Gnostic documents, which now have survived as a result of the discovery at Nag Hammadi in 1945, and which are available to anybody to read, by the way. The Nag Hammadi Library, the Gnostic texts are available in good English translation and well worth having a go at. That's right. And if you're raised a Christian and you read the Gnostic texts, I remember when I first encountered some of them that I've read, your heart almost wants to break as you realize that you've been only given a tiny portion of this beautiful philosophy that's so psychedelic and so... So psychedelic. Yeah. Exactly. But let's also not forget that the God that is worshiped by Christians, Jews, and Muslims is fundamentally the God of Abraham. This is the God of the Old Testament. I mean, this is stated clearly in Christian theology as well. It's not like God suddenly becomes somebody else 2,000 years ago. Christianity is a direct continuation of Judaic tradition, albeit with many finesses and development. I like to think of it as a transmutation. I like to think of it as a transmutation, a very important difference. Yeah. But what about that entity? Does he suddenly transmute just because people decide to transmute? I don't know. I mean, the God of the Old Testament is a real old bugger. He's extremely... He's a shithead. Absolutely. He's awful. He's just persuading people to do the most terrible things, carry out massacres, to take over other people's lands, sacrifice 50,000 here. It's a dreadful thing. What's been done in the name of that entity down through the thousands of years is truly horrendous. I think that part of the waking up of the human race that's going on now is that we have to separate ourselves off from that entrainment in that cult of... I actually think it's a cult of insanity. We have to separate ourselves off from it and find a new form of spirituality that is relevant to our future. There's a difference between disbelieving in the God of Abraham and disbelieving in spirituality. It is possible to disbelieve in the God of Abraham and still be a profoundly spiritual being. I agree with you. This brings to mind someone that I met during this last podcast tour that I did, said something to me that I thought was very smart, which was, don't try to change your parents. Try to change your kids. Exactly. Exactly. It really is smart. If you look at it from the perspective of this loon... I call that God you're talking about, loon loon, a kind of psychotic, out of control, maniacal, power-hungry, homophobic doom thing. And if you want to take the Christian version, or the fundamentalist Christian version of it literally and think that Jesus was actually literally the child of this being, then that means that this Christ really does have the chance to be the Redeemer. In the same way that if you take it to a personal level, anyone whose father or mother was an alcoholic, angry, fucked up shithead, they have, through their physical existence, a chance to take that energy that was passed down through that dark force that possessed their parents and probably way before their parents, whether it's alcoholism, whatever it is that could be a genetic trait that gets passed down, you get this chance to redeem the pulsation of life that you represent that trails all the way back to the Garden of Eden or whatever happened way back when. And I think that's why Christianity, even though it would be easy to write it off based on its followers, the Phelps family and all the other freaks out there, it still presents a chance that this Abrahamic shit-god could be redeemed through his son. Well, this is an interesting question. Praise God, convert to Christianity, Graham Hancock, we don't want you to go to hell except Jesus is your savior, please. Actually, Duncan beautifully put, that was a passionate statement and really quite profound, I have to say. Let me just add a little point to that. The notion of the Redeemer, the notion that somebody else dies for our sins is profoundly un-liberating in my view because it is alienating us from responsibility for our own choices. It's like, the cliche is the Catholic who carries out all kinds of horrendous acts of wickedness and then goes into confession, confesses to the priest and somehow is absolved from all of that. This twisted, tortured figure on the cross who died for our sins, that may have had a role to play at some place in history, but I think if we're going to move forward as a species, if we're going to move forward and create a better world, we have to realize that we're each responsible ourselves for our choices. We cannot devolve that responsibility on some supernatural being. Well, I think we are the Christ on the cross of time and that we are a matter that's been crucified in this terrible nexus between infinity and the temporal timeline we're trapped in. I love it. Duncan, you're turning into a poet. This is beautiful. Yay! Say more. Say more. You know, it's so funny that I find myself, I'm not a Christian and it's really funny to hear myself defending it, but I think we probably actually see things in a very similar way. I suspect so. Listen, there's a lot of good stuff in all of those religions. Our predicament now as human beings is to choose the good and reject the bad and not be lured into the illusions that they create, particularly the illusion that anybody has a monopoly on the truth, which is at the heart of the notion that if somebody disagrees with our religious views, then we have a right to kill them. That's the wicked idea that is prevailing in the world since the Crusades, since before the Crusades. And you've embodied these ideas in your book, War God. Yeah. I mean, War God for me, I'm best known as a writer of nonfiction and indeed I'm working on a sequel to my best known nonfiction book to Fingerprints of the Gods. I'm working on a sequel that will be published in 2015. That's great news. But in the meantime, I have also been writing novels and I've written a series of novels called War God. The first one was War God Knights of the Witch that was published in 2013. And the second one, War God Return of the Plumed Serpent, is published on the 9th of October this year. And these novels are about a dramatic moment in human history. And I really felt that the only way I could write about this truly and properly was to do so in the form of a novel rather than in the form of a detailed, footnoted, nonfiction book. And that is the Spanish conquest of Mexico. And at the heart of it, these novels are adventure stories. They're full of battles and courage and the choices that people have to make in extreme circumstances. But at the heart of these books is the notion that spiritual forces are at work behind history and that demonic forces have chosen certain moments in history to mislead humanity and to take us off the path of light and put us onto the path of darkness. And that's why the War God of the Aztecs, whose name Witzel O'Poshley means hummingbird at the left hand of the sun, while I was very interested to discover that he manifested to Moctezuma, the emperor of the Aztecs, during Silo Saibin trances, Moctezuma would eat Silo Saibin and then he would encounter this entity who would speak to him and whisper in his ear and tell him to go cut out more human hearts and sacrifice more thousands of victims upon the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan. Then I was intrigued to discover that Hernán Cortés, the conquistador who turned up in Mexico with 16 cavalry, 490 men and 100 dogs of war, armoured in steel and trained to relish human flesh, that Hernán Cortés had visionary encounters with an entity that he believed was Saint Peter and Saint Peter constantly drove him on to ever more heinous acts of wickedness and violence and cruelty. And then really the heart of the novel is this, that the same entity that takes the disguise of hummingbird to mislead Moctezuma takes the disguise of Saint Peter to mislead Cortés and drives these two men into acts of dreadful madness and plunges the whole of Central America into a catastrophe which resulted in fact in the deaths of 29 million people within a period of just 30 years, 29 million people were killed as a result of the Spanish conquest of Mexico and it set the stage for many of the horrors that were to emerge later in the world, the whole attitude of the European powers to Native American Indians, to Native Americans who were called Indians because the European powers initially stupidly believed that when they discovered the new world they discovered a new route to India, that the whole, pretty soon they realized they hadn't done that, they'd come to a new world and the whole attitude to Native Americans that they could simply be brushed aside, stamped out, exterminated, the destruction of the Native American cultures of North America, the Spanish conquest of Peru which followed soon after the Spanish conquest of Mexico, the whole episode of colonialism, of slavery, all of that I believe we would have had a different story, a very different story if the Spanish conquest of Mexico had not gone the way it did, if against all the odds Hernán Cortés with his 490 men and his 16 cavalry and his 100 dogs of war had not crushed the Aztec power and imposed his model upon the new world, how much better it would have been if those two cultures could have met in a spirit of love. That is mind blowing. What would that world be like? I've never thought of that. What a different world. So much that the Native American peoples had to teach the peoples of Europe, so much wisdom, so much knowledge, so much understanding of the natural realm, so much beauty in Native American cultures and so much that the peoples of the old world brought as well. If they come together in the spirit of mutual tolerance and love, we would be living in a completely different world today. In fact, if Moctezuma and the Aztecs had treated their neighbouring peoples decently, if they hadn't marched them up the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlban and cut out their hearts by the tens of thousands, Cortés would never have won anyway because the reason that he was able to win those battles against the Aztecs was that many other Native American tribes, notably the Clascalans, joined forces with him to overthrow Moctezuma because Moctezuma was the big, big bully of the region. So I'm hoping that little by little, I'm identified as a nonfiction author. I'm continuing to write nonfiction, but I'm hoping that little by little, people will give my fiction a chance. Take a look at the novels I'm writing. I've got, if people go to my website, which is www.grayamhancock.com, and go to the clearly marked War God page, there are chapters to read free online from volume one, and there's a couple of chapters to read free online from volume two, which is in fact published tomorrow. Congratulations. Thank you. And what I'm saying, and if they scroll, if you scroll down that page, you'll see a video trailer runs for about a minute, 30 seconds. And I'm also making a special offer at the bottom of that page. I made it first on Joe Rogan's show a few weeks ago, and I'd like to extend it here on your show, which is that if people will buy, I'm going to give you a link to that. People will buy either volume one or volume two or both and write to me at the email address that I give there. I will send them at my own expense, a signed dedicated book plate or several book plates to place inside their books. And this also applies even if they buy the Kindle edition, but this offer is only open until the 17th of October. So to be clear, a book plate is a label, which is designed to go inside the book. The book itself or the books themselves will come direct from Amazon in the usual way. And all the links are up there on my website. But what I will do when I return from my travels, which will be in November, because I'm on the road until the beginning of November, is I will sit down during November and I will send out at my own expense, signed dedicated book plates to place inside those books that you've bought from Amazon. And the only one other thing I need to say, because I made this offer last year with volume one, and I actually did correspond individually with everybody who wrote to me, I can't do that again this year, because I have a huge book to write. And before the end of November, I have to be sitting down and just writing nonstop 16 hours a day. And I hope people will understand I can't correspond individually, but I will show me proof of purchase, send me above all else your postal address when you email me at the address given on the war god page on my website. And I will at my own expense site personally sign and dedicate the book plates, put them in an envelope and send them to you by email, you know, you're never going to you're never going to finish the new fingerprints of the gods. If you do this, you're going to be writing this until 2019. You're going to be sending book plates. I want a book plate as soon as we get off the finish recording, I'm ordering a book plate. I'd be pleasantly surprised if the response were that great. I found that by my readers, many of whom are, you know, good, great supporters of my work and huge help to me, they somehow somehow don't want to read me as a novelist. That's why I've put free changes online up on that page. I'm not asking you to buy the book blind. You can look and see the kind of stuff writing and see whether it's for you or not. Guys, read everything that Graham Hancock writes. Please, you can see that he is a genius into you can't truth is in everything, including fiction. That's ridiculous that people are more inclined to read your nonfiction. That must be incredibly frustrating. It's been a real problem. The publishing industry doesn't want me to publish fiction. It only wants me to publish nonfiction because the publishing industry has, you know, really deteriorated so radically in the last 10 years. I remember a time when I used to publish in the early 1990s when editors actually had courage and would back, you know, would back an unusual idea because they had a gut feeling that it could work. Now editors have no courage and no power at all. Everything's in the hands of the marketing department and the salesman and they think in terms of brands, you know, and I am branded as a nonfiction author, but I refuse to be confined within those narrow narrow limits. There are some ideas that are so extraordinary that they can only be really fully explored in fiction where you can get inside the heads of the characters who you're writing about. And I actually love writing fiction. I have a ball when I'm writing fiction. I really enjoy it and I've learned more about history by writing historical fiction than I ever learned from studying it in a standoff nonfiction kind of way because for the first time I'm forced to imaginatively inhabit the heads of those characters and to see why they did what they did.

Hello my dear, sweet, beautiful friends. It is I, Dee Trussell. Dee Trussell. And you were listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And friends, I feel like I've got to put a special warning on this episode. If you feel that you may be possessed by demons, if you have the slightest apprehension that there could be residing in some part of your metaphysical makeup, a trembling, quivering, shrieking, hissing, skittering, spitting, biting, lizard-like entity, then watch out. Because this episode that you're about to listen to could very easily make that thing go scurrying out of your body, desperately trying to escape from this sweet, beautiful, luminous light that emanates from today's two esteemed guests, Alex and Allison Gray. So before you listen to this, if you've got any demons in your body or if anyone in your family is possessed by the demons of resistance, by the demons that make a person feel like they don't deserve to make art, if you've got wrapped around your brain, some dark reptilian serpent-like entity that whispers over and over again into your ear that you shouldn't even bother starting some project, that you shouldn't even allow yourself the slightest inkling that you could be a great artist, that you could have within you the seeds of some beautiful forest of joy that you can grow into the time-space continuum through your creative output if you have a muttering, inhibiting serpent like that, a stifling beast, a nullifying force within you that is trying to damn your creative outflow, then I present to you a step-by-step guide to constructing a demon-catching box that you can set up in the room that you'll be listening to this podcast in. And what this is going to do for you is when the demon of creative blockage comes scurrying out of your nose or your mouth or your ears or your asshole and tries to escape into some corner of your house to wait until you're at some weak moment where it can clamber back into one of your orifices, this is going to lure the demon into a special kind of demon trap and ensure that never again will you have to deal with the embarrassing condition of being possessed by a demon. So following is a step-by-step guide for making your own demon trap. How to build a demon trap in 10 steps. Step one, have your toad make love to your chicken. This is perhaps the most difficult step as it requires good luck and patience and most importantly a charismatic toad. Consider arranging a movie night for the two. Step two, your chicken will lay a ruby red egg that should glow in the light of the full moon. Take this egg to the Marianas Islands and present it to Periki, the chief of the Chamor people. He will thank you and take you on his boat to the Marianas Trench. Swim down to the deepest part of the Marianas Trench and gather six pieces from the broken obsidian obelisk you will find there. Step four, by the time you return the egg will have hatched and a basilisk will be running amok on Periki's ship. Do not look the basilisk in the eyes or you will immediately be struck dead by God. Pluck a feather from the basilisk's tail. Step five, fly home and spend the next three days drinking scotch and listening to Elliot Smith. Step six, extract your earwax and use this as adhesive to assemble a cube using the obelisk pieces. Step seven, find some parchment. It should be soft on both sides highly absorbent and strong. Use the basilisk feather to write your dreams upon this parchment. Don't hold back and writing down your dreams. Say everything no matter how ridiculous your dreams may seem. Step eight, carve a round hole in the obsidian cube. The hole should be about the size of the Dalai Lama's thumb. Put your dream parchment in the hole. Step nine, listen to the following podcast. It will drive a tiny shrieking demon out of one of your orifices and this demon will go galloping into the obsidian box to wipe its ass on the parchment covered with your dreams. The demon will be eternally trapped in a stasis field. Step ten, fly to Cuba and bury the box in a few days a cigar should grow there. Smoke this Cuban cigar. You've earned it. You're free from demons forever. As simple as that sweet friends, get that demon out of your old waxy old soul hole, baby. It's time to be free. We're going to jump into this podcast with Alex and Allison Gray, but first some quick B's now. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the sweeties over at thetracker.com. That's T-H-E-T-R-A-C-K-R.com. Friends, you know as well as I do that it's damn easy to lose everything in this dimension. Here we are being aerosolized by time. We are dealing with the cruel forces of gravity and let's face it, you don't remember 80% of the shit that happens to you. And if you do remember it, it's some murky blurry memory like staring through thick swamp water with no goggles on. Half the time we're in a synambulic sleepwalking zombie-like trance muddling through our lives and leaving shit scattered around us in random places because we're half asleep. This is why we lose our keys. This is why we lose our backpack. This is why we lose everything. Also, we're stoned all the time. At least if you're me, we are. And so I present to you the tracker. This is an amazing thing. It's a tracking device. It's a bluetooth tracking device. You place it on whatever you tend to lose. Keys, wallets, you can put it on your pet. It's small enough to fit anywhere. When you misplace an item that has a track R pixel attached, use your smartphone and a 90 decibel alert will help you find it in seconds. It even has powerful LED lights so you can find anything even in the dark. Did you lose your phone? Just press the button on your tracker pixel and your phone rings even if it's on silent. You can even locate your item if it's miles away because every track R user is part of the largest crowd locate network in the world. It's like ways for finding things and tracker's 30 day money back guarantee means you have nothing to lose. Go to thetrackr.com slash Duncan to get 20% off any order. That's the trackr.com slash Duncan for 20% off thetrackr.com slash Duncan. I've tried this thing out. It's awesome. And there really is a wonderful sense of security that happens when you know you've attached one of these sweet little James Bond style bits of tech to something that you lose all the time. It's super cool. Look, maybe you're not like me. Maybe you have some fully functioning, actualized, woken up brain, but I don't. I lose shit all the time. I put my phone in the refrigerator sometimes and it's really nice to know that all I have to do is press this little button on this awesome cube that I have attached to my backpack and it makes my phone ring. And I know I can't lose my backpack and also it has this crowd locating thing. So if you accidentally leave something somewhere far away, you might be able to find it. Give it a shot. It's super cool. Relieve yourself with the burden of having to remember where you put shit down. What a nightmare. Babies, sweet, beautiful babies.

I don't know how many of you are into the occult. I don't know how many of you have the desire to use technology to make contact with higher dimensional aliens through chaos and sound. But if you're some combination of the things I just mentioned, you must get into modular synthesizers and start with a make noise morphogen. These things are crazy. You can't just buy it though. You've also got to buy a make noise skiff, which is the thing you hook the modular synth into. Listen, I'm not, I'm not, this isn't an ad in the sense that I don't work with them, but my God, I've never encountered a more spooky piece of technology than the make noise morphogen. Go to Amazon.com, check it out. Look it up on YouTube. This thing is this incredible sampler. It's just this chirpy weird living thing. It's amazing.

We also have a shop at DuncanTrestle.com with posters, t-shirts, stickers, and a great many other things. Okay friends, that's enough of me yapping. Let's get this show on the road. I took a little mini pilgrimage to visit Alex and Allison at their beautiful place called Cosm. I am not exaggerating or flattering when I say this is a sacred magical place. I've been to a few of them. I've been to Varanasi in India. I've been to Vrindavan and I've been to Cosm. This is a humming celebration of art and it's just an amazing place. They have classes. There's a community there. Just go there. If you're in upstate New York, if you're coming through the area, they've got a guest house. You can book rooms there and just spend a day or two or a week or ever long you want to in the presence of a thriving artistic community. An art church. It's a church dedicated to art. I guess that's how you'd put it. It's amazing and also they happen to be building an incredible temple called Entheon and it really is. It's, I don't know, it's just one of the coolest things I've ever encountered. It's an inspiring, beautiful place and just my brief visit there really did knock out some of the creative blocks that I've been experiencing a little bit and inspired me to really dive deeper into the podcast and into being creative. They're beautiful people and they have spawned a vibrant, life-affirming, empowering community and of course they're two of the most amazing visionary artists walking on this planet today. So anytime I get to spend even the slightest amount of time with them, it is what I consider to be a really great privilege and I feel like the luckiest person on earth that I get to hang out with them at all and so I'm very excited to present to you this conversation with Alex and Allison Gray. Welcome upon you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be blue, welcome to you. It's the talking chasel, chasel, chasel, chasel, chasel, chasel. Box, are you talking to your mic? Hello, hello. Yes, we're here, we're rolling. Alex and Allison, the gods tried to keep our live podcast off the airwaves back here at Cosm. Thank you so much for giving me a second chance to record a conversation with you. Such an honor. Yeah, we're looking forward to revisiting some of those topics and to invent some new ones. I've got the first one I would love to ask you about. We were all hanging out last night and you said that the imagination is magical, it's the source of magic. Did I mishear you? No, because neuroscientists, the best neuroscientists would agree that everything that we experience is a figment of our imagination, which begs the question, what the hell is the imagination? Yes. And that gets to the central problem of existence. And if everything that we're experiencing is through the lens of the imagination, it's very difficult to get true perspective on that lens, consciousness itself. It's like the fountain head, the dotted. Exactly. That's invisible because we're the fish swimming in it like an ocean. And the ocean of life, the ocean of love that we're surrounded by, we're not present to. Unless we kind of relax our identity with our particular little cellular glob and start to see ourselves as more like a brook, a section in a brook of a flow that's going through through everything. And that being a node in a network of a flow is more like what we really are. What about the nodes who feel like the part of the brook that they're in is polluted and rotten? What about those nodes? Or what about the nodes that feel completely alone in their brook? I mean, I hear what you're saying and I think, yes, I'm here at Cosm looking around undeniably, we're in some kind of magical brook, some kind of outflow from source. But what do you guys have to say to people who haven't built an art church around them, an art community? What are they to do? You're talking about feeling. And feeling is the responsibility of every individual. So people have to vision the life that they want to live. They have to live into a future that they love. So if you envision green and quiet around you, or if you envision skyscrapers and cars around you, and then live into it and love it, it doesn't matter. It's your feelings. You decide how you feel. But you have to have a future that you want to live into. And in order to do that, you have to have imagination. But this is the thing, Alex and Allison Gray, amazing artists, focused human beings, focused for a long time, and organized. You have literally organized this life around you. But so many of us feel fuzzy to put it lightly. There isn't some compelling wind in our sails. We must create art. We must outflow this beauty into the world. And it can often feel a little disconcerting to hear people say, just envision your life, and we don't have a thing to envision. People are afraid to really look at what they really want, and they're afraid to say what they really want. If you would articulate, anyone would articulate the life that they would love, put it on paper, do some writing, make it your creative life to envision the life you love. I'm saying sometimes we get so drearily depressed. Or sometimes you're just, you know, I don't know, you're in your, some folks are in their 20s. They don't, they envisioning anything. Oh, you know, like we were talking last night about, we're walking up, gosh, you guys, I wish you were here, I wish I could bring you all here to see this beautiful place. We're walking through the woods, and we're talking about tattoos. In the dark, in the dark, we're talking tattoos in the dark. But I was, so I was asking you two, do you have any tattoos? And I was like, no. And Allison said, do you have a tattoo? And I, I don't. And the reason being, anything I put on my body, I know I'm going to get bored of. I know it's going to be more of a reminder of a kind of semi manic episode I must have been in, when I decided to get Ganesh's mouse tattooed on my arm. But the, on your ass. Or both. Yeah, both. But what I'm saying is, in the same way, sometimes when we consider a life vision, oh God, okay, I'm going to picture it. The beautiful, the beautiful house, the, the freedom, the whatever it may be, some other part of the mind kicks. And it's like, no way, you don't even want that. What's there to be wanted? You don't really want anything. But you know what you want. You see, what you do is, you listen to the call, you know, you get attracted to certain things. And if you don't make yourself wrong about it, if you don't say, oh, I shouldn't want that, you eliminate the shouldn't, and you just allow yourself to want what you want. At least, at least think it through, you know what I mean? I think that a lot of people deny themselves for some one reason or another. It's not supposed, you're not supposed to, you know, have that or one. Okay, for example, I have a strong intuition that I will never live in a house with a water slide going down from my bedroom down into my atrium where my pool is. But let me just say this, I, I thought there was a time there was definitely a long period of time when I thought I would not want to leave the city. This is a big decision, you know, we've lived in the city, we still have a place in the city, thank God. But because I love the city, I lived in two big cities and I love the city. So I thought I could never live in the country like my parents always wanted to, right? And then it became like a really, really good idea. So basically, you just listen to the call, you like have this inner voice that tells you it's time. Now it's time not to give up the place in the city because you know you love the city, but also to, and really truly, it's a thread through our life because I've always wanted a place, not all full time living in the city, like in the country like we do now. But that's because our work is here. If our work wasn't here, I would not be here, okay? I'm not into like, oh, take a little vacation every weekend. That is does not appear to me unless my work is there. So if I had a little vacation place, I would have a place to make art because that's what I want to do all the time. And Alex always felt like, oh, it's, it's a waste of time to drive back and forth. Well, our business is here, our life is here, and we have something that we love. But don't get mistaken that everything is the way we envision it because we envision things that we haven't accomplished yet. But right, I'm sure it's not some, it's not as though you just in your mind imagine something and it forms around you, it's conforming to your sort of, I mean, it does. You start visioning something enough and it will occur. We have this theory about it and we're experimenting on it. I'll just tell you, we have been visioning the steeple head of Entheon for many years. And Alex drew it, and then Ryan Toddler, our wonderful ZBrush artist sculpted it. Who works at Disney. Who works at Disney and won an Oscar. Okay, so he's, I'm sorry, very quickly. Ryan Toddler sculpted Alex's drawing. Very quickly. Would you mind before we get into that? Just letting people know what Entheon is. So they understand what this is. You're right. Entheon is a temple of sanctuary, the sanctuary of visionary art that we're building at Cosm. So we're in the process of building and it's a sanctuary. So it has a steeple and it's a sculpted building. Alex and Ryan worked for a couple of years to create three-dimensional sculptures that are going to wrap the building. But the first sculpture that's going to go on the building is the steeple head. And we have been creating little, we call them bots. They're little MakerBot sculptures of the steeple head and we paint them and we sell them to raise awareness of our of our project. Entheon, they're basically, you know, worthless little sculptures that people can put on their altar and they make a little investment. It helps us, you know, and they put it on their altar and they help us vision it into being. We call it visioning it into being. So we keep visioning it with this steeple head. Now guess what? The steeple head is here. I mean, the steeple had arrived from the playa where it first was exhibited after it came off the boat from Thailand. We brought it to the playa and then we brought it here. So it's been here now for a couple weeks. It's aluminum, cast aluminum, light enough to sit on top of our roof, which is nice. It's still weighs, you know, somewhere under a thousand pounds. But anyway, it is a in its hand painted. It's beautiful and it's here. Now that was years. But let me say this. In 1985, Alex and I sculpted the frames for the sacred mirrors for this temple. Okay. We had the vision of the temple in 1985 and immediately set to work building these 10 and a half foot frames. Okay. So let's talk about this, this inspiration or vision to build a thing. Because a lot of us, there's two pieces to the problem that I can think of here. One, we need a vision so that we can envision something into existence. Two, we need the courage to believe that that thing that we want to create is not an indication of the beginning of some spiral into madness. Because you two, these amazing, you are, you're an artist. So it pops into your head, you know, I think it's time to start building a temple. But me and many of us, when that pops into our head and we're telling our friend, yeah, you know, I just, I think I'm going to start building a temple. And I want to start working on the steeple head. Our friend is going to be like, no, no, because you started a podcast, which has started a revolution and people listen to you. You know, I know that your numbers have grown logarithmically through the last few years, Duncan. Everybody is very impressed when they know that we know Duncan Trussell. They are very impressed. Seriously. So you have grown this in that same way. It's different, but it's the same. Way different. Because anyone, now, if I go to anyone, that's because it's natural to you. We haven't started a podcast and you keep wondering why. Well, we go to our friends and say, Hey, I'm going to start a podcast. And the worst thing our friends are thinking is, please don't ask me to be on your podcast. That's all. But if you go, what I'm, what I'm trying to get at. Really? We love to be on your podcast and everybody's. No, I, what I'm, the thing I'm trying to get at is, okay, Moses gets a command from God. Go free my people from Egypt. Noah gets a, God's like a floods coming. Build a giant boat. The most insane requests. So what I am saying is, and maybe the vision that we get is not something so spectacular, but equally potentially disastrous, which is quit your job. You're not supposed to be in this job. You're not supposed to be in this life situation. And it's time for you to leave it. How do we summon the courage and how do we summon the ability to discern the, to discern whether this is a true intuition or some kind of egoic fabrication? And if it is a true intuition, how do you have the guts to jump off that diving board? Don't go to stupidville. That's what our teacher, Mickey Singer says. Don't go to stupidville. You don't have a job. You don't want to leave your job and go hungry. No. Right. You know, you have to be wise. You, you have to do it in steps and you have to do it in stages and you have to have confidence. I think that's the thread that goes from conception to, to, you know, completion. Yeah. I think Jesus said something like be innocent as doves and, and clever as serpents. Wow. And so in order to stealthfully live awake while in polite society, you have to understand the conventions of society and not bend them to breaking point in order to unleash your weirdness in, you know, the, in the place that not the right place. So you have to find the conversations and the community that is tapped into the same wavelength that you're tapped into. I'm glad you said that because this is another problem that folks face out there. So it's, so I understand what you're saying in the marketplace is the Ram Dass folks call the world where you have to work the marketplace in the marketplace. You get randomly born into some spot or you end up in some spot. You're an 18 year old kid, 22 year old kid living in some rural part of Alabama. And you hear Alex Gray and Alison Gray say, Oh, find a community. And you're thinking, well, I don't, the only community who might, what am I going to join? You know, there's no community here for me. Right. I'm not interested in being in any kind of like church, Southern fundamentalist Christian church group. This is the, the most, the closest I get to this kind of hearing about communities is listening to folks like you, you two talking about it. So how do you balance? Well, here's one of, I think one of the ways that's just naturally evolved has been festival culture. Those nodes. And you can imagine them as like, they're, they're a great mother load kind of festival that aren't really festivals like Burning Man. Burning Man is kind of like the ultimate festival become a community of many festivals and many, it's called not a, not a festival because it you, you once you get there, you put away your wallet, there's nothing to buy, right? So there's no like tribal market or, or anything like that. It's really like a, like a monumental art fair is what I think. Exactly. And you express yourself and you come and share your, your self and it's a gift economy. It's a reconception of everything. And this is what I'm meaning is that these are deprogramming stations for religious excess. That, that many people wander into or a festival or something like that. And somebody hands them a mushroom or something. And then they start thinking like, Oh my goodness, I never read about this in any Bible or anything. Like, I mean, what's this about? I actually now I know what they're talking about when they say God, but yet I don't read anything about sacraments in the Bible, or maybe that Garden of Eden story is about something like this. What is this? And so then you look under the psychedelic rock and oh my God, you've got an entire prehistoric and then the great civilizations were founded on psychedelics all through America. That was the old time religion. So if you, you know, kind of go back before Christianity wiped out the Eleusinian mysteries, then you've got still a psychedelic Western culture. And you've, and you, and so what you're saying is you go to one of these deprogramming stations, you have the revelation that there is an entire other thing going down that you didn't even know about. You must be kidding me. There's a secret religion on earth. There, there couldn't be. I thought I knew all the religions, but this one's not really named and this one's decentralized and yet it's vibrant. It does feel ancient yet completely novel, brand new. And so you go back to your town having gotten that download and then what, what I'm saying is if the idea is we have to be, don't go to stupidville, well, what if we're living in stupidville? Well, you know, you, you may want to look, you may want to live in stupidville and, and, and a lot, most people do, but if you, but if you want to live in a life you love, you know, start bouncing it off of your favorite people is all I can say. Other people sometimes have insight about your life that you haven't even been willing to listen to yet. So, you know, be coachable. You know, let, let somebody tell you probably, you know, I don't know, people who you care about and trust. I mean, you know, it's good to go to them for, for, you know, kind of a, a reality check sometimes when you want to jump off the edge. But you do hear about people who have an epiphany and they want to do something big. Because, because as Alex has heard in his inner voice, humanity hungers for a righteous task. So people have these like righteous task epiphanies, you know, they just, it comes to them that they should do something or nothing. For Alex and I, our feeling was the greatest contribution that we could make together as two artists committed to our art would be to create a sacred offering, a sacred offering of our work and event and ultimately a sacred space, like the Sistine Chapel or Shark Cathedral. Yeah, are some of the greatest works of art on earth that we think of because they are channeling and they're wombs for the gestation of the awakening human spirit. These are voices that Alex has, you know, the awakening, the gestation of the awakening human spirit. It's like, these are, that's what a temple is. It's a womb. So anyway, it's a container. So when, then we started to think as artists, we could create the container. And so that's what we have felt is, is our underlying most important thing we could do. So everything kind of funnels towards that. And yet we make our individual paintings about every subject that we want to make them about, you know, anything that's interesting and calls us. But you have to listen to what's calling you. And then the voices that tell you you shouldn't or you wouldn't, like say you say, I would love to be a musician, but I could never do it. Right. Well, then, you know, just start doing it. Don't give up your day job. Right. Just start doing it. And the more you do it, and the more seriously you take doing it, the more you'll get out of it, and the more you'll get known for it, and the more people will understand that that's who you really are. Right. And not, you know, the assistant manager at Best Buy, but that you really are a great drummer. I mean, identify with the thing that you want to be identified with, which usually is something creative. Yes. And this is what this is one thing that I really love about this place is that though it is a community that seems to be built around an idea that comes from God about building a temple, which just saying that feels wild. But it's not some kind of like, it's not like a loosely run ship here. There is a real pragmatic, structured ethic of hard work here is what I picked up when we walked around last night is people are deeply invested in developing their artistic ability here. And it seems like everyone is no one's you don't get the feeling anyone's lazing around. No. So there's what I like about it is there's a there's an active role that artists always take. And this is one of the great reasons that creativity and spirituality can find ways of reinforcing each other. Like we've been looking at in kind of just as an educational orientation, the idea of the three levels of, you know, spirit, mind and body. Yeah. And so as a as a school and an art approach, Jean Delville used to talk about three levels of beauty. And so first in the spiritual, you've got transcendental beauty. So the highest aspiration of truth, goodness, and, and reality, you know, the chewiest bit of God, visionary, mystical experience that you can muster in your divine imagination. You're when you melt down into the one and become part of the infinite and are able to have a visual and being experience from that dimension, understand your oneness with this infinite flow. Then there are categories of that mystical experience. And you can look at that in fine detail. That's transcendental beauty. Then you go to looking at the classic ways throughout history that the sacred art traditions have looked at that experience, have looked at God contact, have looked at a spiritual or mystical state. Yeah. And so you see the lens of art history and you look at the archetypal forms that come up in our sacred geometric visionary states, the sacred geometry as it's evolved through the different world cultures, the Islamic kind of pattern making and the different pattern making of different cultures. So you see those kind of archetypal beauty and pattern language. So you, you have the highest conception from the highest dimension of spirituality, you clothe it in the most archetypally beautiful forms. And then with your craftsmanship, you bring it it to the body around to the manifestation with the physical beauty, which is to make the most physically beautiful object you're capable of as an artist. Now, that's a connection with beauty on the highest level through the entire history of art that you can integrate to a practice where you have to keep your attention in the now by drawing a line on a paper. So that direct one pointedness gives an advantage because you see, am I remembering my mantra? Are you drawing the damn line? Yeah. Can you get from point A to point B? Can you overlap those compass circles? So now you're drawing the the flower of life. And that is connected with an infinite grid. So you can imagine all of the hidden dimensions that are part of the nature web. That's another part of what you'd study in the archetypal beauties, you'd see how God does it. What is the Fibonacci sequence? Right. You know, why does the golden ratio always show up? Right. Oh, you have to speak into your mic. Okay, well, an old art professor in the only time I really had a serious conversation with Lowell Tolstead, he wound up being a director at the Columbus College of Art and Design. But as we were going through an art exhibit, he said, Alex, you know, there's a lot of people who come to art school, and they're really skilled already, and they become even greater skilled craftspeople, but they don't have anything to say. Wow. Really. And so you see all the skill, but you just, you know, nothing. And then there are people who come with the most, you know, amazing imagination and stories to tell and just like, but pitiful, terrible output, you know, it's just like it gets in the way of them telling and sharing their story. So by merging those qualities of having a great skill and a great story to tell, it's those are combining the two. Well, how do you combine the two? Powerful forces. If you, Alex is the perfect example of combining the two. You have to aspire to hold them in your mind. But I can't. But also you study, you are a scholar. You read. You have always been building a philosophical core that started when you were in high school, you know, reading Gojif and, you know, and Auspensky and this, and then onward through all Hegel and Schopenhauer and all of the Sufi mystics, you know, and Ibn Arabi and, you know, and Ken Wilbur being like, you know, so you've been studying, studying Buddhism and Hinduism as well, and studying all through your life. But let me ask you to do something based on what you're saying on behalf of this person who I can feel out there. Let me just ask you to this question now. Listen, I have such a story I want to tell. It's eating me alive. I want to get it out there, but I can't draw. I can't paint. I'm not a good singer. I don't feel artistically talented. I'm too old. I'm telling you, there's no way that I'm going to be able to do this. I don't have the talent. What can I do? You don't have the confidence. You don't have the confidence because, you know, the thing is, you know, you have, if you really feel passionately that this message has to be delivered, you can deliver it in any creative way that you feel is you can be a writer, you can be a public speaker, you can be like a storyteller kind of thing. You can be an artist, but it's the same as any practice. If you're going to play music so it's convincing and makes people cry, you have to practice. You have to practice every day for many years. And that's the second part of what I was just about to say about Alex is that he also practices every day and has for every year of his life. His first drawing that'll be in the exhibit at Entheon was accomplished when he was five years old. That will be an image of a skeleton that he did at five. So what I'm saying is he's been practicing and he's been learning. I also, I practice painting every day. It's my meditation. Now we're too old. I haven't, when I was five, I wasn't a young Alex Gray drawing what I imagined was a great skeleton. I was smearing crayon. I was probably, you know what I was doing? I was probably shoving crayons in my butt. That's as close as I was getting to do any kind of like art when I was a kid. What I'm saying is like. You should try that today and you would be on YouTube. Here's the technique of Duncan Trussell. Yes. His purple, Duncan's purple crayon. I can't wait. He drew a doorway. Let's go see. No, don't do this. Do not try this at home. Well, but so what I'm saying is. So you're saying you're not going to be an artist, but look at what you are, Duncan. I'm not talking. Again, you are a mouthpiece of incredible power. No, I'm not talking and I'm not talking about me. I mean, I do feel like my podcast. He's talking for the common man out there. The man living in the fucking trailer park is listening to this broadcast. I'm talking about anybody out there because I just, I do speak not for them. It is a, I mean, I'm lucky. I stumbled upon this podcast and now I get to have something that reminds me of what you're talking about, but I'm talking about pre-podcast. I would get so frustrated whenever you hear about these damn prodigies who are drawing their beautiful skeletons when they're five and you're like, yeah, you motherfuckers. Like we, it's too, I want this. I want this. And yet I feel too old. I feel not talented enough. I feel too much. You're telling yourself the wrong messages, my friend. You just have to give it up, you know, start changing the affirmation, say, change it to an affirmation. I mean, that's, that's what everyone needs to look. I don't think there's anybody out there that doesn't secretly an inside feel that there's a creative person that is either fulfilling itself or is not fulfilled. Right. There's a creative person in there. They can evaluate, I'm not doing what I should be doing, but I know that I was a good dancer when I was little or whatever, but I'm not doing it. Well, then you live a life of feeling like you're not fulfilling your creative flow. And that is a health factor. And I just like, I would not tell you, Oh, I don't feel like exercising. I don't like to go for a walk. I just like to sit on my ass. And okay, so we feel that way sometimes, but is that okay? No. So you have to get up and exercise creativity is the same fucking way. Got it. It is the same way it you, you have to force yourself. Right. You know, like you think you're an artist, but you're not being an artist. I will tell you, there's so many people that come to us who say that, that they were an artist at one time, they gave it up. They even went all through art school and they gave it up. They need to come home to their identity, their own identity of being an artist. And if they don't, woe be to them. I say, I say it is to your own peril that you ignore your creative call. Scary. Well, because it's a flow. Okay. Think of what it is. It's the energy flow is now blocked and every time you see somebody else's art, you think, I should be doing that or I should be doing that. I should be doing that. I should be doing that. It's just like an engine that's like chugging along until you make yourself ill over it. Don't let that happen. Okay. You do not have to be Lance Armstrong to enjoy riding a bike. Right. So get out there and make some art. And this is why we have, once a month, we have art church, which is basically come back to your core, who is your identity and make some art with us. We'll do it together. We'll hold hands. It's not so hard. You haven't made art since you were in kindergarten, but now you can. It's okay. Nobody cares. It's just, it's an inner visioning. We go inside, we vision, we try to see, how do you have an image? How do you even get one? And then how do you turn that image into marks and strokes? And should I use a number two B pencil? Or should I use a red cadmium? You know, whatever it is, you have to make those sort of rational decisions out of these kind of completely imaginary and intuitive ideas. So you're turning things from the, from the intuitive mind into the rational. It's an incredible process. And we all do it whenever we're creating, you know, we look at our soil and we say, what does it need to grow better tomatoes? You know, you start reading up on it and you get better tomatoes. Those kinds of things, you see the smile came to your face when I said that. Because you know how fulfilling that is, how that makes you feel good, even gardening or growing, or you put some amazingly beautiful food. Everybody's posts their food all the time. This is their creativity and they're fulfilling their creativity when they do that. Yes. I think that the, never has it been easier for those of us who might say that we're not an artist or not that creative or something. Never has it been easier for us to use the tools and social media to start to share our lives anyway, because we can all take pictures of whatever's going on around us and share them. No excuse. And it's, you know, it's possible. And it's, I think that the way that we think about it is that your life is your greatest creation. It's your greatest work of art. And you're the author, if nothing else, of the story of your life. The way that you at least will tell what's going on. And so if you're responsible for being the author of the story of your life, how are you going to craft the narrative? Are you going to be the victim? Or are you going to be cause in the matter? And so the more cause, are you going to, are you going to be responsible for what's going on? Gotcha. Or are you going to try to voice that off on somebody else made me do it? Or I'm living my life in response to the, to some other asshole or something like that. I don't want to define myself that way. I want to find out from the highest level of beauty what the divine thinks I ought to be doing. And test that before you just like go off and do it. You ask again. You say, are you sure you want me to such and so? Give me a sign here, you know, and wait for it. And listen and pray and meditate and really like ask the divine. Ask your imagination. If you don't believe in the divine, ask whatever love and the highest possibility for you in your life is. Ask that potential what it wants of you. Can you remember your mission? Can you have an amnesis? Can you forget forgetting and, and remember who you really are and then reorient yourself, orient yourself to the vertical, to the true and to the good and to the beautiful. Yeah. If you can reorient yourself, then making any kind of creative statement from that is probably going to come out fine, you know, and really if you just tap into your feeling, you know, you can tap into the healing nature of art and because creativity has no mythology about it. You don't have to believe anything. There's no dogma involved. You just get a pencil or you get a crayon or you get a brush or you get, you know, sculpting tools or something or you start singing or you start writing, you know, and you start to feel creative flow. Oh, I'm not stuck in language. I can do actually, I can tap into this and use it to rethink, reimagine the story of my life and the way that I think about things and maybe what I'm going to be doing. What do I want to dedicate my life to? What am I in service to? And how does my, how does that show up in my life? Right. And so if you're in service to love, if you're in service to a universal love that is all embracing, we're not talking about us and them. We're talking about all of us. You know, somehow we've all got to be able to get along and make something beautiful together or, you know, we're not going to have a world. Right. And we need people to tell us the truth, not to spread lies. Wow, that is so beautiful. It's this, what yours is talking about is in my least afraid moments, I fantasize about this reality that you're talking about. And I do believe that you get marching orders from the universe, and I do believe that it's God. But do you think you two could talk a little bit about the kind of sacred fear that emerges in a person when they actually experience the point of contact that, you know, so many people, we watch the movies and we imagine getting to meet an alien or getting to see the thing or the special thing or see something, see Bigfoot, see the proof of the thing itself. But then sometimes when it happens, and Alex yesterday, you were talking about how scientists sometimes when they make a big discovery, they stop because there's a feeling of fear. I just wonder, the uncanny, I wonder if you two could address how to overcome that woozy sense of fear when you walk into that part of the universe. I think you'd have to be anesthetized not to feel that, you know, I mean, there are things that are so weird that we can't look at them. And if we start looking at them, we start feeling really weird, you know, and so it's like it just keeps people away from and that's one of the things that plagues parapsychology, you know, because they can demonstrate in test after test, the best parapsychologists, actually, they're some of the best scientists on earth, because nobody believes them. They have to get their results so tight. Right. And so no, we're going to do this again. What? Yeah. No, again, man, you know, and so they really go over stuff and now Dean Raiden, the great parapsychologist, has got metadata on multiple tests that have been run successfully over time and shows that without a doubt, telepathy shows up without a doubt, many of these kinds of prayer actually heals what where where could people find that you could hear that where one of his book coming out is called real magic. It's about to come out. I'm so looking forward to this book. So I hope he'll do a book tour and he'll be on your show. Oh, I love it. But this this this brings us back to the original question. Imagination is magic. And you've walked us through a way to bring magic into your life, which is and it's very organized. But but one thing you didn't quite address. And I'm really interested in this. Okay, I'm sorry, close encounters of the third kind spoiler alert. This guy suddenly becomes compelled to build this mud mountain. Right. And I think everybody not just him, then there's all these other people that they saw it too. But don't you think I think that's who we are. Yes, I think that's the psychedelic movement. Yes, you see, that's what the movies about isn't it people from every age now because everybody, you know, that's our age was doing it in the 60s, right. And so all up through there people, it was like a broccoli sprout sprouting open with the amount of people that were trying this substance and other psychedelic substances. And they are having incredible experiences and openings, you know, like like like Bill Hicks was coming out and, you know, claiming incredible benefits and value from this experience. Now psychedelic science is taking it on and they're finding that the benefits are very real and very measurable that these it's amazingly useful. But people want to get together. They want to be in community when this happens, don't they? Yes. And but before we get to be in community, and I maybe just because I'm a negative, or sorry, I have a dark streak in me or something. And this is the thing I would like you guys to address. Because you are in the flow. It's coming through you anytime I'm around you, your painting, Alex, your drawing right now, you are in the flow. But what I'm talking about is in sort of what gets covered in the War of Art, as what he calls resistance, I would just love it if you too could address the various forms of resistance that will emerge the moment you decide to become a servant of love and actualize that through your art. And some of the challenges people can expect to face or may currently be facing in ways that we can overcome these blocks so that we can be pulled more downstream. I want to address, you know, letting the blocks out, because people a lot of times do ask about creative blocks. How do I get started? I'm blocked. I mean, you know, I think that we have to know ourselves and where what we'd love to be doing and then go toward joy. But we can't, we have the blocks are, you know, you have to have a job, you have to make a living, you have children that need you, you have, you know, a partner that needs some attention. So you've got to, you have a lot of responsibilities in your life. And creativity is mandatory. So it's part of what you must put into your life, no matter what. And so, so there, it takes three things really are four things to have a creative life. I mean, first of all, it exists in the material world. Art is not art when it's in your mind. Okay. It's art only when it comes out as evidence. And it's your intention that it's art. That's the definition of art. And that would be for music as well. So if you have music going around in your mind, it's not art yet. It's not even music. It's just something in your mind. You have to get it out. So once you've gotten it out, it's in your studio, but you haven't shared it. Yes. So it's in the outer world of the individual, but it's not in the outer world yet of the collective. And that's when you get it out. You, you either put it on Facebook, or you have a show, or you, you know, coffee shop, whatever, that's outer world collective. Other people get to share it. Then there's the inner world of the collective, which is the response to your work. It's the face button. Wow. I mean, it's the Facebook like button. Yeah. It's, it's the, you know, it's the, it's the YouTube don't like button. It's a don't like button. It's the reviews. It's the t-shirts that people wear of your work and they buy the objects and have them and want them and use them. And then after that, they, they use what they've learned from it, or they use, they take something with them into their own life or into their own work. So you'll see art that has a little bit of Alex Gray in it. That's right. Okay. So, so anyway, they take it into the future of their own creativity. That's a spiraling upward effect of creativity. Wow. If you go full round to the, to the, you know, inner world of the collective, it becomes a meme and then other people use. Okay. Wow. So, so that's upwardly spiraling. That's our community. See, by the way, the psychedelic community is attractive because it's upwardly spiraling, healthy people, loving people, happy people, successful people, beautiful people, and creative people. And so this is an attractor for the general public. People want that. They want happiness. They want health. They want love. And they see that in the love tribe. And so it is attractive. And so then people want to talk to each other and find others. They want to find the others. Yes. That's right. So they come to Cosm and places that are completely unique from Cosm, but that attract the love tribe. Right. And, and ones that are like Cosm. A lot of people come here and say, what we're doing exactly what you're doing. But you find out it's all very unique whatever everybody's doing in their collective communities, because you keep hearing about communities. If I was listening to this, I would not have the guts to come to Cosm. I think if I was listening to this, and I was a young, it was a bad, it was a bad, no, it's, no, I know, Allison, I'm, no, I'm saying this not because you did something bad. I'm saying this because I would feel too insecure. And I would find that I would just, I'm just thinking of me and the life of a young artist or an old artist. Let me tell you about the people that come here. Just they, they find the others and they're inspired. So I just wanted to say that. I'm going to let you talk, but I had to say, I'm just saying take my love and they find the others going online, going out. Okay. So I'm going to go to Cosm going online and then looking, I could see myself getting as far as looking at the thing. And I'm friends with you all. And even coming up here on the train, this time I get nervous and like butterfly and I'm like, oh, yeah. Cause you guys don't realize it because you live in the midst of this cyclone of creativity. But I was telling Alex just wandering around. I had at least three life changing conversations talking to, you know, and I'm not even exaggerating. I mean, literally like getting like, oh, here, let me show you something you've never thought of, but that you should have been thinking of. And that happened to the point where you guys just was stammering. So by the end of like walking around here, I'm like, I seem like I've had a stroke. I'm like, I'm staying, I'm like kind of mumbling. He was drooling last night. No, it's just because my brain is like melting out my ears. So what I'm saying is I'm just, how do we overcome this block of coming to places like this? I think that people have to realize that every artist also faces blocks and fears themselves. And that every, it's very natural to have to be able to confront some of the fears that you have, even if they're unconscious in order to make creative actions. There's all kinds of sometimes repercussions in people's lives that they are unanticipated in things. And so there's a fear to break convention from what they're, you know, in, you know, depending on their social situation. So exactly. So in these cases, I encourage, I don't encourage people to try to, you know, break down their world or something, but to find a way to put their creative life in a little notebook, a sketchbook, something that is something that's kept me alive when I haven't been able to do my paintings. It's just been keeping my five by eight inch notebooks with me all the time and making drawings and making notes about the stuff that I want to be doing. And so this is mine. It's like a diary. And in that way, it's a, you know, it's, it is up to that person, your own creation is your redemption. It's not something that you're going to get from anybody else. You know, you have to put the responsibility of your life on the line for your life and to get your life and redeem your life as something creatively meaningful and worthwhile yourself. So you see that the actual payoff is much more worth it than the fear that keeps you from doing it. And that you have to basically get over that fear in order to get something done. And there's going to be some level of chastisement. Oh, you didn't do everything you could have done. Bad you, you know, you're going to have to basically get the naughty finger of your unconscious that is telling you that, that you could have and should have activated. And mostly it's the fear of confronting that first wave of guilt of having not activated our creative lives that keeps us from activating our creative life. Because we know we have to go through a little. Yeah, I know. I'm sorry, creative self soul. I'm sorry, soul. I, you know, I, but I'm here for you now. I want to be seeing your shine in my life more and more. And so I'm trying to make a place for you speak to me. Let me ride this divine wave that is in my heart, you know, that wants to come out in some way unique to me. I have a gift each one of us, you know, each you know what I just, I feel like, I feel like the person, and again, I'm not putting you on this pedestal for giving because it's going to sound kind of cheesy. But I feel like I'm the person sitting next to Jesus when he's like, here's how you pray. You don't know that you did it. And maybe this is a prayer you have memorized, the prayer to the soul that you just said this beautiful prayer that you say to your soul. I'll play it back for you. Don't realize you just like wrote this incredibly poignant, beautiful prayer that you say to that part of you that for so many years has been locked in a tower doing just you're rescued. Hey, the prince, your, your own self saving prince has come through the window, kissed you with love's first kiss, your wake to your creative life to your creative soul because you're complete and whole inside of yourself, you know that you are, you've recovered it completely. And so from that access point of the divine mind that you can access now, because it's in your heart, it's just the light in your heart. It's your, it's beating, right? Yeah. So no mythology. It's beating. Hey, make something of it. You got this time. You got this pause. Got the done done done done done done done done. Yeah. Wow. I love you guys so much. I love talking to people about creative block. If anybody ever wants to talk to me about their life or their art, they can write to me at Allison, a l l y s o n at Cosm.org. And I have a blog, Ask Allison about art and life. And we talk about a lot of these things, you know, about, you know, people's desire to have a practice, a spiritual practice of art, yeah, in their life. And so, well, this is, I know we're at an hour and you guys are very busy. Just I, how can people get in touch?

They are incredible people. What they're building over there is a truly novel, sacred place. I hope you will go there. Much thanks to the track art.com for supporting this episode. All right, friends, here's a, a little sonic gift for you. I don't know if you're familiar with Chad Van Galen. I love him. I've been emailing with sub pop because I'm hoping to get him on the podcast, but they were kind enough to give me permission to play this song of his, which is a real blazer. Also, the animated video for it is one of the coolest trippiest things you ever saw. So now please enjoy this track from Chad Van Galen, Pine and Clover. I'll have links to his stuff in the comment section of this episode over at dunkintrustle.com. Thanks for listening to you guys. I love you so much. And I'll see you real soon. I've got another supremely glorious podcast headed your way with my dear friend Ian Fidance. We talk about sex. See you soon. She was a shape shifter. Politics didn't matter to her. No, no, she's born a million times over. The mind full of sweets smelling pine and clover. And she taught you how to be low. She was a bonafide grifter.

Let's do the podcast. Greetings to you, sweet friends and family. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. I would first like to start off by with a very quick, non-sponsored ad for an incredible new service that they say is going to, in some way or another, potentially compete with Twitter. It's called Kleenex.com, you can go check it out. And it's basically a way that you can tweet your snot, basically. It's just like instead of tweeting, Instagram's got pics and Twitter has got words, but Kleenex.com, you can just take pictures of the various types of mucus and whatever expulsions happen to come exploding out of your body. And you can also like or dislike, or if somebody blasts out a particularly greenish, sour, clearly infected blow of mucus, you could maybe competitively blast your cleaner, healthier mucus. And if you get enough followers, there's potential sponsorship from a lot of the different industries involved in keeping us healthy and free of colds. Also, I would be remiss if I did not congratulate my dear listeners who are living in the great country of Canada. Congratulations, you are now in the peculiar situation of being able to freely carry plant matter around in your pockets or keep it at your house without fear of someone with a gun, potentially arresting you, shooting you, separating you from your family, or in some way, shape or form taking away. Some of your rights, it's crazy. You guys are really on the cutting edge of things. And that brings me to a really exciting announcement. I've already kind of mentioned this before, but the more I listen to this tape, the more kind of, how do I say, I'm just intrigued by it. If you didn't hear in an earlier episode, I found this old tape that has got one of my favorite sad clown slash, you know, railroad hobo style singer, Fergus Blanders, and it's got tracks on it that I've never heard before that are impossible to find on the internet, that I played for one of my friends at a record store and he couldn't believe it. These are deep Blanders cuts that seem to be completely, I don't know, they're just nowhere to be found. And I tried to contact the Blanders camp, but he and his manager have gone off radar, which happens sometimes with him. The last I heard, he was actually going to a monastery in Bhutan to do some kind of performance out there, which seems absolutely bizarre to me because he's a hard drinking, self-indulgent, if you ask me, I still have his music kind of dude, but that's neither here nor there. My hope is that I don't get in trouble for playing this track. And I'm just gonna include some of the like weird shit that also got taped over as a kind of, I mean, I don't wanna be correctional here, but if you find a tape, don't tape over it before you listen to what's on it because you never know what you could be taping over. And in this case, somebody with completely good intentions or maybe a group of people, I don't know, a few different people taped over like really, really rare tracks that maybe even have the potential for being made into an album or something. I mean, this is like finding like some old Jerry Garcia songs or something that no one's ever heard before. And wow, man, that would be, for a lot of people, that would be pretty exciting. So I'm not pissed, I get it, I've taped over shit that I regret taping over, but I'm just gonna include some of the stuff that got taped over, this completely rare and as far as I know, never before heard Fergus Blander's song and I'm playing it because it has a little bit of a connection to Canada. So congrats, Canada, you did it. You can now have plants in your pocket and way to go. And also don't forget cleanox.com, it's cold season and you're gonna be able to make so many great, incredible sprays of mucus and share those sprays of mucus with your friends and maybe even make new friends or getting the polite kind of mucus competitions with people from all over the world. That's cleanox.com and again, they haven't sponsored me. I'm just very excited about the service. So here we go. Here's a never before heard Fergus Blander's song followed by a little bit of business and then a wonderful conversation with the creator of Dance Safe, Emmanuel Safarios. And if you're from the Blanders camp, my apologies, if you want me to take this down, I will. Okay, I think it's the plant. Hi. What? What's the plant? What is it? It's an egg in the marijuana. Okay, thank you. Don't want to be surprised. Just smoking marijuana within a two-year period who were intelligent at first and after two years of marijuana they just came around and they go, hey, hey, how are you doing? I'm going to be the one of the first to say that marijuana is very ultimately destructive. And then finally there'll be government studies to prove that it's totally harmful, much more harmful than it's ever been exposed to has been. Because I've seen it through people. I just end up, hey, hey. I don't like that. I like drunkards, man. Because drunkards, they come out of it and they're sick and they spring back and forth. At the bottom of the glass is the college level class teaching you everything that you need to know. Hear the eyes go tingle, tingle as your coins go jingle, jingle down upon the bottom you enroll. Whiskey's my professor's philosophy she shares. Her alma mater consists of a billionaires. Some take a class for wisdom, others take a class to hide. From airing her past the chastain through blasted countryside. Kings and grounds which places before they graduate. Some write love on their diploma, and assign their name in hate. For me, whiskey has been a lover and a friend which is why I smile when I'm held back and take her class again. I love whiskey, I love whiskey, I love whiskey, I love whiskey. And for tomorrow, to go in early, medical claims file. Whiskey is my mother, because whiskey fucked my dad. Whiskey's the best parent that this kid never had. I guess it's a little bit like discovering a Mona Lisa in your basement and realizing that somebody was in a hurry and they wrote a grocery list on top of it. And my friend was telling me that in a weird way there's some parallels between writing a grocery list on top of the Mona Lisa and karma that pretty much every single person is a grocery list written on top of the Mona Lisa and that meditation is not so much to make better lists but to become who we really are. Well, my friend said that, I just kind of changed the subject because to me it's like, here is this beautiful thing, you know, blanders. And then here is this symbol to me of the whole world which is like you've got noise and you got static. And then with a tape like this, you think to yourself, which is which? But to me, I'll tell you one thing I know for sure. Blanders is the noise and everything else is static. And I'm thinking about even having the tape sent to one of those tape reconstruction laboratories in Beijing to see if there's some way that they can maybe pull what's underneath the stuff that's been recorded over blanders out so we can get an entire Fergus Blanders album out of this thing. And if so, then that's going to be great for the entire world. If not, then I guess I'm just going to have to do what my friend said after he babbled on and on for a long time about this stuff and just accept the fact that even a Mona Lisa that's got grocery lists written all over it is still the Mona Lisa. So we'll see. I'll keep you guys posted. I know you're dying to hear more of Blanders beautiful voice and incredible genius poetic lyrics. And the more I'm able to recover stuff from this tape, the more I'll try to share it with you. OK, guys, we got a wonderful podcast for you today. We're going to jump right into it. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been made possible by the radiant rainbow beings of light over at Squarespace.com. They have specifically requested that I not reveal the fact that Squarespace is, in fact, a quadrahedron located in a different dimension and that they are undulating beings of light who are attempting to create a very simple yet profoundly powerful service through which websites can be created, not only so that people can promote their weddings, send out invitations. I don't know why you'd want to promote your wedding, send out invitations. Well, I guess you'd want to promote it. I guess an invitation is a promotion. I have to read this is actually on the script. But one thing that they they don't want me to say is that their their mission here is to create a very simple and inexpensive way that people can make their dreams come true. Because when people make their dreams come true, they manifest some ultimate reality and the ultimate reality ends up up shifting consciousness and the upshift consciousness naturally results in a reduction of violence and the reduction in violence and aggression. Inevitably improves the conditions of the planet. And this creates a kind of positive feedback loop which results in them being able to teleport from their dimension into this dimension because these beings of light breathe love in the way that we breathe oxygen. So I'm not supposed to tell you that. Sorry, Squarespace. I just felt like if I don't let people know who you guys over there actually are, then I'm kind of being a little unethical. That being said, Squarespace gives you everything you need to create a beautiful website. They have award winning templates that you can mix and match to in a matter of minutes. If you want to, if you wanted to, you can create a really incredible site. They've got everything you need to sell stuff. They've got full shopping cart functionality and not only that, but they've got amazing customer support. So if you run into any kind of confusion, they'll get back to your right away. They size to any device and it's probably inappropriate to say this in the midst of a commercial and I'm not trying to spread fear and I'm certainly not trying to bash the great web designers out there who do such a wonderful job making wonderful websites for all of us to enjoy. But they're not all great gang and some of them go deeply and permanently insane from being hunched over their keyboards coding so much. It's called code possession or the manifestation of the vaporous darkness. I'm sure you already know this and I'm not going to go into all the gory details of it, but in Indiana, in one of their cemeteries, right outside of a seminary, they found one of these web designers who had lost his mind, had gotten the fifth round of notes from somebody and had found the graveyard that their great grandmother was buried in and gone into the tomb where their great grandmother was buried and I'm not going to go into the details, but I'll just say they defiled the corpse and spray painted on the wall, some kind of HTML code that I guess if you were to put it into a computer would just say fuck you man. So that sucks. And again, this is not the bash all web designers, but if you ask me, I like doing stuff myself and Squarespace.com is it's got everything you need so you can you can do it yourself make a beautiful website. It's Squarespace and then if you decide that you want to hire a web designer just make sure that you don't reveal what cemetery. Any of your relatives happen to be in chances are everything's going to be fine but man it's some pretty heavy stuff. Right now you can head to Squarespace.com forward slash Duncan and when you're ready to launch use offer code Duncan to get 10% of your first order of a website or a domain. That's Squarespace.com forward slash Duncan use offer code Duncan when you're ready to launch and not just launch a beautiful website but launch what could potentially be the great shift in consciousness that is going to completely and radically transform this planet not by adding flashy new stuff like spaceships and teleportation and monkeys that can drive but by connecting us to a kind of primordial pre existing technology which is the fundamental ground of goodness that makes up all things. And the glowing beings of light over at Squarespace.com want to be part of that process and you can too by creating an amazing website that shines that sweet rainbow light through every pixel on the screen of whoever happens to be looking at it. That's Squarespace.com also a deep heartfelt thank you to my Patreon subscribers. If you go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH you'll be met with uncommercialized episodes of the DTFH you'll also get access to all kinds of stuff over there including sometimes our plus long rambling things as I try to help myself understand some of the things that I'm currently taught by my meditation teacher at least that's what the last Ramble is about and I try to do it in a way that doesn't make me seem like I know what I'm talking about or like like I'm some kind of expert or know it all which is Jesus Christ depending on how many Yerba Mates I've consumed is one of the. It's a danger it's a danger because I'll tell you is so much easier to talk about Buddhism and meditation than it is to meditate which I think is one of the big problems because really it's like every single Buddhist text I read in some way shape or form kindness as well you know maybe it's not even a thing that we talk about which is pretty peculiar and to me and a little paradoxical in the sense that I love watching YouTube videos right now the great teachers like Chogyam Trumpa Rinpoche or the Dalai Lama talking about this stuff and fantasizing that they're drawing not from some memorized. Stuff but from their connection to an ever refreshing kind of data stream called the Dharma could be completely wrong about that really mean I don't know but it's fun to think that anyway thank you. Patreon subscribers you want to subscribe go to patreon.com forward slash D T F H and sign up you will also get access to our discord server where folks who theoretically listen to the podcast though now I think about it maybe some of them don't.

Friday November 16th I'm going to be at the Sam Rasa Center in Echo Park and recording. I guess you could call it a podcast it's more of like a I don't know what you would call it. Why do we always have to call things stuff I'm going to be up there talking with David Nick turn my meditation teacher he teaches classes all over the world and he's coming into town. And he lets me sit up there and ask him questions about the particular branch of Buddhism that the lineage of Buddhism that he's in which he was a student of Chogum Trumpa Rinpoche and he's a really great teacher. If you're woo woo adverse or if you kind of like think I want to go to some new age talk man or whatever it's not like that. It's what I love about him and the lineage that he teaches and I know lineage sounds like a fancy word but it's like that's what they call it. It's it's and I didn't mean that in a condescending way I mean it's like lineage. The sort of the school he's in is pretty basic and I used to hate that about it and now I love it about it because it's real simple. There's not a lot of bells and whistles attached to it and it's it's all kind of sort of centered around a very experiential way of practicing Buddhism which is pretty awesome because it's so easy to get caught in all the. I guess what we are calling right now icing is him he and I like as he teaches me you know it's easy to have a lot of icing and not much cake and icing is pretty awesome and I love icing and I also as a child if I'm going to get sick at a birthday party is because I've been eating way too much icing even though it looks good and it's delicious and sweet. You want some cake under there and so that's the topic is lots of icing not much cake cutting through spiritual materialism that sounds maybe really heavy and potentially boring but it's not. It's just a fun thing to think about sort of the difference between all the extra stuff that you might add on to this practice or that that is really cool and fun and awesome. I don't know maybe like practice where you are capes and juggle magic wands and have like a some kind of like dance sessions and oil yourself down roll around in some kind of a ball pit only it's not balls it's like miniaturized globes that that make like the ohm sound and then and somebody on the side. It has a mister that sprays masculine infused mist on top of you and then when you're done you're sort of like laid out on a nice bear skin rug and spanked by a professional spanker who then rolls you up and some kind of velvet blanket and then. You sort of hang out in the velvet blanket while being massaged or something and all that stuff sounds really fun and now that I think about it I hope somebody creates that. Religion but it would be easy in all those steps to get kind of lost if there wasn't some underlying basic E equals MC squared to type thing to the. Religion itself you know and some I think maybe some things actually are just all icing and there isn't any cake but then is the icing actually considered the cake is there a difference between the icing and the cake who am I to say what's fucking icing and what cake isn't. Maybe some people want a nice big fat bowl of fucking icing dude back off man so that's that's what we're going to talk about and maybe we'll figure it out maybe we won't again that is the Friday November 16th at the Samarasah Center in Echo Park L. A it's from seven to nine p.m. and there's going to be refreshments and and and we'll hang out a little bit after so this is a cool thing if you are interested in this kind of stuff. Even if you're not interested in this kind of stuff why not just drop by and see if you see and just be bored with it will be bored. I just can't be bored. You don't like it. Okay man I guess that's about it. Oh shit one last thing. My guest today's guest Emmanuel Safarios is the creator of dance safe and this sometimes happens that at the end of a podcast. The guests kind of forget something that they meant to mention and in this case dance safe is now making available fentanyl test strips. If you're somebody out there who likes to use white powders and if you're somebody out there right now who is using some kind of white powder particularly heroin or cocaine. Not not to make you paranoid or anything like that and you'll hear Emmanuel talk about this a little bit more you could research it. I guess fentanyl is making its way into the white powders out there and fentanyl kills people and it's super powerful and there's a thing called the chocolate chip effect where a little grain of fentanyl might make its way into your. White powder and then and then and you can you can OD. So if you're somebody who is doing that right now you might as well order some of these fentanyl test strips by going to dance safe dot org why risk why risk. Killing yourself and who you know it sucks that the supply chain is being corrupted by some kind of weird super powerful synthetic drug but I really like Emmanuel's POV you know from my perspective. I've always loved psychedelics and I think I have more of a kind of like hierarchy of substances and are like a weird ethical hierarchy of substances that I project on to various psychoactives or mind altering chemicals whereas for Emmanuel. It's more of a look people are using substances out there and there's no sense in shaming them for that because that doesn't do anything and also there's no sense in pretending it isn't happening and then acting shocked every time somebody dies. Why not just accept the fact that part of being human for some people is engaging with substances that are sometimes dangerous and potentially deadly and then make available to people things that can sort of mitigate that risk. I love that I think it's a very very intelligent and rational POV when it comes to drugs but he's gonna articulate that a lot better than me and I really love chatting with him always found it to be very educational and also. As somebody who from time to time really does enjoy using some psychedelic or mind altering substance it also I always feel a little more informed and a little sort of more grounded. In what's going on out there because folks like Emmanuel are they keep their ear to the railroad tracks so to speak and also they set up dance safe Emmanuel's organization actually sets up booths at events where they test drugs for people so we can avoid the thing that happens. And some of these events where somebody takes something that isn't what it is and then the entire event ends up. You know being transformed from a celebration to a tragedy and this all of course has its roots in the insane prohibition of drugs which absolutely does not work and the. Absolute insane rave act that Biden passed which just doesn't it doesn't work it doesn't work if it work great it doesn't work people are still dying and the reason they're dying is because they're they don't they're not being educated and they don't have access to. Tools that they could use to mitigate risk mitigate risk God I sound boring. Hey guys want to come over to my house and mitigate risk tonight Jesus Christ. Well anyway it doesn't have to be boring and I'll tell you this I'd rather have boring friends than dead friends. I think today's guest is a wonderful human the founder of dance safe.org. This is his second appearance on the DTFH all the links you need to find Emmanuel and all the links you need to get fentanyl strips or any of the testing kits that they supply over at dance safe.org will be at dunkitrustle.com. Now without further ado please welcome to the DTFH Emmanuel Safarios. Welcome. It's the dunkitrustle. I mean you're welcome back to the DTFH what a wonderful thing to have you here with me thanks Duncan it's great it's great to be in your studio man I have so much respect for you and what you do because. As many people know I am a lover of psychedelics and I have since I was 16 or younger been infuriated by the prohibition and the stigmatization of psychedelics. And I consider you to be one of the people who is on the front lines of one of the very important social for lack of a better word there I don't like using it wars that are happening right now which is the. Movement to shift the stigmatization the conditioning the. Complete superstition surrounding psychedelics into a more logical arena and also in that process to get a lot of people potentially out of prison and get a lot of people who might have gone to prison. To keep that from happening so thank you let me just qualify that all all drugs not just psychedelics all drugs we need to get rid of that stigma. Right yes that's the cool thing about you too is that you don't do what I do which is like I have created a hierarchy of good drugs and the bad drugs. This is so funny because like my my meditation teacher told me that this joke this joke which is like really cheesy but really funny to me which is because he's a musician and he's sorry David if you're listening I'm going to butcher your joke. What's the difference between a banjo and an accordion. I don't know a banjo burns longer. It's like a diss on the on one certain musical instruments. So it's like there's literally a hierarchy of musical instruments. So the violin. Oh so sophisticated the banjo. What are you like a redneck. Well this affects the drug policy reform movement. It really does because the stigma has been put on all of us and one way that a drug user tries to relieve themselves of that shame is by saying oh well at least I'm not using crack or at least I'm not using that drug whatever happens to be right. Well it's I guess let's look at that. Let's deeply look at that which is certainly all drugs are not equal in the sense that there are certain drugs that have far more damaging effects on the human being than other drugs. All drugs have risks and benefits and some drugs have a greater risk profile in certain areas addiction potential things like that. But what we have to understand and most important point that needs to get across is the vast majority of all drug use no matter what drug you're talking about the vast majority of people who use that drug use it non problematically and in fact obtain benefits from it. And that's true with stimulants that's true with opiates as well we just see in the media and in our own lives the worst case scenarios we notice when people are having problematic drug use. I'm going to give you an example of something that William Burrow there's something William Burrow said that I remember when I heard it I thought my God this is just awful that he would say this and it's terrible and he's just rationalizing a really horrific thing. And then in retrospect as I've thought of it just from a rational perspective I guess it's kind of right and he was saying that heroin injecting heroin into your body physiologically is not really that damaging. No it's not damaging at all in fact the early addicts were doctors who at the turn of the last century who had access to it. They lived long healthy lives surgeons operating on you while they were on their heroin. I mean no thanks though like you know what I mean like if I went to my doctor and he's like we're doing a surgery next week I'm going to be so fucking high on heroin. Well wait let me blow another myth for you then so they have heroin maintenance programs in Switzerland and Germany even some in Canada. We're talking instead of methadone or suboxone if you're an addict you can enter the program and they just give you your heroin as much as you want. You can go in three times a day helps these people get back get their lives back put food in the fridge for their kids. The thing we don't understand is that when you're using high dose opiates the high or the inebriation effect only lasts a couple weeks after that you're just feeling normal. You're not getting high. The notion that heroin addicts are let's call them just daily heroin users are chasing a euphoria that simply isn't true. And when we look at the phenomenon of addiction where people can go to prison for a month or two and not have access to well you can get access to drugs in prison but let's say some people can't. You know so the withdrawal symptoms also only last a couple weeks so you've gone through the withdrawal symptoms you come back out you start right up again. You could call that a substance use disorder and for some people it may be but it also may be the case that opiates are the best medication that we have for severe childhood trauma severe anxiety things that SSRIs won't touch. We have thousands and thousands of people who make the choice to use high dose opiates and live functional lives and what's really killing them today is the fact that there's fentanyl contaminating the drug market they don't know what dose they're getting they can't take it regularly. Prohibition has created the addict and our narrative and store in our minds of what the heroin user is prohibition has created that. Okay let's talk about that the. I want to get to the root of the problem here which is that. People are taking substances. Because they want to reduce the suffering they're experiencing in their own lives usually in some way shape or form that's a one main reason people use drugs well let's what are some of the other reasons insight therapy self exploration. Fun maybe you could say wanting to have fun you know with your friends is about reducing suffering because it's the opposite of suffering fun rate something like that but I just want to make sure you're not. I don't think most people use drugs to. Relieve themselves of pain maybe largely with opiates yes but that's not why people trip not pain suffering. Okay sure let's dive into this so and I think you're right let me refine what I was saying. Because it was like very like monolithic in the sense that when the implication what I said is that when a person does anything there's one motivation behind it you know usually there's like a. Variety of different motivations within any action but there's some overt motivation that has underneath it a bunch of more subtle motivations behind it so. When people use drugs there's generally some combination of things like for example if I would be very suspicious if I met someone who told me I am taking this substance or that substance for knowledge that's my dog. Is that going to come through a little come through okay that's my dog we're trying to reduce my dog's suffering that's Piper itching. To reduce her suffering it's creating a reverberation through the ceiling which is then going to make its way into the podcast which is then going to make its way into the years of so many people listening right. And so this brings me to kind of what I want to talk about which is there is an inevitable. Karmic repercussion for the way we reduce our own suffering which is not limited to the individual and the impacts of a substance or method on an individual but these waves radiate out into society and so. This is where the legislation I think comes into is that there is an acknowledgement or recognition that we are dealing with these waves of karmic repercussion from people who are doing anything in an attempt to reduce their suffering but to clarify the point of reducing suffering. Entertainment. Even some most forms of exploration of knowledge have attached to them an element of distracting distraction a sense of being sort of enamored or caught up in some thing whatever it may be and in that enamored moment and being caught up in like seeing the thing. Are suffering this thing that we were feeling which made us want to go to a movie which made us want to reach for the pie which made us want to like get a massage which made us want to like get a blow job or. Or continue our work. Yeah that we justify we're doing good for the world or you know what all of it is an attempt to relieve suffering everything anyone does. There you go. That's right that's that perhaps maybe meditation but that's the ultimate. Well I mean obviously people consciously engage in meditation to relieve suffering but that that's then that may be an activity that doesn't produce the karmic results that you were speaking of. Well I mean you know with my God with meditation. It's so easy to like it to get caught in the very same trap you get caught in with with a Netflix movie with meditation where you start like sitting down and like like looking taking on some sort of form that you've seen somewhere or another and imagining in your mind that somewhere in here is like a thing you're doing and which is fine by the way but what really is the difference and I think you could name some differences but I want to get to the issue at hand which is that humans on this planet are suffering and we want that suffering to not happen anymore and so we're doing anything we can to try to reduce that suffering. Some of us are shooting heroin some of us are shooting people and some of us are meditating and yet we still are dealing with like one central fundamental problem which is like fuck we don't feel so good sometimes. So that's what I wanted to talk with you about is. It's the ultimate topic. Yeah it's the ultimate topic. So if my methodology for reducing suffering is to inject myself or eat a drug that is going to create some physiological change in me that makes me dependent on that drug. In the short term I have succeeded in reducing my suffering but in the long term I might have added more complication to a situation and in a paradoxically in the long term amplified my suffering happens all the time. Absolutely I mean you're kind of defining substance use disorders right there people who use drugs to escape to relieve themselves of their pain their suffering can get trapped in a cycle. Right that's the thing right there and I think that like when we look at like regulation and again I'm I'm I guess you could say playing devil's advocate here so that but let's be clear that is nothing to do with why drugs were made. Illegal historically and has nothing to do with why they are remain illegal today. It's not because of the risk of addiction that drugs are illegal that that's maybe an excuse but drugs were banned because of racism. Every single step of the way you know the the anti Asian American laws back in when they built the railroads was late 1800s. You know the first ever drug laws were laws that were combined with other anti Asian culture laws so they banned smoking opium at the same time that they banned carrying your laundry on a stick over your shoulder because I destroyed my mother's life. It was a joke. She became hooked dude. First it just started off on the weekend. She's carrying her laundry all day. And then it was a really bad right. It was a downward spiral. Yeah we allowed them to come over build the railroads for us once the railroads were done. We didn't like them around our communities so we started passing laws aimed at their culture and one of them was opium as a first drug laws in this country. Right. Yeah well OK so in the past and I like I've heard the same thing with Nixon and like that he like wanted to figure out a way that he could essentially like the idea is let's concoct a way that we can control people by arresting them. And so what we do is we make something that is a completely natural normal facet of human experience the reduction of suffering through this chemical or that chemical illegal. And so what we've done here is by stigmatizing and legislating this thing or that thing. Now what I have is an avenue to arrest people. Right. And that produces this kind of eerie horrific power that's been moralized. So it's kind of like of course we must do this. Of course we must because if not then we're going to experience this rampant. Terrible fucking ripple pouring through society and it's going and all of the world will collapse because of it. Well you know Portugal is a perfect example of why that's false. Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001 so that that's 17 years ago now personal possession possession for personal use is no longer a crime in Portugal for all drugs. They reduced their overdose rate by 53 percent just by doing that. And they have one of the lowest rates of drug use of all of Europe. Wow that's so amazing. Yeah you know what's so funny is when they legalized marijuana recreationally in California my interest in it diminished. Oh yeah prohibition creates this forbidden fruit effect which not only attracts young people to the drug. Don't do that that's bad. But also causes misuse and abuse because when you prohibit something you say there's no benefits there's only risks if you do this you're bad. And so the consciousness of using it responsibly to obtain the proper benefits which of course includes not using it too much and don't take too high of a dose. That doesn't even enter the consciousness of a lot of young people. This is why I founded DanceSafe was to create a positive drug culture one that recognizes the benefits because that's the best way of reducing the harms. And it's why I named my new podcast Drug Positive for the same reason. Very quickly can you we already talked about it on the podcast that you're here but maybe for some new listeners. Can you can you talk a little bit about what DanceSafe. I should have this and I should have this elevator pitch perfected by now. DanceSafe is a peer based harm and risk reduction nonprofit with chapters in I think now about 20 cities across the United States where we provide harm and risk reduction information and services basically. Drug checking services will test your ecstasy pills or any drug you want for you so you know what you're taking. We have literature that we bring to events on the safer use of substances and peer based drug education from a non-judgmental perspective. And but I I'm a bit out of the loop here. I thought that because of Biden's law that that doesn't happen anymore. Oh so the the rave act has sent a chill through many through much of the festival community and some festivals don't allow us to do pill testing on site. Some don't allow us there at all because they're too afraid but we still are able to do a lot of festivals around the country. So how does that work. And I think we talked about in the last podcast if like you're running a tent where someone is bringing in a schedule one drug to be tested or whatever schedule drug. Can a cop just position themselves somewhere outside the tent and when people walk out arrest them. They could but you know the exact opposite has happened. We've had cops who have confiscated drugs on people come to our tent and say hey can you test this for me. I want to see what it is really. Really. There's a very strange relationship between law enforcement and harm reduction. You know they might be arresting people at the festival but yet they allow harm reduction to do its thing. Now that's not all cops. Obviously there are some counties and these are usually the events where the promoters won't allow us to do the testing that would be totally against that. But in the counties that understand harm reduction there's usually a lot of cooperation. Well I mean yeah because you know the thing is like you created like many there are many police officers I've met are people who are doing it because they actually want to help people. You know what I mean it's not like these we were running. I think most go into the profession thinking they will be helping people. And they're like taking on the shittiest job. It's like the shittiest job. It's like being a bouncer for society. And it's like you've got to like you. I just when I wake up in the morning like this morning for example you know one of my anxieties. I think man I hope I give you a good interview today. You know what I mean I get a little flutter inside of me and I'm like man I hope that like I don't over talk or whatever. Well if you're a police officer you wake up in the morning and you think man I sure hope that I don't end up in a situation where somebody fires a gun at me. And I don't know exactly how I would I would never do that job right. So somewhere within that stress I think there's a lot of probably opportunity for somebody to start exhibiting some pretty like symptoms of PTSD and anger and who knows what else. But anyway the point is they're not all bad man. And if certainly when it comes to this issue they don't want to be arresting people for some bullshit that they know is like on the on the on the on the hierarchy of harm. Yep you know but I think they realize that I think local police local city councils get it way more than the federal government gets it right. That's right. And that's how change is happening in this country. It's not happening at the federal level. Congress is gridlocked and you're never going to get a law passed through Congress but we've decriminalized or legalized cannabis in over half the states in the United States through initiatives state by state initiatives. And what I tell people now one of my podcasts I promote every episode is the next step we need to do is state by state initiatives to decriminalize all drugs because the polling has already happened. And across the entire country Republicans and Democrats alike by a sizable majority favor the decriminalization of all drugs that possession for personal use should no longer be a crime. Really? That should be the next thing that the movement takes on. I keep trying to promote that. What polls are you citing there? It was a private opinion poll conducted by a reputable opinion polling group. There's some movement happening in California with a group that I'm in contact with. It's probably going to do the first one they're thinking either Oregon, Colorado or California. It's going to happen maybe next year the first one. I know in one of the debates between Ted Cruz and Beto O'Rourke Ted Cruz brought up that Beto O'Rourke at some point in his political career was for exactly what you're saying. And Cruz brought that up as a political bludgeon to make him seem like he was a monster. Yeah, well it's not even, fuck those feds. Who cares about what Congress thinks? You do it on a state by state level, right? Let the feds come in and try to fight us. For a while they were raiding a lot of California pop clubs. Now they've given up. Now they've kind of said, okay, even sessions is not greatly turning the clock back on cannabis. That's right. No, I mentioned that not, but I mentioned that because there are obviously people at all levels of government who agree with you, but know that if they come out publicly and say that and cite the statistics and the data related to what happens when you do that as far as harm reduction goes, they're still going to get crucified. They can't say it because these days and all days, it seems like unfortunately people are magnetized not towards logic. They seem to be more magnetized towards passion. They seem to, right? Go figure. Well, you know, the great thing about propositions and is that you don't need any politicians on board. You collect enough signatures. You put it to the voters directly. Wow. I do want to get into like something a little bit more philosophical, but only because you are such an expert on this and you've made it your life's work. Why don't we just do it right now? What are the steps that anybody listening to this who feels drawn towards the notion that we should decriminalize all drugs? What are some steps they could start taking to help this reality happen? And also, if you don't mind, if you could just add some data sets that they could go to so that they could educate themselves on it. You know what I mean? If someone listening right now, if you're like rolling your eyes and like, what the fuck are you talking about? That's the most insane, psychotic, lunatic, shitty, satanic idea I ever heard in my fucking life. This guy is out of his goddamn mind. I don't want my kid to be able to go down to the 7-Eleven and buy some fucking methamphetamine and smoke meth behind the fucking 7-Eleven. What are you doing? Why are you letting this man on your podcast? He's going to destroy society. Tell them the data sets and then give us some step-by-step moves. So the first thing people need to know is that decriminalization is not legalization. Decriminalization just means that a personal possession is no longer a crime, but manufacturing and selling still remains a crime. Now, I'm an advocate for full-on legalization. Every drug needs to be regulated after it's legalized. But that's for another show when you have me back on in a year or whatever. But decriminalization is what they did in Portugal, a couple other countries have it too, where if you are using drugs and you have them on your person, on your body, that's not a crime. Not even a misdemeanor. California has made personal possession just a misdemeanor, so it's close to decriminalization. If you just have drugs on you in California because of Prop 47 a few years ago and you get busted and they can't show that you intended to sell them, that's just a misdemeanor. Oregon has a kind of decriminalization law similar where it's a misdemeanor if you don't have any prior felonies. Don't ask me why. But anyway, we're moving to that direction. So what happens when you decriminalize drugs? And if you take the Portugal example, the most important thing that happens is you open up the public space for conversations and services to take place. Most people are dying today. The people who are dying from drugs today, they're dying because they're hiding their drug use. They're not talking about their drug use with the people they need to be talking to about them. Doctors, teachers, public health providers. They're not going and obtaining the services that even the ones that are available for them. And safe injection facilities and DanceSafe and the RAVAC preventing us from doing harm reduction work. Once drugs are legal to possess, all of those of us who are trying to get these services out to people, it instantly becomes widespread and available. And that opens up the conversation, changes the culture, now everything changes. It's not that they diverted money from enforcement into treatment, and that's what reduced the overdose rate. We know treatment doesn't work. Medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction works pretty well, but 12-step works for a tiny percentage of people that enter it. It's not treatment. It's just the fact that... Stop the presses, Satan! Hold on! Okay. Now, I am not in a 12-step program, but I have many, many friends who are. And these people have certainly relapsed multiple times. So if the quantification mechanism we're looking for here is not relapsing as being an indication that the program is successful, then yes, perhaps you're right. People do relapse when they go into 12-step programs. But the 12-step programs themselves are producing for some people a structure within which they can explore themselves and maybe get to the root of why they've been making some of the decisions they've been making, which have caused their life so many problems. And any addict will tell you that it's not the substance that is causing the problems. The substance abuse is a flower growing off of a much deeper... The roots go much deeper in this tree of sorrows and that we get to the root. And from that, we might find that the addiction or the addictive behavior diminishes. So I don't agree with you in the sense that I do think they're effective in at least illuminating the interior universe of some people and showing that there might be a connection between that universe and the external universe in which they're experiencing so much chaos. You ready to unpack this? Yeah, let's do it. Well, like I said, 12-step programs work for a small percentage of people, but the data shows that they are not helpful for the vast majority. And in fact, whatever treatment program you can name helps approximately the same percentage. Can you define what you mean by work? Let's just do it this way, that the individual feels that they are no longer suffering from their problematic drug-taking behaviors. Because we're not going to call total abstinence the end result, even though that's what 12-step considers to be the only successful result in the end. Oh, okay, so wait, hold on. Right, so if we use the criteria of the program itself as in like working means that you are not using, if that is the criteria, which I'm not sure if it is, then you could say it's not working. Well, even that criteria, absolutely, it's not working. But to be able to help a drug user stay alive and no longer have the negative consequences of their behaviors happening, that would be what we would call successful. And that could be moderation, no longer feeling the compulsion to use too much too often. Anthony Bourdain committed suicide, right? They remember him? Yes, of course. And he had a problem in his 20s with heroin and he kills himself whatever 30 years, 40 years later. And because people knew about his problem in the 20s, they immediately jump on this notion, oh, well, maybe he was using drugs and the toxicology reports came back. No, he wasn't using drugs, right? And he would drink alcohol on his show socially. It didn't seem like he had a problem with alcohol, but there was a lot of the 12-steppers that would come out and criticize him and even see things in his drinking on his show that weren't there, right? Because they are steeped in the abstinence-only model. But the fact is, the vast majority of people that recover from addiction do not become totally abstinent. They are able to partake in the substances that at one point in their past, they had a problem with. The vast majority. Wow, okay, I got you, I got you. Okay, cool, that makes a lot of sense. That's cool, that's cool, man. But again, it's like, man, I have met people, alcoholics in particular, who, like, they can't. Alcohol is very interesting and I think our entire addiction treatment kind of paradigm began with alcohol. Certainly 12-step grew out of alcohol, right? Alcohol is different in a lot of ways than other drug addictions because I think there is, particularly there is a certain type of alcoholic and I believe it's a genetic profile where they have the tiniest amount of alcohol. Boom, their personality changes completely. I used to live with one of them and they become helpless and dependent and like, it's like, you know, whether they've had half a beer because suddenly they're a different person. And for people like that, for that particular type of alcoholism, I think maybe total abstinence really is the only way to go. But that is, you don't see that kind of thing with most of the other drugs that people can get themselves addicted to. Yeah, okay, I got you. So it's like, you're talking about a more nuanced approach to this. It's like, let's not lump every single addict into the exact same category. There's genetic profiles connected to all these various addictions and because of that, there clearly are different treatment methods based individual to individual. I'll just tell you something about myself. In my 20s, I had a meth habit last nine months and I actually went to NA afterwards and I loved NA. I loved it. I didn't do the 12 steps because I didn't really need to, but I understood what narcotics anonymous was all about and I became a big proponent of it. Because I think it does help a lot of people. Very, very pure organization. No bullshit in that organization, at least if people are going voluntarily because court appointed 12 step just fucks with the entire 12 step. You're being forced to go there. Yeah, so I just say it only works for a small percentage of people and we need to include harm reduction based treatment protocols as well. Or maybe revise our definition of working. In other words, like it's like, again, it gets back. I have a spiritual belief that allows me to say I don't have control. I don't think I have control over anything in my life. And in fact, my meth addiction really drove that home for me when I was unable to stop using meth. I had to leave the city I was living in order to quit. Thank goodness it wasn't for very long. It was only nine months, right? But that made me realize I'm just a sock puppet with the universe's tentacles inside me moving me around. Even the activism I do, everything that I think I take credit for, that's just nature doing its thing. And so I was able to accept the admit that you're powerless kind of thing because it didn't make me feel more shame. But for a lot of people that surrender to a higher power, the admit that you're powerless over your addiction, etc. That it's a permanent thing that's going to be with you the rest of your life and therefore total absence is the only way to go. A lot of people, most people, the vast majority can't accept that and it actually locks them into a low self-esteem and addictive drug taking behaviors. Whereas if you let them feel that they're more powerful and they can manage it, even if on a spiritual level you and I will think, well, you know, you really don't have power. That actually helps other people. Yeah, yeah. And maybe if we begin, maybe another problem of this viewpoint on addiction is that people who are deeply and profoundly addicted to things that aren't chemicals are completely in denial. And so people who aren't, who are just stone cold sober people who find their attention grabbed inexorably by a relationship, by a career, by a fixation on their thought patterns, by any number of things. What's the number one leading cause of death in teenagers from driving? Do you know? The cause of car accidents? Yeah. Drinking? I don't know. Texting, yeah, texting, yeah. Yeah, so there you have an example of another addiction, which is that people are, their attention has been grabbed by their phones and their attention has been grabbed by the desire to constantly communicate with people. Right. They're driving and this is causing deaths all over the fucking place. So those many, many people who are fixated on their phones don't consider themselves to be addicts. They just think of themselves as living a normal life and doing what's necessary to efficiently run their business. They don't realize that, and many people who are working all day long don't realize that they're addicted to that. And many people who are completely grabbed by the universe's sticky and hypnotic aspect of being able to numb and nullify ourselves by ignoring something within us don't know it. And so you watch TV like, man, I'm glad I'm not addicted to math. And you've just been watching fucking Sean Hannity. You've, you know what I mean? You've just been watching, you've been like sitting in front of your TV. Well, so you've touched on a really important point here because I think, you know, what drives the drug war other than the money and the corruption of politicians, intelligence agencies, corporations, you know, we got to understand this little tangent here. There is no commodity that is traded in such a high value amount in the world more than drugs, except for one. And that's oil. It goes oil, drugs. And by drugs, I mean just cocaine and heroin, right? Just those two. And then armaments. And you realize how much money, illegal tax-free money is being made, that it's second only to oil. And it's being laundered through major banks, major multinationals. That corruption is really the elephant in the living room. I just wanted to put that out there. But the justification, the reason that the general public has such a hard time letting go of the drug warrior inside themselves is because it serves as the perfect scapegoat that we realize about ourselves but don't want to recognize. And that is we all over consume. We live in a society that tells us to gratify our desires instantly all the time. And the greatest motivator of human behavior is shame. And so to offload our shame, to feel better about ourselves, we take what we don't like about ourselves and we project it onto what we consider the extreme version of that. The addict or the drug user. We say, at least I'm not them. Yeah, sure. Why do we over consume? We're trying to relieve our suffering in the wrong ways. Yeah. But do you think you could go a little deeper into that? Why does a person feel drawn to this thing or that thing? Well, so, you know, I don't know if you got the last email I sent you before I arrived here today, but I said, hey, remind me to tell you why I think artificial intelligence, generalized AI, sentient AI is never going to happen. Will you tell me why sentient AI is never going to happen? Yeah, I will. And I think it speaks to this conversation we're having right now because, you know, current artificial intelligence is really just pattern recognition. The kind of machine learning and neural networks that we have, we've been able to program that can, you know, win the game of go. I'm a go player, right? Google's DeepMind AlphaGo is incredible, right? So we've made great strides in artificial intelligence, but it's not sentient. And the reason is because in order to learn, you have to have desire. Intelligence emerges from desire and desire is primary. The baby is born and if it didn't have any desires, it would never learn. But it learns when it cries, mom feeds it and it starts to develop an intelligence that it knows how to manipulate its world. It all begins because it had a desire. Desire is fundamental to the universe, this avoidance of pain moving towards pleasure or contentment or happiness and avoiding what we don't like. It's integral into the universe. We are all, we are born from it. And I think, does that answer your question? You asked why do we seek to pleasure and to avoid? You can't answer that except to me, except to say that that's the nature of the universe. And the spiritual teachings are about how we can get out of that trap, right? Yeah, but to get out of the trap, I think we need to understand the nature of the trap. So though I do in some way agree with you, the answer is that is the nature of the universe. I think then the next step would be, well, let's start looking at what is the nature of the universe. And then maybe from that, we can start understanding what kind of trap we're in here. And so let's look at that. You know, a baby has some desire as hungry cries gets milk and that satiates temporarily the baby's hunger. So the baby gets to survive now because the baby's gotten milk, right? But most people I know who are experiencing the incessant sobbing of an internal baby living inside their head. They're not looking for anything that's causing them to necessarily survive as much as a way to like do something in the moment. So it's like a book, a movie, you name it, a cigarette, whatever it may be. Well, boredom is really the perfect illustration that we live in suffering. We can't even sit still with ourselves. We suffer just sitting still. Yes. Yeah. And that right there. So to me, like I think a thing worthy of exploration would be to ask yourself if the milk that you're giving the baby in your brain is actually making the baby stop crying. Or have you done what I've heard really rotten parents do, which is when the baby starts crying, they just turn the stereo up louder than the fucking baby crying. The baby's still crying. You just can't hear it because now you're listening to Led Zeppelin 4 at 10 on your fucking volume or 11 if your spinal tap. And so in this, you know what I mean? Big babies. Yeah, right, right. So here, let's get into that, man, which is that it's like if the problem in the world is addiction, which I think it is. I mean, if you were to like look at the United States as an individual and realize that for 93% of this individual's life, it had been engaging in the use of a really, really, really, really dangerous drug war. And you were to say, man, you were to sit down and do an intervention with the United States. And you'd be like, listen, I know you think this is working, but people really don't like you right now. It's causing a lot of problems in your social circles. And it's really, really getting in the way of you experiencing what you were born for. Then you would find, oh my God, this is this thing we call war is in fact another flower off of the very same tree. And what is, what are the roots of this? And potentially if we can discover the roots of that, then maybe we could start reducing these massive fucking horrific flowers that look like flowers. They look like people being blown up, people being thrown in jail, fathers and mothers ignoring their children. Well, what's interesting to me is that I think one of the best tools that we have to enlighten us about all this happens to be a drug. What's that? MDMA. MDMA is in its phase three trials through the FDA right now as a treatment for PTSD. It has this very mysterious ability to heal unresolved trauma in conjunction with psychotherapy. You have to use it with intention. And to the degree that war and certainly the drug war, as I just explained, the scapegoating process is largely from our unresolved trauma. What we don't like about ourselves, the shame that we feel that we project on others, the greed that we want more, the jealousy that we have all these things come largely from unresolved trauma. We don't have to get into the psychopath conversation, whether they're born that way or not, because maybe even that trauma is inherited, right? Because like you, I think, I believe in the transmigration of the soul. So maybe it won't work for psychopaths, but for most of us, going deep with the help of a substance like MDMA can help us heal. And then, you know, I had one of my podcast episodes is called Is the Military Trying to Weaponize MDMA? Because a lot of people are really skeptical about MDMA therapy for veterans. They think, oh, you're going to heal these veterans and then they're going to just put them back into wars. It's going to become a tool of oppression and empire building. And my position is, no, it doesn't work that way because part of the trauma that veterans suffer is the knowledge that they went over there and killed innocent people based on a lie. And they can't, because PTSD is largely a moral crisis. It's an identity crisis where you've interpreted your trauma in a way that you blame yourselves. And then when, so when you heal that, there's no way they're going to go back there and engage in the same evil destructive behaviors that they did previously. Because the healing process itself is about acknowledging and recognizing that you're a good person and you wouldn't do something like that. So that the healing process is about recognizing that you're a good person. And I think that that right there, I think that's one of the keys, which is that right now we recognize ourselves. And the way we recognize ourselves is as a person, right, good or bad. We just recognize ourselves like we, one of the products of being a human being is that you recognize yourself. When you look in the mirror, you see you. When my dog looks in the mirror, I'm not so sure, you know, but when we look in the mirror, we see an eye. Oh, there's Emmanuel. Oh, there's Duncan. There's me, right? So we recognize ourselves. And when we recognize ourselves, it doesn't stop there. Does it? When we recognize ourselves, it's generally followed by a lot of other shit. Oh my God, you look old as fuck. Oh my God, you look tired. Oh my God, you're getting fat. Oh my God, you're getting fat. Oh my God, look at that fucking zit. Oh my God. Or if we're not looking in the mirror and we're looking in the fun house mirror of our own minds, then we think, oh Jesus Christ, I can't fucking believe I said that to that girl last. What the fuck was I thinking? Oh my God, why did I send that text? Why did I send that fucking email? Why did that person do that to me? Right. And if you recognize yourself, if there's a moment where somehow in the recognition of the self, you go, that's okay. Right there. A lot of the shit that you've been doing that's been causing all kinds of harm in the world and harm to yourself. It's probably going to, it's probably going to change a little bit. Right, right. But how do we get to that point is the question. How do not just through MDMA or therapy, what is the question would be this? Is there something that is not connected to transitory phenomena in the world? Yeah, well, I think ultimately there is no self, right? You know, MDMA and having even better than that, having good parents that raise you well can produce a healthy ego. A healthy ego. And the West is very good at producing. Western psychology is based upon trying to produce healthy egos. And I think this is one of the reasons why MDMA is becoming legalized because here in the United States, right, the Westernist country, the pinnacle of Western progressivism, right? Despite Trump now, because everyone is recognizing its value in that way. But the East then takes the healthy ego a bit farther into the transpersonal realms. And there is a whole field of transpersonal psychology. But to get there and then the more classic psychedelics tend to take us there, right? MDMA can raise us up and give us a healthy ego. And then we've got LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT that can produce, not always, but can produce these transcendental experiences where we realize, well, one of the classic ones is, we're all one. Wow, we're all one. What does that mean for you as a person to think we're all one, right? Like the deepest part inside of me is the same as the deepest part inside of you. That recognition should entail simultaneously a recognition that everything you think you are that separate from everyone else is just transitory, including your mind, your body, your pimple, et cetera, and your thoughts, everything that I can claim credit for. Like I said earlier, it's just nature doing its thing. I am really just this pure consciousness that's the same in everyone else. That's scary for some people because to believe that because we are attached to our unique sense of separateness, uniqueness from others, et cetera. Also, you're going to like, when you hear a thing like that, it's easy to get really confused by hearing a thing like that, because when you hear a thing like that and you haven't necessarily experienced a thing like that, or if you have experienced a thing like that, it's been in the midst of like a hardcore psychedelic moment that has then caught, like, you know, I can think of many, many, many, many of these experiences with psychedelics. Were they difficult? What? Were they difficult for you? Oh, no, absolutely not. The difficult part is the transitory period in between the merging with the universe. It's the place where the ego tries very, very tries a million different tricks to not be, to not become what we are. And so somewhere in there, there can be like something very similar to a yoga stretch that is maybe that is challenging you and it hurts. And it can be really scary. And if you get stuck right in front of that place, then you can have a very challenging psychedelic experience. But the moment you pop past that into that, this place, then suddenly you have, that's where people have these very healing experiences, I would, I think. And I think MDMA is a really wonderful route to talk about this, because I have a personal experience with healing trauma through MDMA, which is that, and this was way before any of this research was publicly available. And I can remember being on MDMA and getting lucky enough to begin thinking about how much I hated myself. You know, I got lucky enough to be able to summon up to recognize myself, so to speak, as an ego and to look at the ego from the lens of MDMA, rather than from the lens that I had been looking at myself in the entire world through, which is a lens constructed through a combination of genetics, experience. The amygdala. The amygdala, but not just the amygdala, the language system, the story system, the story we tell ourselves. And so in that moment, from this incredible rush of love and deep empathy for everything, I was able to experience myself within that field. And within that, I was able to love myself for the first time, maybe since I was a kid. That's what all of the Phase 2 participants told me when I interviewed them for my documentary. There's this classic mechanism of action for MDMA that you hear a scientist talk about where it shuts down the amygdala, where the fear center of our brain is, and increases activity in the forebrain where we can make new thoughts, put things in context, and you hold that space for five, six hours with a therapist and talk about your traumatic experience. It creates new neural pathways. And then even when you're not on the drug now, when you remember the traumatic incident, it doesn't activate the amygdala anymore because you've spent so much time developing these neural pathways. That's the classic mechanism of action. But when you speak to all of the subjects who went through the study, what they will tell you is exactly what you said. I forgave myself. I realized I like myself because PTSD is a moral crisis, like I said. It only happens when it affects your sense of self. That's right. And MDMA has this amazing, beautiful, miraculous, nobody understands why ability to produce self-appreciation and self-love. And then, of course, that includes empathy and love for others because we all are only one self. I disagree with the idea that nobody understands why. I think maybe from a scientific materialist perspective, there's some questions regarding the functioning of the sensory apparatus in general just because we don't have the technology yet to fully map what's going on in there. But it gets back to this idea, which is, is there a state that is not affected by phenomena? And where we run into some problems, not just with MDMA, LSD, alcohol, TV, movies, relationships, orgasm, is that this thing happens sometimes in a person's life where suddenly they experience that MDMA sense of universal love. This feeling of, oh my God, I'm okay with all the flaws and all I've done. I was just doing my best. And then maybe in that moment I'm MDMA, you have this flash where you realize, wait, if I'm okay and I was just doing my best, then the people that were hurting me theoretically at some level are okay too. And then you start thinking, wait a minute, I think everything is perfect. Right. And it's a flash. Yeah. And then cut to next Wednesday. You look back and refer to that and you still feel way better than you did because you at least have been given a very temporary, how would you say, vacation from the gravity well of your own self loathing. Right. Then cut to the week after or the week after or maybe even not so long after the event. You so loved that experience that you're going to try to get it again. And this is where we run into addiction. And so now what I'm doing is I'm telling myself that this experience that I've had is based on external phenomena. Yep. What I think is the root of the problem that leads to war is because people are always going to this thing or that thing to try to get to a place that they already are. And through this sort of never ending furious attempt to get to that point, we end up completely not being in that point. And in that point, I think is what we actually are. I fully agree. Fortunately, you can't take MDMA every day. It just won't work. So it's got kind of a built in anti addiction mechanism in that regard. But I think if you could feel that every day, people would get addicted to it, obviously. But I also think most people actually learn the lesson that you're talking about, right? The euphoria and the inner peace that MDMA and other substances can produce for people. They recognize that's a temporary phenomenon. And everyone thinks, wow, how can I cultivate that more in my own life? Because they don't go immediately. Most people don't become addicted to any drug. They just don't. There's a moderation effect that's just normal and we get it. But it stimulates people's thought process like it did you. And perhaps psychedelics in your life have led you to become a spiritual thinker like they have for me. And that's a good thing. The answer, or I'm never going to pretend to know the answer. But one way of exploring it is that that state is always among us, even as emotions and activity. It's like the white screen that the movies project on. It's always there. And drugs can kind of snap our brain out of the habitual thoughts and emotions and feelings that allow us to see, oh, there's a purity behind this. That purity, that peace exists even in a battlefield of war. It's always there. And is there something that's the same about us that's not transitory? I've always thought of it this way from the teachings of spiritual masters that I've read. When you reach that state in meditation, first thing you stop identifying with your body, right? Feeling a little itch is one of the first things I remember when I say, God, that itch is over there. I'm not going to focus on that. Then it's like your thoughts, okay, I don't want to focus on my thoughts. I just want to kind of be present and feel my real self. All these thoughts keep coming up. Where do those thoughts keep coming from? It's not me. I realize that's not me because I don't want that thought. I'm trying to get rid of them, but it keeps on coming. That's not me. And you get to this state where I've been able to do for a minute at a time where it feels like, wow, no thoughts coming through my mind at all. Like, oh, I'm really meditating well now, right? Stensibly, you get to this place where you've totally disidentified with your body, with your mind, even with your emotions, but you still feel that you're there. You're still there. You're feeling your pure consciousness. If at that moment someone came behind you and put a bullet through your head, you wouldn't even notice. You would just stay right there feeling yourself. Because that pure, real thing that you are is not connected with your body or your mind. It's the entire universe. What is? Yeah. You like that one, huh? Yeah. Yeah, me too. That was good. And that is, I think, where some confusion happens so that people think, oh, well, to get there, I need to meditate. And now we're in the same predicament, aren't we? Getting addicted to meditation. No, we're getting addicted to the idea that that state is not a fundamental state, that that is actually what we are. And so now we're like, okay, by meditating, I'll get to this place. By meditating, I'll get to this place. And so now, even though, and that's great, by the way, that's okay. Whatever reason you have for sitting still, or more importantly, whatever reason you have for remembering who you actually are, it's a great reason, if you ask me. If the reason is because you want to radiate some love, if the reason is because you want to, like, become a rock star. If the reason is because you want to potentially levitate or teleport or read people's minds. Whatever the thing is to me, the many, many, many complex and very interesting intentionalities that lead to a person relieving themselves of the amnesia that comes from having a highly complex nervous system that has manufactured an identity and a past, present, and future, and has manufactured a sense that we are separate, I'm all for it. It seems like as we go down these winding paths, the paths get a little wider. We end up meeting people from other paths, like, oh, hey, where were you? Oh, man, I was on the LSD path. And then you run into, like, hey, where were you? I was on the path of sorcery. I was studying magic. And you run into somebody else and you're like, where the hell were you? And they're like, oh, I was trying to be powerful. I was trying to be a powerful boss. I was trying to get myself into a flow state so that I could make more money. And you're like, oh, cool. All right, well, let's all walk together for a little while. And then as you walk down that path, it begins to widen a little bit more. And you look over and it's like, whoa, there's a monk here. And then you look over and you're like, whoa, there's a shaman here. And you look over and then those people, they begin to like kind of help you refine. And then suddenly you end up at a moment where you're all the same person walking down the very same path, except it wasn't a path. You've become what you actually are. And you realize this isn't dependent anymore on some shift in this thing or that. And that, to me, whatever way you have to get there, it's great. And one of the things I love about your perspective on substances in particular is it has that taste to me, which is like shit, man, it's all the same thing here, man. This is all the same. Oh, yeah, right. You know, that brings up something interesting, you know, this debate of whether or not drug experiences are real, right? Oh, that was just a drug experience. A lot of people poo poo psychedelics because like you're hallucinating. Like whatever's happening to you is not, is not real. You know, well, in the West, we have a very different definition of real than what they have in the East. In the West, real means occupying a location in space and time. Right? This teddy bear that Teddy bear I brought is real because there it is important to blah, blah, blah. And like say, you know, if you have hallucinations when you think something is occupying a space and time and place and it's not really there, right? And that's a little strange. In the East, real is that which has always existed, that which never had a beginning nor an end. If something came into existence and then left, how can it be real? And of course, that's all phenomena. Everything has a beginning and end that we can see. Yeah. And so to them, the only thing that's real is consciousness. It's the one consciousness. And so, you know, when I say to people, you know, hey, you know, I smoked DMT and I met these beings. Oh, that's not real. That's just hallucination. I'm like, it's as real as what I'm experiencing right now. I've learned from them. I talked to them. They talked to me. You know, am I saying they existed on a planet over there? I have no idea where they are, but the experience, all experiences as real as anything else, which isn't real, but it's all part of phenomena. That's one of the funniest things when someone does that trick, because when you report something and a person comes back to you with no, no, no, that was an illusion. And the thing telling you it was an illusion is an illusion. It's like going to the DMT realm and one of these beings and you're like, hey, you know, there's a whole other universe out there. And that being was like, yeah, that's a bunch of shit over there. That's not real. This is where it's really at. Right. But then it's just two sides of the very same Mandala and saying that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's why I'm not into this whole, the universe is a simulation, right? That we are actually a simulation of another higher beings that have created us. I think this is like the way that in our modern world, we were trying to come up with an explanation for these psychedelic experiences that we have that doesn't seem woo-woo to us, right? Because we're developing artificial intelligence now. We have this idea that we're going to, you know, we have computers. We have little worlds that we can create and maybe wear that world. And maybe like when you smoke DMT, these beings are from the world that has created us. And we're just, you know, computer avatars in their world, right? And the problem with that theory is that it can easily, logically lead to an infinite regress. Well, those beings may be a simulation of beings higher than them and then it can go on forever and ever and ever. It's much simpler to say that there's an infinite amount of beings everywhere on every level. We're all just consciousness playing itself out. And the only thing that's real is consciousness. It's not that those beings are real and that we're not real, right? Like, well, what if they're not real too, right? Well, this is a ridiculous question for you, but it's just a fun question to ask. What if I told you, and again, this isn't like I'm alluding to something or I believe it, it's just a fun like thought experiment, but let's imagine that I told you, you are in a simulator, you're in a simulator, you're in a universe simulating machine and beings in this universe simulating machine are really adverse to that idea for some reason or another, but you are in one. Well, how would your life change after that? How would you start behaving differently? Well, you know, if I didn't have a perspective that everything is just an illusion anyway, I might start thinking along the lines of the matrix. Oh, I got to take that red pill. I got to escape. I got to get to the place that is real, right? And that's where I think the trick is. There's no place that's real, but yet there's an element of truth in the movie, The Matrix, that this is all an illusion, but we still cling. We still want to think that there's something real that we have a self in the pod that we can escape from and go on an adventure and kill the aliens. Then that's finally real. None of it's real. Okay. That's funny. Right. You're right. It's like, yeah, okay, sure. Yeah. It's like a never ending. Again, we're back in the exact same thing, aren't we? Which is that we're trying to get from one point to another with this idea that it's going to help as an antidote to this problem. When the problem itself is the problem that we've identified as being real, permanent, continuous, and that is causing all of the suffering. So yeah, that's to me is like something that's really amazing to think about is that what, just a fun question would be, what if you didn't need, and I don't mean in a boring party pooper way, that as I used to interpret it when you'd hear people say this, what is what if you didn't need anything? What if right now, even if you don't believe it, even if you're not feeling it or thinking it, you are that place. What if that was true and true and if that, and what if that was the only true thing? Wow, man. That there's some something within that. I think that would as far as like I'm concerned, if that, if that was what I thought, I imagine that it would probably reduce a lot of the bullshit that I was doing in the world. Well, what they say is then you would be free, right? But they also say we all are free. That the process is just to realize that it's sort of moving the veil that we're actually not free. Our bondage is only an illusion also. But what we want to do is be and feel and know that we're free. How do you do that? Yeah. Well, there's many, many ways that there's prescriptions have been given to us from the ancient days through various forms of yoga, meditation. Ambient. Right. MDMA, LSD. Right. You know, I tend to think that meditation is the way to go in the end, right? We can get peak experiences in the PEEK through drugs, right? Well, you get a little peak. It's like, look at that. Oh, wow. Yeah. Then we're right back in our body. And you know, maybe there's some healing and we change solely over time through the use of psychedelics. Obviously, that's true. But I don't think most of us are going to become fully free, self-realized simply through the use of psychedelics. And although it can happen instantly for unknown reasons to anyone, I think. But I think that the recipes we've been given over the ages by people who at least claim they've gotten there tend to all point towards meditation and not acting selfishly, right? Going against the current of what our body and mind wants to do. There is a great phrase that one spiritual master said that I read is, every day, do one thing your mind doesn't want to do and don't do one thing your mind does want to do. And that's just a great way to start the process of becoming free. You know, realize that you don't have to do what your inclinations and your body and your feelings and sit, in other words, sit with your suffering and accept your suffering because suffering is love. Yes. But what a high level thing that is, you know, to that point that you so beautifully just made there is for a lot of people when they hear suffering, they have different ideas of it. They think of it like the feeling when you burn your hand or something like that. They don't they don't realize it's not the feeling when you burn your hand. It's all the feeling feelings following when you burn, all the thoughts falling, the recursive thoughts falling when you burnt your hand. And but to get to this idea of suffering, one thing that I heard that used to drive me up the fucking wall about suffering is that many of these teachers would say, you're not going to fix it. Give up that idea, this idea that like give up the idea that this thing that you think is fixable is fixable in the way you think it is. It's not. It's a fundamental state. Right. And then, then suddenly, if you just for a second, and this is what I love about what you're saying in particular in a relation to chemicals, like imagine if just for a second, no matter what activity you may happen to be engaged in at this very moment, whatever it may be, that's perfect. That's perfect right there, including the grief, including the suffering. So when, so in other words, when I'm like, so for me, if I'm like, Oh God, I feel so bad. And this has now happened with my teachers. After my dad died in particular, I had this wonderful moment with one of my teachers on the phone where I'm like, I'm crying on the phone and I say, I feel so terrible. I feel so sad. I feel so bad. I am so unhappy. And he said, you're going to feel that way. And that's it. There wasn't a, and then, right now do this, now do that, it was, this is where you're at. And in that, I stopped trying to evade it. I stopped trying to escape it. I stopped trying to get out of it. And maybe you felt bad with a little less suffering. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. That's it. But listen, in the same way my trainer, when I was going to the gym a long time ago, before I hurt my back, I'd like to return it in the same way my trainer taught me how to do pull-ups by like applying all these embarrassing straps to my body so I could do pull-ups. Psychedelics can function in a similar way, which is that or drugs or whatever it may be, for me it's psychedelics. These can be at least kind of like intermediary tools and like, you know, when you go do yoga, well at least if you're me, and you go do yoga and the yoga teacher will come and give you like 17 embarrassing like odd cushions and shit so that you can get into the poses and you're like humiliated because like you're looking at people who are as like bendy as a fucking rubber band who are like in their 80s and they're having to use like carpets and shit to like prop your body up to do downward dog. But over time, the props kind of naturally, you're like, I don't need it anymore. I'm already limber, you know, I could already do that. The props start naturally falling away, you know. So to me, this is like what the psychedelic pathway, one part of it is. And that's not to say that it's something you can really trick yourself because at some point you can either start thinking that you can start thinking one thing or the other regarding psychedelics. You can start thinking, man, I've been doing this too long. I don't need this anymore. And now you're shaming yourself and you're all like, you know, you're all or you could start thinking like, I'm not going to do this anymore because it's bad. And then you stop and you're shaming yourself in a different way. Whereas I think potentially maybe what might happen is these things you just naturally stop thinking about them. You stop wanting to go for your phone. You stop wanting to go on Reddit. You stop wanting to go on Drudge Report. Because why? Because why? Because the reason is you were going there in the hopes of experiencing this flickering state and now you've found it everywhere. I think that would be my theory. Yeah. That's, you know, how that resonates with me most is in terms of activism and making the world a better place because that's been my path, right? I've always, you know, since I was a teenager, been an activist, right? I was anti-nuclear activist when I was 16 and just, you know, now I'm trying to change drug policy, et cetera, right? And you know, it all really comes from my relationship with my father. I was just in this workshop. My stepdaughter has been doing it for years and that's why I'm carrying this teddy bear around by the way. I went through level one. It's called Global Harmony in Sacramento and it's very interesting. I got closer to my stepdaughter and I have to carry this around until level two. That's, you know, so. You have to carry a multicolored bear around with you? Yeah. I have to carry it around for the next couple of weeks until I go to level two. But if you check to see if there's any bugs in there. Well, I got to choose it out of a whole big room full of teddy bears and, you know, I picked the one that looks. But I mean, if you look to see if there's a recording device in there. Oh, and I feel something right there. Why do you have to carry that around? Tell me why. You know, I don't know. I think the part of this was like getting in touch with your inner child. And I think they also want you to come back to level two. But and so this is a reminder. If you carry around with you, you're not going to forget to come back to the next level. I'm not going to forget because I'm going with my stepdaughter who, you know, really wants to. What's it called? Global Harmony. Yeah, it's a local. It's in Sacramento. But in any case, in this, we're talking about like the go into your relationship with your father and my father was abusive. And that's why I feel lucky that I was introduced to MDMA as a teenager because it helped me to heal from that. You know, but I also realized that my activism began sort of as this rebellious state, I happened to meet these Quakers who got me into anti-war activism. And I was able to channel my anger against my father into something more productive. Right. And so then, you know, it's been like, I want to change the world. I want to make the world a better place. And through my lifelong process of, you know, healing, and I have come to realize that the abuse that I suffered as a child from my father was the greatest gift I could have ever had because I have more empathy now for the suffering in the world. People who have had great childhoods and never experienced suffering, your proverbial wealthy people who are insensitive, you know, they may lack something. They may be more spiritually challenged. And I was able to fully forgive my father. And it was horrific. I don't want to go into all the details. But I was with him at his bedside when he passed away. I took care of him for the last year of his life. I always protected myself from him. You needed to because he was that kind of person. But I ended up fully forgiving and fully loving him precisely because of what I feel that he gave me. And when I translate that to the real world, and this activist hate hearing this, you know, this whole notion of like, everything's perfect. Right. The war in Iraq is perfect. Terrorism is perfect. Donald Trump is perfect. Right. The evil in the world is there to get our souls on the path towards love. You can't even imagine a perfect world. Why try? If it was a perfect world, there was no there'd be no love. Also, because you can only understand things in relation to their opposites. Yeah. So everything that's happening is perfect. It's all here for a reason. It doesn't mean I've stopped being an activist. You still do it. You still try to relieve suffering, even though you realize that suffering is a necessity to help people approach and realize love. I think that theoretically, that if you wanted to be an activist and make things better, then my guess would be that you're going to do a better job if you have found a way to love yourself and to forgive your parents. And when I throw my mind into the big picture events, it can be a little confusing and my mind can get grabbed into a kind of state of hopelessness. So and what I've been taught is that though, certainly we don't want to stick our heads in the sand and ignore the truth of the horrific tragedies that are happening all over the world and use something called spiritual bypass to avoid confrontation with this. But because these big, big, big problems are going to require, as in the climate change report that just came out, an unprecedented shift. And the way humans are living, then that means that we have to start with ourselves first and then as we're working on ourselves, continue a thing that was initially fueled by anger. Because in the same way, when I was talking about that weird thing where there's all these kinds of paths that lead to broader paths, I think it's similar with activism. So many people start off fucking pissed off. So many people start off just wanting to seem cool. Yeah, wanting to seem like good people. So many people have all these crazy reasons at the beginning of it. And then as they progress, they begin to realize, oh, wait, we're all here for the same reason. And then the fights that happen between activists, when you're kind of far out in this strange mandala, they stop happening. Because now we're getting closer and closer to the real truth, which is that we want to connect or to remember who we really are, what we really are. Because what we really are is fundamentally good. I have never in my fucking life heard anybody criticize a rose. Yeah, I've never heard anybody be like, I tell you, roses suck roses. Oh my God. Who does that rose think he is? Look at that rose. Look at that rose. Clearly that rose is putting on a show of being that colorful. It's not really that colorful. Look how wilted that rose is. My God. How is that rose wilting in such great environments? Have you ever seen such a shitty fucking rose? Did you hear about the rose? That rose is never. And yet humans are identical. We are nature. We're part of nature. And yet we criticize and hate ourselves. So to me, it's a beautiful thing that you're saying, which is like, man, on one level, everything's perfect. On another level, somebody's house is on fire. Fucking house is on fire. I'm not going to be like, hey, that's perfect, dude. Someone's in prison because they smoke cannabis. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think that there's some weird synchronicity between the two forms of activism. I think you could almost say that self-remembering is a form of activism. That sure, the ultimate, the ultimate form of activism. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because you know what happens if you keep engaging in activism and you don't bring in that spiritual perspective? What Stalin, the Khmer Rouge, you know, these horrifying, you know, put your enemy against the wall and shoot them all. And the most, the dictatorial dictatorships on the planet have all come from the best of intentions originally, but not the ultimate one that you're talking about, the cultivation of humility and the remembering who you are, right? We need to learn to see our perceived enemies as potential allies always. That's not to say there isn't going to come a time where we have to fight. You know, we will. And it's unfortunately seeming to be more likely the case that we're going to have to fight in this country, too. I, you know, pray it's not going to have any time soon. But even as we do that, we can come at it from a different perspective. This is the whole point of the Bhagavad Gita, by the way, the great Hindu spiritual text, Arjuna, is on the battlefield about to go to war with the other clan. And there are relatives of his on the other side and he gets dejected. And then Krishna gives this speech to him, which is called the Bhagavad Gita about how you should go to war anyway, but do it from a place of detachment and remembrance. You can't control the situation. You need to participate. It was a just war. It was a just war. It's not saying that, you know, so I'm not saying therefore I'm that, you know, say Iraq or Afghanistan that should stay and fight, right? You know, the war that we're fighting is the war to end the wars in Afghanistan. So we keep doing that. We keep keep on fighting, but just, you know, be an activist, but do it from a place of detachment where you aren't desperate for the results. That's great. Yeah. Well, that is something in the Bhagavad Gita. You have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. Right. And, but I think, and I think, man, that the this is one of the things that pops up is popped up in my head. And it's a legitimate, valid point, which is like, you know, how do we deal with confrontation while simultaneously being compassionate? And it's a big, big question. And I think that the and it's a it's a good thing to have and think about. But let's, while thinking about this, keep getting back to this question, which is, what are we really? What are we? And if what we are is fundamentally good and we keep reconnecting with that memory that gets obscured or by their flickering, non-continuous self, then maybe the thing is we, the thing you're talking about, some potential conflict always there, not just in the United States, but in a personal level, always some potential conflict, always something that could be looming in the future, whatever it may be, always, always there. And then some would say inevitable in some form or fashion. And I think this is one of the reasons why people call meditation a practice. We're practicing so that when that thing comes, we can respond to it in a way that is nonviolent and loving because we've been practicing. And then when that happens, if you're somebody like me, who's been a big portion of our lives, reacting to confrontation with aggression in some form, even if the aggression was veiled as something as simple as an eye roll or a sarcastic remark or some very, very subtle form of aggression, high-roading, which I'm quite guilty of, or like producing an idea that my POV must be better than another's POV, or all the very, it gets very subtle. In fact, I imagine in some form or fashion, I'm doing it right now and I apologize. But it will, because it's, this is just like, it gets very refined, right? But if in the big, like, sort of overt mechanisms, we respond to confrontation from a place of being grounded in some fundamental good, you'll find that the way your fights happen is completely fucking different than the way they used to happen. I mean, on an interpersonal level. Right, right. You know, and that, and when you get into one of those kinds of fights, arguments, or whatever you want to call it, and you watch the way those fights go down, it's almost a game, it's playful, there's something in it that's like. And you know who I think is a testament to the success of this method on, you know, a larger macro scale? You know him? Who? Rick Doblin. Rick Doblin has been able to work with our perceived enemies to such a degree that they have come around now and are behind MDMA legalization in a way that nobody ever would have dreamed of. Even 20 years ago when I first met Rick, you know. I mean, I dreamed of it because I, you know, I was like, I hopeless positive belief systems. We're going to do it, you know. But you know, he, there's so many people out there right now who just think, you know, they don't want to work with the Trump administration. They don't want, you know, but they're never going to do it. You know, the way it was in my career as a harm reduction activist, I started reaching out to parents of kids who died at raves after they've taken fake ecstasy. Oh, and people told me at the time, you know, you're crazy. Those are going to be the most anti-drug people ever. They're going to like, you know, never going to work with you. And I found that to be not the case at all. I was nervous the first time, but all the parents that I've contacted, ended up becoming allies in harm reduction. Wow. Yeah. You know, so, so we, we need to perceive our, we need to realize our perceived enemies, our potential allies, and approach them as if they already are. Wow, man. Thank you so much for this conversation. I've learned so much from it. Will you please tell my listeners where they can find you and how they can help you and become your allies? Yeah. Well, you know, the thing I'm trying to point right now is my podcast called Drug Positive, and you know, it's on iTunes and everywhere else. We've got nine episodes. My wife is my co-host. It's really great because it's the first time we're really working so closely together on a project. And that's, that's awesome. And, you know, I don't bring too much of this spirituality discussion into it. It's mostly a harm reduction and activist or it's a drug policy reform podcast. We need it. But it's, it's entertaining. We're approaching a thousand listeners per episode now. So, man, I'm so lucky to get to hang out with you. And I'm so grateful for the work that you've been doing for so long out there. And I'm obviously exceedingly grateful to Rick Doblin. And, but I hope somewhere in the midst of your tireless effort to create a more rational relationship with substances that you give yourself a pat on the back here. You deserve it. And more, many of us are very grateful for your work. Thank you very much. Hare Krishna. Thank you so much for listening, everybody.

You are listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. I'm recording this episode not from my studio, but from home. I'm in a gritty basement breathing in gasoline fumes and surrounded by brick and it's fucking cold in here. So if you're a rustling, it's because I'm wearing a jacket. It feels like I should be reading a manifesto and eating MREs. Is that what they're called? MREs or MRIs? Regardless, we have a glorious episode of the podcast for you today. Nikki Walton is here with us. We're going to jump right into it, but first this. I want to thank Fields for supporting this episode of the DTFH. CBD isn't about what you feel. It's what you don't feel. Stress, anxiety, pain. I've been using CBD for a long time to deal with my occasional insomnia. It helps me relax. But the problem with a lot of CBD out there is that it tastes like you just squeezed a malarial elf's nose all over your tongue. It's bitter. But Fields CBD is like something from Frank Herbert's Dune. It's magical. It's like some kind of Tolkien-esque Lord of the Rings elfin tincture that you use. You put it under your tongue and you will start feeling the difference within minutes. It's amazing stuff that you're lucky to have CBD on this planet. It naturally helps reduce stress, anxiety, pain, sleeplessness, and even better, there's no hangover or addiction. Again, it helps me fall asleep. This stuff is amazing.

Thank you for being here. Thank you for having me. I'm so excited. I've been looking forward to this ever since it was scheduled. Yes. You know, I know you as a spiritual teacher and so I was surprised as I was researching you that actually have you help people with their hair. That was a previous incarnation as Ramdas would say and not too long ago I worked with Dr. Eyes on Air for many, many episodes helping people embrace their natural hair. I started in 08 because I hated my hair, started a website it went viral and helped black women like find their freedom through loving their hair and their skin and it started with my own self-hate. So I've been on like a journey for a long time and it started without her beauty then it went to inner beauty. I'm also a psychotherapist and now it's kind of transcended both. It's like transcending the self entirely. Well, I want to talk about to me and Ramdas has talked about and I don't remember which lecture it was from but I remember him talking about when he started his hair started thinning how much it flipped him out. Hair is important. I've got a bald spot. Oh, do I ever? And it, you know, so how do, like how, first of all what did you not like about your hair? What problems are you having with your hair? So I'm a black woman and I grew up in the United States where highly textured hair is not seen as beautiful or professional it's not appropriate and even the people around me, my own family members because they were trying to love me and help me were like you got to straighten your hair, get into the best schools, you know to get those jobs, you got to straighten your hair and I never had a relaxer. So my parents wouldn't allow the chemicals which two, three, four-year-olds were getting back in the day when I was, you know, grew up in the 80s and there were girls my age, my cousins had relaxers chemicals, like lie relaxers in their hair. Mine was straightened with a pressing comb but that's still very, it's harsh. It breaks your hair off, it burns your scalp it burns your ears, it's a whole thing you know, it was a part of my journey, a necessary part of my journey to be able to come to terms with hey, my hair doesn't grow this way naturally and I have to find a way to be okay with it the way it actually does grow out of my scalp. It's not a mistake that it's curly, it's not a mistake that it's super wavy let me work with it because up until 18, all I knew how to do was keep it straight. I didn't know how to like help it grow and flourish. I just knew how to not get it wet and like how to stay out of humidity and not to get in like convertibles or I didn't learn how to swim because of my hair. You know to this day I still don't exercise a lot just probably out of habit from not wanting to sweat not wanting to sweat my hair out you know but yeah it's like that was a huge part, huge part of my life growing up and the catalyst I believe for the present spiritual journey that I've been on for all these years. It look you know I totally see that. You know people reach out to me sometimes saying their hair is thinning and they're just you know they don't know what to do. Obviously it's a different reason for loathing your hair. I'm graying now though now I'm graying and I'm 38 and I'm probably like 50 or 60 percent gray. My family goes gray by like 30. That's a new thing. Are you coloring your hair? I henna. I've been henning my hair since I was 24 for the thickening and like the smoothing and gloriousness that the henna provides there but now I see like right now I have roots I'm looking at them you know I can see them. I would like to henna but I just with the kids and with my schedule I don't get time. So it is a new thing I do henna when I get time and I have not accepted the gray. My mother never dyed her hair. She is her hair silver and it's stunning and her face is young and it's a cool look. I will do it if I could go all white immediately like storm that would be dope but if I have to do that in between I don't think I can I don't think I can do it. Oh I know look I've got this gray I hate it I want to You were distinguished. Thank you. You know my wife will say that it's different from anything and I get what she said but still like once people have seen the gray and then you die. Yeah. What are you doing? You're not fully gone. Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah Did you know that Netflix actually has different content available to users depending on where they're located there's tens of thousands of shows but you only get access to a fraction of that it's really weird it's like going to a gym and only using being able to use the treadmill or something here's what's cool about the day sponsor ExpressVPN ExpressVPN

ExpressVPN.com to get an extra 3 months of ExpressVPN for free thank you ExpressVPN what do you think is the part of us that gets so upset about things like our hair going gray? the part of us that we have to see through the part of us that again started me on this journey which I've never felt comfortable in my own skin I've never felt a part of any group of any I've always had a million friends but I've always felt on the outside of everything people look like they're just having so much fun and get it and they got their stuff together and they love life and they're fully invested and I've always been like I'm watching life I'm watching Nikki and the further I got into my practice the more I learned I have been there is this place that's always witnessing and I think I've identified more with that than with this body this ego that doesn't like her graying hair and her new fine lines under her eyes I think that I've always identified with the witness of that more which is why I'm weird I've always been weird and I'm just embracing it now you know that's I just never would have thought of you as an outsider absolutely is it that we're all outsiders looking at each other being like gosh you're on the inside I'm on the outside is it even possible to be on the inside are we witnessing people putting on a very sophisticated show there's a part of me that felt like I was different all of this time but now I know it's all me so it's the first we're all on the outside watching, witnessing and when you are aware that you're the witness seeing it's like there's a light on here and there's a light on there and when you meet people where the light isn't fully on and on at all you're the catalyst for that light you're like lighting their flame and then it's like oh I'm not different I'm you too no one has their shit together no one does and it's like leaning into that leaning into the fear leaning into that discomfort that social awkwardness is what helps you see that it isn't actually not real only love is here you pray to God I pray to God when I am scared and when I am feeling pretty centered I just rest as that love I rest as that God as that love so when you're scared you're differentiating when I'm scared off of my throne, off of my center out of the witnessing position being nicky then I'm like God help me get through this looking at my Maharajie picture what do I need to do next give me a sign that kind of thing versus when I know that I'm the witness when I'm feeling love and I'm being loved there's no words necessary I don't look for signs I don't need confirmation I don't need to pray with words it's just a listening it's feeling that love and then write actions spring from there yes so it's both for me some days I'm like I am is God and then that's it I always know something's off when I'm consulting the tarot card on Instagram too on IG just swiping through waiting for it to refresh I'm like yeah I need to log off and go sit can you talk a little bit about how you practice mindfulness while simultaneously having a presence on the internet yeah I actually checked out of the internet for many years so 2013 was the height of my success with the curly, nicky, curly hair stuff and I was on I was on like today's show and Steve Harvey and you know Dr. Eyes and Harper Collins bestselling book and like all of these accolades and husband and house and nice car and healthy kid and big diamond like all the things in America you're supposed to have is supposed to make you happy and I was not happy at all and I'm also like I said I'm a licensed psychotherapist so I'm aware something is amiss, something is wrong you should be content but I was always waiting on something else to come along to make me happy and I was waiting for the internet even before Instagram got big I was a blogger so 2008, 2009 I'm posting lots of content every single day my child's life from like before she was even conceived all the way up until you know four or five years in people, my internet aunties you know sending diapers to my house and my PO box it was intense every birthday party I was not there I wasn't there there was something dope to happen so I could have something to write about to have something to take a picture of and I could feel I'm like none of this is not real this is not good and I knew I'm like I've got to do different stuff and I called Tracy Ellis Ross weeping into the phone crying and she's like you got to read better books better than the law of attraction books and I'm like okay cool and so she sent me down a path of like non-duality like 600, 1,000 books later and Ram Dass was one of the first people I found and actually ended back up at that teaching as well but today maintaining a presence is it's not what it used to be and I am not good at it because most of the time if I have a moment I choose to not log in and post a picture I probably haven't posted a picture in months but I will post some content sometimes I just it's challenging to walk that line to give enough of myself where people feel connected but to not over give where I'm thrown off center and looking at likes and you know wondering what people are thinking as opposed to staying in the knowing that they are me and I am them oh yeah that that feeling I don't know I'm sure you know what I'm talking about the gross feeling where you want to post something but you don't really have anything interesting you want to say but it's kind of like you're like I need it's been so long yeah I hate that feeling because I could I'll start formulating some clever bullshit and then it's like the whole time what am I doing this is not inspired this is neediness exactly the most recent post I did was I just came back from the retreat and it was powerful and half the people I met there were there because of you and this beautiful show I mean seriously I just started asking people how did you hear about it and your name would come up and retop about you and I have some questions about your chancing your Hare Krishna days I need to hear more about that because I got to share about mine oh great we need to chat about that that has to happen right in like in a minute but yeah I just I posted because I felt it necessary but it was also kind of inspired just to remind people that wherever you go you know there you are so whether it's you know Maui or back here in Florida because people kept saying Nicky are you going to be sad when it's time to go are you going to cry on the last day and a few years ago I probably would have been really sad like oh I have to leave this love behind but now I'm like I'm in where of this I am this love on the plane I am this in the car in the Uber on the way home I am this at home with my kids yelling you know it's all the same and it's dope and there's a really big permission slip to fill it when you're surrounded by people that are practicing and you know trying to be this love in their daily lives for everyone but we can be that no matter where we are yes that is right and may I add that okay I follow a lot of Instagram spiritual Instagram accounts that run the gamut of the world religions and also New Age stuff and some of them are so cloying but I follow them just because I want I like to see that the weird like a picture of the Buddha with something that the Buddha never said like you know work hard get revenge whatever they're putting but I have to say your account has been really inspiring to me I love when you post I love when you I love the energy you're putting out there and I think that as you're so good at simplifying these things in a very accessible way which is what I loved about Ram Dass so thank you for your account because to me there hasn't been anything on it that I've seen where I'm like really you know so I hope you I hope you do continue to find the balance but don't please don't don't leave us I know you know with this dude daily show that I'm doing it's every single day I record Monday through Sunday and I edit myself and so when I'm done with that which is like 4 a.m. until noon every day Monday through Sunday by that time I don't even want to promote the show on Instagram I'm like I'm just hoping that it promotes itself on Apple it's taxing but it's my practice like I chant I meditate I chant and then I go right into recording from that love and then I edit and it's like a puzzle because it's like 30 minutes of content that I cut down to 5 minutes and then I'm exhausted and then I have to switch to doing other things like you know job you know I work from home gig and being a mom it's a lot it's a lot going on so after when we're just only because it's going to be boring for us to talk about now but we've got to talk about some delegating you can't don't I used to edit my own podcast I used to do that I have a wonderful editor Aaron and he does it's just that the amount of time it takes so intimate though Duncan I want I try to give it to someone but it's like I know what I don't want on there I know what needs to be on there and I know like I need to whittle it down to the essence of the message without all of my shit in there right speaking of which I talked to KD Krishnadas during the retreat and I'm like hey this love practice has been great it's been many years now and it's never gone it's always or I can always turn to peace to love to God whatever you want to call it the I am presence source the vortex whatever you want to call it I can it's right there I said but all my shit still here too I'm like so tell me will that lesson will that decrease and he's like it's not yours and I'm like I do that and you've read that but it was powerful to hear that in that moment you know like whatever your fears or your anxieties you know they're not yours reclaiming them and then trying to figure out how to let go of them we just let go and let them whoa whoa he Krishnadas cut right through he just yeah he said things to me that are like that that I probably thought about every day since he said it so tell me about your experience with the Channing Heart Krishna with the Mahamantra yes so 2020 let's say March April Ragu you know him you hear now on that work we had a really dope conversation and he's like hey you should start a podcast with us and I'm like you know I don't even really know what podcasts are but I've got some friends that are very spiritual I'd love to chat with them on air so let's let's do it and so he sent me a Mala that I later found out had the thread from Maharajis Blanket and so I had chanted Ram before in years past and I just started doing that again during the day nothing formal just chanting you know while I'd be walking or while I'd be with the kids you know on my treadmill I don't do that anymore because that's not who I am as a person but just like generally whenever like just in life whenever I could remember I'd be chanting Ram and then I started listening to Krishna Das so by like July 2020 he replaced all of my music like every other musician was replaced and it was just Kyrton music all day all night period my kids hated and they kind of love it but they mostly hated so it was let's say October November I am watching some documentary about Ram Das Maharajis and Amazon Prime recommends the Hari Krishna documentary and I watch it and I had never heard of the Hari Krishna movement in my life and I did research more later and I'm not an organized religion or group kind of person so I could never be a part of it but I liked the strictness of like the regimen like you chant 16 rounds and you don't eat meat and you don't drink caffeine and you don't drink alcohol and you don't you know have relationships if you're not in it to like produce kids and I'm like that's very I needed all of those things in my life and I employed them November 28 2020 and I started chanting 16 rounds that morning and I live on the water and out back there's always dolphins but that morning after I chanted which took forever to do Hari Krishna mantra on every beat 108 beats 16 times around so it took me like about almost two hours so when I went out on the dock this dolphin a baby one came up like swam under me and looked up at me they never interact like that so I'm like oh that's a sign right and so then the next night I had a dream my first in I've only had two dreams where Neem Karoli Baba was featured in it and this was the first one and he was like laying across my desk like it was like a tuck it and he's looking at Prabhupada which is the guru for Hari Krishna in that mantra and so Prabhupada is chanting and he's completely unaware of me it's like he's in another dimension I can see him but he can't see me but Maharaj Ji Neem Karoli Baba can see me and he's smiling at me and he keeps looking at him and then looking back at me smiling and so I remember waking up the next day and I messaged Krishna Das and I'm like does that mean that's my mantra is that it and he's like yeah you know they love the Hari Krishna mantra it's a great one so that I've been chanting it I get up at 5 a.m. for my sanity I have two kids you know and I care for my parents and it's it's a lot and from 7 a.m. until 10 p.m. I'm Nikki or Curly Nikki but between 5 and 7 a.m. I can just be and that's the time that I started practicing and that within a month my whole life started changing and by like three or four months in everything was different my new podcast was born and it's my life is amazing and very center and it's like when I'm chanting it's like a contract it makes the silence so clear like you can always be aware of silence you can hear my voice right now you know you can hear your thoughts you can hear ambient sounds but there's a silence that none of that can touch and so when I'm chanting when I'm aware of this chanting happening it's very easy to hear the silence and then the silence is very easy to fill the love so it's just like a really easy gateway in and I can stay in while I'm chanting and sometimes become aware of the chanter of the chanting itself and not be the chanter and then it's just love there you know for brief periods it's just pure love and then it's back to Nikki doing the chanting but it's changed everything I mean physically too not just you know spiritually there's a lot of differences in my life materially everything is different the work the responsibilities that I have every day they've all shifted and this has become my work like this practice has become my work today's episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Shutter I Love Shutter it's the ultimate streaming service if you're like me and you love horror movies I love horror movies and when I was growing up my dad had to go to work and my brother was working he'd give me like eight bucks to get food and he had to deal with a local video store that I could get any movie that I wanted as long as it wasn't porn so I had to go down there and thank god whoever was running this video store was also a horror fan he had the weirdest most obscure, scariest titles ever of course I didn't realize at the time whoever was running that video store was a connoisseur of horror all I knew was that I was watching some scary shit that is what Shutter is like it's like having in your own house one of those amazing video stores it has all the classics and all the coolest horror movies that you may never have heard of not only that but I'm learning more and more about the genre from watching Shutter for example I didn't even know that there was the type of horror I liked was called Folk Horror but thanks to Shutter now I see these are the movies I like and right now they have a Folk Horror Collection with 30 titles of Folk Horror from the Wicker Man to Blood on Satan's Claws to literally my favorite horror movie the Texas Chainsaw Massacre if somehow you have missed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre or if you haven't seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in a long time go to Shutter right now and watch it it is the most entertaining incredible beautiful example of horror that exists on the planet I've probably watched it 40 times I'm not even joking 30 I'd say 30 times is an honest estimate of how many times I've seen the Texas Chainsaw Massacre it is incredible but Shutter doesn't just have cool obscure horror movies making their own content and DTFH guest Rob Schraub has actually directed a few episodes of the Creepshow series which is on Shutter and you can watch that I'm telling you if there's a streaming service to subscribe to and Shutter I love them one day I hope to make a movie for them and I hope that you'll check them out if you're a fan of supernatural thriller and all things horror you are going to love Shutter as much as I do and right now you can stream your first 30 days of Shutter for free go to Shutter.com and use code

when I first started becoming interested in it I remember the devotees would say look just chant see what happens if nothing happens well then nothing happened what did you lose a few hours or something of your life who cares but chant and see what happens and then you start chanting and then what you're just things like baby dolphins come and swim up to you things like that start happening but something better than that starts happening as I recall because I haven't been chanting regularly I get scared I chant it so much I got a little scared of it or something like something about it tell me I want the like story of how you heard about it how you got started and some of the stuff that was happening internally and externally so I've had I would say I had a legitimate mystical experience like a real life changing experience and it happened at the Hari Krishna temple in Laguna beach my brother had been hanging out there and I went to see him and so then I just started going there and I love the smell of the temple and the deities and my brother's teacher there and I already loved the Bhagavad Gita so it was amazing to see a place where the Bhagavad Gita was sort of the Bible even though obviously I have other texts that go deeper than that but so I just started going there eating the food, hanging out there are such loving people because they're all chanting too and so even though it is a very strict and disciplined practice if you want it to be if you want to go as deep as you want with it in fact that was one of Prabhupada's bits of advice was go deeper is what he would say but yeah so it was Jamaas to me which is the appearance day of Krishna and I was sitting in the temple watching this like little boy with a peacock feather waving it in front of the deities they're pouring milk on the deities and I can't explain what happened other than I mean it was the most powerful psychedelic event of my life it was suddenly this realization of like oh this is real like this is not like this isn't some academic oh this is a symbol set and it represents the potential in humans and oh it's not a metaphor this is some kind of intelligence interacting with embodied humans via this is the way it shows up and so I remember my the first thing my mind thought was it's like this is a UFO in the sense of like this is advanced technology like this is so advanced that you most people can't even see it they just see statues but it's just what you're talking about that moment I hear exactly what you're saying I can feel what you're saying yeah and that and ever since I mean that changed me that I've been altered permanent I mean I I chant Hare Krishna to this day I'll never stop wow so it's like greasy statues we hear Hare Krishna mantra but there's something deeper that's actually there you know you can you saw through it for a moment yeah yeah because the because humans naturally I mean the way that Hare Krishna's talk about it is you know because we are part of Krishna we have qualities that are within Krishna and one of those qualities is we want to be in control and part of being in control is when you get around something infinitely greater than you what do you want to do you want will reduce it so you get around something like wow look at these superstitious people with their incense and bells and oh isn't this so it's beautiful and primitive and you know you know wow how quaint or something like that right you know and yet there's something attractive about it and that's what it's designed to do that's the compassion part of it is it's designed to play with a human nervous system away we're like you know I'll come back I'll come back and maybe chant a little bit and you know it'll be fun it'll be interesting a little you know a thing I do what and then you start chanting and then the dreams come and there's the baby dolphin and then you're and then people magazine and then a whole bunch of like breakfast club like just crazy stuff like I wasn't seeking those things yeah right yeah exactly yeah it's the yeah it's I'll never understand it I love that you can't write Krishna though that's 16 rounds a day is that's in the morning I do for it right and oh you want to hear something really bizarre yeah one so I try to kick it up to 64 because that's what probably I'd recommend it initially and we were like what we as a people Americans are like we can't do 64 rounds or you have to live life and he's like alright 32 you're like can't do that and he's like alright at least 16 so that's how we got to 16 so I tried to kick it up to 64 and it was a Sunday at about 2pm and I just decided hey kids let's go to the park I never leave the house that late in the evening like that's late for me like with two kids by myself in the hot sun in Florida I'm like let's get dressed let's go to the park so we go to the park and it's a sandy park and within like an hour of being there my kids playing with this other kid really sweet little girl and her mom is looking at me and I have got my Mala and I'm chanting in my right hand and she walks up she's like are you with us I'm like nooo what's up like who is us and she's like oh we're here it was like two or three hundred Hare Krishna's chanting on the beach that day and I missed it I was at home chanting because I mean I'm not a part you know I didn't know I had no idea we were in Clearwater Beach chanting that day from all over Florida like all over the US I guess and so we talked for like two hours my kids are ready to go just chatting it was beautiful and again like such a clear sign you know like keep chanting keep chanting because for me is a really good permission slip to keep me in that love to keep me as that oh my god yeah I you're so funny because just a few days ago I was like oh I gotta find my beads I don't know where they're at I've misplaced them somewhere but so how have you started going to the temple or have you no you know I'm such I told you I'm such a loner and they invited me to some event that was happening around Thanksgiving but again I have the kids and I wasn't able to go my first experience with like public chanting was in Maui with the Rambas and it was appropriate that felt very appropriate because I was you know locked down 2020 when I got into this we couldn't go anywhere we couldn't do anything so this was my first experience with that and it was amazing it was so gorgeous I had it it was fantastic oh I'm excited for you but in you have some deities at your house yeah my family everybody thinks I'm so weird so I've got I was raised Catholic and so I have a meditating Jesus right by my bed and I have a Krishna that was sent here at the end of last year like December I think it was December 11th 2020 when that arrived and I have several Buddhas I have a couple of Hanuman somebody from the Ram Dass organization Steve who I love sent me one that was made from the same wood as the one that they have there at Hanuman Mall and sent me some of the you know like the shavings from the the actual that they have there on site and I was there actually in July and Maui too when they were finishing up the temple so that was really cool and just recently I was on Etsy trying to find something some kind of paraphernalia related to Ram Dass or name Karoli Baba and I couldn't find anything that I liked so I wrote this guy who was selling t-shirts that had name Karoli Baba on it and I'm like hey do you make statues of him they were like no but if you send me a picture I'll get one made and he did in a month and then he took it to a temple there in Delhi and like sent me pictures of it and then sent it out to 10 pounds and it got here while I was in Maui and so usually because this is all so strange you know like with my parents who were also their Catholic you know I'm like hey dad there's a package just got there from India and I won't be back for about a week but I really want you to open it and make sure that it's in one piece you know and before I would have never had him open that box but he did and he sent pictures and you know he's like oh it's great I'll keep it in here with me and keep it safe until you get back so it's just yeah I don't know what it is it's like to have the pictures and the statues everywhere it's like oh it's a reminder everywhere I turn only love is real you know if I'm stressed out or I'm moving too fast because I've got four things I've overbooked myself you know on my schedule and I bump into a picture of Ram Dass smiling at me and I'm like that's right what am I doing you know it just kind of snaps me back into it you know seeing Jesus meditating you know right by the bed just like that you can feel that presence that peace and I didn't think there were any answers in Christianity I didn't find the mystics the Christian mystics until the end of my search and I'm going to Italy next week actually to do a silent retreat at St. Francis of Assisi's home you know church there what and it's they they were talking about the same love everybody is talking about this everybody this is it like you find this in your meditation or in your prayer and then you practice filling it before you take a step before you take a breath before you send an email before you get on Instagram while you're scrolling Instagram you don't stop filling it and so like my Christian friends I'm like that holy ghost you feel on Sunday that makes you want to dance and sing and jump feel that when you're at work you don't have to jump around but feel that that liveliness in your body you know fill that while you were with your children don't just fill it for an hour my friends that do yoga don't just feel peace when you're on the mat that peace take it with you practice filling it on the subway you know like that's it that's the whole that's the end it's the path and it's the destination and once you have it that's it you got to use it you got to fill it well you got I mean that's the hard part isn't it yeah I forget it all the time I mean that you're making me remember and this is why one of the things Prabhupada advised is the devotees are always supposed to be talking and hanging out together this is part of the tradition is because there is an acknowledgement of how easy it is to forget how incredibly easy it is to forget and how absurd it would be that it's easier to remember some embarrassing political drama happening on the world stage than it is to remember the transcendent reality that has been here was here before there was a planet exactly exactly no it's I made it in 20 I was with my grandmother when she took her last breaths at the end of 2015 and I had already been practicing this love I didn't know it had a name until the top of 2016 when I found Joel Goldsmith he was a Christian mystic even though he was Jewish and he shared practicing the presence of God which was a teaching that came from brother Lawrence which was a monk from France that lived in the 1600s and he would not wash a dish until he was filling God not thinking about God you know not reciting a scripture from memory but filling him filling it whatever you want to call it actually being in contact with it being in contact with it that's it and then living his whole life that way so 2016 I started setting alarms that would go off once in once a minute for two hours and every time that chime went off I would shift out of being aware of the world and back into being aware of the word aware of God aware of love and I would forget you know because after like the 50th chime you're now like you don't even hear it anymore but then I'd reset it and I'd reset that intention and I'd get up in the morning and I'd say can I hold love all the way to the bathroom can I hold love throughout the whole shower can I hold love the whole time I'm making tea and you can't you forget because you're you trying to hold love and that's the problem you're actually love so if you can just be the love there is no forgetting it there's no coming and going or leaving it you just be that but we don't want to let go of ourselves I know I saw a meme yesterday on Instagram was an octopus and he was holding on to like all these different objects and he had one of his arms loose he's like yeah he's like I'm doing I'm letting go and I'm like that's me that's me I don't know I can't I don't have any answers all I have is this love and I practice it 24 seven and it's been carrying me it's been carrying me yeah no it's I I try to remember this and then you're trying and you know it's and I think that again this is sort of part of the at least my own personal bullshit is that I want to be in control yeah so if I'm going to let if I'm going to let go I want to be in control of letting go if I'm going to reunify with the transcendent well I want to be the one doing the reunification I don't want to and I and I don't think people like me egoists like the truth of the matter is no you're going to be helped you know what I mean it's going to it's not a one-way conversation and you know so I think that like part of it is asking for help yeah trying not to get to that point in life where you're asking and you know needing to beg for it and not just being able to say it's everything is good everything's gravy but you know it'd be nice if you can show me the way show me the way you know put me in your service you know like show me what to do next without your life needing to be crumbling and my life has done that to me you know a couple of times or it's like nothing is working and now I see it as grace as fierce grace like there's nowhere else to go but deeper inside and every single time that happened I came out on the other side beautifully you know less of me came out on that other side you know it's just thinned out and it's it's good the the very confusing one of the there are many confusing things the hard christians say one of them is like when something when a catastrophe happens in your life they call it the mercy of Krishna yeah because it's unhinging you from the world I recently and I share this on the podcast I was with my son at night like 8pm walking up the steps getting ready for bed and I had my Mala in my right hand chanting as usual hard Christian in my head and something snapped like inside of my head like on my right side it felt like an electrical zap I'd never felt anything like it before I still haven't to this day this was like about a month and I grabbed my head with that hand my right hand where the Mala was also and I said ouch loud enough for him to be worried he ran on up the steps to go find my parents I made it to the top of the steps but I felt nauseous and I felt just a little dizzy and warm and flushed and I don't know if that was anxiety because my mind was like was that like you know precursor to a stroke was it like a little stroke like was it some type of aneurysm so my mind is like worst case scenarioing and I'm scared but as I pull my hand down from my head I can see that Mala and it was like my thread to the truth and I immediately went back to chanting and remembering only love is here you know and back to Hare Krishna and so my parents are like taking my vital signs as they have all of that stuff in the house and we go to the ER but the whole way on my way to the ER I'm chanting at the ER with the nurses with the doctors chanting cat scan I don't have my Mala in my hand but I'm chanting out of the cat scan Mala back in hand chanting it carried me through that experience and there was they didn't find anything and I don't know what it was and neither do they but it was beautiful to have that anchoring the fear was there but love was louder it was loud and that was dope and you had that and that's part of this practice that you know it's that I think that's why they call it a practice is because there's if you have any the smallest bit of intelligence you know you're on a planet where incredibly horrible things happen all the time in a body that's certain to die exactly surrounded by other people that are certain to die this is not a stable situation to live so even if things are going great for you right now it can't stay like that permanently so the practice is building this kind of temple or a place that you can find yourself in regardless of external circumstances that's powerful a temple so that no matter where you are it's sacred it's holy even if you're in an ER you know to have that practice going that was it showed me that I can practice in very uncertain circumstances there was a pull to be thinking and googling symptoms you know don't do that I know and I'm like chant louder that's what you do they say you try to chant louder you get louder than Maya get louder than the illusion you know so you can see through it and the community too they all go together and supposedly they ask Buddha what's the most important thing is it the Dharma or is it the Sangha or is it you know you and he said it's the community it's the community is the most important thing and people forget that or in Christianity what do they say they say the church is the body of Christ and you know that's all of these things by the way I think one of the problems is if you're a secularist or if you're recovering Christian or someone who was born into some weird shit then you you don't want to hear anything about it but if you can separate yourself enough from whatever your encounter with it was and think about some of these ideas that this the church is the when they say the church is the body of Christ they're not meaning it in any other way than literally and so to imagine that some being has sort of hasn't turned into a butterfly from being a caterpillar but has turned into groups of people gathering together singing about love and the cocoon was it being crucified right that is so psychedelic and so wild and you know similarly with Vaishnava Bhakti Yoga to imagine that one of the ways that the divine is growing into this world is through a sound right how is that possible it's impossible to believe in fact you shouldn't believe it if you hear it for the first time why would you believe it it doesn't even sound preposterous it sounds insane they literally said the sound Hare Krishna is the form God has taken in this life for us so when you're chanting the present God is present in that moment while you're chanting and feeling that I feel love and I chant to that love and I don't know what that love looks like I just know how it feels I chant to it, I sing to it I pray to it and it carries me it's not that one of the wild experiences I've had with it is in a delightful experience it's not what you think it is so it's like wait this is indescribably different from what I conjured up in my head about what God must be like and of course because the idea here is we are limited in our capacity at this current stage of our evolutionary process as we grow into whatever it is we're growing into into the universe so you wouldn't be able to necessarily summon up the well Bhagavan, the most everything the most beautiful, most famous most loving, most you wouldn't be able to summon that up in your mind because you're not the most of those things as much as we like to believe it so when you encounter it it's not going to look like what you thought it would look like at all you couldn't imagine it when I went back home in 2019 it was around Christmas time and I was there for midnight mass and I went back to my church I grew up in after a long time and the priest who I grew up with since I was 7 was there and his form is melting but there was such a glow about him and there was only 8 people in the church because that's how religion is today and I remember him looking around and saying like turn the lights down and I want you all to meditate with me and come into the presence of the Christ within and I'm looking around like when did this all start or was I just not able to hear that when I was there at the time so I sit there and I close my eyes and I'm focused on the Christ within and the true Christianity is finding that within yourself and so when church was over I went up to him thinking that he wouldn't even recognize me and he's like hey Nikki how are you I'm like I'm great when did you start filling the presence of Christ of God within you and he's like oh Nikki too long too long to recall he just kind of shoes me away and goes and continues to talk to the other congregants like it was nothing and I'm like he's he's like what are you doing in that church and I wasn't able to see it because I wasn't there that's what I believe I can see that from now I can see that and I missed it I was bored out of my mind at church I like the music sometimes I like the fellowship sometimes but I didn't like anything else I felt dry I love this this idea of blindness is so cool and you know Paul Saul of Tarsus witnesses Jesus and then is made blind it like goes blind but what do you think that means was that like an acknowledgement like was it that he just he he nothing really changed but he realized I've been blind my entire life completely blind to this other reality that's awesome and it's it's gorgeous now and I try to live my life like I'm blind they tell you to do that in the Yoga Vasistha in the Ashtavakra Gita like although I see I see nothing so the things that the eyes report knowing what's actually there which is the kingdom which is the Christ I see the furniture feeling love where I see stop that's my practice and the chanting helps keep me there you know feeling when I'm feeling love I am that love so I'm automatically there and even though I see a Niki and I see a Duncan and I see furniture and I see outdoors only love is here and I can't see that love in fact I can it's manifesting as all of this you know but I feel that love more but I'm in the constant communion with God behind the scene knowing that it's appearing as the scene and shortly you know later it's going to be appearing as a car you know going to pick up kids it'll be appearing as a kitchen you know it just like rearranges but it's always just this love this formless boundless field we get stuck and we think we're these forms and we're watching we're witnessing that is it you know that can you tell me again where it says to imagine that you're blind it's in it's a hundred percent in the Ashtabakura Gita and I'd have to find the chapter for you and it won't take long what is that book I have so do you know um do you know Muji yes I mean I know of him okay well that's one of his favorite books um uh name Karoli Baba that's one of his favorite books it's a very powerful very powerful book and it's short and it punches like it will cut your head off just every line is like that like although the sage sees just like you and me he sees nothing he sees nothing he sees stuff but he knows that it's empty you know it's like that simultaneous awareness of being Duncan and being love and like being aware of yourself as being love being aware of yourself as being beyond that body while having the experience of having a body that's that's what we're doing seeing the body knowing it's not you knowing that everything you see is you or nothing is you you can go either way everything is me or nothing is me but it can't just be this is me this body is me that's the only way not to be everything can be you that's love nothing is you that's you know enlightenment that's pure I like the everything in the beginning for me I did nothing like it's easy for me to kind of pull out of the scene and see it from like an impersonal standpoint but that love is so beautiful and that love for me is I'm not just Nikki I'm everything everyone and everyone I meet is me not me Nikki but me as this I am this presence that's looking out of your eyes and mine and my kids and your kids and everyone the okay so this is what I love to love about the Ram Dass retreats I'm sorry miss the last one but the so Ram Dass would always have someone representing the Bakhti Yoga side and then someone representing the emptiness side and then let them you know sort of deal with each other so the conversations like Ragu has with Roshi Joan Halifax they're so funny because you know not that Roshi Joan Halifax is like she's all love she is all love because if both it goes to the same place it's just different ways of conceptualizing it maybe but I remember once Ragu's saying to her I think she was talking about a Buddhist topic something about emptiness non-dualism I can't recall the exact content of what she's saying but I remember Ragu saying well if that means I'm separated from Maharaj then I don't want it I want to keep doing this over and over and over and over again forever and it's beautiful it's it's it's beautiful and the you know and the so what the Hare Krishna say about that is and again this is where I think organized religion does get problematic because some Hare Krishna's really are not quite fond of the Buddhists which are they're not fond of anyone yeah yeah exactly my avatis is what the word is and but the ideas okay so there's Goloka Vrindavan right and that's where Krishna lives that's the eternal heaven or whatever you want to call it that place has a radiance it's so powerful because this is where God Vishnu takes the form of Krishna and plays forever and so that place is so incredibly powerful that the field surrounding it is called the Brahma Jyoti this is the emptiness that people tune into so the idea is if you have found the empty part of it or that you've you recognize okay this is a veil or whatever you want to call it then yes that's right but that's just like the effulgence of the thing if you go deeper in then suddenly you find oh no it has a personality yep and the personality whether you like it or not whether it makes sense to you or not the personality is a blue-skinned cowherd boy who is eternally frolicking in this beautiful garden of Eden style planet with his associates and it doesn't matter if you think that's ridiculous if you don't it doesn't matter if you think it's fairy tales it doesn't matter that's the way it is and so that's where that's where Christians present it and you know you start chanting skeptically however, devotedly whatever you start chanting and all of a sudden you're like wait I think this is true it's so absurd though it's so impossible and yet and yet it's true but it's not the I mean I think that's the you know though and only because most people I know don't know much about bhakti yoga but do you know about the rasa-lila a little I'd like to hear it from you okay thank you so the rasa-lila and any of my deep bhakti yoga friends if I'm screwing this up feel free to send me corrective messages I'll fix it after the fact um so the rasa-lila uh the gopis the the story goes these women living in Vrindavan they hear the playing of a flute and they leave their home they leave the way it's described as they leave the lamp burning to go out into the clearing because they've heard Krishna's flute and he there's a hundred native them who gather around him and he makes love to all of them but it's not like some like it's not he becomes each of their perfect ideal perfect lover and so this I think is supposed to represent um that this is the this is the compassion of the divine is that and I think it's interesting because you know once you start recognizing how much you're participating in the creation of your own reality and then once you realize that wait it's not just a it doesn't seem to be a one-way street it's in my participation something else seems to be dancing with me too and the more you're tuning into the love field that you're talking about then the more you see the love field and then you realize this entire thing is some kind of love letter from God to me and so in that way you become one of the gopis you know not not just like physically having sex with God which would be incredible but at every single level with all of your senses with your entire experience of life and just what you're saying now instead of it just being you know your house or whatever you it's it's God and you're in the presence of God or the temple like you said a temple yeah yeah yeah I like it how do you work oh I know I like though how you said how they left their lamps burning and that makes me think of that inner light you know always on like keeping that on because that's another practice whenever I try to stay aware I move slower the way I would move if I was holding a candle that I didn't want to go out you know and I think that's why Eckhart Tolle moved so slow I think I heard him say in a talk once that you know he is deliberate about his movements because he's staying aware as this as the now you know that's so cool right move like you're holding a candle yeah I used to be an altar girl you know and I think about like how you didn't want it to blow out because that would suck you know so moving slower shielding it and when I'm moving a little slower even when I need to hurry you know moving just a little bit slower it helps me stay aware as this love helps me keep some attention there helps me hold that thread oh my god you know that tip famous tichnoton story I must be related to what I just said because I could fill his quote coming but I couldn't I couldn't grasp it someone running late to one of his events have you heard this this was okay and well I know someone's because they say that the retreat someone's going to was late to go hear him talk and they're rushing to go hear him talk in there they pass this monk walking really slowly and they turn and look and it's tichnoton that is excellent I've never heard that yeah just like very slowly walking to this thing he's very late for and it's amazing listen I think walking slowly is so important and you know one of the signs of trauma is that you walk really fast that is I guess I can see that and not allowing yourself to rest you know to relax not allowing yourself to relax that's a thing that I'm just now getting to see for myself like not feeling guilty when I'm doing nothing oh god I want to be able to do that yeah that guilt always be like needing to be busy because if you stop being busy then there's that guilt creeps in you know they used to have to have in factories people who were foremen they were really scary and they would if you stopped working or if you slowed down they would beat you but somehow that foreman is like they've managed to make this thing even if you work from home some invisible thing is always behind you like what are you doing you're failing you're going to take a lunch break how do you stay competitive you're going to eat like that's crazy that's been my latest challenge like being able to after I'm done with all that stuff from 4am until noon taking a moment to actually eat because there's been times where I don't remember to eat until like 3 or 4 and it's not okay because by that time I have a headache so just like getting out ahead of that and taking care of this vessel too while doing all the other things yeah you know I'm so inspired by you I'm going to start chanting again after this conversation just because it's just bringing me back to that feeling I can feel it it changes like the whole quality of course during the time when you're chanting but the whole rest of the quality of your day changes and then you keep it going because now it's stuck in your head and because you're full of that there's no room for the other stuff about you know needing to be super busy for that to be like a good productive day instead of taking some time for yourself when you have that chant still going on you're aware of that place in you where the chant is always happening there's no room for I'm not good enough or this needs to get done so I can feel good about myself or you know I'm not a good mom or whatever those things are that come up there's no room for them when that chant and when they do come up you can see through them that's just a thought they don't stick to you you can easily you don't even have to let them go you just see them kind of let them pass and you stay as that ocean of love and that's it but when I'm not chanting and that thought comes I gotta think about that thought it feels real it feels true and then back you're pinned again you know it's very rare for someone to just take up the regulative principles and start chanting like you are that is a very rare thing most people don't do that I'm at a gorgeous famous Kyrton singer from John-Avi do you know her Harrison she was born into the Hare Krishna movement and she has an album with Willow Smith and when we got I interviewed her on my podcast for Be Here Now Network that's called New Growth and when we were off air she's like where did you come from how did this happen she wanted the details the ones that I shared publicly with you about the dream and how I got started I care about people just deciding I'm gonna give up meat and I had given up meat over the years but I always end up eating meat again even though it didn't feel completely right and I don't have any real why's of why I don't my son is always like mom doesn't like meat I'm like I do, I like meat a lot I like wamp chops but I don't eat them anymore I don't have the desire and it doesn't feel like I'm missing anything I like a glass of wine on the beach I live on the beach now without needing to have a glass of wine in my hand it feels good because I choose this so I'm again so full of the mantra so full of love that I don't need any of the other things anymore it doesn't feel like a sacrifice like I'm missing something that's the difference that's one of the gifts it gives you I remember that the loosening of the addictive stuff the more you chant though it's not like you're quitting you just aren't thinking about it anymore I mean it's grabbing your mind it's like designed to completely shift your attention at every level I mean that's what the temple that's what the temple is is the place where you can be fully absorbed so your smell your visual field your ears your feelings because you're holding the mala you know so it's like every one of your sense organs is being drawn in to this reality or not really drawn in but you are it's helping you recover from a brutal kind of existential amnesia which is you have forgotten your relationship with God that's so gorgeous you should put that like get that transcribed and I'll wear it on the t-shirt I didn't invent that that's from I know that you just said it in a way that was way more relatable than I've read the books I've read some of them at least and that was really clear what you just said you gotta go to Vrindavan I have to go to all these places when I told Ragu everybody I'm like don't y'all go back over there without me I'm coming too because I don't want to go by myself I travel by myself a lot but to hit all those places on one trip I think what's so fascinating you know only just because of like my on and off relationship with Hare Krishna's it's just astounding to hear someone who is adhering to these things and who isn't going to any of these temples not that you need to and also I think it's super important you already know this anyone listening bhakti yoga is not limited to the international society for Krishna consciousness that's like the way Christianity has all these churches there's a lot of different types of bhakti yoga out there the Vaishnaiva bhakti yoga is what we're talking about in particular but the Hare Krishna's aren't the only community that practices that it's just the only one that I ever encountered it's the one that I came across that said here's some rules and I needed them I fast twice a month it's coming up I think tomorrow I don't even know how to pronounce it is it don't ask me I'm the I'm a devotee at Jason I'm just lucky enough to have made contact with him at all I just got lucky I stumbled into them but we have to connect to you have you had Rodinath Swami on your podcast yet? no but I actually DM'd them and they had agreed to it and then we kind of lost touch and I DM'd again and haven't heard back so I'd love to absolutely that guy he will make you cry just sitting he he I was someone I was lucky someone knew him and like I got to spend like 30 minutes with him and I'm sitting with him and you know unassuming just a very sweet person but he starts telling a story about Krishna and I think my question was well why does Krishna show up as a baby you know because that's one of the ways God appears as a baby and he started telling a story of Krishna as a baby and my friend and I we just were we we couldn't help it tears are just like flowing to her cheeks because you know you're around them when they tell the stories it's different than if you read it it really is I cried a lot at that round boss retreat you did? yes and like at times I don't even know why I was crying I think Mirabai you know Mirabai star she came up to me at dinner and I'm having a very nonchalant conversation with some people and she comes up and she's like Nikki how are you and I started bawling at dinner and you know we talked a little bit more but it was moments like that just like cleansing you know being around these people that have just been completely like swimming in this love being this love for years you know for so

Oh, what a week it's been, my sweet friends. And this conversation with my friend Natasha came at exactly the right time. I'm sure many of you listening are fans of Natasha, but in case somehow you have missed the great, brilliant phenomena that is Natasha Legerro, you should know she's been podcasting for as long as I have. And she's really good at it. She knows how to get real. And sometimes I forget how important that is, you know, especially when it's getting real about, like, feeling depressed, which is something that happens to me from time to time. In fact, it happens to me every fucking winter. And I don't know that you would call it like a clinical depression because I've had that. And that's, you know, like suddenly your bed turns into a gravity well that is inescapable. And you just lay in bed and sort of freak out and slowly, like, just like sink into increasing levels of entropic, nonrestful slumber with suicidal ideations springing out of your sapped, slow moving brain. That I wouldn't wish on anybody. And it's a really scary thing, but there's other forms of it. You know, there's just sort of situational depressions. The blues just, I think we're all feeling, or a lot of us are probably naturally feeling a kind of gloomy sort of as, you know, we get all the weird news about fucking COVID variants and all the stuff. And we're all kind of stuck indoors. And, you know, it's just a stressful time. So maybe like the worst thing you could do right now is if you're not feeling great, you know, like get out there to the world that somehow you're doing amazing because you've learned how to crochet or something when really your subjective universe feels like some kind of distant cratered ice moon orbiting an even more cratered ice moon and some distant part of our solar system. You know, that doesn't help anybody. And I think that, you know, without getting, you know, commercially confessional, it's a good thing to let people know if you're starting to feel the fungal creep of depression. Because I have noticed from my own experience with it that it never wants me to say it's happening. It always wants you to keep it secret and not say anything and ignore it. And by the way, not to be maybe the worst influence of all time. In my experience from time to time, ignoring it, actually, I'm so sorry to say this has worked because sometimes it just goes away. It lifts the whatever it was. It was just some momentary, you know, combination of a lot of bad decisions drinking too much, getting dehydrated, not exercising, sleeping too late, looking at too much porn, whatever. And then like you just get kind of gummed down and sapped. But the frightening thing is that sometimes if you ignore it and don't let people know you're feeling weird, it can amplify and it gets worse and worse. I don't know what this thing is. I'm not going to go on and on in some obvious mental health rant here, but I will never understand why in our bizarre culture being open about the fact that from time to time, your neurotransmitters aren't exactly firing on all cylinders is somehow considered like weird compared to, you know, somebody will go around like getting people to sign their cast. But if you're feeling weird or depressed or paranoid or anxious, or you're having insomnia, or you know what I mean? You're getting like, like anxiety attacks. People just keep that to themselves. I guess we all want everyone around us to think we're some kind of impenetrable citadel of perfect mental health. But who the fuck am I fooling? I was huffing butane in high school. I've been doing acid since I was 16. I can't necessarily expect this old 46 year old bowl of pudding up here, very large and powerful bowl of pudding that many scientists have asked to study. And I get calls from some of the nation's top rocket scientists three or four times a week asking for me to look over their equations. But I'm a little too busy right now with my family. But that being said, come on, why wouldn't I have some some stutters and limps and swirling rainbow wheels up there? You know, it would be weird if I didn't. So but anyway, this conversation with Natasha made me feel better because it always feels better when people are honest about what's really going on with them, especially when maybe you haven't been that honest about it. And I know it's not like I've been hiding it or anything. It's just it just creeps up on you sometimes. I was gloating. I was gleefully yapping with my friend Shane about how yep, this winter I didn't get it. I didn't even get depressed this winter. And then suddenly I'm looking at myself in the mirror. I haven't combed my hair in a day or two. I smell like somebody rolled me around in a giant tin of Vienna sausages. You know, and then it's like, ah, fuck, it happened. But I'm fine. I'm back. I'm I'm on my anti. I'm sorry. I'm going on too long here. I'm on my anti depression regimen at the moment, which is no booze. Waking up early exercise and by early like 5 a.m. I'm trying to go for 4 a.m. Going to bed early. All the things that like if you're feeling depressed, you're not going to do your depression. We'll say to you like, you know what you should do? You should stay up till 5 a.m. Looking at YouTube videos on serial killers. Yeah. No, there's nothing wrong with getting up at 3 a.m. and going downstairs to have another glass of wine. Does that seem weird? Why would it seem weird? Enjoy your life. I mean, you will have to get up at 7, but you can have some it just have 70 cups of coffee. You know, so I just do the opposite of what that dark whispering voice tells me to do. And it usually works. And then also I'm sorry. Am I doing some PS? I'm sorry if I'm doing a PSA, but then also because I just know I've got I've got depressed brothers and sisters out there. It's good for us to check in with each other from time to time, especially right now. And the main thing is just tell someone tell someone in your life. Just like I'm fucking depressed. I don't feel great. And probably they'll be like, God, yeah, I feel like shit too. And they'll feel great. They'll make them feel better because you've been going around with some fake smile acting like everything's awesome, sending them clips of bears attacking people or whatever. You know, so it's probably going to be a relief for them to hear like, oh, great. I'm not the only one in this global pandemic that feels a little gloomy right now. So it's good to be honest. All right. Whatever. What am I? What is this? What am I helpline? I don't know. It just feels nice to talk about it. I love you guys. Thanks for giving me the best job of all time before I forget. If you're sick of the commercials in this podcast, if you want pure unfiltered, hard core, free base, DTFH uninterrupted by ads, all you got to do is head over to patreon.com for a slash DTFH subscribe every week we gather together for our journey into boredom. That's our meditation group meets every Monday. We sit for 20 minutes and every Friday it's our family gathering. And sometimes we talk about deep philosophical stuff. And sometimes we talk about the eternal question of whether or not squirting is P. You just never know what's going to happen. But the main thing is you'll get to hang out with the DTFH family. A community of powerful magicians, wizards, druids, priests, priestesses, hers and he's and they's and all in between a think tank of such profound and epic proportions that more than likely we will tear a rift in the time space continuum and pluck the Messiah from that beautiful glowing spraying womb of glory. And you could be part of that by heading over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We're going to jump right into this episode with Natasha. But first this. Eternal praises to the 15 sisters of light for today's wonderful sponsor feels. Do you have problems sleeping? Are you stressed out? Do you have anxiety attacks? I have problems sleeping. And let me tell you, I've tried everything at one point. I was like, I'll just get addicted to Benzos. Fuck it. I would rather be all piled up on Benzos than exhausted with my brain slowly withering into some kind of chestnut thing. But fortunately for us, we have CBD and that's what feels is feels. It naturally helps reduce stress, anxiety, pain and sleeplessness. It's easy to take. You put a few drops of feels under your tongue and feel the difference within minutes. The thing to remember about CBD is that finding your right dose is important. Everyone's dose is different. So leave room to experiment over the course of a week or so. You may need to take more or less to get the effects you're after. But if you're new to CBD, what's awesome about feels is they've got real human support. They've got a CBD hotline to help guide your personal experience, maybe help you dial in dosages. You can feel better naturally. Feels works naturally to help you feel better. There's no high hangover or addiction. And I must add, even though it's not on the sheet, other CBD products taste as though a tiny infected clown, shit, bitter glitter under your tongue. Feels tastes great because it's high grade CBD. Join the feels community to get feels delivered to your door every month. You'll save money on every order and you can pause or cancel at any time.

Let's dive in to this wonderful conversation with my former co-host Natasha Legerro. We started podcasting together, but obviously she's not just a podcaster. She's an actor. She's a brilliant comedian who when this horrendous thing finally ends, you must go see live. Sometimes she tours with her brilliant husband, Mosha Kassher. Together, these two create the endless honeymoon podcast. They're both so funny and this podcast is really, really good and has taught me quite a lot. Highly recommend it. All the links you need to find it are going to be at DuncanTrussell.com. And now my dear friends, welcome back to the DTFH, Natasha Legerro. Natasha, thank you so much for coming on the DTFH again. It's just been too long. I thought I had to come on since I noticed that you still use the lavender hour email for all of your fan mail. I, you know, I, it's what am I, I shouldn't do that. It's weird. It's okay. Is that weird? No. No. I mean, what am I going to do with it? Just all that I have left of those days, you could do whatever you want. You could share it with me if you like. I'm good. I just actually recorded a song for someone who invited me to their bachelor party in Maggie Valley. And I was so astounded that I was inspired to sing a song to him explaining why that was not going to be a good thing for either of us to do. Wait, he wanted, he wanted you to come to his party. Yeah, it was a very sweet email. I'm not like, I'm flattered, but also like, and I get it, you know, from his perspective, but then you think about the reality. Like imagine if I were a little more open, I'm like, yeah, I'll go to your bachelor party and then I show up and I don't know anybody. I mean, a bachelor party every, it's like deep friends getting hammered. Also, there's an infectious disease spreading. That too. Like, yeah, we're dealing with COVID to make matters worse. So that as well is a daunting problem. One thing I've noticed about me and my psychology right now is like, I really want to see people I know, but I really, really am repelled by people I don't know. Yep. I don't know what that is. Is it healthy? No. Is that healthy? Do you think that's a healthy way to be? Absolutely not. It's, how sick have we all become? I think I'm pretty sick and I think there's different levels and, you know, I think it's really hard to be in a relationship right now because like, yes, it's also extremely hard to be single. But like, the amount of time that we're spending with our partners is like, not normal. And like, I wouldn't usually be witnessing the things that I'm seeing every day with my partner because like, some stuff should be done in private, you know, but like now we're like private together. Yeah. Like that can't be good for a relationship. Oh God. I mean, I think as long as you remember that, you're fine. It's when you forget this isn't normal that, you know, things get weird. That's, that's what I do is I have to just keep reminding myself like, well, this isn't normal. You're, you've spent the last year in closer proximity to Aaron than anyone you've ever been with. And just the fact that we have managed to like maintain a marriage to me is amazing. It's a, it's an accomplishment. And I mean that. I mean, it's a lot of people didn't a lot of people, a lot of COVID divorces, a lot of COVID breakups. Yeah. Well, what are the options when you have kids? Well, yeah. I mean, you know, I think that, that tells us just how brutal it has been for some people because even with kids, they were like, we can't fuck this. This just isn't going to work. I'm going to go off to some place. I mean, it sounds like hell. It sounds like hell to then be in a pandemic, freshly divorced, missing your family, wanting to keep them safe, but it has happened to people. I mean, God, I know what you mean, but you no longer have, but you no longer have to watch your husband drink chip crumbs in bed. Right. Right. That's true. You're free of that, that, but you, you know, I feel bad, like, you know, I feel bad for Aaron in that regard. I don't, you know, I, I've, she pointed out this thing a long time ago that I do that that I didn't even realize that I did, which is when I take my socks off, I, I do this lasso thing in the air. Why? I don't know. I didn't even notice it was that unconscious. I like lasso my socks. Every time. Yeah. Lasso toss. And then I just tossed them away from my body. You didn't like just away. And this is, this is something I just didn't know, even noticed that I did. Cause like, I, I've been doing it so long. And so I'm, and she, she pointed that out. Like, where, what are you doing? Where, where do your socks go? Well, they land on the floor and who picks them up usually. Cause it's not you. You're just lasso throw. So forest is sitting on the couch and we're watching a show and I watch him reach down, pull his sock off, lasso it and swing it cause he sees me do it. And it's already infected him. The sock lasso. So, you know, it's nice to know I do this thing unconsciously, but also it's like, I would like for her to imagine that I am some perfect being that doesn't do things like drink crumbs in bed or forget to flush the toilet or all this just visceral stuff, but it's too late. Let me ask, let me ask you something. Do you have any interest in stopping doing that? Lassoing your sock? Cause it seems like an easy thing. If it kind of annoys her, it's that seems like an easy one to slowly stop doing. I mean, it is cute. I like the spirit of it. You're kind of like freewheeling. I'm free. I finally can lasso my sock off my feet, but. Like you're free from the restrictions of society and the man and the socks. I mean, it's sweet, the undertones, but like if it annoys her, that seems like an easy one. No, you're right. I mean, I agree. But, but these things that seem easy. Duncan, can you stop for a second? Sorry. Someone's my foot. My computer just started talking. Oh, it did. Can you hear me? I hear you. And you're showing up on this. What? There's no delay. There shouldn't be a delay. I think there's like a one second delay. Okay. You know what? Just to be safe. Let me stop this first. What we got so far. All right. We're back. Tech heirs. Who cares? What do you mean though? I mean, I feel like there's this art to living this closely with someone that I am just not that good at. But because, you know, you, you want to, you have to find that a way to communicate something that's bothering you to someone that doesn't activate their defense mechanisms, you know, it's like, you don't want to turn into someone's parent. It's so hard as a woman to not be a nag and to micromanage everything, but I do feel like, especially where children are concerned, women can make better choices. What? What do you tell me what you mean? What do you mean by that? Well, I think that women in general can be more of a nag, you know, and, you know, just being very conscious of what you're doing, like something I learned through therapy, which I feel very lucky that I can do therapy right now is like every time I ask him to do something, I also like make sure to put like a little barb at the end. Like, could you put your shoes away because I tripped on them or could you be the dogs because I've done it every day this week? You know what I mean? Like, you don't have to put that second part on. It's obviously something you have to be very conscious of. Like, you know, once you become conscious of it, like that you lasso your socks, then maybe. Which is, I think, the least of the annoying things that I do. Right. That's actually kind of cute. I like, like I said, I like the spirit of it. But, uh, but yeah. No, I leave, I've been leaving food out and stuff. I've haven't been, I haven't been cleaning up after myself enough, but like I'm realizing now, like that's, I have all these, uh, things I look out for, which can mean I'm getting depressed. And one of them is I don't clean up after myself, but she's been doing a great job cleaning up after me. So like the signal from my external world has been like, oh, things are good. So that's what I just realized is like, oh shit, that's one of my signals. You know, like I've, that's when it's time to look at my life and figure out what's, what's happening. Um, but yeah, I know what you mean. It's. That's really good that you can see that because like I'm not someone who's ever been depressed my whole life. You know, I feel very lucky about that. But now I'm like, I think I have some kind of situational depression because I feel like I'm in hospice. I don't really like when it's time to go outside. I don't know how to dress myself. I look at my closet and I'm, I'm just like confused. It seems like a crack. Yeah. But like it's there. And so I imagine people who are already prone to depression, like what they must be feeling like, I, I, I don't know. I mean, I. Yeah. Do you, do you have any, do you have any advice? Like I've been wearing one earring. Like I look. Well, I think one of the advantage. Wait, Duncan. I really think we have like a slight delay. Are you sure you don't mind about that? Yes. Because you know what? For, I'm recording separately and on this side, it sounds great. But you know what? To be completely safe. Let me just stop it. Oh, thank you. Thank you.

And yeah, I just feel like every, every few weeks I'm like, am I, is my period starting? Do I need to do ayahuasca? Do I have situational depression? Yeah. It's, it's, it's a challenging time for someone who has never been depressed. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's, I guess the good thing about having been actually depressed is I'm sort of familiar with it. And I know how to work. I know how to be depressed. And that's bad because I, I'm so good because I, my depression usually it'll, it'll lift. Like I have a lot of techniques that seem to work. Tell me. Tell people you feel depressed. That's the first one. The cardinal sin of depression is keeping it to yourself. That's the, that's how I get in all kinds of problems with Aaron because I'm really good at not acting depressed, which is a form of procrastination. Cause the idea is if I act like I'm not depressed, maybe it'll lift a little bit and then no one will have to have been like burdened by that. You know, it's, and it works sometimes, sometimes that actually works, but if it doesn't work, then all of a sudden your partner is going to be like, what's wrong with you when suddenly you're in like a paralyzed state on the bed or something. And then you have to, you know, and also not admitting it is a form of denial that like it's just unhealthy. So then when you admit it to the people around you, usually they'll be like, oh fuck, and they'll help. And you don't even know, like listen to you and they'll like suggest things or notice things you've been doing. But then for me, it's just, it's the obvious. It's so obvious and it's so annoying. Exercise. Get outside. Sunlight. Vitamin D. I mean, none of these things, if it gets, if it progresses enough, you, I have yet to, I haven't been medicated since I was in college, but if it progresses enough, you have to get medicated. You don't want it to get to that place. So you just, you have to basically start doing the opposite of what it's telling you to do. You know. Right. Like I'm like, I need to just, maybe I just need to lay down for two days. Yeah. Exactly. Right. Oh, you'll feel better. You just need to sleep for about, oh, I don't know, maybe 30 hours straight. Yeah. Which, which could, which won't work. But also for me, it's like, if I'm getting depressed, then what I'll start doing is staying up late, serving the internet and like playing, playing video games, like just stupid shit to avoid reality. And then because I'm doing that, I'm not getting enough sleep. And then if I'm not getting enough sleep, I'm going to be grumpier and more depressed that it, that's the problem is that it amplifies itself. Whereas like, if you just start, you know, I'm meditating. Like I don't want to meditate right now. Cause I've got, I'm a little depressed. So like it's extra hard to meditate right now. It's the last thing I want to do, but that helps too. It's, it's no, I don't think there's any quick fix, but there's a lot of little things you can do. The main one. I bet if we all had that mayonnaise jar that Timothy Leary had with like full of Harvard grade LSD, we, we'd feel good. Oh God, no. I'm reading, I'm reading Ramdaz's book and, and I just feel like the sixties, it just felt like we'll never get to that. Like the stories he tells are so insane. Like, oh yeah. Then I took my plane to get cheaper gas in Mexico. We got in the Cessna and then went back to the hotel we were renting for the summer so that we could all do LSD. And then, you know, when we, when we landed at the airport, we just kind of put the gas in those little, those little lockers at the airport and, you know, hid the LSD on our bodies. It's just like, what world is this? Yeah. It just seems so free. Fearless. Fearless. A lot less fear. Now, but, but you know, I think the problem with memoirs is that you, you're hearing the side of things that sometimes is in someone's rear view mirror. Right. You know, I don't, I'm not, I don't know what his experience was, but I, you know, I do know that some of like Tim Leary's kids had, I wonder what they would say about that. Cause I, you know, as a father, when I know, and I know what Tim Leary was doing in that kind of wild hippie life that a lot of people were living with their kids and it was very European. And, but also I think it was kind of irresponsible in the, in the most extreme way and indulgent, you know, cause like, I think that kids need us to be stable as much as we can, authentically stable, you know, but stable, meaning like, I don't know that forest needs to see what daddy's like on 600 micrograms of acid emerging from some orgy. You know, I don't know. I don't know. On the other hand, you know, maybe, maybe that's a good way to be or something. I just, I've got, do you, in your parenting, do you feel like there's, there's something in you that makes you want to be kind of square? Oh yeah. It sucks. Yeah. Same. Like, I know, because I have so much fear now and I was never a fearful person. I kind of lived my whole life kind of, I probably would have gone with Ram Dass and like hid stuff in a locker and, you know, carry drugs on me past a border. Like, I don't, you know, if it felt like, oh, we can get away with this, like, I, but now, I mean, your life is like full of this fear that I don't think people really warn you about. Yeah. No, I don't, I don't think they could. I mean, they could try. They warn you by the, when you look in the faces of parents. It's all there. But, but. I feel like I cut you off because you were talking about how to get out of depression. No, I love drugs would help. No, I mean, that's the dream is, is that, and apparently like some drugs do help. psilocybin can help and ketamine can help and LSD, I guess could help, especially with therapy. But having like, am I depressed periods when I've gotten high on acid? A lot of times it doesn't help. And it just is a really rotten experience that on the other end, I'm still depressed. But now I also had a shitty acid trip to go along with it. I mean, I don't want to roll the dice. Again, when I was a kid, it was like, who cares? I don't think I even knew I was depressed until like college when I was having suicidal ideations and went to a therapist and they're like, you're fucking depressed. I don't think I knew what was happening to me, but I don't think there's a quick fix. I know, I think, but don't you think to get back to the idea of the sort of. Lore of the memoir, the lore of the memoir and the stories of the 60s that really to me, what's what's amazing about Ram Dass and is the is the adventurous quality, you know, like they were really open to not just experimenting with psychedelics, but their approach to life was so beautifully experimental and so beautifully adventurous that it's inspiring. Drugs were just a part of that. You know, and when I watch you, your Instagram, it seems like y'all are very adventurous. You're always going on these wild trips. You're living in some, it seems like it's a commune or something. I mean, we tried to do some communal living and I realized that it's just really hard for me. I'm not into it. Like, you know, it's like every day you're looking, you're sharing a bathroom with seven people. Like, I can't do that. I need to know more about this. What was the, what initiated this? Well, what initiated it was that, you know, there's COVID and so there was another family, the woman's an epidemiologist and she has three kids and they were kind of quarantined on this property in Northern, Northern California that Moshe's grandfather built like, you know, a long, long time ago. And so we went up there too. And then the communal space was from 8am to 8pm in the A-frame house. And then they would sleep in a trailer with their three kids and we would sleep in the house at night. And, you know, every morning the kids would come in and start talking and we'd wake up and have to come downstairs and, you know, and it was just Moshe like kept arguing with the children. And it was like, there was, and then I realized too, like, I waited a really long time to have a kid and I think I'm really happy with one kid and like, I like my kid, but I don't like kids. Yeah. And I think that's something that I've kind of just realized, you know, like I'm not like one of those people who wants to hold your baby. Like it just makes my arm hurt, you know, like I'm not like, oh, give me that thing. I got it. I got it. I'm sure, I know Erin's the opposite, you know, like she, she's like loves babies and I think that's like such a beautiful quality and it's also a talent and a gift. But like, you know, I feel like I have love and I have so much love for my child, but that doesn't mean that now I just like being around other people's annoying children. I mean, how much experience have you had being with other children other than this communal experience? I mean, could it, is it possible? Like Moshe is arguing with these kids and you're like, I don't want to be around these kids. Is it possible that just y'all just weren't vibing with this other family? I mean, that, that is, that could be, yeah, I'm sure. I mean, but it's like, there were three of them. Three families. No, no, three kids. But you know, like one of the kids was like, and then they also like teach your kid really bad things. Like, you know, like the kid would just like walk out on the deck and pee. And so then like my kid would start doing that and then it's like, yeah, like I think when you go out into the woods, kids, they can start to like go a little feral or something. You know what, I gotta just admit when I went, what, I was just thinking how in the country vacation rental that we still have, I was just on the deck peeing and I felt so liberating. It felt, it feels great. So cool. It's like, but, but yeah, I mean, I think what you're describing is really incredibly intimate and potentially catastrophic. Like, you know what, when I think of the communal living situation that Ram Dass was doing and it was sort of centered around a religion, like a tradition. There was and he would go from like communal living situation to communal living situation. He's like, I paid the bills and watched Tim's kids and Tim would, you know, everyone had like their, their kind of, you know, chores and place and things they did. Yes. But it's funny when I got there, they were like, yeah, this other family who came with us for a week, because we were there for like two months. The mom was like, she just would check out every, every night at six PM. And then I was like, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding. Every night at six, I was like, I'm going to go into the R trailer because we each had our own trailer that we could kind of escape to. But yeah, I really needed that. And there is something wonderful about like having people pick up the slack and having someone else do the dishes and every other night you have to cook. It's kind of crazy that like every night someone has to make dinner. You know, and if you're just a plain family living by yourselves, which most of us are or just a person, it's like, it's, it's mind boggling to me that we have to like, it's just, it just becomes so boring, I guess. Like, okay, let's cook dinner now. Like let's start thinking every night at four o'clock what we're going to cook for dinner. Right. When I was single, I would just eat Cheerios at night and, you know, do my thing. But y'all are in LA. You could just order. No, of course. Of course. I mean, you can't do that in the woods, obviously. Oh, you're saying the woods, right? So, okay, so this is interesting. This is really, okay, this, this helps me understand that what was happening with you. I was so confused about what was going on. Duncan, have you ever never, have you never heard that people make their Instagram lives seem really fun and exciting? What? I thought everyone was very honest about that. I thought everybody was very honest. No, you know, no, it didn't, it's, I don't think that you are projecting your Instagram is the best because it's so honest. And I think you would be surprised at how beneficial that is for all of us who are going through varying weird things during this pandemic. You know, a lot of people look up to you and to see like some of the images of like piles of clothes or chaos. And you know, we're like, okay, great. This isn't just me. This is happening across the board. So I think there's something cool about it, but the thing didn't necessarily seem pleasant to me. I, the idea of living communally doesn't even strike me as good as in my, the fantasy version of it. I'm already miserable, much less the actual thing itself. But when I have had those experiences, I've noticed how wonderful it is to have a community around you, not just because they're going to cook and stuff, but like emotionally, you know what I mean? Like there, like there's a, if it's a big enough community, you feel kind of held to some degree by them. And you know, especially if there's more than just we're going to live together. Like if there's some kind of, you know, something that everyone's connecting on. Yeah. Trying to not get COVID. Right. That's our religion. But yeah, you, I was more like, you were more in a walking dead situation that maybe what you would call a commune. Well, I wanted my kids to like socialize with people, you know, it's like, that's something that is obvious. Obviously it's important to listen to scientists and it's important to not get COVID, but it's also important to like, you know, kids brains need to like be inspired and like activated by other children their own age. And it's like, we can't just like keep everyone separate. But wait, when you were just talking about Instagram, made me realize like there's such this, this like explosion of like, mainly women, like influencer type, everyone wants to be an influencer, like girls I know are now like telling you how to eat and telling you how to act. And all these influencer, like this resurgence or this like new career that's, that's like people are just like, I'm going to tell you how to act and look how great my life is. And it's like, this is all happening during like a time when we're all kind of privately depressed. It just is like such a lie, obviously, you know, like, why do you know what's going on and how I should act and what I should eat. And are you really eating like that? The whole thing. So I think my, I just try to be honest and like, you know, show the chaos. Yeah. I mean, thank God, you know, this is, I hopefully I pull this off because. Yeah, I, people need, I think it's better for people to hear that. Yeah. Right now it's hard to be married and right now it's hard to live with people and right now. I mean, talk about being single. No one's touching you. I mean, how, I mean, I know people are getting out now and the vaccines, how, you know, the rollout is, is good and, you know, thank God. But yeah, it's like my single friends are like, I haven't been touched. It's like, that, that just sounds so hard. Oh my God. Yeah, that, yes, that, that sounds like it. I don't know what I would have, I do know what I would have done. I've thought about, if I were single during the pandemic, I think I would have just. Got in a cat. No, I would have resumed, well, I would have resumed ketamine addiction. Oh my God. That's awful. I would have just bought thousands and thousands of dollars worth of ketamine and bought a lot of weird synthesizers and I think I just would have numbed. Don't tell your followers that that is a bad idea. I don't mean it. That's a good thing. I mean, like it would be around you when you've been on that kind of thing. Like I just remember you like flushing things down a toilet. Like that never ends well. No, it's, I can't. It's tear. I mean, it's no, I know. I mean, I, there's no way, there's just no way out. That's the problem is. Remember you said avoid white powders. Well, that's before I think I done ketamine and then was like, this is not a white powder to avoid. This is the best thing ever. And of course that's what I said because I was getting addicted to it. That's what everybody says when they get addicted to something. But yeah, I mean, I, that's why I feel lucky to have the inconvenience and the burden and the stress and the anxiety and the claustrophobia of having kids and being married right now because it, it, it doesn't allow the same level of profound selfishness that you can achieve when you're single. I mean, just, you can just maximize your selfishness. Yeah. And I'm not saying like selfishness, like you're greedy or something. I just mean self absorption because you're just by yourself. Well, these single people all better learn French or some new language or the saxophone or something. Oh God. Yeah. That's the, that's, that's the other thing is the pandemic achiever club where like, while all of us have been like, you know, dealing with our own demons, they're like, I've learned how to bank bread and I can read Sanskrit. It's like, fuck you. The pandemic achievement club. Yeah. So congratulations to any of y'all who got abs and did the thing and like, but even then I, there's a, I think what you're commenting on an Instagram, there's a kind of frantic quality to it. It's like when you're watching someone do pull ups in a prison movie, you know, it's like, yeah, I'm doing it. But it's like, yeah, but you're still just like all of us, you know, having to come to terms with this reality of that, that, you know, society isn't stable in the way we thought it was. And that's really scary. Yes. And then also with Instagram, I think kind of one of the lower depths of misery to me is like reading your comp, like refreshing your page, reading your comments. Like that's something that like, that would be because I saw a girl doing that once in like, we were in, I was in line for something and I saw someone doing that. And I was like, that is so sad. And then I was like, Oh, I do that. And, you know, it's like, that's something you wouldn't want someone to see you doing, right? Like that's something you kind of like move your phone to kind of privately because you, it's a private thing and it's like a private thing in a gross way. And I would love to like get that part of my life out because people, you know, people are mean and cruel. And then all of a sudden, all these like mean things are in your psyche. And, and why do you care with these people are purposely saying mean things to you? Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. It's, it's a, Now I shouldn't have said that. Now everyone's going to be like, this woman saw it. Like I'll go to your page. I'll read the comments. They'll say how no women are funny. No, I think I really think that I have done a permafly dip. Of my podcast. For that thing that you, that you used to were a car got costed by that. And what, and what happened is, you know, my friend Connor, a beep, taught me about this. He's just said, if you're not careful, if you are a white guy with any kind of like voice in the world, then you're going to get these all these angry, like, all right weirdos that just attach themselves to you. And yeah, but I think via Instagram and via guess I've had on this show, they've left me. I was a joy. I just, that was when I went on Instagram. No, like realizing like, well, this sucks. People think it's because of you. It all started with you. You posted a picture of God. What's her name? Oh my God. Divine. Oh yeah. And it said something like get, vote them out. It was just, I saw, I just thought it was cool. I ripped it off your Instagram, posted on my Instagram. I credited you. But I just thought it was cool. Instantly of flood of people on my Instagram who are all Trump people. And it was really embarrassing and really like a come to Jesus moment for me. Cause I was like, oh fuck, I'm just like covered in these lice that have somehow gotten confused regarding my point of view on, on some things. And then I started posting pictures of like, you know, a kid getting a vaccine and they're Biden, you know, just pictures that I knew would upset them. But are they bots? No, they weren't bots. They were just a lot of like, you know, QAnon people, Trump people who had just decided for, I can't even, who just decided that I was like, like one of them. And I think I've shaken, hopefully shaken most of them off. Like there might be a few people clinging there. But yeah, so I don't think that's going to happen this time. Hopefully. I got what I was going to read you this. I looked at my, every time I look at my Instagram, there's just like something terrible here. Here's one that someone said yesterday. I posted a picture. Eek. You look like a used tampon. Someone thought they'd get another day out of. Oh my God. Like the level of hatred from, I guess it's, I'm sure it's mostly men, right? Oh, his skank hunt. That's his, that's his, his, his name. But it's just like, I just feel like as a woman, yeah, it's just constant, but it's not real. So I mean, yeah, maybe I did look bad, but it's just like, it's just not a real thing that we should be concerned about. I think there's something to be concerned about it. Yeah. I don't think it's a danger, but I, for me, like anytime I've gotten, you know, the level of hate that you can achieve online, it's, it's, it's more, it's more thinking in terms of like, that's a, that's a person. Skank hunt is a person, right? And that's a person who has dehumanized you. If, if skank hunt had had it, like understood that you, that just because you have like some kind of fame or success doesn't change the reality that you can feel and that you are just as confused as anybody else and just as wanting to be happy as anybody else. I don't think they would do that, but I think something about the way we interact with each other online creates this like possibility of just completely dehumanizing a person. And then in that, you're becoming like hyper aggressive like that. And then, cause they don't think they're important. That's the main thing. Obviously skank hunt, when skank hunt at night is thinking about himself, he's not thinking like, I'm a really remarkable person. You know, I've, a lot of people want to hear what I have to say. And you know, I really want to help the world. He just is lost in a dreamy state of like, I don't mean anything to anybody. You know, I don't, I'm nothing to nobody. So I'm sure on, when I was on Chelsea lately, I said really mean things about people, you know, that was kind of the job. Yeah. Hopefully there's like some kind of, I don't know. I hopefully as, as all of this, you know, me too is happening. And, and, and you know, I feel like black lives matter. And I feel like maybe there, there could be this like 60s level of consciousness level raising that could happen among everybody. We could all start realizing that our actions. Yeah. But I don't know, that's probably not going to happen. Meanwhile, QAnon is like happening. So it's happening to you though. I mean, you are, you are just, you're different now. And for the better, it's, you know, when, when we were coming up in comedy, that style of comedy that Chelsea handler was like one of the like figureheads of, which was like viciously attacking famous people. I guess being that if you're famous, if you're a celebrity, you've got it so good, then, you know, the, you know, getting roasted. It doesn't really hurt you. It's, if anything, it adds to your fate, but it's, it's all for fun anyway. Right. And so, yeah, that was the idea. And it wasn't just Chelsea lately. It was, think of all the different shows that popped up, like at least the roasts that you're on, the person's right there and gets to respond. And it's cool because they signed up for it. It's consensual. Whereas the other stuff that I also, when we were doing the lavatory, I'm sure many times I can't even remember, I would say shitty things about a famous person. Never imagining they would even notice me, much less like feel hurt by something I had to say. Yes. And that's probably thrilled that I just mentioned them. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Yeah. Skank Hunt was probably like about to eat rat poison or something. It's like, you know what, maybe there, maybe I should keep saying shitty things to people online. But yeah, I don't know. I think there is a collective humanization happening. And how you create good karma is like in the moment when you're about to send something or say something you decide not to. And it's like in that tiny little moment is where you can start making differences in your lives or even like checking your at replies. It makes you feel bad. But like in that moment, you can be like, okay, I have the strength to not do this. I have the strength to not like pick whatever that thing is. It's like not a positive thing for you. Oh yeah. That moment is so interesting. That's like, that's the bundled up some total of all your karma is in that moment. And that's in meditation that you can start making that moment longer and longer and longer. So you have more time with that thing that is so interesting. It's just an impulse. It's not much at all. Like the thing that keeps you doing what you do. If you really look at it, it's hardly anything. That's what's fascinating about it. The thing where you send the shitty email. Or say the shitty thing or get revenge or whatever. Those preceding moments. It's like. The impulse just isn't even that strong. Do you know what I mean? Like it's not about expanding the moment. How do you expand that moment? You make one decision to not do something. That's hurtful. And then. And don't put the bar up at the end of your sentence and don't check it. You just kind of try to keep doing things that will. Expand it. Well. The answer is ketamine Natasha. Hey, I'll try it. But. No, no, no, no. A babysitter. Oh, no. I mean, I think therapeutically it's great, but not the way I was doing it. The. So there's, you know, there's all kinds of ways that they. Teach that it could be done where. Generally the practice of meditation. Watching your breath familiar. Familiarizing yourself with the moment to moment you. You know, like that, that can just, that can be enough. When I'm meditating every day. And the moment pops up. Then normally I wouldn't even notice. And that moment is in between. Me not being an asshole and me being an asshole. I'll notice. Oh, wait, this is the fact. There's that thing. Oh, that's not real. I don't think that's real. Oh, what happens if I just don't do it? And then. Then you don't do it and your whole machine gets fucked up. I mean, that's what's so cool is the. And if your entire experience has been. Habitual and then you, you disrupt it. What world are you in the moment after you've disrupted a thing you've been doing for your whole life? I mean, that's a different world. It's like a different universe. And it's not just your whole life. It's like with technology now, like I'm so much more addicted to my phone than I was a year ago. And sometimes I'll just like, right after I've exhausted every single tab and every single thing, I pick it up and like two, I'll get, you know, drink one sip of water and then pick it up again. And it's like that habitual nature. Like there's nothing there for me. Like what do I, it's like more pandemic porn or more, more. What do people think and of me and of what I said and, you know, what else can I look at that might give me, I think you said like mainlining the news or, you know, it's like none of that is, is, I mean, obviously you want to be informed, but I do feel like we're kind of being wired to be so addicted to it. So maybe even just trying to start with the phone in terms of, for me, in terms of like creating better karma in my life and less depression. I think that could really help me. Yeah, yeah, for sure. I mean, yeah, definitely for everybody. Have you heard about these, what are they? I think they're called serotonin fasts or dopamine fasts. I can't remember what's neurotransmitter, but have you heard of this? Like it's like, it's like basically you turned, obviously you turn your phone off, but it's not just that. You reduce your sensory input for 24 hours to almost nothing. So it's almost like you're meditating, but it's not just that you're not looking at your phone. You're not looking at bright colors. You're not doing it. Yeah, you're just like, there's no activation of that part of your brain for some amount of time. And then when you go back into the world, you, you don't, it's like, it's, I guess it's the same thing they say about like a lot of people's palates have been corrupted by sugar. And like we've become accustomed to very powerful tastes, but if you start eating food that's a little more bland over time, that food will start tasting as good as an Oreo or whatever. And so the phone is like sugar for the brain. And so if you sort of go off of that constant high, then going outside and walking will seem as exciting. Theoretically, I haven't done this, but you know, suddenly when you're just doing things that used to be in the eighties called life, you know, I used to get excited about books. I would buy a book as a kid and be like, Holy shit, I've got a new book because there wasn't a phone to go into. There wasn't anything but the book. Are you able to get into a book now? Have you, have you found that you can still do that? Audio books. I can do audio books. The reading part of my brain sadly seems to have been somewhat warped or something like, but audio books, I consume a lot of books by listening to them when I go like jogging or go up in the woods or something or just, yeah, what about you? No, everything is a struggle. But I have some kind of like situation. Wait, Duncan, sorry, I need to get my charger. Yeah, sure, no problem. I'll hit pause on this. These are, look, I think that you're doing, all of us are doing really good considering what we're dealing with. Also, you're a, you're a comic. You're a touring comedian ever since I've known you. That's your life is this rhythm of doing shows and writing jokes for the shows and doing shows. But I'm out of that rhythm. Exactly. Like you're, like we've all been in a cocoon. Yes, we don't like the thing that for us was more than just a job. But like almost like a form of spirituality or way to check in with the world or the real checking of the phone. You know, like was getting on stage and trying a joke in front of a crowd of people and their instant reaction. That was the real thing. And we don't have that right now. And I think a lot of performers, it's in, it's our nature to be in denial or something or, and just forget like, oh yeah, we're, we haven't been able to perform for a year now, responsibly. And that's fucked up. Like, and we, I mean, I always thought comedy would be the, like when's comedy going to go away? We'll always be able to go and do shows. But that's, that got vanquished for a while. That was the one thing every comedian always said. Yeah. Yeah. They'll always be a way to do shows and then gone. But how are you doing with that? Have you been working on any new jokes or? No. Like no joke writing at all. I mean, I haven't. I feel like, I feel like consumed. I feel consumed by like keeping myself and my family safe. So I feel like I have to like read every article and stress about every strategy and like, you know, like can, can, like I really wanted my child. That's why we were, you know, that's how I found myself living in a commune. Because I wanted her to be able to socialize, you know, and for her to be able to, you know, be able to, you know, be able to, you know, be able to develop. So, you know, I just feel like I haven't really. And maybe it's just being a woman or maybe I worry too much, but I do feel like a lot of my time and energy is spent in like managing, you know, my, my fear and making good decisions. Because every decision, even if you like decide to go get your hair cut. You know, if you're like a new mother, that's so much, you know, because on top of that, you're just like a new, a new mom. So you don't really know. We just had a off record moment. Natasha and I are getting caught up and we're both talking about how we both feel depressed. And I was just telling her, you know, the, you know, how I just got in a rotten fight with Erin yesterday and how horrible it is to what, like our forest started, you know, was very upset and crying. And you were telling me you would. Yeah. Today we got into a fight and then the kid was like, can you turn the music on? And like, it wasn't even a fight. It was just like, you know, it was not nice. Yeah. Yeah. And then, and then I love what you said because you said it's not just like getting into the fight. It's making sure that they see you make up. And I think that if I could start remembering that, that would really in, in every way. Yeah. It's the resolution. That's what Trudy Goodman told me. And, and I, you know, I love that. And, but, you know, it's never going to like now, like watching your child get upset because you're fighting with their mother. Or their mother's fighting with you. It's, I can't get, I'm never going to get that out of my head. And, and I feel so guilty about it, but people fight. I mean, people fight. People who have conflict, people don't aren't, don't get along all the time and trying to, trying to cause Aaron and I actually talked about it. We talked about, should we have our fights in private? Yeah. That's what I was thinking. Maybe that would be better. Yeah. Just never fight in front of the kid. Yeah. My parents, my, you know, physically fought in front of me. And that was really terrible. And I would never, I hope I would never get in. I mean, obviously I'm not, I would never be in that situation. Like that was my life's goal is to never be in that situation. You know, so. Yeah. So when I picked someone, I knew we had like a great rapport in that way. But, you know, it's just like obviously with the, the circumstances of life, you know, it's very hard to not ever raise your voice at someone from like 8am and 6pm or 8pm. Yeah. It's hard. And it's, it's, yeah. Well, you know, we, trying to make it fun and resolving it when there was an issue is like so important. Yes. And honestly resolving it. And if it's not resolved, then it's not, then don't fake resolve it. I mean, the, the idea, I, I think the idea is, well, what we decided was we shouldn't fight in private. Because then it's a lot. It's the kids aren't going to learn that this is a normal thing. And so when they're getting angry with each other, when they're fighting, they'll think something's gone wrong. There's a malfunction here. People don't fight, but, you know, so, so, and, you know, this is one of the things I like about being married and having kids is it, it really does force a resolution. It forces you to work through a thing because you've worked so hard to be married. You work so hard to, to harmonize with a person and it is work, good work, but work. And so there's a lot at stake that in maybe a less, you know, in a, in a non-child related relationship, you might be like, no, I don't have time for this bullshit. This, you know, and then you get to like go and repeat the cycle over and over again of getting in relationship and out of it and over and over and over. So it forces a resolution. There's a evolution that happens too. But yeah, I mean, we, you know, it's the, it's, it's conflict resolution is what the whole world needs to learn. You know, that's what we have to peaceful conflict resolution. It's the, my parents, depending on which marriage, my mom mostly after my dad had to fight some private, but none of it. You don't think that, you don't think that was good. Oh, because your mom's a therapist. So that was probably a tactic on her part. I know. I think that what happened is that my mom was, it felt ashamed that she had been in so many marriages. And so she didn't want me to see them not working again. She felt guilty or something. You know, yeah, no, I don't think it was a therapist decision. I think it was just, she felt guilty. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard. And I think that's why I'm so happy for my child. Cause I feel like her, her vision of what it is to be a woman and be able to like never need a man. If you don't, you know, even just like coinciding with all the egg freezing and the technology that's happening so women can have babies later. I just think it's really exciting for women to like, you know, hopefully create a matriarchy. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, this is something Joachim Trevor Rivache said, which I refer to when I'm in my like really dark selfish moments. Whatever the ism may be, or archie in this case, matriarchy, patriarchy, communism, socialism, libertarianism, whatever the thing may be. If you really want to create positive change in society, figure out a way to create harmony within your family. That's it. That's it. And that transcends class class that transcends capital that transcends everything because it's the, it's like fire. Right. It's an elemental thing. We've always done this as long as there's been people and it's probably always been hard. And it's always been confusing. And so, you know, for me, anytime Aaron and I do not just resolve a disagreement that we're having, but get, but really get honest with each other. You know, like when I told her, I've been not, I've been lying to you. I haven't wanted to tell you I'm fucking depressed right now. I just, I don't, I didn't want to like deal with it myself. And I don't want to be that kind of parent, like, oh, daddy's in a mood. That thing, you know, mentally ill parent, but it's just something I've had to deal with my whole life. How do you know if it goes away or if you need medication? That's the question of the hour. Obviously alcohol can help a little bit, you know, just like if you don't have, you know, alcohol addiction, but then it's like, it becomes, oh, you know, at least I can always soothe my nerves if I need to, but then. Yeah, I can't booze is like, it's good that I we've said it because there are certain things just immediately go off the table for me because I do have a regimen when I'm real when I'm finally coming to terms with the fact that I'm fucking depressed. Number one, I'm annoyed because I'd actually, I thought I'd made it through the winter without getting every winter I get a little depressed. It's every winter. And I really was telling a friend of mine, it didn't happen to me this year. And then, ah, fuck, here it is again. So that's, that's annoying because I was feeling this weird pride of like, wow, I didn't go fucking blue this winter. But yeah, this, so then, yeah, booze off the table. That doesn't work for me. You don't drink when you're depressed. I can't. It's a depressant. Right. So if I drink, I'm going to, you can't even have like a glass of wine at dinner. No, I mean, I could, but what it just, what it fucks with my sleep. So and then for me, like, all of it seems to be really tied into like sleep. So what, what I'll do is I won't get enough sleep. And then if I, if I can pull off not getting enough sleep, then maybe I'll get manic, which will make me feel creative. But it's still, I'm still going to put that's putting off the depression. So it's just like, okay, I mean, it helped so much to say it out loud. And then, and then now she knows it. And it's like, oh yeah, we could deal with this together. It's something we could totally deal with. I've dealt with it before. It's nobody, it's, it's, I know what to do. I'm like, get enough sleep, drink enough water, exercise and stay fucking honest. And yeah, unfortunately I can't get drunk or drink until it's like truly resolved. And even then, who knows? I mean, booze is like, ugh. Oh, so you're anti, anti-alcohol right now. No, I love booze. I love all drugs. I love to get high, but the repercussions for a person who gets depressed of alcohol are pretty severe. Like it, you know, hangovers suck anyway, but try a hangover when you're depressed. It's like, you know, it's, it's like the devil's peanut butter and jelly. It's like the two go hand in hand, you know, but what about you? I mean, I know you don't, you, you, you haven't experienced it before, but you feel like you've got the tendrils of it or something. I mean, what, what are you doing to work with it? Oh, um, I don't, nothing. I mean, I'm just like, I'm kind of in torpor. Yeah. Yeah. Yep. Well, I'm, I'm, but I, but I'm willing, this is why maybe I, you know, I'm willing to try. I want to start doing something about it. You know? Yeah. I mean, it's, it's a. Empowering things, you know, things that aren't based in fear all the time. But like, what can I do to like feel creatively inspired? And how can I have more of my intake be things that are like edifying for me? Right. And so, and intake also like social, like walking down the street and running into someone. And, you know, like I took a walk the other day and ended up seeing like three or four comedians. And it was so nice to like just talk to people outside. Yes. It feels so novel. Yeah. And, you know, I think that we need that. Yes. That we, God, what happened? Novelty and physical activity. And those are the two things that make your brain feel good. And like we're not, I'm not getting those things, you know, everything's the same. Right. Yep. Groundhogs day. Yeah. Yeah. It's the worst. I know what you mean. Right. And then the phone only fucks it up that much more because, you know, that's the other thing is like as a form of self medic. Cating when you're getting depressed, you will go to anything. And if you're feeling depressed, of course you're going to go into your phone because it's helping you get some serotonin or dopamine in there, which is what's lacking when you're depressed. So it makes total sense. Now that I think about it, why I've been so particularly addicted to Hearthstone lately, which is like, it's like the CIA just fake, just invented this game that just, just blasts the, the happy juice out of your brain. But it's like, as it's happening, you know, it's artificial. It's not the real thing. But this is, you know, this is why like addiction springs up with depression. They go in hand in hand because you're, you're trying to self medicate. You want to get better naturally. You don't want to be depressed. You're trying to get it better. And so the easy fixes are always drugs or booze or something like that. That's easy, but usually it doesn't work. God imagine if booze treated depression, do you know how we would be in the happiest the planet would be just filled with people singing to the hills because it doesn't work. We'd be in the sound of music everywhere all day long. Yeah. Okay. Oh, go ahead. No, please. Duncan, I want to ask you a question. Would you secretly like to have deep fakes made of you? Hell no. Do you want deep fakes made of you? No, but I just think you're someone who I was thinking maybe it's a, it was, I don't know. I just thought it'd be funny. No, my God. No, I mean, it's an, it's an inevitability for all of us. I'm sure you already have deep fakes made of you at the recess of the internet. It's an inevitability that we're all going to have to live with, you know, but no, I don't want deep fakes made deep fakes. You know what Game of Thrones, when everyone's like winter is coming, you know, they're all fighting each other. That's deep fakes. Like, whatever the fucking particular thing you're upset about or whoever you're at war with online or whatever hill you're currently dying on, just forget it. It's the deep fakes are going to like completely unravel society as we know it. How do you learn how to make a deep fake? That's, that's, that's the thing is like anytime I've looked it up, it seems super complex, you know, cause obviously as a comedian, like, you know, I'm like, Oh, cool. I'm going to make a deep fake of Brendan. How many times I wanted to like make a deep fake of Walsh. And then I go and look, I'm not spending 20 hours on this, you know, project. But I've known you when you've learned, when you've learned like HTML code, like you're good at that. Like you actually have a capacity for it. So I bet you could learn how to do it. Oh, no, I'm never, I'm not good. It's too late. I'll just, it's too late. The terrifying thing about deep fakes is that we're already in our phones. We associate our phones with reality and there's a real possibility that at some point someone could intercept our phones and do deep fakes. So of every single person we know. So we wouldn't even know that we weren't talking with our friends. You know, we would happen all at once. Well, yeah. I mean, not now I'm saying in 10, 20 years, that's going to be a weapon, which is all of a sudden everyone is going to get, you know, facetimes or calls from their friends. And every, their friends are going to like say scary things to them or say they need money or, you know, threaten them or, and it's going to create disruption. It's like a, it's a disrupting like. You said it would affect our parents more though. Well, no, I mean, they'll be like thinking that that we're at, they won't understand how it works is, or can't you like a code word or something? Yeah, that's what I was telling you. Yeah, we're going to have to all have code words, which is like, if I ever call you Natasha and I'm like, listen, I don't have much time. Please. I'll explain later. I need an Amazon gift card. I would give it to you. I know your life. But that's, but that's why you have to be like, okay, what's the word we came up with? And, and would I say, um, yeah, it's really hard to know because it would be so weird if you were to FaceTime me out of the blue. Yeah. You know, and then to ask me for money. It's an emergency. I'm sorry for FaceTime you. I could only, you know what, whatever the fuck I've already given them the words. They won't even have to deep fake that part. And then I would get, I would get the Amazon card for you. And yeah, it's, I guess it's like a new scam. I feel like somewhere in the process of getting an Amazon card for me, you would be like, this is something is somebody would be like, no, don't do that. That, that, that, that part we, we don't have to worry about. I mean, the real implication of deep fakes is just, it fits into simulation theory because the real question we have to ask ourselves is, are we actually some kind of cosmic deep fake? Like, is this a higher technology? Emulating a previous Natasha and a previous Duncan that don't exist anymore. If we already been digitized and are they just, you know, part of the multiverse. Yeah. That's the scary thing. Look, this, this was a wonderful time I had chatting with you. I appreciate all your time. And also I, on behalf of all the depressed people of the planet, we thank you for being honest that you're feeling it too. Because it, it, we all benefit from just that's for all my depressed fans, you know what I'm talking about. You got to say it out loud. That's the first step. You know, so it's good that you're saying it out loud. And also it's good that you're giving all the people who feel like they're beyond depression or that it's not something that could get them. When they hear you say it, it's like, I think it's quite liberating because this is a, we live in the age of depression right now. It's the, it makes sense that you feel like that. Well, thank you. And yeah, it's, it's been great talking to you. It's great catching up with you. Thank you so much for your time. You've got a show coming up. Don't you with Todd Barry? What is that? That's on March 26th. I don't know if this is going to air before then. It will. So yeah, we're doing a zoom comedy show. Wow. I've done one. Brave. And it was great, but I feel like it might be like my first time on stage, like my first time on stage, I like totally crushed and like, I was like, I mean, it felt like I was on drugs and it was like waves of laughter. Like I could feel the laughter. And then like my second time on stage, I had like this huge head and I was like, I'm going to tell them about my next performance at this open mic. Cause they're going to want to come, you know, and I was just, it was like a total bomb. You know, I was like, started doing crowd work. I told some guy he smelled like the whole bar kind of turned on me. You know, I went home and like laid in bed and like was just like, Oh, this is going to take a long time. You know, like, I, so anyway, zoom comedy. Am I excited about it? Oh, it's mostly crowd work though. It's going to be like Todd making fun of people probably. And I mean, he's like so funny with his crowd work. So I'm just doing it to, to just watch him do that for an hour and a half. You're going to do great. What a, what a courageous thing you're talking about. Have you tried it? Have you tried to do comedy on zoom? Hell no. That's the new, that's the new forum for us, you know, like, no, I would smuggle acid into Mexico with Ramdas before I would do comedy on zoom. No, wait, you are fearless and you are never let me cancel. I can't just be like, Hey, it's like, it's like on our birthday. No, the world needs to do it. Do the show. I'm going to buy a ticket. No. I'm just kidding. No, no, please come to my show. Thank you. Duncan, you're not invited though. Okay. I won't come guys. Come to this show. Thank you, Natasha. I will put all the links to your wonderful podcast and everything else you want. Thanks for, I really appreciate it. It's great catching up. Okay. Bye. Bye.

302^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - DAN HARMON AND EMIL AMOS-LIVE FROM THE IMPROV Transcript and Discussion^2014-05-28^One in four car batteries is weak, and needs to be replaced! Let our professional parts people test your battery for free at O'Reilly Auto Parts. My name is Lucille Limone, and one year ago I hired a web designer to build a website to display my hand knitted American history themed neckties and business gloves. The web designer stopped returning my phone calls, and when I threatened to take him to Small Clang's court to get my 6000 deposit, he put an alligator in my window while I was sleeping. The alligator chewed both of my arms off in one of my feet. Now I'm forced to knit with my mouth, and remaining foot in my work has suffered greatly. Now I cannot enjoy an alligator show, or the smell of Doritos, without thinking of the morbidly obese con man alligator wrangler, who not only destroyed my business, but ruined my life. Hello my name is Duncan Trussell, host of the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast, and inventor of the Hikers' Comb. Unfortunately the story you just heard is not an isolated incident. One of the number one causes of dismemberment in the United States is from getting mauled by a deadly animal placed in your window by an unscrupulous web designer. From bears to honey badgers, the neighborhoods of America are filled with the screams of innocent victims who awaken to find their bodies being ripped apart by the sharp vicious teeth of deadly animals. This could happen to you, but it definitely won't if you use Squarespace to build your website.

You don't need to go outside. If you're going to go outside, make it because you're on a bicycle or going camping or figuring out how to build solar panels or bowing down at the feet of some forest guru who's teaching you how to astrally project and walk through walls. There's no need to spend their precious time here on this beautiful green living planet wandering through the hell mazes that are the chain stores of America. Do you really want to bleed?

And of course, we have a shop and you can check out some of our shirts. We've got an amazing new t-shirt coming in from Ron Regi. And we're going to replace the logo t-shirts that took forever to replace because of various catastrophes related to global warming. But soon the shop will be stocked up again. Go check it now. Maybe you'll find a shirt that you like. Okay, let's get this podcast going. Let me just say before this starts that a few nights ago, I did a live podcast at the Hollywood improv and then we had an after party and it was definitely, I think it was one of the top three best nights of my life. The other two best nights of my life were involved being abducted by an alien and flown to a paradise planet on a small little meteor in Alpha Centauri. But this was definitely the third greatest night. It was amazing not only to find out that a live podcast can really work, but it was the coolest part of it was meeting all of you guys who came to the show. You guys are the coolest people ever. It was so fun getting to meet you in person and then getting to hang out with you at the R-Bar where we had a wonderful after party with DJ's Emel Amos and Nina Tarr and Demon Babies. So I just want to say thank you to all of you guys who came to see the show and thank you to everyone who gave me so many cool gifts, including a laser edged water bottle that has gratitude written on it. So the idea is that apparently there was that experiment done. I don't, there's a parent, I can't remember the guy's name, but apparently if you put like a smiley face in front of water, it makes it happy. Do I necessarily believe that? Absolutely not. But it's still a beautiful water bottle. So thank you for that. Thank you so much for the awesome comic book and thank you, thank you for the party rats. Somebody gave me the most amazing gift that has really transformed my life. These are tiny little light rats that you can strap on your finger. They're great for parting, but they're also fantastic for night blogging, which is something that I really love to do. So it was amazing to see all you guys and we're going to start doing that once a month, I think. Keep your ears peeled, opened, keep your ears opened and peeled because we're going to be doing more of these and I sure as hell hope you guys will keep coming out. So here we go. Here's a live podcast. I'm sorry if I seem, if it seems a little different than a normal interview, but it's a different dynamic when you're in front of an entire group of people and I was nervous in the beginning. And then when I realized that the room was just filled with a kind of awesome love vibe, I definitely, I think I loosened up and Harman and Emil who are the guests are geniuses. So it was really, there was really nothing that you could do wrong because those guys were always there to pick up the ball if I dropped it, which I hopefully I didn't do too many times. So here we go. The guests on this today's podcast are Emil Amos. You can follow him on Twitter. That's Emil underscore Amos. There'll be a link to that on the comment section of this website. And he's also got an album out on bandcamp called Lost Decade Two. You can listen to a song that we recorded together called Alter in the Woods. All those links are going to be on my website. Today's other guest is Dan Harman. He is the creator of community. He is also the creator of the adult swim show Rick and Morty. And he's also the host of an amazing podcast called Harman Town. So you should definitely listen to that. It's also on Farrell audio, the podcast network that this podcast is on. Okay, everybody, now please open your third eyes, send out your love tendrils, not just to these two awesome human beings, but also to the entire group of 200 meat bodies that gathered together to see the first Los Angeles live Duncan Tressel family hour podcast. Hare Krishna. Please welcome Duncan Tressel of the Duncan Tressel family hour. Wow. Hi. Hello. Thank you. Thank you so much. This is amazing. Wow, this is really crazy. I'm so excited that, you know, I was just talking to Dan Harman and he was saying, isn't it great to find out that all those years of working on material or for nothing because that is so cool. Such a great thing. It's so exciting what's happening with podcasts. It's amazing to think that they've drawn an entire crowd of people to the improv. So cool. You know, the way I see it, if you get a group of 200 people together in a room, then the first thing you always have to do after saying hello is to get them to intone the sacred om. So I was thinking we could all just do that for a little while, just make the oming sound and relax and sort of shift the energy in this club a little bit because it is a comedy club. And probably right now at this very moment, there's some angry old comic just radiating poison energy into this room as he snarls that doing a podcast does not count as comedy. So let's do it. One, two, three. Oh. Sounds so cool. I'd rather do that for the whole show. We broke a glass! Yes! If we direct our energy, we can kill Putin tonight! Now, I think you'd want to. That guy's pretty awesome, actually. So okay, so I guess I have to start the podcast by, because it's weird right now that we're bifurcated because not all, there's a lot, you guys are here, but then there's also like a big audience out there on the internet. So as I've been thinking about how to do this, I've sort of been rolling around in my mind like, how do I bring you two together? And I was thinking what would be so awesome after I introduced the podcast is that we could all sing the theme song? Okay, cool. What's that? She said Duncan, Jonestown. Not tonight. Maybe in a few months after we really get to know each other, we'll drink poison, but I really just want... Oh, you're saying a lot of people don't... You guys might not know that the... You're welcome, right? I told... I forgot why you said that for a second. I thought you were accusing me of doing some kind of Jim Jones thing. But yeah, what she's saying is the theme song is the Jonestown Family Choir singing that for those of you guys who didn't know. I figured those little kids shouldn't... They shouldn't drink cyanide for nothing, like now there's songs on a podcast. That's kind of cool. Okay, so I'm just going to introduce the podcast for the internet. I don't know what's... This is going to sound really weird. This is the second live show I've ever done. So forgive me if it's a little bumpy or weird. I'm just going to have to figure out how to do the podcast live, because usually the way I do the podcast is I'm sitting in my house having had many glasses of coffee, glasses of coffee. I drink my coffee out of a wine glass. That's part of the process. And then I maybe eat a little marijuana and then sit in front of the computer and sort of record the intro over and over and over and over again for hours. My neighbors must think it's just like a schizophrenic lonely guy sitting there talking to himself in his underwear drinking coffee out of a wine glass. So forgive me if whatever I end up saying in the beginning doesn't... It just is real crumbly and strange, because normally I'd be going back and editing it. So anyway, here we go. So weird. Hello everybody. It's me, Dugga Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And we are recording in front of a live audience at the Hollywood Improv. Say hello. There are 200 meat bodies jammed into this room right now. And it's an incredible feeling. A lot of great energy is in here right now, all of you listening out there on the internet. And before I started recording this part of it, I told everybody that we are going to say hello to you by singing the theme song. So do you guys know it? Do you guys know it? Okay, so maybe we'll do it. We'll sing two verses of it, and then we'll get going with a podcast. On the count of three, let's get going. One, two, three. Welcome, welcome all of you, that you are with us. Take hands, go meet you, be rude. Welcome to you. Great work. Great. But we're going to do it one more time. But this time, do it like you knew that your parents were going to make you drink cyanide in a few months. So we're really making a good performance. Okay, on the count of three, one, two, three. Welcome, welcome all of you, that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Awesome. That was perfect. Well, I'm not going to talk about, I don't know how caught up you guys are on the podcast, but over the last few weeks, I've gotten a severe bicycle addiction, and I can't stop. It's the strangest thing. I'm really hooked on riding a bicycle, and today I had my first case of bicycle rage, because you know the Lycra guys, if you see them go by when you're walking, they just seem to be seething anger. Once you're wearing Lycra, and you're on a bike, you become a kind of cruise missile that has to deal with people driving cars. You have to deal with people driving cars, and the more you ride a bike, the more people driving cars seem like the end result of a collapsing shit system. The more you're riding on your bike, because when you're riding on your bike, you are given this incredible gift, which is that the space between point A and point B becomes more important than any of the points. You're doing it for just to be in the space of riding your bike outside, and the more you ride your bike, the more you realize how car culture has basically robbed everyone of so many things, like the smell of cooking food, like when you're driving your car by people's houses, you don't smell that. When you're riding your bike, you can smell people cooking, you can listen to what's going on inside their house. Sometimes you hear them fucking, and then you put your bike down and you creep up to their windows. Cars have robbed us of that. They've robbed us of the ability to be voyeurs. They've robbed us of the joy of fervently masturbating next to someone's house, wearing your bicycle helmet and crying. But the other thing that cars rob you of is hills. They rob you of hills, and hills are something a few weeks ago, like three weeks ago. I don't know if you guys can see it, but there is a little bit of color in my hands. And for the last many, many years, my hands have been golem white, just the white of someone who just stays inside and just is completely stuck inside their house. But now this addiction is like, I'm actually getting a tan, and when I first started riding my bike, I began to dread the hills. That was something I got really worried about, and I would think like, oh, there's no way that I'm going to be able to get to these certain parts of town, because there's a steep, terrible hill in between me and that place, and there's no way I'm going to get my bike up it, and my ego's too big to get off my bike and push it up the hill. It's four-year-old pushing a trike. But then, now that I've gotten addicted, I've started going up these hills, and the weird thing that's happening is now I find myself longing for the hills more than going down the hill. I don't know if there's cyclists in the audience, if that's something that you experience, or if it means I might have a brain tumor or something. Fix gear. No brakes. No! Breaks! That's a terrible idea. I don't understand that. We can talk about that, but why do people not want brakes on their bike? It's a fixed gear, so you rely on locking up your legs and skinning your back tire. Why? Because it's just more dairy. That's what it is. What he's saying is really what starts happening is because you realize the rush of riding the bike is not just being outside and being in nature, but it's also there's an incredible rush when cars are getting really close to you. There's something really exciting about the danger, so what you're talking about is like, you love the idea of having to squeeze your legs together and push back on the tire just for the sheer horror of knowing that if you fuck up, you're going to slide in front of one of those concrete trucks, and that's it. No! I want brakes, man! I squeeze my brakes when I'm going downhill. I'm constantly terrified. Maybe that's why I don't like hills, because I'm a pussy and I don't want to go too fast, but I like what you begin to realize is that cars are robbing us of hills. They're robbing you of the thing that a hill teaches you, which is that if you keep trying to go up any hill, eventually your body is going to warp and conform so that you can then get up a hill. And it's clearly an obvious metaphor, which Donovan embodied in that incredible song, which I can't remember the name of. It's a Zen koan, which goes, first there is a mountain, then there is no mountain, then there is. And you guys have heard that? So if you guys have obviously listened to the podcast a bunch, you know that I tend to rave about how awesome technology is, and the credible idea that at this very moment where probably every selfie you take or every video you make will be assimilated by some futuristic supercomputer and allow people to wear virtual reality goggles and go backwards in time to have conversations with digitized versions of themselves who've been abused with artificial intelligence based on their social fingerprint. You guys know what I'm, no? Okay, cool. One of the cool things about doing this by yourself is like that everything's an awkward silence. So you don't know. So there's something exciting about the idea, to me, of the technology presented pre-bike. Pre-bike, the idea of being able to go open up digital wormholes and travel into virtual realities seemed like an incredible thing. But now that I've just been outside every day, all I want to do is like go up a hill and listen to birds and get to places where morbidly obese people can't come because those places are always more beautiful. They always are. The hill creates a barrier. The hill is the ultimate blockade for the parasitic shitheads of society who think about a hill in the same way vampires think about garlic. Like, no, it hurts you. So I had my first, anyway, I had my first case of bike rage today as I was going downhill and going super fast and some guy pushing one of those little ice cream truck things like tried to get in front of my bike and I pulled the brakes on and I almost wrecked into him and then I'm like, fuck you dumb shit, fuck. And I realized like you are, the whole hill thing is bullshit for you. You can't assimilate the idea that life is a journey. If you're screaming, some poor guy wants to sell ice cream, you asshole. But that's the thing that a bike ends up teaching you is that the tendency in the society that we're in is that they want to take the hills away from us and they act like that's giving you a gift. They want to take away that moment in between where you are and where you want to be, that incredible uphill struggle. They want to remove that from you or give you the illusion that hills could be taken away from anything. There's no way to get rid of hills. It's like getting wetness out of water. Hills are a natural part of existence and the struggle in between where you are and where you want to be is way better than any reward you get from finally arriving at the destination. And that, thank you. But that used to be the paycheck, you know? Like now there's a paycheck where if you do a certain number of things for a certain amount of weeks, you get a paycheck at the end of it. But it used to be there was no paycheck. Like everything was just the belly of a mother dog and humans were sort of wandering through that primordial, dangerous beauty just suckling on nipple after nipple after nipple, which was fishing or having sex or even getting attacked by a tiger. And I think that if there is a great conspiracy, the great conspiracy is that Barack Obama is an American. He is not an American. That's the only thing I wanted to say to you guys. He's a Kenyan and those hills have taught me that. When I'm riding up the hills, a bird lands. There's always the same bird. He's got seven eyes and he has an American flag and he says, tell them Obama is a fraud. I mentioned the whole thing about that weird getting to love the effort between point A and point B because my two guests today are the most hardworking, prolific people that I know in my life. They're not only are they two geniuses, but they have a work ethic unlike anything that I've ever seen. And it kind of acts like a little bit of sand in my bathing suit when I consider how absolutely hard they work to produce the stuff that they produce. So I'm hoping that we can talk a little bit in this podcast with them about the creative process and the question of when does leisure more important than production? And some of the ideas that I often have is I'm laying in my bed playing Hearthstone when I should be putting a podcast out. So we're just going to get the show going. Emil is going to come up. For those of you who haven't listened to the podcast, Emil Amos is a musician who plays drums for the band Olm. He also has his own band called The Holy Sons and he's going to come on stage and play some music for us. So give him a round of applause, everybody. Emil Amos!

And no! New paragraph Nothing to do with you! Hello! I'm not talking about you yet but I am talking to you Just you You know who you are You know I'm only pretending this is generic You know I'm looking directly at you and you alone And there is something I need to say to you That I would only want to say if I was talking to you I shouldn't have this kind of control over your life You should be floating through space and have Newtonian interactions Based on your gravity, your mass, your momentum I shouldn't be affecting you I think you should stop reading I promise that if you stop reading right now I will stop writing Okay, we both broke that deal Another paragraph What's this one going to be about? Is it going to be more bullshit about how sad lonely or scared I am? You don't have time for this shit If I'm going to say nothing of any importance to you The least I could do is keep it short If I'm going to talk about you, can't I just get to it? You don't have all day You have a conversation scheduled immediately after this To talk about me talking about you I feel bad about this enormous mountain of self-expression I can't imagine how angry you must be When you pull up to it in your empty pickup truck And see how many meaningless chunks of me You'll have to toss over your shoulder Before you find anything that reflects enough of your special face Well here, let me give you a break Here's a shiny gem about you I think you're stupid, selfish, and untalented Here, let me help you load that into your truck You vacuous piece of shit We'll strap it with some bungee Actually, why don't I ride with you So I can help you get this onto your identity pile It can be pretty heavy to realize that I perceive you As a wimpy, empty, self-important bore Is this your pile here? Oh wow, impressive Man, you sure have a lot of stuff from other people on here No, no, that's not a judgment Although I suppose if it was, it would go right on this pile Okay, let's get this big mother off your truck Man, I really let you have it with this one, you parasite This is bigger than anything you've already got Now, I'm required to say this to everyone, just as a formality You do realize, of course, that this giant jewel you got from Mount Harmon While inspired by you and reflective of you Is not you, and that its value is a piece of expression Is not value that can be directly attributed to you But is, in fact, the direct result of Dan Harmon's tendency To make things interesting Okay, good, I know it's obvious, but I'm required to tell people that You know, as long as I'm here, mind if I take a look at who you really are? I wouldn't mind getting underneath a lot of this stuff, let's sort of... Can we do a little experiment here? Can we put everything back the way we found it as soon as I'm done But I just want to try something Could we please remove everything from your identity That is the result of someone else saying something about you? Whoa, whoa, easy, I'm not doing anything permanent We're going to put it all back You're going to be who you were before I came here I just want to show you something Let's just make a separate pile for all these rumors people have spread about you And compliments and insults people have dealt you And these horoscopes and... Oh, personality quizzes don't count as self-expression People are always surprised to find that out Applause, booze, your mother said a bunch of bullshit that cuts both ways But none of it matters, your accountant says you're attentive Your roommate says you're a slob Someone said you were a genius Here's some photographs, those are of you, but they aren't you Here's a clipping from a publication, not you And of course this giant sparkling jewel I created when I called you human garbage Not you Next, let's set aside all the things you like Yes, the things we like are there because of who we are But we're trying to get to the who we are part We are not BBC America, sunsets, baby elephants and converse Okay, if we did this right, what we should have left is the stuff you've generated Including anything you've expressed about yourself that hasn't been propaganda, sabotage or lies And we call that your actual identity Well, now don't be ashamed just because it's not a giant pile of stuff doesn't mean you're not a person It's exactly fears like that that lead people overpiling with other people's stuff You have plenty here, once your pile is cleaner, it makes it easier to make it bigger What do we got here? You're a chocoholic? I'm sorry, that shouldn't be in here, that's just saying you like chocolate You can't put a holic after something, you consume and call that an identity Aw, what's this little doodad? Did you make this? See, there we go, you make stuff, everybody makes something Let me check it out, I won't break it, I'm very familiar with these This is called an attention sucker, it's designed to draw attention toward an identity pile These are cool, can I show you something? I have to actually open this, it's okay, take it easy I make these things all the time, I know them inside and out A lot of people hate these things because they draw attention to identity piles that have nothing in them But more attention suckers, but inside every single one of these lame-ass, embarrassing, derivative pieces of shit that we make is something incredible Look here, see that? It's right at the center, that's a little baby expression See how pretty? This expression contains something called need And even though no two expressions of need are the same, the need they express is universal and eternal So much so that you can't normally see it, unless it's expressed inside one of these little gems Isn't that pretty? Look at that need, look how insanely incomplete and alone you are It's infinite, you were born in need, you will die in it Some people think that not only does need connect all people and all life, but that life is itself An expression of need on the part of a physical universe, and that the physical universe is an expression of need on the part of the nothingness it's trying to fill And some people actually believe that that's what God is, the original infinite, unknowable, unfillable need A single thought that says something that is not, must now be And these people that believe these things, they say that you can atone with that God by expressing your own need By simply figuring out what it is you want, being honest with yourself about it, and then expressing it in some way In a conversation, a poem, a joke, a movie, a stained glass window, etc And everything you touch grows, and everything you imagine becomes, and you get laid, and you make money, and your life is easy And you never have to defend yourself, because everyone that means you harm bursts into flame because you're doing God's work and he doesn't want you fucked with Now, let's put this unintentional expression of need you made back inside this dumb thing surrounding it that wasted the world's time And let's put that back in your pile, and let's put all your bullshit back there, all your rehearsal, ambition, misdirection, self-pity, melodrama, entitlement, restraint, privacy, and brazen, bold-faced lies There, you're all back to your shitty self again, with me saying you're shitty, right on top, like a star on a Christmas tree You are quite welcome Thank you 2008 Thank you Dan Harmon everybody, let him in! Dan Harmon! Wow Alright, let's get this show going Everybody, please open up your heart chakras and shoot Love Tentacles out into the ether and welcome to the Duncan Trussell family hour My two best friends, the coolest people I know in the world, everybody give it up for Dan Harmon and Emil Amos Let him in! Thank you everybody I could have just stayed up here Yeah, I realized that, it's still clunky, I gotta figure out the, I should get a stage manager or something, huh? Thank you, thank you very much Can we order beers and shit? Yeah What kind of beer do you want? The Stella couple, two of them, three You guys, that was amazing, thank you so much, that was really awesome man, thank you So, both of you, the reason I thought it was kind of, it wasn't even intentional, but then I realized you both in your own way are kind of tortured by this stuff that's coming out of you And, what is that? Do you think that's a necessary component of the process or is that something that people just think they're supposed to feel? You know, like, why is it that the thing seems to be in some way impacting you in a way that isn't ultimately pleasurable? Well, I have always thought that, like, creatives are these gingerbread men, they're made out of just this empty, what you call, meat body And then there's a hole, if you're a creative there's a hole going through the center of you that's meant to just have some shit that is not you at all come through it and get lightly flavored by the inside rim of your gingerbread hole Right, that's from the Bible But there is a, yes, there's a third component to it, I think the reason it hurts is because there's this thing called the ego, which is this uninvited, unnecessary Kronenberg muscle mass that kind of contorts the gingerbread man And it also is like, blocks the whole, like, Daffy Duck is the quintessential depiction of the ego, like he wants the pearl, mind, mind, mind, mind, mind, like Daffy Duck wants more credit than Bugs Bunny Daffy Duck wants pearls, that was something he was going on Yeah, remember the Genie Cave episode? Yeah, Pismo Beach Your ego is like the thing, like, oh, I wrote that, I did that Right And then that's the thing that has to get obliterated in order for you to write anything, because it won't, that's the thing that keeps the cursor blinking and nothing being typey typed Right, that's awesome But the weird problem that you're talking about is that if you completely remove the ego, then you don't really get to enjoy the fact that you made something Bingo, yeah So that's the big paradox So the part of you that's capable of feeling anything and taking credit for anything and enjoying anything, that's the part of you that has to be gone, dead, gone, whenever you do anything of merit That's from, there's like this essay Alistair Crowley wrote, for those of you guys who don't know that, he's this quote, awesome He's like, you know, he's one of the great magicians of our time, but he had an essay called The Holy Grail, and he said the terrible thing about the Grail Cup is that the moment you drink from it, you stop being you anymore So you can't enjoy whatever that incredible delight would be in having eternal youth or being perpetually everything So are you saying that the suffering that comes from making this stuff is just you clinging to the greedy enjoyment of what's coming out of you? Yeah Cool What do you think? I think that's totally correct But it was interesting you were talking about enjoying hills earlier, right? Yeah It seems like the basic goal of this kind of collective societal impulse is to follow this path of least resistance down this hill or something and money and success and affirmation and things are kind of tumbling down it and everybody goes with that current, it's almost impossible to rebel against it So the artist or whatever is supposed to stop in the middle of the current or whatever and look up, back up the mountain and realize that there's this impossible task of like stopping this current or changing it and even though it's totally impossible, mythosisyphus Mythosisyphus, for those of you guys who don't know, that's pushing, I love that this crowd, someone cheers the mythosisyphus I bet that's the first time at the improv, first of all anyone to mention the mythosisyphus, they're like, oh yeah, unless syphusisyphus is like some urban deaf comedy jams comic Syphus, tell us it like it is Carlos Mencia has like a 10 minutes on syphus, it's hilarious, they heard that on his album But so my point is that the syphus myth, I think on the surface is this really negative story, like in the Pink Floyd song where he's saying, help me carry this load or whatever There's all these references, it's always like this defeated fatalistic thing, but in terms of workaholicness and shit like that, you're just sort of living with this task And I think in a kind of, I think that's what Sartre's solution was, and I think that's what Martin Luther King, like why we really celebrate him It's because he sacrifices himself to this impossible task, this sacrificial task And then so he looks up the current, looks up the mountain, which seems completely impossible And then just finds a way to try to enjoy that subversion and going back against everything So you're saying it's like pushing the boulder up the hill is a subversion of the general flow of everything In this metaphor Entropic collapse of things Yeah, in this metaphor You're doing this desperate attempt to fix what is ultimately a planet just sort of rotting in the middle of a hole Definitely, I mean it's all around, it's right in front of you, you don't have, this isn't like an obscure metaphor or anything But so there's this task in front of you, and that's a painful task You're going back through the current is already creating a type of violence across all the people coming down across it So people get mad, you're saying people get mad when you're creative, people just tend to get angry at you probably I'm sure people are mad at you, I listen to that fucking voicemail from Chevy Chase Yeah, well he was just sleepy You know I went to He doesn't like to work that late I can understand I was fletched, why am I up past eight It's because of you you fat alcoholic piece of shit, I get it Man he was I saw, by the way you know I came to visit my brother in LA when he had the Chevy Chase show and I saw the Chevy Chase show I was there and saw it Holy shit it was bad, it was so bad It was the most sad thing to watch that show Expecting like, I don't know what I expected, like the kind of like witty handsome guy from Caddyshack or something But he just seemed confused, he seemed like he didn't know what was happening and he came on stage and just seemed genuinely like M.K. ultra level Hypnotized by some malevolent Illuminati force that was like Somebody was puppeteering him with a bad connection or something Like the controller wasn't quite working It was so depressing and sad But I like what you're saying Well he says, I'm sure he's a sweet guy, everyone at the center is full of love and I don't know We gotta love everybody, right? That's the idea, no As I've said a thousand times, I mean he was absolutely dedicated to making people laugh Which is, you know, some people aren't And that's like, I would come out into the Paramount lot and he would be stopped by a tour of people that were just touring the Paramount lot And that is all respect to Paramount, that is a shitty tour You're just pointing at buildings and going, King Kong was in there, I'll take your word for it Here's my $800, it's a bad tour Right This is the library steps of community, what? What is that? Right Where's Dr. Phil, for God's sake But Chevy Chase would like, the people that ran across him while he was walking from one side to the other He would stop and he would gather around him and he would Suck their life energy until they withered Until they withered in a weird fig like thing All folks lead the room, you know, like even if you're a clinical narcissist, like if you really just put the pedal to that metal If you love yourself that much and that obsessed with yourself And without any exception, without any shame or anything, I think that would lead to total redemption, making other people happy Which he did for decades, he's a fucking legend Yeah, I think there's something redemptive about fanaticism, but it is weird if anybody's solely devoted to one thing There is something in that that's always creepy Did you see that picture of the Islamic terrorist who got his legs blown off? It's amazing, it's a video It's good, I watch it every morning when I wake up Before I take a shower, it comes on Thinking about getting every frame in it tattooed all over my body But you should just go to J-Date You need to spend some time with Just go out to dinner with some nice young ladies The video is The video is of this guy, he's just gotten his, he just gotten blown up And he, he's drinking a Pepsi No, almost, almost He's like, somebody brings him a bottled water and he's like in shock You can see his guts are just hanging out And he's kind of propped up and the look on his face of happiness is so real And it's like, it's like the middle of a really nice picnic With someone you just fell in love with It's just this glow, he's like drinking this water and then he just sort of dies And that to me was like, that sums up fundamentalism right there That's Chevy Chase Yeah, exactly, yeah, then I, then I, right away I thought, my god, this must be how Chevy Chase writes his jokes He watches people blown in half and then, I'm sorry, why am I, he was really funny in Caddyshack I didn't mean to attack him Great guy, I'm sure he's awesome, I don't know He's your enemy, so fuck him, Dan Anyway, the point is, there is a type of friction that happens when you end up diligently pursuing something creatively And I remember with you, Emil, when we were in college together And you were the first person I met who spent all this time working on art I remember all I felt was like this kind of sick jealousy And it was real, like I really got annoyed with you because I was jealous And I didn't like the fact that somebody had overcome their entropy enough to constantly be creating something It was really fucking annoying Yeah, I felt that pretty heavily Hey, I wrote a new song, Duncan, you wanna hear it? Yes It wasn't it That one's good too Would you like another wine glass of coffee? That was a, that was a fucking, this base level callback That didn't really, alright, thanks Yeah, that dynamic, that's part of what I'm talking about You're like, you're cutting back up this river or whatever There was a guy, you remember this, there was a kid that would chase me around the campus yelling things Because I told him I was happy Oh yeah That really insulted him, like so deeply that he would chase me around and try to pull me down Well no, that's because that was another thing that happened to Emil when I met him He was so depressed, such a depressed person You were, he would lay in bed all day, he was like really down in the dumps And I remember like we were in a, we took a class on sociology with this hardcore leftist lesbian feminist professor Do you remember her? She was a hardcore man and she was talking about, I don't remember It was a very, it probably was really important but I don't remember what it was But I remember it was just very dramatic and I looked over and you were sort of slouched over in your chair And you got this like weird laugh in the middle of her talking about this terrible like thing happening in the world That was just this like, it was like the laugh of a 120 year old man who like Heard somebody say there's hope and he's like ah There's no hope He was like a ghost and I remember like being so sucked into liberal arts college that I'm just like what a fucking dick He's never gonna learn But be lucky if he learns even one of the liberal arts But you started reading, all of a sudden you started reading like really hardcore existential philosophy Like Heidegger and you were reading Nietzsche and then somewhere in the midst of you spending all your time reading that stuff It was like something snapped inside of you and then you became really happy Yeah, I mean I don't like to say it because it sounds intense but it's all because of you, really actually Could I get a basket of zucchini? I'm starving How long is this show? Well, I mean Alright, I'm jealous, I'm jealous Fucking musicians, they get all the trim, it doesn't matter Well, okay, so I'm not gonna tell the whole story of my life I think when, tell me if this happened to you, but you started, I was a pretty brainy kid and I was straight edge And then I started taking drugs Well I was a kid and I started taking drugs, that happened But I mean I was about 16 and I think one day some dude was playing Aerosmith and got me to smoke pot That's how it always happens We just like, yeah And then like, you know, it was like a weeks later it was just straight to acid The first dude I ever took acid with is actually in the back of the audience right now Anyway Give it up for Dr. Phil everybody, you came to the show tonight I think my point is, is like, I kind of like did that sort of junky basketball diaries slide Where you just like, you start out trying to learn and then you just kind of like become a fucking useless stoner, you know, or whatever So I destroyed my brain, my brain chemistry with whatever I could get every day And then by the time I actually got to college I had been, like my skull was broken open by a drifter who took a guitar and broke me over the head So I had 17 staples in my head and all these drugs in this little box That's not a metaphor No That's what I thought it was At first, at first My skull had been broken open Once you number the stitches, you know that's literal, okay But up until then I thought it was just like a John Mayer song My skull was broken open by a drifter called Friendship Yes, of course, thank you My point is though that like, then I met you And so I had sort of like taken, let drugs take me to this place and drop me off at sort of the end of the earth, you know And then you sort of reminded me that I liked to learn and I liked to think and I liked to read and I liked, you know, whatever shit like that And so that it turned my life around and then you just partially only got jealous because I got so excited by that And it like fueled me to redesign myself, you know, and then we went through all those experiences together Yeah, that's a terrible moment when you realize somebody is taking advice that you can, that you're not doing for yourself And it's like, it's like making yourself happy Yeah, that was, yeah, that was really cool. Yeah, that was an amazing thing to see though because you were, what's that? Oh, I thought she said Charles Barkley It's heartbreaking We'll get to Barkley, I've got a lot of opinions on him, I've got to lead into it I just realized Charles Barkley sounds like heartbreaking That's true Yeah, well, you know, he broke a lot of hearts of many of us and I'm so sorry, is he alive? I'm so glad he's alive He's like the minor key dude now Is he really? Pretty sure Well, that's going to be the podcast you got, no So, so the, the, but there is a weird thing that happens where suddenly you guys are, you become separated or something Like it makes you an outsider because you end up getting magnetized into this thing that you're doing This like your ego is still there for both of you and you both have got to have at least some idea of what's coming out of you And how beautiful and inspiring and powerful it is So that sucks you into it even more and then the next thing you know you become what people call a workaholic Which is somebody you both, I know you are and I know you are, forgive me, you are You work, you work so much and so hard all the time No, no, no, I don't work hard, but, but, but What do you mean? But workaholic, I accept as a definition because it's an unhealthy dependence on work in terms of your identity So that brings me to, this is the thing that's been happening to me I've been pedaling around on my bike and then I went up to Big Sur And I was sitting on this rock in Big Sur looking out over the Pacific and thinking to myself This is way better than anything I've ever done Like this just sitting here with my dog feels so great And, and riding around on the bike just that feels better than any phone call I've gotten about some kind of like success Or the whole thing feels so good And then that's gotten into my brain and I just can't stop thinking about like buying an Airstream And getting, and selling all my stuff and then just like traveling around the country doing a podcast maybe Something like that He's so cool But, but the question I have for you guys is don't you ever feel, don't you ever think that like even in the, like in the midst of all this production and creation That, that ultimately it's all the, like what the book of Ecclesiastes says, Dust in the Wind All of this is for nothing, nothing you do matters Try to drink as much as you want, that won't help, don't drink, that won't help Be with a bunch of girls, that won't help, don't be with any, nothing's- It helps a little It does help, I think that guy who wrote that was an asshole but He didn't have a bike, whoever wrote Ecclesiastes should have pedaled around on a bike But don't you, so my question is like so many people get so caught up in production Isn't there, what about just giving up everything and vanishing off into the nothingness, don't you guys ever think about that? Well I'm 41 and I like, like I, I'm getting married in November and I want to have a kid so now that Right The, the second half of that video game starts, like if I was, if I was, when I was 30, yeah I always had that, like feeling, you know, which is why I didn't, I wouldn't write on the staffs of other people's TV shows I just kept writing stuff and kind of made my own path But now, but then there's a second half to life, in my opinion I'm sure this is just drinking the Kool-Aid of, of, of mediocrity or something, who knows, but, but I also, I don't know, I, I, I want to do it, I don't, I don't want to be the, the Gary Busey character in the back of everyone's wedding Like, with the Hawaiian shirt Oh shit Like, going like That's me There goes another one, how are you I'll tell you, I thought you gotta follow the spiritual path That's what's important, that and the Cranapple juice Uh, I, I, I want to, I, I want to, I want to merge with my woman and make a little, make a little Asperger kid and uh Pray to God he's not good at football and, and uh, you know, play, play, play Lego video games with him You can make it so he's not good at football Just make his shoes too tight for the first six years, he'll have feet problems It's called I have a feeling, my karma dictates that my kid's gonna be Keanu Reeves, like he's gonna be Johnny Utah Yeah, that's the scary thing about having kids is like, they're, you know, there's gonna be that inevitable moment when they see their first George W. Bush speech And like, your kid could be like, he seems really smart then That could happen But that's called the, um, that's called the, uh, uh, in Hinduism there's these ashrams is what they're called And so there's what's called the Grihastha ashram, that's called the householder life So the idea is like owning a house, having a child and sort of like the idea is like You're supposed to like, like in the hardcore version of it, which is ridiculous and comes from the Hare Krishna's because it's such a fundamentalist idea But the idea is the only reason you have a child is to teach the child about how to transcend the cycle of birth and death and merge with God That's the only reason you even make life, but that's ridiculous Well, you guys agree, maybe so But I think that's a lot of pressure for the kid Or you're like, we only fucked once for you Fine God, we're, yeah, that seems really intense But so the idea is it's like there's no, what I like about calling that an ashram is that, uh, there's a, that it's no different from what's called the Brahmachari ashram Which is giving up everything, abandoning your possessions, giving up, like just cutting every single tie that keeps you locked into the current paradigm And drifting out into the world, and that's a different ashram, which is like the begging monk, which seems more like what you are, Emil Nice Burn Bitch I think, uh, most likely most people follow different trajectories spiritually, and there's no reason why like somebody should, you know, have the same arc as another person So, but the second part of life thing is incredibly true to me I think that, that, that leisure area, whatever you're talking about, was kind of something that as a kind of Faustian trading artist dude, like I had to do in the beginning And I, and I was like, had to go out and be like totally lost and get fucked up and waste my time and destroy my body and all that shit and stuff And then now, second half of life, it's my job to sit down and report everything that I learned, which is like just pure hard work, you know, pure hard work And so, like Mozart, when he's in the bed like, you know, reeling off the shit before he dies or something, it's like, it's not fun or anything necessarily But, uh, but it does make me happy in a very deep way that other things can't make me happy So, when I'm talking about Martin Luther King or Sartre, this solution to the Sisyphus thing, I'm being pretty serious that like, you just have to find a way to enjoy this hard work And then that's sort of like the answer to the equation or something You may have your point of leisure or like that, that kind of taking in period instead of reporting, you know, and giving back or whatever You might have that a different point in your life Don't you think the reporting though is there's something in it that's like blasphemous, like the idea of like reporting in, like whenever that sneaks into your mind like, ah shit, I gotta take a picture of this It's ruining the moment That reporting in thing, you know, when Rogan was talking about his DMT experience, he was talking about how while he was in the midst of seeing these golden Buddhas and this incredible like vision of some transcendent force There was the realization that what he was thinking about was his desire to tell people about it And that creates this wall between you and the experience, you know, don't you think that selfie impulse is kind of like a satanic impulse that it's a Well, you're, I mean, I think that I think it's more like, I mean, if it's if it's happening while life is happening to you, yeah If you're in the middle of having a life experience and you put the brakes on it in order to Instagram it, you're, you're, it's a technical violation But there are 25 year olds in the audience who for them the joy is in the Instagramming so that you can't circumscribe that too But in the strictest sense, like this guy, Sam Christensen, teaches this workshop in Burbank for actors, anybody, it's like a self image realization thing Just short of being a cult but enough to be just a really good acting class He said at one point like I was in my 20s when when I heard this from him and it kind of changed my life he said God is the moment God is right now he's here right now and the devil is five seconds ago and five seconds from now The devil is is a thing that is trying to keep you out of God's reach by making you think about what just happened and what's about to happen Because God wants you here right now That's awesome That's so cool That just gave me this great image of Jesus returning floating over whatever city and it's just hands holding their cell phones trying to take pictures God is shot at Jesus It's also a great way to get out of you know your girlfriend goes I'm doing a show at UCB next Wednesday I'm like yeah what are you the devil I don't know if I'll make it Anybody who invites you to their improv show has been possessed by the devil 95% of the time Any appointment any schedule yeah it's all the devil Yeah so that's the trick isn't it it's like whenever I sit down like I can look through my notebook and I'm always attempting to write a book And whenever I look at the pages where I've decided like this is where I'm writing the book it is embarrassingly bad It's just like so puffed up like some kind of I don't know who I think I am but it's like suddenly my word choices are all too big and it's awful And basically unreadable but then when I read the parts where I've just got like I'm super high sitting in the cafe unhappy about an ex-girlfriend or something That's where the good writing is so it's like figuring out a way to remove the purpose from the act of creation it seems like an impossibility how do you do that I think if you're doing it for a paycheck if you're doing it to get something done then you're going to have to accept that there's a certain amount of falseness that's going to be into it Like you can't do 10 songs for an album and get it out by November and not have a couple of them be or just a certain percentage of the whole effort be Well this is the Sisyphian effort of pushing because for the sake of pushing So that's how it kind of dovetails what we were talking about earlier Like you could release an album or a book or write a TV pilot every 30 years and have every single page and every paragraph and every song and every melody be totally in the moment But then you're not really helping anybody by being that much of a purist The interplay between ego and that thing that comes through it and obliterates it I said earlier that the ego had no purpose but of course the ego keeps the gingerbread man moving it puts him over to the typewriter The ego's the vagina the baby pops out of The ego looks at your fucking income tax reports the ego looks at tries to get laid the ego does everything that makes you want to get something done by a certain date And so you're a business partner with Daffy Duck in every creative endeavor Then there's the Bugs Bunny who's just like, who gives a fuck, Duck? Bugs Bunny's a Buddhist you know he was transgender he was like he transcended everything he didn't give a shit man His fucking whole he would be living in a hole in a place where they were trying to make a city and he'd be like this city needs to change Like I'm gonna fuck these people over he fucked with an opera conductor for just a half hour just for the fuck of it Like he just like he's so zen that he's Charles Manson If only my dream is to get him on the podcast I don't know if we're applauding you're awesome but I'm not Charles Manson But you look at Woody Allen's stuff like in the 70's when he was like who's this fucking guy he made himself without permission Nobody wanted to nobody invited him up under the silver screen Nobody said hey you should be in a romantic comedy He's like just like Paul Rudd I mean he looked like a fucking writer and he was just like I don't know He's obviously his Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck are at war with each other That's what you see on screen like he's it's had something to do with being able to be so Bugs Bunny That you can actually start to make fun of the Daffy Duck use it in your shit I love this so much I've never heard this It's like the ultimate articulation of Buddhism and mindfulness because they usually use big words Crazy weird Eastern words describe this but Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck You might have just created the new Buddhism this might be it Based on you know every improv troupe there's probably 70% of the audience has been in an improv troupe There's always that one person that hangs up the flyers and books the gigs and they ain't always the funniest guy on stage They're the guy that hangs up the flyers they're the guy that gets you the gig And they're also in the improv troupe and they come into the scene and they're like Wow I'm nervous and you're like oh Dale but like Dale the improv troupe wouldn't exist without that guy Here's my we have to go because we have the lights so I only have a few more minutes But I'm sorry you guys we only had 90 minutes we've already done 90 how much time do I have you guys I can't see six six minutes five minutes all right well here's my question for you guys Yes I will sing a song with an email That would be awesome what song That was a joke It was a joke that backfired because they're into it Here's my question to you it's an unfair question I haven't given you time to think about it at all But for the people listening for this week can you tell them something that they should do That's going to throw their lives out of whatever weird orbit they're in And move them in the direction of something awesome Worst question ever I'm just trying to burn time I got five minutes I mean if you're if you're if you're if I'll speak to the writers in the audience If you're a writer like you you have been avoiding sucking for 20 years This Memorial Day weekend an addition to remembering Pearl Harbor and stuff Sit down at some point and prove that you suck I saw young writers like yeah write something really shitty Make an agreement that you're gonna set fire to it no one will ever read it But like you will you'll be cleansed by proving to yourself that you are the shitty writer that you think you are And so the sitting there in this stasis going like I'm not a shitty writer. Yes, I am. No, I'm not. Yes, I am No, I'm not just just be a shitty writer and yeah do it cool be a shitty writer Well, you have you have to purge all that shit anyway, right you got to get past it There's a good Lucy K interview on Charlie Richie other day where he was saying basically that That all the people that like don't become good writers are people that just let fear kind of drive them back Whereas if you get into those really like unsure places you kind of pedal it to the metal there You're gonna like experiment discover way more shit, which is like basic LSD frame of mind or whatever So I used to have this used to have a girlfriend and she she once I was like trying to sequence a record or something And I was like which does this song fucking suck or whatever and she was like it was a really brilliant way to say yes But she She very gently said something like well I think you have said the same thing in other ways that were a lot more constructive and and they came across really well You know so I was kind of left to realize like maybe this isn't the best articulation That's partially with your point earlier is like as time goes on your experience Goes on you you start to merge all these things reporting You know in the taking in kind of all come together you realize there's an art to living Is an art to talking there's an art to articulation there's an art to reporting you have to be You want to be good at that you know and that's that's really difficult to do so there's nothing wrong with reporting as it's about reporting it well You know and articulating something and if you can really honor that art then you're gonna make everything worth You know other people listening to so I would say you know that like take my girlfriend's you know advice in that sense And just like realize that the craft is really more about perfecting your ability ability to articulate what you actually mean to another person Love it you guys give these guys a round of applause Dan Harmon Before we wrap up we're having a big after party the R bar and there's still plenty of tickets So you guys come because we're all gonna be hanging out there after after this so come I tweeted the address you want to come everybody give yourselves a round of applause Thank you so much for coming We're going to be more of these you guys are awesome.

into the field my god they're crying I've never seen aliens cry before as they weep big beautiful alien tears under your horribly wounded body my god they've pulled out some kind of rod I'm watching them resurrect you I'm watching them bring you back to life you're so happy you can't believe it you've been brought back to life but the rod that they used whatever that technology is it's angered the coyotes and I'm watching that coyotes attack the aliens and then attack you again I'm watching you die and I want you to know before you finally die for the second time that I am so grateful to you for listening to this podcast and I wish I could have saved you for everyone else I hope you're safe watch out for coyotes you know I was so obsessed with AI for a second like really obsessed it was so exciting to me I kept thinking about something I'd heard in a Terence McKenna lecture or read how as we get closer to the singularity the amount of time between what we can imagine and bringing that thing into the world would shrink and AI seems like the technological intermediary that is gonna make that happen but now that I've spent some time with it I was bored with it I don't care and I went deep man I went deep I was open in Terminal Windows baby on my Mac running shell scripts going on github it was a very painful obsession in the sense that I just couldn't let it go I wanted to know how to create a neural network on my M2 Mac to do text-to-art video generation thinking I could use that to take clips from the podcast replace them with animation and then upload it to my YouTube that way the guests who have come on the show who didn't want there to be video I'd still be able to use their video that was the idea but maybe this is just a passing phase maybe it's gonna get better but having successfully done this having looked at like you know I turned a small clip you can find it on my YouTube of me and Johnny Pemberton doing the Leather Rose I said make us Vikings basically use a lot of weird shit to do that control net stable diffusion a lot of weird stuff and it's cool it looks cool but who cares it's still not as cool as just me and Johnny yapping in front of a green screen have you ever seen a work of art in real life like a famous work of art I did not to brag I saw Van Gogh that's the one that sticks out of my head and I remember like realizing a holy shit the difference between looking at the thing itself and the picture of it is the difference between a picture of Hawaii and going to Hawaii that imbued in the art was some kind of energy that's what made Van Gogh great it wasn't just the art it wasn't the painting the painting was a cup the painting was the grail I sound so pretentious right now the grail it's just a cup but the moment it collects the blood of Jesus it becomes the grail similarly art creation the shell that is the end result of some creative process functions as a kind of metaphysical cup it's holding all of the energy of everyone involved in the creative process that made it inside of it so it creates this amazing extra feeling a kind of artistic gestalt the hole is greater than the sum of the parts now it would be easy to miss that you listen to music you're like I could make this or you see some work of art and you're like I could do that and you probably could but the amount of time it would take you to get to the point where you could make the thing is probably a lot of time even if the work of art you're impressed by is lo-fi that's the in fact the trickiest form of art out there because lo-fi Daniel Johnston for example gives you the impression shit I could make this and you can't you definitely can make Daniel Johnston style music no problem just get a piano learn to play a few chords sing some simple song but it won't be Daniel Johnston it'll be you before you went through the learning curve before you were driven by your passion to study all forms of music to dive into the most complex music and to become completely obsessed and take a bunch of acid that the butthole servers gave you and go completely insane fly your dad's plane into the ground in a suicide attempt you it'll just be you before all that and even if you did all of that it's still not gonna be Daniel Johnston because what we like about Daniel Johnston's music isn't the skill it's something else that's in there that makes it special and I think that AI is going to usher in a completely different renaissance than what I expected when I was talking to chat gbt getting it to code video games for me going on the subreddits are based around AI and stable diffusion and text to art AI I had a moment of thinking my god this is gonna be incredible it's going to free us from the learning curve it's going to sever that very human reality of if you want to learn if you want to make something you either hire somebody to make it for you or you learn to do it yourself and learning to do it yourself is gonna take a long time so you have to roll the dice it's a kind of form of temporal gambling are you sure you want to bet ten years learning how to do comedy learning how to write you sure you want to bet that and if you're not sure that you want to make that bet then that's good because you're probably not a writer or a comic it's not your thing but even if you're like yes I want to spend the next ten years doing open mics learning to stand up or ten years learning how to write there's no guarantee at the end of those ten years that people are going to give a shit about what you create so it's gambling so let's remove that what happens if instead of having to go through that initiatory process we could just make whatever pops into our head we could just as Terence McKinnon said extend the shade what's in our imagination into time space instantaneously using this technological intermediary and I think that what's going to happen is no one's going to give a shit about what you make that prompt engineering as they call it is not going to capture your soul and put it into the digital image created by the AI which is why when you look at the most advanced incredible beautiful high res 8k incredible AI generated art it just gives you the same feeling you get when you go to a really nice shopping mall it's like this is cool I love the waterfall I love the fountains it's going to give you the same feeling you get when you go to Vegas wow this is amazing they really did sort of replicate Paris but it's not Paris it's a shitty fucking casino with rotten food and a miniature Eiffel tower in it that no one cares about ultimately other than like a quick selfie who cares so this to me is AI art I'm sorry for my AI art fans out there I acknowledge that at some point maybe I'm wrong maybe my superstitious primitive notion that the the the art is a kind of medium that holds human consciousness within it is absolutely idiotic but I think it might be the case and I think the renaissance that's coming is not going to be one where inhibited creators and artists and people who didn't have the resources or the time to learn how to do this or that are suddenly able to spit out works of art by telling an AI to make something but rather the tsunami of AI generated digital content movies video games that's about to come our way is only going to amplify the value of human created things that nothing's going to scratch the itch it's the flashlight phenomena my friends if you've ever made love to a flashlight you know what I'm talking about it's a perfect replica of the human vagina it's potentially molded after your favorite porn stars vagina you can fuck that thing all day long it's not going to say no or yes because it's just a fucking plasticky gooey thing but if you're super horny any port in a storm if you're super horny you will humiliate yourself in private by fucking a flashlight I don't mean to sex shame you there friends I don't think it's really that humiliating I just kind of felt humiliated which I kind of liked kind of added to the experience like look at me look at me some horny ape thrusting against this fucking awful synthetic pussy that kind of turned me on but it just doesn't really scratch the itch if it did then I imagine that all human life on the planet would eventually cease because everybody would be fucking flashlights all the dudes it's like I'm not going to go through it I'm not going to go through the dating process I'm not going to go through all the fucking things you have to do to finally meet someone you fall in love with or just have sex just order a flashlight my dick doesn't know the difference like if a flashlight gave you that same incredible this is this is amazing you know when you finally meet someone you're into and it's like it doesn't matter if it's the dead of winter it's going to be spring for you your mind is spinning with romantic bliss any song you hear you think about that person that doesn't happen when you fuck a flashlight when you fly when you fuck a flashlight and you're driving down the street and your favorite love song comes on you don't think about your flashlight probably maybe flashlights have gotten better I don't know my point is it may be that we never crossed the uncanny valley that they talk about you know that feeling of like oh that makes me feel weird when you see bad CGI that's the uncanny valley the idea is that you know if we can create a sufficiently advanced simulation technology we could cross the uncanny valley and on the other side we could enter into a CGI landscape via VR and we wouldn't even know that it wasn't reality that was the dream that's one of the techno utopian dreams you don't need to fly to Hawaii you just put on your neural interface and you're in Hawaii a synthetic replica of Hawaii thus saving all kinds of money and planet because you don't have to get on a fucking plane but I think this AI is just gonna show us that no in fact no matter how perfect the synthetic replica is it's still just a synthetic replica it's still just a flashlight we're gonna go through an embarrassing period where all of us like a horny dog at a party are gonna be humping the legs of our techno idols whatever it may be all of us are gonna be like fuck it I'm gonna make something incredible AI make something incredible I can't really think of anything AI will you tell me what would be an incredible thing I would want to make and make it we're gonna go through this incredible experience of realizing that the thing is just a cup that cups are great glasses are great chalices are great but it doesn't become a grail until the blood of Jesus fills it up and in this case the blood of Jesus that's your consciousness your humanity your soul that's the group energy the group of people who collaborated to make a thing all of their energy gets into whatever the final creation is with the midnight gospel people will thank god people really liked it and people will sometimes they'll see me and they'll like thank you for the midnight gospel but it's like shit man I was one tiny piece of that thing now all the artists all of their like not just what they did on the show but everything they did before that all the learning curves they conquered all the risks they took all the all of the putting themselves in situations where there was no guarantee god knows in animation that's the case but throwing themselves into a very uncertain future like all of that energy it went into the midnight gospel and it goes into any other thing that gets created if I had an AI and I said to it can you make season two of the midnight gospel using these podcast episodes I think in some future it's going to be able to do that but it'll just be dead it would be like a lifeless dead empty pointless thing no one would like it it wouldn't scratch the itch because it wouldn't have within it all of that light from Pendleton and all the artists on the show and all the writers and all the creator just wouldn't have any of that it would just be there some kind of synthetic things but it would be an idol I guess you could say if you want to get like Old Testament style dramatic I always wondered though like in the bible this thing where god gets so pissed off when people worship idols the golden calf and now I get it it's like there's some recognition from the divine consciousness that humans some humans are easily tricked into humping the legs of idols that it's not that hard to get a person to attach themselves to some synthetic replica of something that just isn't real and that this is what AI is I mean I'm not saying it's bad all the way through I don't think it is I think it's going to do a lot of great things for us but all those great things are going to be the discoveries it makes and curing disease it's going to be the the equity created by giving people access to like health health advice and life advice but the value of the thing is not going to be in its ability to instantaneously create works of art that are generated from its scan of all their works of art I feel so dumb I mean I really was like so excited about it because you know I love animation and and animation is expensive and animation takes a long time but in my stupid appraisal of like how to make stuff I left out the most important piece of the puzzle which is humanity the humanity humanity the collaboration the struggle the arguments that happen when you collaborate and the joys that happen when you overcome obstacles that you didn't think you could overcome all of that it gets into the art that's what people like about it now again I'm probably wrong about this but we'll find out over the next few months for sure it's already happening it's just you're going to see just infinite AI generated content you're going to see stuff you're going to see animation that seems visually to be really incredible but it's just not going to make you feel what you feel when you watch something created by humans I could be proven wrong here but I think that's going to be the renaissance it's going to be this contrast that gets created by every single bit of AI generated music AI generated art AI generated writing there's going to be so much of it that human generated stuff is going to just stand out like a light it's the difference between synthetic rose perfume and smelling rose it's going to be the difference between flesh light and vagina and once everyone realizes that the uncanny valley is insurpassable that there's no way to cross that divide because there's no way to imbue consciousness if you don't have consciousness there's no way to put your soul into something if you don't have a soul and that the AI it's just never going to be able to do that no one's going to care it could be like the next VR thing as far as text to art AI goes I read some analysis that pointed in that direction it could just be that like you know everyone was excited about VR holy shit I can't wait but the goggles on I can climb a mountain visit Mars and it's freaking cool to put it on and it is fun but ultimately it just it didn't blow up like people thought it would because humans wanted to be in the real world and real 3d space it just doesn't scratch the itch anyway hope I'm hope I'm wrong truly I hope a volcano a volcano a volcano an eruption of incredible art comes exploding out of the motherboards and the servers and the prompts so that suddenly we're just inundated with the most incredible beautiful stuff we've ever seen that would be great but I don't think it's gonna happen I think what's gonna happen is we're about to get big fat blasts of lifeless robo jizz splattered into our eyes and we're gonna get sick of it we're not gonna fall for it won't seem interesting and then AI is gonna lose this initial glow that it has that no one's gonna care they won't have to regulate it because no one's gonna care oh wow it wrote a book but it's a shitty book oh wow it made some new Picasso but that's not Picasso oh wow it created an entire virtual universe we could explore who cares it's dead empty I mean have you ever gone on world of warcraft in some of the zones no one goes to anymore who gives a fuck there's nothing there there's no person playing other than you in this vast beautiful glowy dead environment it's boring so who knows I thought that AI would help us discover sentience by being sentient or do you say sentient is sentient like the most pretentious way to say that consciousness by generating consciousness but no that's now it's gonna help us understand consciousness it's gonna help us understand consciousness by creating a contrast between the digital replication of what it thinks humanity is and humanity itself and somewhere in there we're gonna understand the soul whatever you want to call it the ottman what makes humans special in the universe and I think that's gonna be a very good thing I told you I was gonna rant and this was a rant and now I'm done ranting I so appreciate you listening one person who listened through the whole rant without skipping ahead we have got a tremendous episode for you today friends Cole Marta Dr. Cole Marta my dear friend he works with maps he runs a wonderful ketamine clinic in Los Angeles and he's just an all-around awesome human is returning to the DTFH we're gonna jump right into that but first this if you haven't yet you should definitely check out the metaphysical section of ebay because in that section of ebay people sell haunted items I'm looking at it right now authentic real haunted doll real in case antique haunted extremely active pre-owned of course 600 bucks 600 bucks now I'm a comedian I'm a podcaster I don't have a lot of time but if I did and I wanted to start a new business it would definitely be a business that sold haunted items not fake haunted items by the way and I don't know maybe these items on ebay are truly haunted but real haunted items actual haunted stuff things that if people ordered them they would unleash in their life swarms of demonic entities because that's what they wanted I was gonna do that I would need a way to hire people who could either haunt items or find haunted items be able to differentiate haunted items from non-haunted items be able to quantify the level of haunted that the item possesses so that I can create some kind of pricing structure based on that you don't want to charge somebody archaic death spirit prices when all you guys is a basic poltergeist so this is why if I was starting this business the first place I would go would not be a haunted house would not be an in-state sale it would be zip recruiter because whether

Cole welcome back to the DTFH it's so good to see you it's so good to see you too thank you very much for having me back first probably the most important question do you still play World of Warcraft or did you kick that yes so that's been my savior through the pandemic i'm not sure what you've been doing in isolate or for the first few years but World of Warcraft classic came out i remember that did you play World of Warcraft classic yeah yes like two months before the pandemic started or like within months of the pandemic starting which turned out to be the big savior of isolation to me because like people i played with the game with like 15 years ago all sort of came back at the same time for this big event of World of Warcraft right and i play in this like very specific little community of twinking have you ever heard of twinking in World of Warcraft not in the video game i know you played World of Warcraft yeah yeah there's this like so you played World of Warcraft yes like at the end of the game sort of the game never ends right because you're on this like hedonic treadmill with like gear right and when you finally get like the gear you've been trying to get all month or all year then a new expansion comes out and all that gear is obsolete and so then the game keeps like enticing you with like oh this is an even cooler staff or this is a cooler belt um with twinking it's a way of waiting real quick for people who don't maybe don't play World of Warcraft like it's not like what are you what are you talking about here is there is a temp there's a temporal you're making a temporal investment into the gear like it's similar to crypto you're you don't just get the gear like most of the gear requires lots and lots of playing and not just you're not guaranteed to get to get the gear as i recall you know you want some staff you have to beat a boss in a dungeon who doesn't drop the same gear every time so you're in a group of people many of them are looking for the same thing you go through this dungeon with them fight the boss the boss drops the item you want it but somebody else is there once that's that fucking thing you gotta roll you gotta roll yeah for where you're at when it gets bigger and bigger and bigger yeah you're dealing with massive groups and so there's the possibility of obtaining gear that is so fucking rare and not just rare but rare in the sense that most people just they they don't they're not going to spend expecting they're not going to go for it and so you do get this legendary shit that radically changes your experience of the game and so that's that's what's going on here that's what he's talking about so 20 that's like that's the way they're like that's the way the game is designed to be played and that's how people get so uh you know they continue to play for so long um so many hours a day and new gear comes out in a year or so let's say six months or a year twinking for people who just want to kill each other on a battlefield the that same thing happens with gear if you like to fight against other people but with twinking they they made it so that like people who have top level characters like in classic level 60 was the top they wouldn't be fighting against people who are like level 12 who are also want to just try out the the battlegrounds or something so they made these brackets 10 to 19 20 to 29 30 to 39 of players so when they want to play against each other they are only in a pool of players who are of like a similar level right so twinking is a way around that hedonic treadmill with the gear because they don't keep making new gear that's meant for leveling through so if you play in the bracket i play in 29s primarily 29s and 39s um there is a final best sword so once you get that sword your character is like done with the sword what's the sword so for like warriors there's this axe that's called the corpse maker um that's the one for like warriors i play primarily priest um so like so this these communities come up that intentionally stop leveling their character they they get their character to the max level for that bracket and then they stop leveling their character and they just get all the gear that they need to be as powerful as you can possibly be at that level and you're done with the hedonic treadmill and you can just play that character forever and be as powerful as you can be so there's like if you run into people who are not playing the game in the same way you just kill them quickly because your character is so insanely stupidly powerful for the level that you're at but yeah this whole community this sort of unexpected phenomenon happened where a bunch of people enjoyed doing this and found each other like it's this really awesome community and uh has its own like discord channels and stuff and they arrange like there are guilds that fight each other and there are teams that play against each other and very very competitive matches of like capture the flag kind of thing so yes that's yeah that's been my obsession for a lot of the pandemic and it's really it's really come to the rescue you know with world of warcraft when i was playing it in classic mode you could be more nefarious that's what i liked about it you there was like this ability to like you know you could and i i'm foggy you're remembering all of it i i have memories from world of warcraft that are joyful memories because i played an undead warlock right and you you go into the villages where the characters are lower level than you and you could just fucking kill them i don't think you can do that anymore right like they stopped at you well they made that yeah they call it griefing yeah you could grief and like they could send out an alert to high level characters who would come and kick your ass so you only have a little bit of time in there to like kill these like lower level characters and then you have to like escape get out of there you could pull it off kill a bunch of of them and then escape it was i was really like my shadow side was like truly and just getting off on i or like i can remember as a warlock you're gathering herbs you know that's one of the skills and i can remember being in some weird zone gathering herbs and these like there's only certain times you gather the herbs getting the zones hard there's some other poor fucker gathering herbs there who's on the it's divided basically good what do they call it odd not good or an alliance hoard an alliance some alliance cheesy alliance character right some do-gooder the hoard hates the alliance even as a player you judge them because you're just like what are you doing right you're gonna really play a fucking gnome with your cheesy music for the gnome you're gonna run around with it so you're out there gathering herbs you're a skeleton you see some fucking gnome out there gathering herbs too so you just melt them fry them and it's like the warlock is damaged over time right so they don't die all at once they slowly wither and die right i can remember this gnome god knows how much time they spent getting there i don't it was a pain in the ass to get there and i was not allowing them to get their herbs and it was pure sadism and like i can remember this player you you can emote and the player getting on his knee like begging please stop did not stop yeah i just keep frying them and the joy the dark horrible joy i don't think people who who haven't played this stuff understand just how horribly good it can make you feel and and how bad it is to be on the other side of that because when you're trying to make a new character and you've like okay it's saturday you don't have work or school or whatever and you know maybe you know you're uh you're in a relationship but your partner's out of town so you're like all right this is my time i'm gonna level my low level guy i'm gonna i'm gonna make him a 20 like no the guys that i play being like low level like that's part of the challenge of even getting there like getting your person even though you stop early you know you're like intentionally stopping level at like 29 like you have to wander into some places where that's a part of your reality for sure is level 60 max level characters can kill you with one one shot they can kill you in one or two hits like you don't stand absolutely no chance so yeah that's like a challenge of getting getting the gear and getting where you want to be but it's just been really beautiful because like the the with this particular community is like the community the ability to like stay in contact like when one wow first came out in like you know 2004 2005 there wasn't you know discord channels and other like just ways of staying in community but this community has sort of like stayed slightly in touch through various ways like certain enclaves of players like went on to play other games together but they all came back and so it was just this like really just beautiful like it's like got kind of disconnected from my life community through the pandemic but reconnected with this sort of childhood almost childhood i was probably older than the average player even back when it was new yeah but like still just like oh it was really really a savior and it and it got so intense like we had tournaments there was like tournaments for money like we raised money to like fund our own prize pools for tournament teams yeah it was pretty cool it's so fun and it's just such a like it truly is just a drug i mean it's the best it's one of the best drugs i i can't i mean i i'm addicted to hearthstone right now so i'm just gonna say like i don't think people know that about you i don't i don't know if that's like a well-known thing about Duncan Trussell is that he's like a pro level hearthstone player i'm not pro i can't get the legend in fact it's driving me insane i'm it so like like hearthstone is is ranked i'm definitely not pro level the hearthstone is ranked so like the it's tiered and so eventually you'll get to the diamond level so i'm at this place diamond five if you can win nine games all i have to do is win nine games yeah and i will go to legend you go to legend and you get your own car a special card back showing that you made it that far well it's another form of hadonic tremble but once you hit diamond five you are up against like like you you don't like for those of you don't know what hearthstone is it is such a great card game and it is so addictive but you know when you're not just normal cards you can count cards you know maybe the odds that the player you're playing against has you know a king or whatever if you're if you're good at any card game you learn how to like do the odds with this you have to learn all the decks that people are playing with all the forms of the decks that they're playing with so that you can strategize otherwise you're just playing turn to turn and once you get to diamond five you can't play turn to turn you have to be thinking ahead you have to like look at the number of cards they understand like with the mana they have what card the odds of the card they're gonna play next turn so you can get ready for that it is so fucking complex it's killing me yeah i gotta quit i gotta quit like i mean you gotta it's probably beautiful on the road you know i would i would think like when you have to go on the road you know or not have to but when you choose to go on the road like when you do a weekend away from home and you're not with the wife isn't it lovely to have that though like to have that like yeah it is when you're winning when you're just losing like you're just losing and what's awful like a wall right there like those last nine are like notoriously like a real line between the men and the boys everyone stops there that's where you stop like most like if you even get to diamond like it took me forever playing to get to the point where i get good enough to even get there but once you hit that fucking five just forget it just give up you're not like these are fucking people in e like in in japanese arcades who memorized every card these are mathematicians i knew someone from stanford a mathematician who played fucking hearthstone yeah and yeah that's like you know these are like at the high end you know yeah like you can you can tell even like you know when you're in that like great player pool just like the the names they're choosing for their characters are just like oh that's like an educate that's like a clever person that like yeah their character whatever that is you know like yeah suddenly the character names but fart or whatever yeah like suddenly the names are like okay the names are like like obscure german philosophers you know what i mean the names go from butt fart to like pedigre right you know so like you're just like what the what how do i beat these people and then you just you you lose and the game's expensive like you have to keep up with the meta you got to get new cards you're so it's just and you know you're you're just like what i didn't know that about hearthstone i didn't know you had to like buy so you buy packs and stuff like so like like a collector card game like magic or something it's like yeah it's like crack magic because magic the games take too fucking long they're annoying they take forever and like with hearthstone the difference between hearthstone i don't know where magic's at now online but with hearthstone they limit your emotes because i think they know that if they let players talk to each other it will cause murders so you could only do like five emotes you can you can go like wow everybody knows which ones are insults right like you figure that out oh yeah they're all insults i mean something terrible cool i have become like you start off like someone will say hello to you and you go hello you're like this is nice they're saying hi no one is saying hi in a nice way they're saying hi because they have drawn great cards and they know they're about to crush you so whenever anyone says hi now i just threaten that's the emote i do right away like you don't know my wrath fuck you don't say hi yeah you're gonna fucking beat me this is the five thousandth game in this tier i play fuck you so yeah it's it's it's hurting i need a new game i i gotta switch to a new game i'm i'm kind of go play world of warcraft come make a twink come come play with us and there you for the voice of satan that's the voice of it come play world of warcraft we can get you into some of the top guilds in the twinking community i'm sure pal or muffin or protect the lumber i'm sick of math i'm sick of math oh come do hair come do heroin oh yeah math i don't blame you heroin right i i you know i would i would love to do that with you col in fact when you're talking about earlier i was like another fun thing about playing online games with your friends is watching their voice come out of their character you know what i mean to me that's the most hilarious thing is like you know you you have to what you're doing yeah exactly you know it's but i i yeah i don't know i want a new game i i want to play a new game i'm excited about diablo it's gonna make music even making music do you take music on the road with you like things that you can well sometimes on the road i'll like like mess around i just have like you know i think you're an expert on this the adhd brain it latches on to shit but it only seems to latch for a certain amount of time at least for me you know so i got really into music and i i don't think it's a bad latch like it's like because i got so obsessed with ableton because i got so obsessed with like um audio engineering with all the technical stuff it's not like that goes away like i know how to do it now to some degree right but my brain is now become latched more to like or it was latched to ai in this horrific couple of weeks and now it's sort of a couple of weeks you've been talking to me about it for like eight months oh no philosophically it's been a long time but the last few weeks you've been like deep in there like you know the all this stuff is going to sound arcane but people aren't coders or like deep computer people but they're these things called google collab notebooks do you know what that is no no so essentially like there you can get these things that will run on google meaning that if you don't have a really powerful graphics card and you want to run some some like what's called stable diffusion like uh text to art ai or feeding video into the text to art ai so it replaces every frame with a frame based on your prompt you have to it's essentially renting a gpu from google okay and so which in it's cheap it's not like really expensive at all but uh i real you know i don't know if you ever do this but like there's certain things that i just decide i can't do coding being one of them you know you just there's no reason that you can't do it but you just think that's not me i took a whole path that you'd have to be dedicated to like getting the sort of destruction right in world of warcraft you have you have to like go through the temporal investment watch youtube videos with people with thick eastern european accents learn how to do this insane shit and so like i i realized like fuck i want to have my own neural network on my computer that isn't online that i could do offline if i wanted to and so i just went in deep man and i and like figured it out like and it took a lot of time and did it it took forever and finally i did it so that was the worst part of the obsession is like i just couldn't stop it couldn't stop until it finally was working and now that i've got it working i'm like ah i'm over a so you know what's annoying i'll tell you what's annoying psychedelic evangelists who recommend mega doses of psychedelics to people who are interested in exploring their consciousness this is a dangerous way of being some people think that you're supposed to take a quote heroic dose of some psychedelic for your first time they treat psychedelics the way fraternity brothers treat kegs they want you to do keg stands over a DMT fire i don't think that's the way necessarily to dive in to the world of consciousness shifting substances which is why i absolutely love today's sponsor loomi labs understands the power of the microdose sometimes less actually is more for me there are serious benefits in chomping some of loomi labs delicious microdose gummies the number one benefit is i don't have to worry about suddenly having apocalyptic visions of the end of time because i got the quote

yet good good for you right i've been reading from ai taking a breather from like what am i what am i doing like you i've been reading the four if ever the four hour work week uh and i'm familiar with the book but i haven't read it tim ferris right i think it's four hours tim ferris and you know i approach all these books with like just i grabbed the shit that i like and then discard the rest but his idea like the like the philosophy behind it is sort of like are you overexerting in your own life like are you have you begun to associate pain with success like it's a superstition or something right do you think or are you just so disorganized that your workload ends up being scattered throughout your week instead of compressing everything down so that you get every the idea is like maximum results minimum maximum maximum effort for like four hours right like okay theoretically a four hour work week that's the name of the book but you know uh i i don't know that with all the shit i have to get done but the yeah but really it's more of like a sort of like what is val what is value like right who gives a fuck if you have a million dollars in the bank but you're working 10 hour days every single day right yeah yeah that's like uh yeah there are certain fields of medicine that are like that you know there are certain fields of medicine where they're the highest paid in the profession but they also work like 14 hours a day so they end up you know when i was training and like sort of rotating as part of the medical training you know we um we get a little flavor of the sort of core kinds of medicine that you can go into as medical students and like some of the fields it's like oh these these are the rich people they're like showing up in you know fancy yeah you know cars and stuff but you realize they just drive them to the hospital and home yes like wow like they have a ton of money but um but what do you do if you just have money and no time yeah they have a ton of money but people who are making exponentially less than them are enjoying their lives exponentially more that and and that it's you know you so you've fallen into this like awful sand trap when you find yourself doing that you're like you know i was because of my disorganization because of my obsessive mind because of a general sense of like i if i'm not suffering i must not be working hard enough right i i i realized like i've lived in austin almost a year and i've barely done anything around barely seen it i i got just the path between my house and my studio that was my commute and that it was so awful and then i just realized like i i think i could breathe completely restructure the way i do shit and have infinitely more freedom and it's the best and yeah so now i'm just kind of i guess like my obsessive mind is obsessing on not i'm not doing anything like minimizing trying to clear stuff out yeah like all right what's your workload like cool what's your work my work it's intense oh it's intense work but um you know i think the last time we spoke on the podcast i was just opening this clinic um for those of you don't know it's a it's a what's the name of your clinic call the california center for psychedelic therapy and and even though it's only been a few years it seems like that's kind of like a normal thing people hear about now is a psychedelic clinic or psychedelic place but i remember us talking when we were first opening up and i was like i think this is the first one or like and i know there are others that would maybe contest that but like certainly the first clinic that's psychedelic in the title of it but now it almost seems like oh everybody's got a you know everybody got a friend that goes to a psychedelic clinic but man when i opened this place three years ago it still felt like you know is this gonna work like is this gonna work out and then the pandemic hit but it's been good it's been good but there's a just because you call the psychedelic clinic right doesn't make it as like i had a friend who on my recommendation went to some fucking shit ketamine clinic and like they just gave him imk and i remember he's texting me from the the room that they gave it to him in and he's like he's like when can i drive and oh my gosh why are you asking me that like where's the doctor who gave you this shit somebody get the nurse in there like this should be something they told you before you came this should be yeah what is happening because they're right there the problem is because ketamine is you can administer ketamine without being a doctor right so a lot of these pop-ups have appeared where people haven't been trained in this in the the the healing part and the dealing with people tripping out and so people are just driving it's like some psychedelic version of the thing that happened in florida the pain clinics right you could just go to the pain clinics say your toe hurts they're like oh here's i don't care here's your nose yeah yeah it's like that your clinic which i've been to is this beautiful place on large mom but you like there's therapy involved you're not just yes yes no we take it very very seriously yeah and we and all of our team here has a specific interest in working with people in with psychedelics you know we do psychedelic research here we've been doing the MDMA assisted psychotherapy for PTSD trials like in the same facility since i think it's like seven years now 2016 i think is when i assembled the team in 2017 is when we started the study we've since done like four or five we're on our fourth MDMA trial for PTSD which definitely want to talk about you know the updates on that that's going really great and almost at the finish line i feel like i've been talking to you for like six years about this project and every time i talk to you i'm like we're like right at the finish line we're right but we are really seriously right at the finish line um and then is there any chance that something could go wrong is there any chance now that it wouldn't happen something could go wrong like you know but it would be a surprise to everyone as far as like a safety thing i think like there could be a real safety issue that could come up you know if but not one that anyone is expecting or anticipating you know right uh one one thing that you know we certainly have on our side is the fact that people have been taking MDMA for 40 years like right in much you know in very unregulated places and stuff so we have a pretty good idea of what the range of effects on people are so yeah nothing nothing that is anticipated would like just totally put a stop to it in fact we're done gathering the data so like like we've we've for the last four years or so we've been doing the phase three trials so at the phase three trials are the last phase before the FDA um is like presented with the when you present the the FDA with the phase three trial data that's when they make a ruling essentially on whether this is uh a medicine or not and so um when i first started we were still in phase two um we'd completed a phase three trial that was um had a really great outcomes great success you know um and um and then we had a second phase three trial which is you know the same so um it's designed the same it functions the same and so we haven't we've gathered all of the data and we've analyzed the data but we haven't published the data yet but we don't expect that it will be much different from the first one because it's more or less a copycat of the first trial so right um so as long as like uh and the and the first phase three study was consistent with the data we were getting from phase two like it's all kind of gone um how we had expected as far as safety and efficacy and that's what the FDA is going to be reviewing is safety and efficacy and so um so it's you know that that's happening you know that that's where we're at in the process it's like it there aren't additional studies necessarily that are needed at this at this point before we would get a response so it's possible that we're talking about like the first time in history that a lot of things have happened a lot of historical things have happened first time in history yeah like probably most important uh that something was put on schedule one and potentially put on a different schedule um wow historic um schedule one being a DEA definition of having no medical value and only a potential for harm and abuse so wow for something to be moved off of schedule one that's not happened um and then uh especially for a medical indication but also you know much to maps credit like I don't think anyone's ever put something through the FDA approval process because it's expensive we're talking tens of millions of dollars um put the put a drug through the rigorous testing on donations from the people who may someday benefit from that treatment like that like I've never heard of a drug being developed that like you know people believed in so much that they were willing to donate their own money to have it tested right there's no like ozempic uh community that thinks oh this has such healing potential I'm gonna give like a thousand bucks to the ozempic research representation right how dare they make that fucking song how dare they they should be arrested for that oh my gosh yeah that song is just a disaster that having to hear that is just the fucking worst no one likes the ozempic song anyone from ozempic listening please for god's sake change that song and they must have so much money oh they ruin the original song for the original ozempic by bob dylan it's magic ever again bob dylan's ozempic is just my favorite it's the best when he said so what's it feel like to be not just like for everybody who has benefited from MDMA or for anyone who's even intuitive like shit I think this is like more than something that's fun to have sex on right there seems to be some benefit that's happening here that is incredible what what does it feel like to to not just be on the precipice of that being sort of rescheduled and then most importantly being administered to people with trauma what does it feel like to be part of the team that has been sweating bullets to make that happen yeah it's been it's like it's almost I don't know if it'll ever it's one of those things that like will never sink in they can never fully sink in like I'm sure a lot of things that have happened to you you know like uh like right um it's like but but I but I'm consciously aware of the amazingness of it you know like I'm I I think about like did I really expect this to happen and and my honest answer is I don't think so like I think I believed in it I think I believed that it was certainly worth testing to see but I I really thought that what I was getting into was that I would be able to tell a story to people like you or friends other friends someday about the time we tried really hard and then you know the feds showed up and shut us all down and you know what I mean like I thought that's what we were kind of getting into I didn't you know like I I kind of thought we were going to get going but some you know evil force was going to just not let us find out the answer to this question but that like to the federal government's credit to the DEA and the FDA's credit it there is a path it's just difficult and expensive um but like that that's surprising to me that that repeatedly is surprising to me actually throughout throughout all these years that uh that that this path existed like it took maps a lot of money and a lot of effort and a lot of time to find the path and figure it out and a lot of advisors and a lot to like figure out how do we get from here to there but but we're doing it and now now we're faced with this issue of like okay um we and we you know we designed it we designed the the the um the protocol like the way it's administered um I didn't personally design it but it was designed to just like with that kind of in mind like let's just see if this works right right um let's just see if this is going to work and um and now that it seems like it does it's bringing up all of these other things about like oh my gosh like this is going to be if this becomes a medicine next year like how do we do that like how do we how is it going to get to people how are people going to be able to access it how are you know therapists going to be able to provide it what kinds of clinics you know like most clinics are not like mine my clinic was built starting with ketamine but with the idea that if these other psychedelics become available we would not be in a position where we couldn't accommodate like an eight hour day an eight hour session yeah there's no precedent right like it's like generally you prescribe a medicine to your patient the patient takes the medicine on their own time you're you know you're you're not like no doctors hanging out with you when you take your penicillin and right watching you all day so so there's this added involvement from the professional that's a big time investment too like that's totally you know and it's and it and it's like you know therapy how long does a therapy session last hour two hours maybe if you have like a great therapist but you're talking the session you're talking aftercare you know that's a huge time investment and that sounds expensive Cole that sounds expensive it is it is and and that's gonna you know I think that's the challenge moving forward like with for there there have been some like ideas but it's it always is compromising the quality of the you know like that I guess that's the trade-off always the other trade-off is like you know they're in the pandemic something that people might not be aware of but like there was a loosening of like telemedicine rules yeah because they were trying to you know protect people who you know were sick you know we're trying to keep people isolated essentially to stop the spread of COVID so so they sort of formally loosened restrictions on what can be done by telemedicine so all these tele mental health and other forms of telemedicine exploded in the past three years like you know I don't know if this is part of better helps story but like for example there's that service that like almost seems like you know very well known now didn't even exist to my knowledge like prior to the pandemic they're like and and specifically with controlled substances like ketamine or adderall or painkillers like there are stricter rules about telemedicine you know telemedicine is a great and expanding accessibility of treatments yeah generally but something that happened in the pandemic is we we knew that it was not a great idea for certain kinds of compounds like ketamine Xanax Xanax exactly but a but a handful of like clinics popped up and grew quickly that were all telemedicine based and we're starting to see some of the fallout of that already yeah and and that also will be coming to an end but but you know philosophically you know it's like we want people to be excess be able to access medicine and we want to be able to make it more affordable and telemedicine is one way to make it more affordable but it's seeming like with ketamine and it will definitely for me I would never I won't do that I like I think that's really dangerous to like give people ketamine to use at their homes um for a number of reasons um but yeah I think that's like it's also like now I'm trying to strike yeah the ketamine order from those clinics is ridiculously expensive it's like stupid how much it costs like the amount you're paying for a dose of ketamine it's dumb like it's crazy yeah it's crazy I mean that's one of the that to me that you know that's the biggest problem but I get here I'm here a doctor I went to one of those things I was like fuck it maybe I'll order some ketamine I'm like I'm not there's no way I'm paying like 50 times the amount that ketamine costs to get like a ketamine gummy from one of these clinics ridiculous exploitive like give me a fucking break I know what you paid for this ketamine yeah yeah yeah and you know like for for a clinic like ours um the like we try and keep the costs as low as possible but of course it's still going to be unaffordable for a lot of people um but primarily what we almost like the ketamine is kind of free like we kind of eat the costs of the ketamine and we we mostly charge for that therapist time so like that's kind of how we work with it here like and that is going to be a reality when you know if MDMA assisted therapy becomes a treatment you know eight hour a day where the therapist is just therapy therapists are highly trained professionals they're very expensive so you know all that stuff is sort of you know staring us in the face now that it's like oh my gosh we're actually maybe going to this is going to be a reality for us I think the precedent if you're looking for one is more like surgery it's like you know this is more akin to some kind of like pharmacological right word pharmaceutical surgery that you're doing you're essentially extracting trauma from people and it's a procedure it's a procedure this is a procedure this is not a medication and and then suddenly it will make more sense to people why because it's like you you know you go to the hospital and you get your kidney stone blasted or whatever they do with that now yeah you're not like confused by the price you're expecting the price to suck the insurance companies are expecting that you know that's the main thing I imagine it's like getting connected to the insurance companies setting sure that's a challenge the reason why this therapy is no doubt going to cost more than normal administration of medicine and it should I mean this is what I like about well in my old age yeah yeah and something I think that will make sense to insurance companies and hopefully will make sense to everybody is like you know the the robustness of the like healing you know that the the insurance companies will will know that like similar to a surgery you know an expensive procedure up front could save a lot of money to the insurance companies on the back end if somebody no longer has PTSD for example you know like last time I heard the numbers it's like a million dollars per person in the VA for a lifetime of treatment for PTSD somewhere around that number and so even if it's you know expensive up front on the whole if the data is like what we've been seeing it hopefully will make sense to the insurance companies will be something that will be covered by insurance I think that will that will expand the accessibility then to like the insured people the insured population and then you know there's this whole other problem in the medical universe the way the medicine works in the United States where even if you're an insured person for some reason you don't get access to like all of the things that could be most useful for your care because the insurance companies are their own whole other right enigma you know the way that they operate I mean most therapists won't even accept insurance these days like they don't even want to deal with it like they don't want to like fuck with the insurance companies because it's so but I yeah I see what you're saying like you know you're getting an important something when your insurance company is encouraging you or even like rewarding you like a colonoscopy they want you to get a colonoscopy because if you get a colonoscopy long term it's going to save them so much money so they are dying for you to go and get a fucking colonoscopy which I have to do next week and I'm not looking forward to all right it's like they they delight in that you're getting this awful procedure but yeah it's a system of oppression they're oppressing my colon my polyps they want to just show you who's boss oh I can't well I would like that but they know they put you under you don't even get the like uh that's just boss experience I guess you could ask the doctor does anyone come in here and like not get sedated right he he was like very rare very maybe that's a niche market like maybe that's you know something to explore we could try and find erotic colonoscopies erotic colonoscopies yeah I'm sure I'm sure that there is a jet set well well funded population of people who will fly to the colonoscopy VR VR you get those goggles on you like suddenly you're in a barn that's the million dollar idea a beautiful horse furry thing that's like you know waving at you an avatar yeah yeah that would that would you know that save a lot of lives that would save a lot of lives in the kink community you know right like countless people would be just lining up to get sodomized by a colonoscopy centaur would be doing a service and then it sends a sample off to a lab and you also find out whether or not you know you're at risk for colon cancer why not continuing to support the DTFH friends Squarespace is your toolbox if you're interested in creating an online home for

you and and maps have come up with for administering the medicine the therapy preceding the medicine after the medicine it seems like you've set up like a way of administering psychedelic medicine in general right like this would would this also work for psilocybin i hope so theoretically work for lsd or is it specific to mdma yeah so like you know i i think um like with ketamine you mentioned there are places where they're just like giving ketamine right yeah like my hope is that the data has universally always said you know medicine combined with therapy even if it's an ssri and cognitive behavioral therapy like very confident fairly accessible forms of treatment are always better than either one of them or both of them you know like there's a you know there's an additive benefit to doing both at the same time and i'm hoping that with that first of all i do think it's with with mdma assisted psychotherapy for or mdma assisted therapy for ptsd specifically the therapy is it it is a must um with the ketamine people can get better without the therapy but they get i have found that in the research i've done of trials where they'd worked with just ketamine and didn't offer therapy there's like a 63 65 response rate people who have like a 50 reduction in depression scores i think we have a higher success rate at my clinic probably closer to three quarters and i think it's because of the therapy component and i think even if it's like not increasing the number of people who are going to get better like psychedelics are inherently like a profoundly interesting and personal experience so if you're if you like even if that doesn't directly link to you know reduction in your depression symptoms right away it gives you like the the knowledge of self the like sort of more universal personal growth things that can come from it i think you're like just missing a tremendous opportunity if you don't take that psychedelic experience seriously to process and integrate and yeah yeah why was on a mother ship can you explain to me why i was on a mother ship i seemed to be on an alien craft and i kept going back to the alien do you what was that why did why was i in valhalla well can you explain to me why i was seeing like an anvil with a demonic creature smashing a bloody package over and over like right i forget my depression what the fuck just happened to me man what was that and we've literally gotten patients like we've gotten patients who have like you know set who have gone to a clinic where they um provide like an IV infusion for example and then just leave the room and then come back you know in an hour and then like make sure you get a ride home or whatever like that that don't put any emphasis on the psychedelic experience we've had patients that come here because they're like you know i had a i was seeing my dead you know like something so obviously like psychologically important material coming from these experiences you know like i was with my children and they were telling me not to go into the cave you know it's like oh my gosh so much to explore here like yes so much like relevant material and like so uh i do think that with i know the intention is with psilocybin it will also be like psilocybin assisted therapy it won't just be like you take the psilocybin um i think i believe it to be a necessary part of it what what will happen when the free market gets its hands on it i don't know like i said it's already happened with ketamine you know in the pandemic and hopefully some loopholes will get closed where people are just being sent ketamine to their house in like pill form and told you know given some advice that i really don't see any evidence for um some of the time like what where sucks uh like taking it every day like we we we know that could be really dangerous to take it every day um uh there are some um i haven't seen any like data to suggest taking it every day um let me tell you as a former ketamine addict better than taking it yeah that's good news oh you want me to say every day no problem exactly like and and if somebody is you know if you're telling them that that's okay and then that's legitimate like you know yes they cannot people obviously can become dependent on it and you don't know how they're actually using it when they're using it outside of the clinic they're just a lot of risks you know like i know there are i know like there are gonna be a lot of people hearing this conversation that would be like like i can be responsible and i can do it you know twice a week the way you know for a short period of time like the data would suggest and i can look up what like the appropriate protocols are and i like of course there are people out there who can do that but those aren't the ones we're worried about the ones we're worried about are the people who who have trouble with that kind of thing or like just have a predisposition to become addicts yeah exactly like they're not bad people it's part of their condition that they learn how to get the things they feel they need you know it's it's it's not even a judgment call it's or you know it's certainly not a like it's not meant to be a judgment on them it's just a reality that like when people have addiction or or even when people are getting better something something that came up in this new york times article that came out about some phenomenon that are happening and in the like send send people can i mean at their homes situation is people are developing side effects that they're not then telling their doctor because they're afraid it will be taken away because it works well and because it works for them it's like not even people who seem to be displaying like dependency issues their their depression is gone and it's the only thing that's worked for them and so they're not telling their doctor that like they're having these serious side effects and the doctor can't see them or you know um so there there are those reasons that you know it's concerning to think that it is definitely not the plan uh anyone that i'm aware of doing the hard work of getting of of figuring out how these things can be helpful for mental health conditions i've never heard any of them like that thought it was the plan to like get it there and then just send people mdma to their house or send people psilocybin to their home you know all the substance doesn't sound like a good idea of all the substances that i've grappled with in my life as an addict outside of nicotine i have never encountered a more addictive substance than ketamine something happened with me and it happened the same thing happened with opioids i don't know maybe it's god or jesus protecting me but i just stopped liking it like but when i was addicted to it great it's we it's weird like it just stopped being enjoyable it just felt it didn't make me feel good anymore i i think it's because like something happens with ketamine where your access to the k-hole snorting it uh insulating it uh it just it becomes it's like they're like no you're not coming you can't come in here anymore like you you're granted the vision that's what happened to me and then it just becomes like what when i was addicted to it people who were not and would do it as a kind of like euphoric you know sometimes an alcohol replacement they would be like i've never what are you talking about i've never been on the mothership i've never encountered aliens i don't understand what is this it's like that became my experience of ketamine is now is it's just like i get it it's kind of euphoric i don't like that i can't walk as well anymore it upsets my stomach a little bit so now i just don't have that addict thing of like fuck man i want to dive back into that alternate reality sure but let me tell you man it crept some people crept up and it creeps up yeah it's a kind of addiction creeps up on you you know i guess that's most addictions lost to you you're still there call you froze up on me oh there you are okay it's creepy it like it's slowly you slowly it's a slow boil man and then the next thing you know you're just you're addicted i know a lot of people have gotten hooked on it man and it's it's and and it's really dangerous to use so frequently i mean in general i don't recommend using it out you know especially if you have a medical condition if you have depression or PTSD like please don't go to an underground or you know go to a rave and take the drugs and and be under the impression that that's going to help with your depression or PTSD like that i'd like to make that distinction in the first place but i know people are going to recreationally use all all sorts of drugs so people should know with ketamine that uh you know heavy regular use frequent they are like daily use for example can lead to like this bladder toxicity problem that is is not present or at least we have not seen it in my clinic and it's not something that has been like demonstrated to be an occurrence in a particular range like if we use this particular range a half milligram to one milligram per kilogram body weight and we use it twice a week at a maximum for a short period of time and then as infrequently as possible that's my that's the way i work with it we do it for a short period of time no more than twice a week and that's like for four weeks and then yeah people will come back sort of just as needed for you know sometimes once every month for a little while sometimes a couple times a year we have not seen the development of these bladder issues but we know for sure they happen in patients who use a high amount every single day and we don't know where in between those two does that stuff start to happen to people is it when you're using it every day that it starts to happen is it when you're using it a really really high dose that it starts to happen is it when you only combine high dose and daily use that it starts to happen like and so is it types is it related to a specific completely harmless or something you know of course you wouldn't all the obvious things like don't drive like all the like any sort of motor function drive completely impaired but on top of that like obvious stuff there are like things happening on the inside that could be problematic if people are just sort of left to their own decision making about how frequently they're going to use it or you know and it but and also the effect of it it's it can be kind of nullifying like you start ignoring what could be symptoms that this is fucking your body up you could you could be sure you start like not paying attention anymore because it's a disassociative you right you're you're concerned for your physical well-being right and I think this is probably true for lots of you're not anymore you don't care as much you and that's where it's really sinister I mean I don't want to seem like some anti-cademy person I'm not I think I have benefited from it and I think that there is not just from the angle of treating depression but from the the potential visionary experience you can have with ketamine the cosmology it can introduce you to that all of these like aspects of it are so beautiful it's just god damn it it's too easy to do like little bumps of it throughout the day and again I'm not trying to this is maybe not something to say publicly but there's a few drugs I've encountered that are creativity enhancers weed obviously in ketamine I'm sorry but it is at least for me again this is I'm doing that this is the problem and this I think one of the big problems in the psychedelic universe is that many of us project our personal experience for the substance on everybody it might not work for you in that way but for me it was it was inspirational it was mind-expanding it gave me ideas that turned into something good and and that's another quality of the addiction you don't honestly it would be better for a drug did not do that than for it to do it because now you have this creativity crutch now you feel like you can only be creative if you're oh yeah that happens yeah yeah probably feel like they like they've gotten so used to yeah especially in creative pursuits I've seen that so much yeah and and you're right like that people do project what their experience with the psychedelic has been on to others and man when you when you do it when you are working with psychedelics daily like I am you know several times a day providing it to people first of all like when we're working with depression and PTSD our patient population isn't a bunch of burners our patient population isn't like people going to you know flaming lips concert our patient population our people with depression who may have no interest in psychedelic experiences you know like right a good a good chunk of our you know pie graph of patients are people who've never had a psychedelic experience prior to this wow and everyone is there like anybody who has a group of friends even will have one or two friends who have a strange reaction compared to the rest of the group to drug like that's that is more like what it's like I would say you know a couple in every 10 will have a very different experience from everybody else and so it is very problematic especially when people get like talking about policy and talking about like giving advice to other people about using these things is like totally based on what their experience has been with it and right that's like the added responsibility I think with using it medically is you're like by definition we need to know what are like really rare things that are going to come up because if you're using it like I've done over 4,000 sessions now for others not by myself and so there are you know I've seen people get nauseous I've seen people vomit I've seen people feel dizzy for a whole day you know like extremely extremely rare but when it's even if it's something that's one in a thousand I've seen if you know about four times now you know and so like that concerns me when it comes to people thinking about it's even true about marijuana but like when it comes to people thinking that like psychedelics are going to be go the way that like marijuana did where it's like oh we're gonna get it medically proven first this is so different from that but I think a lot of people think that's what's like what it's going to that's the path or something or that's the future. The Cordova Milk Bar the Cordova Milk Bar and Clockwork Orange I think it was Cordova the milk bar you go there get a little synthomest or whatever you know like that's what they picture they picture that like cafes you go to the cafe and you're like can I get a micro dose of psilocybin and a latte or something like that they don't realize that that will not probably will not happen. I mean and it and it might but if it does it's not the same thing that we're doing right now like like people with depression people with PTSD like that's a nightmare to me to like think of those people going to a place like that thinking that it's the same thing you know like I think that I think that it's a reasonable different process to pursue like it's not recreational like people use I think I think it's like that that's something society will decide whether it's cool or not and I'm fine if people do decide that because then people know that they're taking that risk for themselves like people know I went to the store I bought mushrooms then I went home and I took those mushrooms and I freaked out and now you know my girlfriend's mad at me or my boyfriend or you know like I you know called my mom and said some weird thing you know like they know like I took that risk but that's not when someone goes to get medical treatment it is a very different dynamic they're assuming that you are taking care of like you they put on you the power of that responsibility and so like in that way I think like marijuana never did that thing marijuana never went through the process of like you know there were a bunch of small studies that have showed that it can be a value to like people in different with different medical conditions but there's no like FDA trial where it was like one gram treats glaucoma when used in this way at this frequency it's like no no even if you are using marijuana for a medical thing there's no way that like smoking dabs all day is the appropriate dosage for whatever your medical condition is like that's just recreation that's like you know you're just you know smoking to smoke which is fine but it's not the same thing that we're doing when we're working with something medically and I like with psychedelics I feel like we really need to keep those lanes separated like yeah man I love that you're depressed you have PTSD you need to you know like we need to really honor that we're doing really good science science that was not necessarily done with marijuana for a lot of reasons but we're doing really good science to figure out how to best provide that safely and effectively and the to me anyway the agenda is not to like then once we get it medically available then we're just gonna like try and change those rules to make it publicly available or something like right there's no sneaky need to prove their safety and yeah like those processes need to be like separated from each other and pursued separately and you know I'm all four people you know trying to make it possible to have those milk bars but not have them be like a place people are going if they are looking for medical care you know no you're going there because you're about to go invade someone's house and beat them to death well at least ultraviolet but you know like therapy therapy my experience with therapy has been it is it sucks every single at least the great therapist died in North Carolina every single session I almost didn't go to it every single session I almost canceled because I knew when I went in there it's going to be work it's going to hurt it's going to like go into deep or deeper than I want to go and I think you know I think that's you know when people hear psychedelics they they think of all those great moments all those moments where like the you merged at the festival with the festival all those great moments with your friends and that is what beautiful the best but they if they're not familiar with therapy and again I've never done psychedelic therapy so I can only imagine the combination of the the the a trained therapist and the psychedelic opening you up that does not sound fun to me Cole that sounds fucking brutal that sounds like just like like that's I mean it's not quite a colonoscopy but honestly if I had a choice between the two right now I can't say right away which I would pick you know like one you're putting you to sleep and shoving a thing up your ass the other they're waking you up more and like like going deep in to find where the trauma is that is that does not sound fun at least from the normal way that I define fun well well I'll say about the psychedelic therapy that like in and I've trained in psilocybin I've done the MDMA work I've done the ketamine work like I have seen it so that you things won't come up that you truly can't handle for the most part you know like there may be stuff in there that you're not ready to handle but we there's a sort of phrase trust the medicine you know like trust trust the process let me cut you off for one second like what yeah what you just said sorry one quick interjection what you just said yeah was literally the least favorite thing that I would hear my therapist say as we were zooming in on something that I had been working my entire life to shove under the rug and she was so good at coaxing it out so good at being like it's better if you go there it's better just you can handle it if it's coming let it come go there and every little bit of you knowing oh fuck I'm going in the room I don't want to go in the room it's the room with all the locks that comes up in my dream you know I hated when she was saying that because it meant we're almost there and it meant like there was going to be like sobbing there was going to be uh even now I can feel it oh so when you say that I'm like oh god no that room you know what I mean like oh yeah but that that's why we need the therapist because right so I'm sorry for cutting you off that is a superpower no no totally no I'm glad that you said that like that that really is part of you know a lot of the clinicians that work with these feel like that like you you there are some things you literally won't be able to go into an unlock like your your your mind and your body won't let you go there won't especially with trauma you know and yeah that is the beauty of the what we've seen it with ketamine too but certainly with the mdma that like that visceral inability to approach it is something that that that's part of what the the magic that the medicine brings like and there's a cycle there there's like physiological explanation for that with mdma there's like a decreased activity in the amygdala and the amygdala is the thing that does that it's the thing that clamps down is like we're not it's interesting physically in space the amygdala is close to where memories are also so there's likely a kill switch there on certain memory access you know like and when you feel totally truly safe and connected to your therapist in the room which you can get to after a long time developing that right trust and care and and connection to your therapist you can get there eventually but but the mdma sort of supercharges that process of the connection and the security and the safety so it's a huge responsibility for the therapist to that hold that that like responsibility of holding it with care and holding it with kindness and holding it with non-judgment um so you know another reason that it should not be just something you can get at the milk bar uh you know so like so with with and with ketamine it's a dissociative anesthetic you know sort of one of the ways it operates is to kind of dissociate so so your tolerance is for a little more depth like kind of naturally the one of the effects of the drugs is you can approach those traumatic things and that's so interesting that you describe it like that because i've heard you know people you would have never met or talked about unless you guys are reading the same books um right describe you know the box that's not a lot you're not allowed to open that box you know or a closet you know like it's always like a seemed like almost even uh may not be of that much interest but like a rectangular sealed object with with locks on it like there you know something truly uh not accessible um yeah yeah uh so so with uh yeah the mdma and the ketamine it's not that it's like making you go somewhere that's as uncomfortable as it would be without those things it just you're now able to i get it not just break down sobbing or have a full blown panic attack when you start talking about that traumatic thing but yes you're like it's like big picture thing is yes like when we're doing the work here we are not um it can be fun people can have connections to joy and ecstasy and bliss and when it does when that happens it's beautiful that can be part of somebody's process but when we're working with trauma ultimately a big chunk of it is talking about the worst thing that's ever happened to them it's not a fun experience it isn't yeah a fun thing and it's not something you'd want to be doing at a rave or at a milk bar or something like that it would be you're not getting in the box at edc god help you if you do you know i would before i got into therapy i would circle it though like i would like if i was on enough acid i would start having memories that made no sense and i would think like is it past life stuff what the fuck is this my abs i wish it was past life stuff but you sort of have these like flickering what the fuck is that why am i seeing that why do i see that when i'm about to fall asleep what the fuck is that and and right you know but just getting getting in there man and it like that's you know that my therapist showed me is it's like it's not like after you remember it you have to like just remembering it can be enough just that alone like having the courage to open the fucking thing and look in and like and the other thing she explained to me which was fascinating is that a lot of these traumatic incidents that happen to kids if they happen to adult they might not be traumatic anymore right but right right when you're in a little body and you don't understand everything's a threat yeah yeah and so you when everyone's bigger when everyone's five times your size everything you know your body your physiology your nervous system is designed to survive so your body knows you know yeah your body's aware like oh this this is a giant who's like screaming and yelling for example you know like exactly an example of the kind of thing that like as an adult like okay you know and you just feel like you're an asshole day but not your life you know when you're yeah yeah it's like different big big influence yeah she she would is we're doing we were doing edmr i think that's what it's called okay what mdr mdr edmr uh that's the milk bar but the uh i can remember in one of the things that came up realizing oh fuck here it is this is the thing and but knowing it was gonna happen like the the box is opening and getting really scared and she's like it's it might not be what you think because you know when you go in these sessions you know what you're thinking you're like was i sexually abused was there something like that she's like yeah it it a lot it just it seems something and then the what i would i remember which i won't share it was awful but nothing yeah yeah but still awful and stuck in me what yeah speak it was speakable very right like it's felt unspeakable before but yeah now that's when you bring it out of the box you're like you can say it and when you can talk about it you know like this is not i don't this is an example of what we were talking about before we're like don't project what worked for you on everybody but one way i have seen people healing is just being able to open that box now because there there there's a there's a really great um therapy model called internal family systems that we that is that works very well with these and like in that model the idea is that like you know there are different parts of ourselves the language like our inner child and stuff like that it lends to this model if not even came from this model um that we have different parts of ourselves and they show up in different ways in different settings and under different circumstances and like there's a whole classification of parts of self that are like guardians and they guard that box and they guard those rooms inside and they guard them with um things that guards would use they guard them with violent language they guard them with violence they guard them with uh self-destruction they guard you know what i mean and so like this kind of work can allow those guards to relax or can you know sometimes away towards healing can be exploring what those parts are that are in the individual and then opening dialogue between the different parts as odd as that might sound but opening dialogue between the part of you that wants to heal and the part of you that is like no one's allowed in this box though and negotiating a like what if we open you know like literally you know that that's something that we can it would be not uncommon to see in a in a therapy room is let's negotiate a deal like is is there even room to negotiate period like if the guardian is like look if you even suggest we even have this conversation about this box i am going to be suicidal for the next two weeks that's the punishment for you to suggest you know what i mean like uh that's but it could also often be you know that you know a really beautiful thing to see that i've seen in some examples um is those guards are tired of guarding the box well the guard doesn't like having to you know be suicidal every time the box comes up but it needs to protect that like the box must stay closed and that's that you know those are some of the like beautiful negotiations and work that we can see is things along those lines you know just you know giving giving examples of the kinds of stuff that can come up but um but yeah it's interesting that you have a box and most oh i got more than one i got john one case is fucking basement but you know what's what's what's cool is you know every time i didn't open all my boxes we left ashville before i finished the therapy but like sure the yeah what's fascinating for me you know i used to like you you get your childhood back like you remember huge chunks like it's not like releases that's the yeah that's the pay off you know like the payoff is like in that if people can you know kind of conceptualize that example that i was just giving like that could be like the experience of ptsd the experience of ptsd is anything that alludes to that box is met with this response of i'm suicidal or i'm not talking to you anymore i'm not you know i'm not leaving my apartment ever again because yes things when i leave this apartment suggest i look in this box and i'm not doing that if it's you know in the horrific example of like a sexual assault you know like it could be an entire gender that makes you feel like that box is being you know like it could be going to a club with loud music and alcohol being served is like whoa too many things reminding me of the box you know like so just social isolation whereas when oftentimes if people can get to a place where they feel safe enough and you definitely do not want to open that box prematurely and you don't want to go there if you're not actually ready because those guardians will do their thing um yeah if you can negotiate an opening of it a lot of times it's like you said it's like it's not as unspeakable as you may have thought sometimes that's what happens or sometimes it's just something that needs to be witnessed you know and that can be in that example could be a role of the therapist is to just bear witness that this truly horrific thing happened and it really did happen and yeah and and whatever happens once you you know do or do not open the box you know whatever happens um being able to talk about it it's not like the healing comes from talking about it it's just that when you don't have a box to guard anymore like those guards can kind of calm down like it's now a part of a story you can tell of your life even to yourself you know like it's not something you necessarily have to share with somebody else but it can again be a whole part of yourself that what we call like reintegration like it can it can return to give you a more full picture of who you are rather than I'm this person except for the things related to this box than I'm this other thing then yeah my personhood and my my own autobiographical story of who I am completely makes sense as long as we aren't talking about that thing that's in the box right but now we can integrate that into our full you know like a more full understanding of ourselves so those are the kinds of things too to go back to like the like you know the value of the ketamine experiences even you know that I've been mostly talking about phenomenon observed primarily in the mgma work but it can be observed in the ketamine work too like those are the kinds of things that I am like those things are happening to people and if we are making room and we aren't providing an environment where we can immediately talk to them about those experiences and integrate those experiences those are the kinds of opportunities that can be completely missed you know like if somebody's just getting an infusion out of place which again people get better that way I don't want to like if that's the only way it's available in your town or you know I don't want to discourage people from getting whatever treatment is available to them but the reason we do it the way we do it is because we know those experiences are happening to people from taking the antidepressant dose of this medicine and what an opportunity to be lost if we aren't there to just bear witness to it. Dr. Cole Marta for the first time in our friendship I've wished we weren't friends because I'm like fuck I wish you were my therapist you're amazing that is a curse that is a curse I see in your face how much you love your job I see you're glowing when you're talking about this you are in love with this work and it shows and it's a beautiful thing that you're doing and all my friends yeah well Cole um what's the name of your clinic again I'm what kind of friend does it remember the name is friends academy that's okay the california center for psychedelic therapy and we have a website the it's psychedelictherapyca.com psychedelic therapy ca is in california.com and we yeah currently offer ketamine assisted therapy and we also do integration services we have a tremendous team I really think we have the best clinicians in this field in this region not you know there are great clinicians everywhere but I our team is particularly good and they're particularly mastered at working with psychedelic experiences people we also do general talk therapy people who may have had experiences outside of a context of medicine that are troubling or not even necessarily troubling but just had they want to talk about psychedelics with somebody who understands those and respects those experiences that's cool we we have those and yeah we also do the research here and we're you know it we talked a bit about like the financial stressors I do want to mention real quick the um that one of the programs that we recently have started that we're excited about because it is expensive we try to keep the price as low as we can we really do but it is going to be out of price range for a lot of people and so one solution we've come up with that we're like kind of launching right now is Brooke and Joseph from our clinic met up with Kevin and Ronnie from Thank You Life which is a nonprofit organization actually I think in Texas and they their goal is to actually raise funds for this exact problem like we know that psychedelic treatments may be expensive and we also want that not to be the only reason like we don't want it to only be available to people who can afford out of pocket and so yeah one solution to come up with is Thank You Life they are a fundraising organization that is focused on providing psychedelic treatment specifically to people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it and they've partnered with a local group here called New Earth that offers like all kinds of services to like young adults who um like educational services wrap around services that include mental health services and so it would be like a one-of-a-kind thing to be able to work with people in that population who otherwise would never be able to have access to this like it even if they get set up with for example a county program they wouldn't be able to access psychedelic therapy through a county program so there's there's sort of a team effort to pilot a program where we actually will start to have a certain number of our cases that we can see our people who otherwise wouldn't be able to have access to it.

Greetings to you sweet friends. It is I D Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast. I don't remember where I read it, but I read somewhere that if something magical happens to you, you should announce that something magical has happened to you. Actually now that I think about it, I think that the idea is that if you cast a spell that works, you're supposed to say that the spell worked. I can't remember wizard rules, right? I mean, they're so difficult to remember. But there are rules out there for wizards and witches and warlocks and I think one of the main rules is that we have to be very careful about what we say because sometimes not all the time, sometimes the things that you say actually do come true and this can happen in the in big ways and it can also happen in really small ways and today happened in a really small way, which is that I was having a meeting and I was talking with someone that I'm working with and we're just discussing, you know, having dogs around and what it's like to have dogs in an office and he told me a really sad story, which is that during a meeting, someone's dog had shit on the floor of the office and they had accidentally rolled their chair backwards into the shit. I guess it happened really quick. The dog did a kind of terrorist style shit right in front of the wheels of the wheelie chair and they were probably engrossed in like some serious conversation and the chair went back and all that pressure and the wheel and just smashed all the shit into the wheel and the chair and he told me how to throw the chair away, whatever, you know, it's just a classic like disaster, minor disaster, minor catastrophe story involving dog shit and that brought to mind something that I've seen on the internet, which you can Google, which is from and probably more than actually, you know what, I'm going to Google it right now. Let me see. There's probably, it's probably a whole genre by now. Yep, for sure, it's a genre and the genre is Roomba's activating on their own and rolling over dog shit in someone's house. And so this is just a recipe for pure unbridled horror. When you get home, you get home, you programmed your Roomba to clean the house, you get home and the Roomba has done the opposite. It is covered your house with shit and sure it would be easy to get into how this represents one of the many technological disruptions that has been predicted as we move towards the singularity, I could point out that this is a very small example of the potential catastrophe that happens when technology intersects and slams into biology. It's not always transhumanism. It's not always CRISPR transforming our cells so that we become stronger, less fat or smarter. Sometimes it can go wrong. It can go Brundle fly level wrong. And that's what happens when a Roomba slides over dog shit at your house. So, you know, I just brought it up because we're talking about, I guess, tools that spread shit, chair being a tool, Roomba being a tool, and we didn't even get to get in the conversation about it. But here's the magic part, I'm in the Uber headed home when my wife calls to tell me that the Roomba ran over dog shit. This happened within probably 20 minutes of talking about it at this meeting. And look, I, you know, I'm a blabbermouth. I'll admit it. It's my job. I talk all the time and I talk too much. The other night at a party, I gave somebody like an authentic ear beating like an eight minute, at least an eight minute ear beating about modular synthesizers and I couldn't make myself. I was like watching my lips. I was boring myself. Like if my skeleton could have ripped itself out of my own body and run away from the ear beating, I was giving this man, I, it would have, but I was stuck listening to my voice yap about modular synthesizers to somebody who like, I, I'm very sorry that I did that to that man. But I very rarely talk about shit smearing Roombas. And this happened within minutes of the conversation. So it reminded me of something that somebody, I love a lot. Michael Beckwith talks about, which is that we, with every word we create the universe with everything you say, you are the universe where the universe is in process. And sometimes if you're not careful, you can speak things into existence. And I guess you just have to watch out. You know, I get, what am I saying? Am I saying we shouldn't tell stories of Roombas colliding with dog shit or that's going to happen to us? I mean, that's some Transylvania level superstitious gypsy crap. Am I saying there's some kind of strange, my cereal network of energy that connects all of us and maybe I, I somehow like picked up on the horror that my wife must have been feeling realizing that while she had been outside, allowing our robot vacuum cleaner to clean the house, she had become victim to a kind of canine sabotage of Viet Cong level canine sabotage, which is that the being had figured out a way not just to shit on the floor, but to get that shit distributed throughout the house. Look, I don't know what I'm saying, except maybe we've got to be a little more careful with what we say into the world, what we speak into the world. Maybe the affirmation stuff is dead on, which is why I'm just saying this right now. I'm a billionaire. I have a giant cock. I have ripped abdominal muscles. My teeth are white and healthy. My bald spot last night. I grew hair again, like some blasted swath of pale land and some arid wilderness. Suddenly it sprang to life as though a magical comet had flown over it. And not only that, but you, you listening. You're about to have the best luck you've ever had in your life.

Today's episode was also made possible by Stamps.com. Friends, we are inches away from an era where 3D printers use nanobots to perfectly assemble anything that you desire. And the good people at Stamps.com have brought us one step closer to this day by creating a service that you can use to actually print US postage out at your own house. Think about that. This is a mind-blowing technology. In the old days, if you wanted to mail your manifesto to 700 university professors throughout the United States, you'd have to go buy Stamps somewhere. But not anymore. Thanks to Stamps.com, you can buy and print real US postage for any letter or any package. All available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Just click, print, mail and you're done. Stamps.com will even send you a digital scale. You can weigh your letters and packages and print the exact amount of postage every time. As someone who loves mailing out manifestos and does it on a bi-weekly basis, I can tell you that there's nothing more frustrating than to have a manifesto return to you because of improper postage. I've used Stamps.com for mailing precious DTFH posters and stickers and t-shirts. And I had a Stamps.com account and it never ceased to amaze me that I didn't have to leave my house to print out glorious, powerful Stamps. I don't know about you, but if I'm leaving my house, I want it to be because I'm going on a rock climbing expedition, going to the gym, going jogging or doing some community service work. I don't want my time to be wasted, headed someplace to buy Stamps. I want to do that online and Stamps.com has made that possible. Thanks to the people at Stamps.com. Do you know I used to spend over 19 hours a week buying Stamps? 19 hours. And now, do you know what I do at that time? I run a blood bank for children where I let children store their blood and take, withdraw blood if they need to. They have blood debit cards and it's been quite successful. And it's a great thing to teach your kids. I don't mean to smush two advertisements together here, but it's a great way to teach your kid about savings and what better thing to save than your blood. There's no way I would have had the time or the bandwidth to create a successful blood bank for children if I'd been spending 17 hours buying postage. But thanks to Stamps.com, I've changed LA for the better. Right now, use DTFH for this special offer. You'll get a four week trial, which includes postage in a digital scale. Don't wait. Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else. Click on the radio microphone at the top of the homepage and type in DTFH.Stamps.com. Enter DTFH. Think about your precious human life plopping down the sidewalk to go buy Stamps when all you gotta do is go to Stamps.com right now immediately. Don't even take another breath until you've clicked on that radio microphone at the top of the homepage and typed in DTFH. Mail the manifesto. Start the blood bank. Change the world. Thank you. Stamps.com. Friends, if you're tired of sloshing through the opening swamp of my voice and you just want to go straight to the interviews, or maybe you want more of the swampiness of my voice. Or maybe you just want to dive in deeper into the deep undergut, the under folds, the underbelly, the pulsating probisci of the DTFH. Maybe you just want to mainline the DTFH right into the heart of your spine. Well, there's one way for you to do that. And that's go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and subscribe for a few duckets a month. You'll have instant access to interviews that don't make it onto the main feed right away. Also, there's music. You want to hear the modular synth music that I have been slowly torturing my wife with over the last few months? All you got to do is go to patreon.com. You'll find some of it there along with opening rants, not attached to any interviews and just random stuff, including access to the thriving DTFH discord server. That's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. We also have a shop with stickers and posters. And of course, as always, thank you, those of you who still use the archaic Amazon link. It's somewhere over there at dunkertrustle.com. Scroll down. If you can find it, that's great. If not, thanks for looking. I love you. And thanks for clicking through Amazon to buy something you hear us talking about on this podcast. Whatever you buy through that link, they give us a small percentage of hope you'll pick up something. Do they sell vagentals on Amazon.com? Here's a free advertisement for my friend, Chop, who I met recently who runs a shop called Synthetics. I think they do sell vagentals on Amazon.com. Let me take a quick look here. I'm holding a vagental right now. It's a combination foot and vagina. I haven't tried. I haven't humped it yet. I'm not going to. I love chop, but I don't know if this vagental is a virgin vagental and I've got a kid coming and, you know, I just, I don't think it's a good idea to have sex with a vagental. I don't know who could have copulated with this foot. So I don't want to risk it. It's, it's, it's kind of good for stress. I keep it around when I'm working. It's nice to squeeze a synthetic hyper realistic foot with a vagina at the end of it from time to time when you're feeling overwhelmed. Today's guest is a brilliant artist who has created some amazing stuff, including TV carnage, which is a beautiful compilation of some of the crazy shit you see on late night infomercials. He also created hot package and most recently the genius comedy series, mostly for millennials, which is now airing on adult swim. I hope you'll check it out. Everybody please welcome to the Duncan Tressel family hour podcast, Derek Beckles. It's the Duncan Tressel family hour podcast. Derek, welcome back to the DTFH. Oh shit. You got to pull that. Oh yeah. I got it now. You can spin it around. I can do this. Look at that. There we go. Derek, welcome back to the DTFH. It's great to see you, man. It's been too long. It has been too long. Thank you. Man, I've been checking out your new show, mostly for millennials. It looks awesome. Thank you. It looks scary to make. Yeah. You and Eric, you guys do the most insanely dangerous man on the street stuff that I've ever seen times a million. And I saw that you actually got arrested doing one of these. Can you tell me about that? Yeah. For sure. Well, it was, I think it was like our last or to second last day of shooting too. But yeah, man, we love doing man on the street stuff and we love escalating them like from, you know, just kind of trying to do, do the other bits. And after a while, that just becomes its own math because you have to, there's so many things that go into it, you know, it's like, we want it to come off, you know, we want to like, exercise the 13 year old part of our brain. But we also want to do something that's hopefully, you know, just beyond like poopy fart fart. So sometimes that's just funny. But you know what I mean? You want something that's going to like possibly be, well, let, you know, be worthy of repeat viewings, but also be worthy of like doing stupid smart and smart stupidly, you know? So yeah, it's like you guys walk this crazy tightrope in between what you're saying, which is just like, you know, really basic like fart jokes or whatever, which is absolutely fine. And then on the other side of it is some kind of like Russian deep Russian existentialist theater or something. And there's a and that's a crazy place for those two things to meet. Yeah, it's I mean, I'm glad you think so. I really am because it's it's like the when I almost got arrested as I was doing this bit called basically, it was just save the planet. So I'm walking around and I have this giant like planet suit that our amazing wardrobe person Ryan made. And so I'm planet Earth and I'm walking around and I'm like handing out pamphlets, but I'm also throwing pamphlets in the air and I'm littering, you know, it's just like the antithesis of a guy who wants to save the planet. So and then that Flat Earth comes out. Andre Highlands dresses Flat Earth and he comes out. He comes out of nowhere and just attacks when we start fighting. And so we got great reactions from the crowd. There's people reacting to like me littering, obviously, there's like and then when we started fighting and it got really physical, people were like on the hook and screaming things at us and like trying to stop us from fighting. And then I started pouring. I grabbed this like red canister that like you have gasoline in it and I started pouring that down. Yeah, Andre's throat. It was supposed to be motor oil, but we ended up we just had to use this gas canister. And that was a bridge too far. Like people were like, oh, my God, this guy is throwing is like pouring gasoline down the throat. And I was doing it as like a save the earth guy. And in the original bit, too, I was supposed to have a daughter that was actually handing out stuff and I was like teaching her all the wrong lessons. But anyway, so I'm attacking Andre and and then I just hear like whoop whoop. It's a very distinct noise and I just feel my arms being wrenched behind my back. And I look up and it's just a cop with like a what the fuck are you doing? I'm not in the mood face. No, they actually said, yeah, you guys didn't have to do this. Yeah, it's kind of resigned. Yeah, he's like, you know, you guys didn't have to do this. Right. Like the street is littered. There is like it's insanity. People are like you're horrified or they're angry or they're scared. But you know what I really like, man? Well, you know, I'll tell you one thing quickly. Sorry. But the cop said to me like he goes. And it I, you know, it's one of those things that occurs afterwards, but he's like, he goes, you know, when I roll, when we roll up on somebody and he's pouring gas down somebody's throat, you're just lucky you didn't get shot. It's like, oh, yeah, there's that part of the equation. And Eric runs into that, too, where like people get very physical and can get very strange. Like we I'll tell you about a mall thing we did, too. That tell me tell me now. I'd love to hear it. I there's an upcoming episode where I I'm a I come out hot. Like I'm a choreography for an elderly flash mob. So I I got all these. I got I got this elderly flash mob. We choreographed a simple little dance for them, but embedded with them is like this, like this older dude who's like this, like tough as, like tough as nails, like cartoon character of an old school Irish dude who was like a stuntman with like a broken nose. And he's embedded in he's embedded in the in the flash mob. And I just come out hot and I'm screaming at them because they don't have their shit together. I'm just like it's it's it's like it's like it's like Roy Scheider and in what you call it. Oh, I know exactly what you're talking about. The fucking like what's like all that jazz, all that jazz. It's like it's like I was like a combination between like a Roy Scheider and all that jazz and the dude from Wow. And the dude from showgirls when he's just like berating people. So I'm just screaming at the at these elderly people for not having their shit together. And I'm just like, how long have we been practicing? This is a trash mob, not a flash mob. And the old dude's like, you can't say that to us. And I was like, really, you're out of it. You're out of the group now. And we just start shoving each other and it's bedlam. We just like started throwing each other a few glass. What the fuck. And there's actually like passerby. Oh, it's like in the middle of all while people are shopping. So it is like battle. There's just like three levels of the mall. People just screaming and like taking pictures. The interesting thing is like people default now just to like just just to like recording things and like documenting them. If they're even do document. I don't even know if they're thinking about they're just doing it because it's like it's this new reflex we have. So people just tend not to get involved. People were getting involved, but like the majority of people were just like filming. That was their version of getting involved. Like, I've got to stop this. Record. Isn't that wild? Because I think when you what that what you're seeing there is like a combination defense mechanism, combination. And I don't like using the term. I don't think it's maybe accurate, but it gets thrown around a lot. Late stage capitalism, which is that when violence starts happening instead of wanting to stop it, you want to figure out a way to commodify it. Right. Just to record it and put it on your Instagram. Yeah, it's just like, oh, shit, violence. That's worth a lot of likes. Let me grab it. Exactly. Yeah. And it's pretty eerie, I bet, to witness that reaction instead of what should just be someone should be like, hey, we're going to break this up. Yeah. And there's like a guy who's like, I was going to start kicking your ass. But right. And that's this, which is what I was expecting. I was like, OK, so let's start kicking my ass. What does the war room look like when you're planning this stuff out? When you guys are writing the show, how do you what's the process from like the inception of the idea to like getting permission from the network and insurance? How do you pull that out? Yeah, that's like, oh, Lord. I mean, we we basically just like have no we, you know, it's the we agree on the fact that like there's just like the there's no stupid ideas and anything that you do think is a stupid idea. Great. Say it even louder. Cool. You know, just like, yeah. And we even like kind of part of the process for the stuff we will work on is just to to actually embrace like the stupidest stuff. Like we we like, you know, we we actually favor trying to get people's minds to go into like the stupidest direction possible and and try and make it. Try and make it. I had to adjust the mic. I was like at the microphone dentist for a second. Oh, but yeah, anyways, it's it's, you know, we celebrate stupidity. And again, like I was saying, it's like we also try to put as much smart or make as much of a statement as possible about certain things. But yeah, the process is just like we know sometimes we're just going to get in shit. It's just kind of like it's like that it's it's that moment where like two kids come up with an idea when their parents are away. And they're like, oh, my God, we have to do this. We're not getting so much shit when mom and dad come home, but we have to do this. So it's just like, doesn't the network interfere? Aren't they? I mean, aren't there lawyers and insurance companies? Oh, yeah, absolutely. I mean, yeah. And then it's like and we always have to like negotiate. It's like it's like a bizarre chess game sometimes. And other times you can argue your point. And and then sometimes it's just like it's a hard no. And that that becomes part of like the corporate structure of networks where it's just like we can't do that because Nabisco is going to get really pissed off because, you know, we they have a product and you can't do that because the product is on our it's just turns into a labyrinth or a labyrinth. So sometimes it's just like advertising gets involved. And I'm just like, you can't do that. Yeah, that's where you're going to fuck yourself. You're going to get you're going to get sued. You're going to get hurt. Yeah, you're going to and like that's what's so bad. And that's that's the other thing. Sorry. Yeah. No, please go. I was going to say, it's just like we like we know we're putting ourselves on the line, but we don't we don't want other people to get fucked up. You know what I mean? We don't want to like have somebody like react in a way that's going to do themselves harm. So we kind of negotiate that in our minds as well. Like while we're making up these these pranks and sometimes they're just completely stupid. But we're putting ourselves. We always put ourselves on the line more than than anybody that could be involved. And we consider like the possibilities of how people can react. And like, you know, it's always you never know, but you try to like be as responsible as possible while you're being as responsible as you can try to. Gotcha. Yeah. And then there's also that like there's sort of like when you're running pranks like that, there's this I wrote on a prank show. And there's always this like weird, like ethical consideration, not based on violence, but also just based on like, you know, like, you know, like punked, for example. Some of those fucking pranks were just really just ridiculous. Like, like I threw a brick through your window and you got mad. Yes. You know, it's like, well, no shit. Like what's what's there to what's punked here? You like broke through somebody or I don't know if that actually happened. You know what I mean? It's real. Oh, yeah. But they've done they did variations on that theme of just like destroying somebody's car and the person comes on and goes, I'm mad. I'm mad. And now I got you. You got mad. But you guys are doing this like what I love about is you sort of woven into the prank, this commentary on the modern times on the world. Yeah, exactly. It's just like it is all about just people like record things instead of getting involved. And then the end of that mall bit, by the way, there's like a there's like another layer to ending to it. So it doesn't just end with me fighting this old guy. Like it's it plays itself out into this. Like I start crawling away and it's really it's really quiet in the mall because I'm just crawling away. And then I rip my shirt open and then the elderly people run in and they I guess it doesn't matter. I was a spoiler, right? Spoiler guys, let's wait 20 30 seconds, guys. We're going to not 30 seconds. Turn it off or skip forward or do something spoil. And I rip my shirt open. I've just got like a I've just got like a layer of nipples. Like they just they run over and they start suckling from my nipples. So it's just like turning and turning and people or their heads explode. Jesus Christ, that's so fucking good, man. That kind of like what would you call that? Like if you weren't filming it, would you call that culture jamming? Have you ever heard that? Yeah, yeah. I remember people used to use that term. Yeah, yeah, like just like I it's and there's a lot like layered into why we do that stuff and the whole suckling thing and just, you know, I could it's it's I just I feel like you don't need a reason, but there is. But it's just like it's just like the idea of just something. But yeah, it is to me. It's like and I think to Eric and other writers on the show, for sure. It's a combination of making these like, you know, the maybe maybe they're just like they're maybe they they feel like terribly academic sometimes or they're like they they they're more esoteric. But they're like these kind of weird little statement pieces, but they're also just like art, you know, it's like a street art. Yeah, yeah. But that's the idea, and it's like it seems like I always feel bad with a podcast with any anything I'm putting out there. And I do it. I mean, I do it and it's embarrassing. But when I throw something out there that isn't funny, you know what I mean? When I get pissed at something or or or even worse, like, I feel like I'm going to talk about me in attention, you know what I mean? And I'm listening myself doing something. And it's just it's not there's nothing in it. It's like even remotely what you would call artistic and certainly not funny. It just but it's like scratching some weird itch inside of me to be like, let me take you out again. But I mean, like if you're like if you're actually if you're like it's the sincerity of it and like turning people onto something and a trust people have in you, right? And there's and and there's a reason people are drawn to you. So you make good work of that. Well, sometimes, but sometimes there's fail. The failure to meet what I'm saying is what you're like. So like you come up with a thing you want to say, like let's say you want to say. People really do seem to be ignoring the violence of the world by imagining they have control over it from filming it or some some something like that. Right. And sure, you could say that you could you could tweet that and people are going to be like, yeah, I guess so. Or right, you make that the core of a hilarious, bizarre piece of art and let them look at it and realize that themselves now you've actually accomplished something wonderful because like it's you're demonstrating. And and you're like you're giving them something that they by and large aren't going to experience again the following week or possibly ever again. And they also part of that part of that labyrinth and all the trouble we went through to make that that that hidden camera bit was we knew that people were going to be pissed off once the like their their heads were going to kind of explode once the suckling started. They weren't going to know what to make of it. But I saw it demonstrated out loud and like people were like, oh, shit, it wasn't a real you know what I mean? Like, oh, he wasn't really about to murder this old guy. I'm going to have to like I've been feeling like 90 percent of the people just like erased the footage on their phone. I didn't get a murder. There would be a comment for sure. He's like, that wasn't real. I can't believe I just had to watch a fake murder murder. Oh, my God. Yeah. And that is like really, really the thing, isn't it? That's the thing, man. It's like, God damn it. What's that amazing? Amazing. They redid it. There's an amazingly violent movie. Fuck. Oh, I just watched it with my wife. It's so fucked up. Anthony Jeselnick named accidentally or intentionally named his tour after. It's called. You know, I'm talking about the two dudes end up just going into into like a house and they end up like basically it's like just like they end. It's a home invasion movie. Oh, you know, I'm talking about it's so good. It was like a pretty things. No, no. God damn it. No, not pretty. It's not pretty things. It's it's like that. Yes, it's why would I think of it either? So it's like two guys and they just go in and they have golf clubs. And that's it. And it was based on a Scandinavian film. That's it. I'll just like write down the time and stick it up and like do like an interjection. Guys, sit back while we try to remember this. Yeah, that's fun. That's fun. That's fun to listen to. Make yourself some cocoa. We're going to try to remember the name of this thing. If only we had something that like had all human information that we could have. Funny games. Funny games. Wow. Yeah, funny games. And so you're watching this movie and you're in the brilliance of the movie is at first you're watching the movie and you start getting mad at the dudes with the golf clubs who are torturing this family, right? And then one of them looks at the camera, right? And starts talking to you and you realize, wait a minute. I'm the one watching this shit. Yeah. I'm the voyeur. I'm the one who's getting off on the fucking violence and the brilliance of that is because sure you could really just say to people, hey guys, here's something. Yeah. You like it. Like as George Carlin said, I like it when terrible things happen. You like it. Yeah. You pretend you don't like it and you get really pious about it. But the reality is forensic files. How many fucking seasons of forensic files are there? Exactly. How many seasons? By the way, great mustaches on that show. I've addicted every single person on that show, whether they're the perp or the cop. They have fucking great mustaches there. Dude, I. It's like the mustache hall of fame. I have actually had the thought. You know, like how thoughts will flicker across your mind before you can stop them? Just like a bird flying out of some subterranean cavern in your heart. And you're like, oh my God, that lives in me. That's beautiful. This I had this fucking thought fly across watching forensic files after I'd seen every episode. I was like, man, they need to make more episodes, which means more people need to get violently right. Exactly for my pleasure. So like, yeah. So I can like make cheese doodles and or like eat cheese doodles and watch. It's hotel room. It's hotel room fair. That's what it is when you're on vacation. I noticed that about watching like, I mean, like like classic law like the classic like law and order, you know, the classic like sweet spot and law and order like kind of like the middle of of them making that series for like 500 years. But like between year 300 and year 700, they had like, it's great. It's like law and order SUV, SVU is like, it's terrible. It's like terrifying. It's just like, it's like an excuse to like hear the word sperm come out of a child's mouth. Like it's just like, it's just horrible. I'm like a prime time. And I mean, it's acting and plot aside. It's I mean, at the core, that's kind of what people are just gravitated. It's like this this gruesome nature of the show. And I was watching it one day and I was like, it's the same thing. You talk about forensic files. I'm watching them. And then in my mind, I'm like, I turn into the worst piece of shit in the world. I'm just like, I wouldn't have put the kid's body there. And I'm like, I'm like, oh, cool. I've murdered a child and I'm fucking scolding this dude for where he hid the body. He's like, I want to take the bow. I would have like put it chopped into five. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Yes. What an idiot. All right. I can't believe he did that. Are you kidding? Like that seems like the most obvious mistake. I want to tell that kid's body way better. I mean, it's a child's body. Like you could invest in an ice chest that will easily fit a child's body You know, it's land there is that people wouldn't even look at. And it's like, oh my God. But I mean, that's why people like, we're getting so dark. But it's just like, I mean, that's the reason why people are just like watching any sort of like, that's the reason why car chasers are on the news for like an hour and a half. That's the reason why they're just like people just love waiting to find out where they're going to find the body. Well, yeah. And it's like those kids that were in the cave, right? Like I'm just like, how many people are just like wanting to see how this turns into the darkest thing in the world? When they just all suffocate? Like, yeah, exactly. It's like, oh, I hope they have cameras jailed there for that part. Or fuck, man. I mean, obviously, like someone is definitely going to all you that is the like that thing right there. That could so easily turn into the coolest fucking horror movie ever. Just like the fucking kids like writers. They're getting rescued. There's some shit in the cave. Yeah, starts fucking with them. But they got out. Thank God. But the well, we can still hope that they have something inside of them from the cave. That's going to come out in the hospital. Holy fuck, that's what it is. It starts off as a movie about a cave rescue and turns into these little tie kids with their eyeballs exploding and scorpion things crawling out. Yeah, they're like patient zeros. They're like the Trojan horses. Are you listening, Hollywood? Guys, make this fucking movie. Make us make this movie. Yeah, yeah, that's it. We'll make money off of things. Ah, you're on Duncan Trussell's pitch. You ready? But man, this is where it gets to me where it gets really, really interesting is that like as a person is being violently murdered, there is some percentage chance that if the murder is interesting enough or just lands on the radar of forensic file, then that murder is going to be turned into money. That's the thing is that murders are being harvested for cash. Like that's the. Well, and you notice how like how now people are just prepped to be on the show to talk about like the murders, too. Like I have a feeling you'd probably have to like really take have an like there'd be some form of effort whenever ago to like have somebody sit down and calmly talk about how their friend got murdered and all of like the red flags and with their hair done and. Right, makeup, makeup, hair and makeup, hair and makeup. Okay, Cynthia, do you want some powder before you talk about your daughter being brutally chopped to pieces? Can you just go? All right, we're just going to go that through one more time. We just need you to say, I'm a little less. Yeah. So let's just talk about your daughter being murdered and action and a producer. Oh, okay. A producer is watching and when they start crying, the producer's like, yes, yes, they're crying. And then I was watching one where somebody who was like John Keyhon as or somebody and the they were just like egging each other at odd. It's like, so that must have been weird. It's like, oh my God, totally weird. It's like, you must have been like, what's going on? It's like, I was totally like, what's going on? Yeah. I've been like talking about their best friend being murdered. I'm like, oh, Lordy, it's absurdity. It really is taking quite a turn. It's fucking crazy, but you this it seems like your show mostly for millennials. It seems like it's like it's a comedy. It's it's a comedy, but it does seem to be like as I was researching this, it does seem like you're you're making a commentary on sort of the exploitation by corporations of a specific demographic. It's like seeing it through the prism of like of like corporate. It's like it's generational. It's like people always want to know what the kids are doing. You know, like every generation has that. And it's like from the people who are like out of touch. And but then they will want to make money off of it. They have to market to it. They have to do whatever they keep the machine running. They have to keep. So it's like, yeah, it's like this clueless, pandering attempt attempt to be cool. All combined with just like this like ethically and morally unhinged host who's like a narcissist and a crowd that's like bloodthirsty. Like the crowd, the audience is the audience, you know, it's just like this bloodthirsty audience is like when I come out and go like, should I chop my head off? You know, they're like, yeah, do it. And they have their phones out, you know, everybody wants it. Where'd you come up with that idea to make the audience bloodthirsty like that? Where did that pop into your head? I just thought it would be I thought it would be it's a great way to have the audience be active. And kind of just like it because it's the whole the premise of or, you know, one of the one of the central kind of points of the show is like how primal everything is. Right. And like, so they're the audience is like just is just like this this crowd of id, you know, like, right. And they, you know, it's like it's like a bloodthirsty kind of Mori Povich audience kind of. So it's just like they on cue. They're like, oh, you know, and then when something is about to go down, they're like, yeah, blood, blood, blood. And then when they, you know, they worship me in a weird way, but they also get they worship me, but they also they deify me, but they also get confused by me. Right. Right. So that aspect of it to me is just like the cultishness of things. So it's like we've created our own little hermit kingdom. Yeah. Right. Like, it's like, it's just like, it's anytime you watch anything about a cult, you know that there's definitely those days where probably a larger percentage than not is scratching their head going, what was, what was she talking about today? Well, she was, don't worry. There's a reason for what happened today. You know, and I feel like that's also a response and like a mirror to what's going on in the world or politics. I just think people are like, don't worry. There's a reason he's doing that. And it's just like, yeah, he's not actually. Yeah. Isn't that crazy? It's the illusion of a lot of fun. It's so fun, man, but it's terrifying. It's terrifying because what we've done, what we managed to do here is create this kind of illusion that there are certain infallible people on planet Earth. Yeah, we need to. Do you think we need to? I think we need to feel that way. I think it's like ego. I think it's just like, I need to feel that way because that I've decided that person is here to represent me. Therefore, when they do something, it's me doing it. And I would do the best things in the world or whatever. You know, it's just like, I would, because I've decided to put, you know, my like to basically endorse this behavior or this person, what they do is reflective of my decision. Therefore, I cannot allow there to be any cracks in the mirror. It's just like, right. This is all fun. It's going to be fun. And I think it's a very ego driven. I think, I think it's and I think that everything that we're doing now and the way the exact what we're talking about, like just people like documenting themselves and being their own brands and all the hellish things that we even have to do. It's just like, I think when when that takes over, that's that's what happens. It's just because everybody becomes like monolithically narcissistic. That's a beautiful way to put it. And it's so sad when it happens. If you like, I just rewatched Grizzly Man. Have you seen that in a while? Grizzly Man with yeah. And, you know, this is this dude who's like on one level seems to be really, really sweet attuned to nature. Foxes follow him around. He's obviously got some like serious fucking issues he's working through. But his like main like M.O. is I'm here to protect these bears. Yeah. But if he'd never gone out there, then he ended up like two bears. Ended up getting killed because of him. Like bears ended up getting killed because of him. And like in his intended effect, it had the opposite effect because the reality is you're watching it is like he really believes this shit. It's not like he's evil, but the reality of it is by going into this place and turning himself into a hero, he has actually become the thing that he was apparently fighting against the classic problem. But on top of that, he there's, you know, that wonderful part where Werner Herzog listens to the footage of him being eaten by a bear because he left the lens cap on. But the no one mentions once in the scene that as a bear was coming into his in his tent to attack him and his girlfriend, he took a moment to turn his fucking camera on. Right. You know, like you're you're about to get eaten. Yeah. And you're like, wait, oh shit, I got to get this on tape. And then he's in so he's like recording himself being devoured by a wild animal, like maybe in that millisecond of trying to decide what to do. The order of priority should be get away from the bear. Right. First. Oh yeah, absolutely. But his order of priorities was film being eaten by the fucking bear. And so yeah. So what you're talking about is just this very thing, which is that it's like, man, we all want to be fucking heroes, of course. And it's a beautiful design. It's good to save people and to save the world. Yeah. But it seems like the order of priorities is that before we become the heroes, let's get the fucking cameras rolling and then do the heroic act. Yeah. And then it's also like, let's make sure. Yeah, let's make sure that when we're doing the heroic act, it catches my good side. It still comes back to ourselves. Oh, that's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Dude, dude, that's right. It's central to it. Dude, fuck, my bald spot really showed up when I was saving that kid. Is there any guys, is there any way? Is there another angle of me saving that kid? There's got to be a better angle than that, man. Shit, I'm getting fucking bad, man. Can we just concentrate on the me not, nobody's seeing my bald spot? Yeah, like the kid becomes secondary after a while. Isn't that wild, dude? Isn't that what I just went to? I know, man. It's really, I mean, listen, every one of us is guilty of this in some way or another. Yeah, I think this is, I think this is like, I think this is just a brand new mirror that's come off of the assembly line that's showing us in like, it's just a different reflective nature. I think this stuff is always in us. I just think this is like a new mirror off the assembly line that has a different reflective quality. And we're like, oh, shit, from this angle, we're also pretty terrible. Right. And I think that that's sort of like come up and in general, we all need to like be, I think it starts with like, if we're being hard on like people in the media or we're being hard on whoever it is for being infallible or not being infallible, then guaranteed that's gotta be a reflection of us being hard on ourselves, right? Yeah. The idea is like, we're fallible, human, greedy, egocentric, self-interested, because we are fucking descended from monkeys. Yeah. Well, and yeah, I think it's, I think it's just like people, it's just like people will find, sometimes people will just find their, their reason to be angry at other people. And that's manifested because their dad was just a drunk who screamed at them all the time. That's right. And it's just like, and it's just like, really? Do your fucking daddy issues have to like affect people's lives in such a terrible way? Yeah. You know what I mean? Like you're angry at your dad by vilifying this group of people or whatever. Yeah. And there's so many ding-dongs out there like that. And it's just like, why are you doing this? Oh, because there's like a, there's this dark little hole inside of you that cannot be filled. Well, that's where, and the problem is we're- And that's me. And that person is me. It's me too. Wait, no, it's fucking me, motherfucker. It's just me, not you. You're mine. I'm a fucker. And this is the, and this is what it, this is exactly it, man. And the problem with what you just said for me, and I think for a lot of people, is that the moment you summon the asshole that you ate most into your month and zoom backwards in time, and inevitably you're going to find some sweet kid who's getting the shit kicked out of them by something. Yeah. You know? And it's- Yeah. A lot of the time. A lot of the time. Maybe not all the time. Yeah. But a lot of the time. And the moment you get, you realize that, now it's like, motherfucker, I can't hate you at the level I'd like to because I've humanized you. Yeah, it's like, it's, I don't know if it's absolutely analogous to this, but it's like, when, I guess it's, what I'm trying to say is it's just that, it is just that simple sometimes. Like, I remember, you know, you talked to, you talked to like a cop who's like a detective or something, and it's just like, well, so you guys like, like, you know, you think of things in terms, TV becomes our documentary series, right? Like, that's the way we start approaching life. Like, these TVs are like, like SVU is a documentary. So it's like, I guess you get some like, somebody calls in with a tip or something, or like, you notice that the guy's got some blood on his shirt, and you just kind of track him down and follow him around. And the cops are just like, no, dude, usually what it is, is somebody got murdered, you ask their girlfriend or their boyfriend or whoever, hey, was somebody mad at them? Yeah, this guy had his job, said he hated them. Go to the, go to the job, the guy's there, did you kill him? Yes. Case closed. He said, it's usually that. Like, it's not mysterious. It's not mysterious. Human nature is not some kind of mystical kaleidoscope. And that's, that, that, that's exactly what, I think that's what we need to think about ourselves is that we are, we are that capable of engineering this like dynamic outcome to things where in fact it's just like our, like the way we achieve things sometimes is just like, we're just like, we're sniffing our fingers after scratching our groin, you know? Yeah. Yeah. That's the process involved. This is like, it's like, so we, but we need to feel like through leaders or whoever the hell that we're like, we're like, we're, yeah, this is, that's right. That's, this is, this is how good I am too, or whatever the hell this is like. Yeah. It's like kind of like, well, we're looking for a tuning fork. We're all looking for a fucking tuning fork, man. That's what we want really bad and we need one. And if we had a great tuning fork, which is what a really great leader could be. I mean, on the grand scheme of scale, it seems a little insane or a lot insane to imagine that one fucking dude can tune an entire country of millions of people. That's fucking stupid. Yeah. It's, it's kind of amazing that we, I mean, it's, I guess it keeps us from inevitably sinking into that place that we all know that we can easily achieve, which is just like absolute chaos. Absolutely. Like left to our own volition, just a mess. Right. So it's just like, we need this like central, the central character to like to be our mouthpiece or whatever the hell the person's supposed to be. But it's just like, yeah, the descent into math, it is so insane. But then you look at the alternative and I just think it would just be like an absolute descent into madness. Talk about, we're doing that, I think. Let's talk about that. I want you to explain that to me because that is so like the, one of the, I think. Yeah. If I wanted to control a huge group of people. Yeah. One of the first things I'd want to get into their heads is that if they were not controlled, they would descend into madness. All right. Yeah. That's like a really useful thing to tell people is like, hey, without me, you guys are going to go absolutely fucking nuts. You're going to start stabbing each other. Trust me. Trust me. You need the dude with the suit and the nuclear arsenal or this fucking humanity thing. Oh man, you're just going to go nuts. Yeah. We need this. Yeah. I'm like the best brand of glue that you could possibly hold it all together. Baby. And like you. So it's just like, I think it's just like we were like, you watch movies about, pardon me, like a, like, I love movies about the president of the United States when they're like always making decisions. Like the president is like, no, we're not going to do that. We're going to do this. And it's like, Mr. President, the president said we're going to do that. And they make these like insane decisions or like that are for the betterment of the you know, they're the hero figure, but they'll just like make these amazing decisions immediately. And I think that's what people still think that like presidents and world leaders are like, like they're in an office and they're like, no, we're not doing it that way anymore. We're doing it this way because it's the right thing to do. Right. And then some nobody objects to it. Everybody goes like, supreme leader, like it's very supreme leader. Very. Yeah, very. And very definitely not how it happens. We have no idea what fucking goes on up there. But you know, I think it's like a really important thing to think about and which is is it the human tendency to descend into madness if they're not being lied to by a charismatic leader? Because if that's the case, I think it's a pretty dire prognosis for our species, you know, and a lot of people anarchists in particular say, you know, actually that is a intentional bit of conditioning that has been going on for a very long time. And usually they'll cite things such as disasters, like whenever a disaster happens and like there aren't no like cops and there are no presidents and there temporarily isn't a government. There's just rubble everywhere. Yeah. You'll notice that it doesn't descend into madness, rather it actually seems to ascend into some kind of like very temporary form of socialism, which is that people come out of their houses and start digging people out of rubble or bring people into their houses or give people water or go out in boats and take people out of their houses. And then you realize like, wait, hold on a fucking second here. Maybe that's our tendency. It's just that tendency is being subverted by putting one dude in place in a place where it should be like, I don't know, smaller groups of like tribes or communities. I think, I think like, yeah, I mean, I think that's like, I mean, that's a hopeful way of looking at it. I think that maybe it's naive. I don't know. No, that's the thing. I don't know either. I just like, and it is, I don't think there's anything to be, I don't think there's any reason to fear that possibility. I just wonder if it's like where, I wonder if it's, that's where we're at. It's like, we just need like, we need something to hammer us over the head so hard. Like a disaster that just does not have any favorites. So we realize that we're all at the mercy of this event and it takes something that powerful and that like, unconditionally, essentially like, it just doesn't give a fuck who you are. It's just going to like, it's going to affect you in a negative way. It takes, it takes that amount of, sorry, let me start again. It takes something that like, intense to make us feel empathetic, because now the, now the shoe is collectively on all of our other feet. Like now we're all those people, right? Like we're all of those people. We're all, you know, pretty much fucked all at once. Right. So we, we don't have time to like have to, to like play some sort of bullshit order of like who is superior and who is like more deserving of something or whatever, whatever it is that we like to do when we have our spare time. By the way, we go to grocery stores and we eat and we sit in chairs all day. So now we've just become like this, everybody's like in their own version of Rome. Everybody's just sitting with their, in their togas going like, those people, I assume it. Those people shouldn't come to the country. Like we're all our own little murals. So I sometimes, yeah, it's like, it takes like an earthquake or a natural disaster, a fucking like tornado to rip an entire community to pieces. So that people are just like actually just brought down to the same level. And then there's just like, I have no choice but to like actually look at this person who I was judging last week and help them. Well, the exactly, I mean, this is one of the, this is, this is a super long wind. Beautifully said though, man, it's just like the thing is, it's like clearly, clearly we're out of tune. And it's like certainly one of the like great tuning forks is catastrophe. If there ever was like a wonderful tuning fork to what a human being is, it's a fucking disaster. And then you'll see like, man, people fucking die for people they don't know. They jump into lakes and pull kids out for no, and they don't even think about it. They just instinctually, naturally fucking do it. And like it sucks, man. That's a shitty fucking tuning fork. There's all kinds of tuning fork. It's called hit and bottom, right? Hit and bottom. That's what alcoholics and drug addicts, they have to like get to the point where they're like, they've got, they're like getting fucking fisted by some dude under a bridge while like sucking a horse's dick just to get like 75 cents to buy like a little fucking crystal fucking light. That just turned into a postcard. That's my hitting bottom story. Literally. That's when I knew I had to stop playing World of Warcraft. The worst postcard in the world. Come visit hitting bottom, Tennessee. But you, you know, man, when that, so like for a lot, like most like to bring it, the problem is like, also we all, I tend to project onto the entire planet or under the huge swaths of populations. I've never fucking met a personality and a motivation and an intention and then the whole time I'm just sort of like ignoring myself. But I know that in general, when I slam into the wall of my own identity, not just like in my own mind, but when like something happens where I'm like, whoa, wow, I fucked up. That was a big mistake. I shouldn't have done that. Holy shit. I heard somebody's, you know, I fucked up. Then that's when like they're, I evolve. Like once I snuck out of a, I was working at a summer camp as a camp counselor and I snuck out because my friends were having like a keg party up in the mountains. And I took a, like I went with like two counselors in training. I'm in my fucking like car driving down the fucking. It's raining. I'm in North Carolina driving around these crazy roads. I guess my idea was I'll just go get fucking hammered at this kegger. I think it was like an hour and a half away from the camp, drive back to camp by the morning and then like take care of kids. Right. It's just, you know, like I can't think of anything more fucking irresponsible and horrible and stupid. I'm like, I'm driving down this fucking road and like right in front of me, man, like, cause it was foggy and it's like within it, like the fog clears just enough time for me to see one of those big yellow sharp turn signs, which I'm slamming into. I hit it. The car fucking flips, breaking glass. The cars, I'm upside down in the car. The radio is playing. I think it's cream in the white room with black curtains by the stage. Right. In the back seat of the car are two, I think one of them 17, one of them is maybe 18. I don't know their age, but in the moment, in that moment, I'm looking forward. There's a moment where I don't know when I turn around what the fuck I'm going to see. Yeah. And those kids could have broken their necks. They could have gotten, you know, a million things because of my selfishness could have happened to those fucking kids. But I turned around. The kids were fucking okay. Thank God. And where it was real high-fiving. Let's do it again. We will just, it's just more of like in that quiet, in that silence after glass breaks and the radio is playing and the car is upside down, you're living in truth, man. And that's a great fucking tuning fork. It's a great tuning fork. And it's such a great way to put it. Like that tuning fork, that note that you hit at that moment, you have to remember it as long as you can. Like you have to like use that moment as terrifying as it was instead of, I mean, of course, you don't want to wake everyone and go like, oh, yeah, I did that. But that feeling, that moment, that realization of how just like absolutely corruptible we can be in our decisions. And knowing that, you know, like I think that's like, that's what comedy is to like, you have to know that you're a scumbag. You have to know that you're not perfect. You have to know that you don't have all the answers. You have to know that like you would be a shitty cult leader. You have to know these things about yourself and like be able to go like, no, I get it. I suck too. Like I suck. I do. Like I suck too, but I, because I know that I try not to suck. Just get it out there is the main thing. Yeah, like that's the, I think that moment that you're describing is just like, so important to like harness, you know, we'll see in that moment. A cult leader would have turned around and looked at the living people in the backseat and said, see, God saved us. We surely should have died. See what I just showed you. Yeah. I showed you the truth. Do you see what I've taught you? Yeah. That's like, and that, that, that is the problem is because our fucking leaders, You didn't commodify it. They're, they're slamming their fucking, they're driving. We're in the backseat of a fucking bus being driven by very fallible, very fallible greedy people and they're crashing the bus. And when they crash the bus instead of turning around and being like, guys, I'm not that great at driving this fucking bus. They're saying, I'm the best bus driver that ever fucking lived. Yeah. And people are hearing that. I mean, like, I guess they're good at driving the fucking bus. They've got a plan. This is the problem. It's like, we, and, and yeah, and they'll, yes. And they'll, and they'll, if, and another, another version of that will be them going to like, if, if you have the nerve to like go like, what the fuck did, what just happened? I can't believe this. It's just, you know, their version of the, their version of reality be like, well, nobody but a gun to your head, motherfucker, you got into the car with me. Yeah. This is why you decided to go to the party. You should have known. I was going to wreck. You should have known somehow. Look at me. Do I look like I can fucking drive? Do I look like a safe person to you? This is your fault, dumbass. Yeah. And where it gets really depressingly sad is that the mentality of a victim. I've just been listening to this fucking great book called hallelujah anyway by Annie Lamont. God damn, it's good. And it is this, this like concise. Breakdown of what it's like to grow up in a dysfunctional toxic family for a kid. And what it's like is you've got a fucking alcoholic parent or whatever. You got a crazy parent, right? And it's easier for a kid with a crazy parent to believe they're the ones causing the problems because then they can imagine that they're still in control than it is to like recognize that the fucking crazy parent is crazy because they're the ones who've been, they're the ones who taught you how to talk, you know, they're the ones that taught you like what you told you the name of the whole thing in the sky is the sun. And if you suddenly realize like, wait a minute, there's a big distortion in that person's reality field. Then that's very unnerving because it's like, wait, if their reality is distorted to the level where they think it makes sense to go withdraw like, you know, $10,000 from the bank account and spend it in Vegas and then come back drunk and punch the fuck out of my aunt in front of my brother or whatever it may be, then what else if they put in me that's distorted that my reality must be distorted, right? So we're having this like experience where a victim would much rather think they're like a person would rather think they're to blame than to realize like, wait a minute, wait a minute, it isn't my fault. It's the abuser, the fucking oppressor, the whatever, and they know that. People know that shit. That's where it gets really scary because for the goddamn oppressor or whoever who's doing the fucking vile, shitty thing, it's, I mean, look, I don't know. Let me ask you, I'm sorry if it's like two personal question, but have you ever gotten drunk and done something stupid that you regretted the next day? Yeah, I mean, it's the same thing as like doing something stupid where you're just like uh, you get behind the wheel of a car or you. But personally, have you ever like gotten hammered and then like done some stupid thing where like the next day you wake up, are you a drinker? Yeah, I used to like drink more than I should have, for sure. And I've, and I've just been like, no, that's not a great road to go down. It's an easy road to go down because it's, it's fun and it's, and it's everybody around you enables it because they're doing it too. But uh, yeah, I mean, like countless times I've woken up going like, what the fuck? Yeah, you know, like, uh, I remember once I like, I mean, this is, I did this to myself, but like I walked out of, I was, I was hammered and I was at a barn party and I walked, I was climbing up this, like through this barn with a friend and, um, we got into a fight with some dude because we're hammered, like onto a fist fight. And then I was like walking out of the barn, um, like to go outside, like I saw pissed off and like, and I was on the second like the second level of the barn thinking I was on the ground level. And I walked out and I, I fell like an entire story onto a pile of hay, which is like just, and then I got up and I staggered away from it. And the next day, the guy whose farm it was was just like, uh, the only reason that hay is there is because my tractor broke down. Like the guy, the kid's dad is like, so we've, the tractor broke down that day. And like I had to, I had to like take the bales off so I could get the and unhitch the thing and then take the tractor away. And I was just like, cool. I got into like a stupid fist fight with some dude, like just like was punching some guy and then walked out all pissed off and, uh, what, like just like basically like killed myself. You know, so it's a combination of like, did something stupid and then did something even stupid to myself. Right. And it happened because you were fucking hammered. Yeah. Right. And you were just being a dummy. You're right. You, you got drunk and you were being a dummy and that's why it happened. And for some reason, some people when that the exact thing happens to them, they think to themselves, that motherfucker in the fucking that I got in a fight with, it's his fucking fault. That son of a bitch because it's, it's so much easier for like a chronic alcoholic to imagine that there's a reason that they're acting crazy. But it's way, it's really a lot more. Like if you had to choose between being like full blown insane or doing shit for a reason, you're going to pick doing shit for a reason. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So these fucking shitty parents, man, what's happening is when they fucking smack their kids around when they're super fucking hammered and the kids like, I'm spilling the milk and build the milk. They're like, yeah, you shouldn't have spilled the fucking milk because you made daddy smack you. Yeah. And because it's, it's harder for them to be like, wait, man, I'm hitting kids. I'm a fuck. I'm fucked. It's the whole like that. Look what you made me do to you. Yeah. It's that whole kind of like psychology of this like suit you made me do now. Yeah, dude. Like that movie chopper that Australian movie about the guy, the, the biker from Australia that's just like a national hero. But in the movie, there's like a brutal scene like that where he's like beating his wife, his girlfriend and like punches her mother. And then the first thing comes up his mouth is like, see what you made me do to you. Yeah. And it's just like such a chilling moment. You're just like, oh my god. Fucking chilling. And then when you, then when you like, you know, one of the things Carl Jung says that's really creepy is the shadow, the collective shadow of a society gets projected into their government. And when you realize that every single fucking war the United States has been involved in follows a very similar pattern, which is that the United States has been at war for 93% of its history, man. And every time we go to fucking war for, we're always like, see what you did. Yeah. See what you did to us. See what you made us do. You made us fucking launch fucking missiles against you and drop bombs on you and kill all your, all these fucking civilians. Don't just see what you did. Yeah. And the people in the country are like, dude, I sell fucking mats. I'm a mat salesman. Yeah. I'm a mat salesman and I watch my fucking kid get exploded by a fucking bomb dropped out of a goddamn remote controlled fucking spaceship thing. I didn't do shit, man. And that's that, I think is like the, in the same way that a fucking drunk has to come to Jesus, so to speak and be like, I've got a fucking problem. I'm fucking hooked on booze. Yeah. The United States can't seem to realize, uh, I think maybe I've got a little bit of a war addiction going on here. Yeah. And it's just like if you, and you know, it's, it's like, it's the, it's the migrant crisis. It's just like those same people who are just like, I like last year, I was just like hanging out with my family. Now I'm like trying to get a, get a, I'm just, I'm trying to get the fuck out of this place. It's been reduced to rubble, like literally been really reduced to rubble. There's nothing, there's no, like when people can't, when, when, when your electricity goes off in North America and like a major city and you have like a fairly decent lifestyle, your electricity goes off, your water doesn't work. How fast do we fucking go to our fucking phones and go call up whoever and go like, my fucking water's been out for three hours. Yeah, pissed. It's like, we can't take a shower before work. The world's like, the world is ended. And the electricity is out for like two days. It's like, what the fuck? It's unsustainable in our minds. Yes. We lose our shit. Someone's got to pay for this. This is insane. And you like, when it becomes protracted and it's like six months of that shit, a year of that shit, you're shitting in rubble, literally shitting in rubble. You're drinking fucking disgusting water. I think I want to get out of here. What you do is to, because suddenly there's like, this is like, well, you're leaving, you're leaving your blades. Why are you coming over here for it? So it's like, well, I'm a human being and I don't really see myself as lesser than you. So I'm just trying to, I'm trying to ask you if I can crash at your house for a while. Yeah. I start a new life because you kind of help burn my fucking house down. You have to, because you don't want to deal with it. It's like the alcoholics way or whatever. Like just perfectly what you're saying is just like, it's their fault. Well, there's, you know what, you know what's going on? Some of the people, some of the people among you are, don't have good feelings toward me. So none of you can come in. That's right. One of you might be a terrorist. It's like, cool. Really? You know, one of you might be angry because we've been dropping bombs on your fucking country, which is why you're coming. One of you might be angry or crazy because we don't have any angry or crazy people here. Yeah, dude. And so now when you, when you slam into that wall, you know, because you're, it's really frustrating because it's like, fuck man, like I honest to Christ, like, I think if you could, and if I could, like, we would like try to fix the problem. But, but honest to God, man, imagine right now if like all of a sudden the walls talk about like a great prank show, two fucking assholes yapping about the immigration crisis, right? Get, get like put into a universe. Let's put two assholes in a warring universe and like, and get them talking about how we got to do some about immigration. And then the walls drop, some kind of reptilian being in a robe comes out, gives us the crystal of power and is like, there you go. Yeah, fix it. Fix it. What? What are you gonna, what the fuck are you gonna do? Wait, I'm in my toga. I'm just like, wait a minute. I'm just, I'm here to judge people. I don't know how to actualize anything. Dude, I want to play music on my modular synths. I don't want to solve the fucking immigration crisis, right? I got to check my IG hits, dude. Are you kidding me? Yeah, yeah, right there, man. That's where we fucking slam into the goddamn fucking wall, right fucking there. And it's like, what the fuck do we do? I mean, really, what the, there's the, we got a certain amount of stuff. And most of the stuff is in the hands of a very small amount of fucking people. And those people, they don't want to give it away. And taking it from them seems pretty fucking unethical. So if the, if the concept is that like they've earned it or that stealing is bad or that, and now we've got people who really legitimately want to destroy the United States, but then mixed among them are people who have children, who desperately need a fucking bowl of soup and a place to sleep. And then in the fucking people who are pissed at us, cause we've been dropping bombs at them. Know that there are people over here who want to give kids bowls of soup. So they know like shit, man, we can use that to get shit in there to get revenge. Cause these motherfuckers blew up my grandmother when I was trying to sell mats. And now it's like this super complex, crazy fucking problem. And what's the answer? Take out your phone and fucking film it and go to bed, take some sleeping pills and forget it, I guess. I think it's like, I think we just become like retreating warriors. Like we just retreat, we like everything around us now allows us to like act like we're doing something, but we actually get to retreat. Right? So it's just kind of like, I'm showing up for war. Kind of, I'm just like on my phone tweeting this thing cause it's wrong. This is like, I'm a warrior. Not really though, cause I'm just like I get to retreat at the microphone. I'm not gonna. What do we do? I don't want to get my hands dirty. How do we not retreat? Like there's gotta be like, I love thinking about like not like bullshit. I mean, I think, I think like part of, yeah, it's so frustrating because I think that it's, I, villainizing people for showing up on mass to like to, to, um, to say this is wrong or to, to, to, to, to vocalize their, their displeasure with what the government's doing, that's becoming villainized. You know, so like any form of like direct action is becoming villainized. And that's the dangerous thing. Like don't fall into that trap. Like don't think that, and sometimes it's people you don't agree with, but like, it's better for people to show up and say something than be scolded into retreat and be the lesson that's learned universally. This is like, don't show up. Don't say anything. Right. Right. We're going to label you with this or that if you do. And the building blocks have started for that. Like people are, you know, people, the fact that people, the fact that we call each other names because people show up to, to, to be angry about something is pretty disgusting. You know, it's just like, uh, and it's being fostered and it's being, it's being regionalized like shitty sports teams. So now politics is just like, it's the Cougars versus the, you know, the, the, the mountain, whatever the hell, my shitty sports, my shitty, my shitty sports teams. Cougars versus the Archons. The Archons of France. They're marsupials versus the mammals. Anyways. Yeah. Uh, but yeah, you know what I mean? So it's just like, holy shit, this isn't sports, dude. It's like, you can't just, that's the thing. That's the thing about like just even like political jerseys. They don't fit well on me. No. Political jerseys just do not fit well. I cannot put on a single team's jersey and go like, ah, perfect in all ways. Never taking this off. Not even going to take it off to wash it. Just going to wear it for a, yeah. I'm going to be this fucking thing forever. And that's the other problem is like when you do take a strong stance on any issue, you, people will like be like, man, you send them back then, right? And, and, and, and it's like, and the, and the problem is, is like, well, fuck, you know, you're right. I did say that and I was fucking wrong. I was wrong. And dude, I've, I've, the thing you're talking about is like, sometimes man, I'll look at, I'll look at people's like tweets and they're pissed off about this or that. And they've tweeted like a big fat fucking tweet of like rage and I'll be like, God damn it. Like whatever. Like you don't mean that or I don't know. And, and I've caught myself doing that and it's so hypocritical because I will tell you a tweet that I'm deeply embarrassed and ashamed of. And I tweeted a long time ago and I look back at that tweet and I, and I really was like, I was really fucking upset, man. And, and it was, I think it was during one of our mini wars. No, it was like Israel was attacking Palestine. And I tweeted. It's so fucking sanctimonious, dude. I tweeted, I'm against anyone. It's something like I'm against anyone who kills kids. Oh, just nauseatingly like obvious and, and nauseatingly pious and just not like, yeah, really? Wow, you're unique, huh? Holy shit. That's a, that's a fucking unique position. Duncan, hold on. Let me get this straight. You don't like it when people kill kids. I want to like really like talk to you about that. I'm sure you want to go on the record saying fire is hot. Yeah, exactly. Right. Exactly. But I fucking, But yeah, I get it though. I was upset. I didn't want the fucking kids to get killed in that moment. But also on top of that, and this is the, this is to me where it's like, I shouldn't be shaming myself because I think ultimately if you are doing anything that is even like 10% towards bringing to reducing suffering on planet earth, then that is better than nothing. Even if 90 fucking percent of the time after you do the thing, you're going back to look at how many retweets you got, how many faves you got, how many whatever. It's still good. I just think that like the, that we all gotta realize this is a brand new technology. And if we can all tune ourselves in a way that we can start using it so that when we like do come out and say something, it's more effective at reducing suffering than increasing panic and fear. Yeah. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So it's like, it's like, yeah, it's, we like, we teach ourselves lessons about like, we got to, you know, again, if it's like immediately, if it's self-gravity, we're so horrible. If it's like self gratifying and it has something to do with us, it's like, people will teach themselves a little bit helps if it comes to going to the gym to get that perfect six-pack ad. Yeah. Right. So it's just like, just do it. Just chip away at it, dude. Just do it. You can get there. You can get to that six-pack app and people are like, you know what, that's a great way to look at it. And but they cannot use that same, they can't use that same logic, that same critical thinking and apply it to other things. Just chip, like help give the world some fucking six-pack apps. They just chip away at things. And like, you know, I mean, everybody has their own version of six-pack apps, I guess, but fuck it. Just chip away at it. I mean, I honestly think that, I honestly think that like people who want to do heinous things that actually don't have the betterment of society or, you know, just like the world. I, I, those, it goes back to those are the moments that I think become exactly what we were talking about in terms of like a natural disaster happening and people just coming together and going like, no, that's that, that's, we got, we were better than this. Yeah. And we have to bank on that in terms of human nature because you can't teach that. You can't, you can't enforce it. You can't, I mean, you can instill it through like trying to be, have your better angels come forward and things like that. But I mean, like ultimately you can't just like staple that on somebody's chest. And I'm just like, and now you're going to do the right thing. It's just like, I think that, I think that, yeah, everybody's, even the people with darker points of view, after a while, when you see that that's one of the alternatives, people are just going to be like, that just does not, that's not going to work, dude. And I also see that working against me one day. Like, you know, if there's ever a good time to be selfish, it's when you put yourself in other people's shoes and go like, I don't want that to happen to me. You know, like, if you're going to be selfish about something, use it that way. Like that is not brilliant. Oh, what I want for myself. I wouldn't want that ever. Brilliant. Use your selfishness. Yeah. Use it as a tool. Yeah, use it as a tool. Well, you're like, it's like some kind of new selfishness judo. Like you can like use it. Fuck, dude, there's the next book. It's like using your selfishness to bring world peace. Yeah. Give the world some six pack abs, new selfishness. Fuck it. Just get there. Mr. Beckles, where can people find you online? Well, this is what I'm actually here for. Fuck the world. I'm at TV Carnage. Those are my those are my my handles on the Internet, on the on the Twitter and on the Instagram. Where can we watch your show? It is on Adult Swim on Sunday nights at midnight. And it's something that I'm very happy and proud that we got to make.

And of course, Eric and like it's it's great. There's like there's I'm like couldn't be happier. And it's and and all through through its absurdity and its insanity and its and whatever points it's trying to make it. Also, it also gives me hope that that can be created and put out there, you know. Yeah, yeah. It's amazing. It's incredible to watch TV these days and particularly shows like yours and just be like, whoa, they are there. They're like, well, it's Adult Swims. Yeah, it helps. But still, it's like, holy fucking shit, man. They're letting this stuff out. Yeah, it's a great sign. Yeah, it is. It is a good sign. It's just like it is. We're like a lot of the shows on Adult Swim, you know, particularly there, they really are, I think, kind of marching up the hill ahead of a lot of there's a lot of people who want to do the same sort of thing and and and other networks want to enable them to do it. So I'm I'm happy. Yeah, man, I'm glad that you're on there. And thanks so much, man. Just like it sounds cheesy, but thanks for making us laugh. I hope so. We really got we got in there.

305^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 558: Sharon Salzberg Transcript and Discussion^2023-03-27^Greetings, friends. It is I, D. Trussell, reporting in from Kansas City. My apologies. I left the cord to my beautiful Apollo Twin X audio interface back in Austin. So we're doing this right into the MacBook, baby. Today we've got a wonderful guest who is one of my favorite teachers of Buddhism and meditation. She is a New York Times bestselling author and you know her. It's Sharon Salzburg. And what a great time to tune in to what Sharon Salzburg is teaching all of us. ChatGBT at the time of this recording has existed for what, 11 days? And already it's transforming the way lots of people do their work. And you know this is just the beginning. This is just the beginning. It reminds me of when I got a Commodore 64 and how impressed I was by that thing that now is only worth money because it's an antique. But you certainly wouldn't use it for any kind of computing for anything that you wanted to do now. But to me, it seemed like a spaceship. I would take books of code and type it into the computer to make the shittiest games you ever saw. And then as time progressed, we all experienced this. The computers began to evolve. I would go to these computer stores in North Carolina and just marvel at machines that you couldn't sell at a good will now. But in those days, they were super expensive and seemed incredible. But the difference between this evolutionary technological trajectory that we've all sort of become attuned to and ChatGBT is that that trajectory, that evolutionary trajectory is going to be accelerated. Meaning that over the next year, we're going to see some crazy stuff emerge from technology. You could probably expect potential cures for diseases. You could definitely expect some really interesting sex toys because once ChatGBT gets into your vibrator and can talk to you in any kind of voice you want with any kind of personality you want, wow, that's going to be real interesting. Not to mention the ability in video games to chat with NPCs that seem to have their own personality and potentially could even connect with you in the real world when you're not playing the game via text or email. Kids toys are going to be super creepy and all of our appliances are potentially going to be very annoying. You might one day walk into your kitchen and hear your microwave talking to your refrigerator. This is on the horizon, which is why teachers like Sharon Salzburg are more important than ever. We're about to get a shotgun blast of technological novelty to our faces and we need something that we can ground ourselves in. I think the teachings of Sharon Salzburg are perfect for that because she has a way of simplifying Buddhism, which can sometimes be quite complex into something that an idiot like me can digest. Anytime I get to have these conversations with her, it's like somebody has poured water on my seething, bubbling, rashy, neurotic brain. Sharon is so good at teaching about the idea of cultivating compassion. A lot of people, I don't think they, when you think about compassion, you just kind of imagine it's like baked in, built in. Yeah, I can be compassionate, but in Buddhism, it's something you actually kind of have to develop, train, cultivate. And you know, right now, people are already wobbled by the never ending historical events that seem to happen every couple of weeks. And so finding a way to cultivate compassion for them and for you and for all of us as we find ourselves getting suctioned into a technological cyclone is probably a good investment of all of our time. Otherwise, we're all going to end up like drooling, raving, maniac characters in some HP Lovecraft short story who have looked into the eyes of the eldritch gods and lost their minds. Look, I'm not saying chat GBT is an eldritch God. I love it. I'm delighted by it. I'm excited for it. But I think once you remove the ability to get used to the wonders that we're about to see, once you remove that, that nice year or two in between each new technological advancement, it's going to spin some people for a loop. So folks like Sharon Salzburg are here for us. And you should definitely check out our new book. It's called Real Life, The Journey from Isolation to Openness. You can preorder it by going to SharonSolzburg.com. All right, everybody, here's Sharon Salzburg. Sharon, it is wonderful to see you. Welcome back to the show. How are you? I'm well. It's great to see you. It's, you know, anytime I get a chance to talk with you, I essentially just scroll through whatever is going on with me, which is generally some form of, I don't want to call it mental illness, but some form of paranoia from doom scrolling. And this results in an incredibly grim appraisal of the world all together. And then from that grim appraisal of things, I like to think what would the Buddha do? Should the Buddha appear? Like if suddenly it happens, the matreya comes and scans this world where we see fever pitched levels of fear, indignation. I'm right, you're wrong. And the subsequent tribalism that has to emerge when large groups of people just stop listening to each other. And then I scroll through all the stuff I've read in Buddhism, all the things that I hope that I gathered from you and Ram Dass, and I inevitably hit that rainbow wheel that spins on your computer when an app is about to crash. So in this case, what do you think should the Buddha, Jesus, whatever name you want to give to some brilliant savior or teacher, what do you think they would think scanning world events as they are right now? Would there be any difference in messaging as opposed to past iterations when these great enlightened beings have appeared? No, I don't think there personally, I don't think their message would be different. It might be a little harder for us to tolerate or trust, but and there are many things that have come up in my mind hearing what you had to say. One is, I think there's a certain balance in mind, you know, speaking on behalf of the Buddha, for example. Thank you. You know, who talked about balance quite a lot because as he posits the world, suffering itself is not redemptive. Suffering is not grace. It doesn't equal grace. And we know that there are people who go through a hard time and they emerge bitter and isolated and blaming everybody in the world and very self-absorbed and there are people who go through sometimes even a harder time and something ignites in them as they metabolize it into compassion. And I would see that sometimes in my, say my teachers in India, you know, where especially this one woman named Deepa Mahu had gone through tremendous personal suffering in her life, you know, losing two children and her husband dying very suddenly. And that was the point that she went to practice meditation because she was so grief-stricken. Her doctor actually said to her, they were living in Burma at the time. Her doctor said to her, you're actually going to die of her broken heart unless you do something about your mind. You should learn how to meditate. The thing that always was amazing to me with people like her was that they were all interested in other people, you know, like, how was your journey? Were you okay, you know? Do you want a cup of tea? And I kept thinking, boy, if I went through what she went through, I don't know if I'd care about anyone else's journey. Right. You know, and so what we're doing in terms of approaching the genuine pain in the world and in ourselves is trying not to add so much stuff to it. Like, it's only me or this is the only thing that is true. And we need to see it, you know, honestly and directly, but it's not the only thing that is true. And so being able to face what's happening with some greater balance, have some compassion for ourselves and others. And then the other part of it is actually, is going to sound a little goofy, but it's kind of like looking for the good, you know, when you're talking about doom-scrolling, I thought of, actually, Mr. Rogers, like, I'm too old to have seen it and your kids are too young, but, you know, but his famous comment, he was about nine years old and very distressed about the state of the world. And his mother said to him, look for the helpers. There are people of good-heartedness really everywhere and are trying and there's something uplifting about that and incredibly touching. And, you know, I've known people who have gone through such huge, terrible tragedies in their own personal lives. And they talk about that, you know, the love that came their way and the help that came their way. And they looked for the helpers and it doesn't deny the pain, but it surrounds the pain with another perspective. And I think that's important in a time that I didn't know that word doom-scrolling, someone had to describe it to me when I was being interviewed or something. You taught me the word. Yeah. I've used it ever since. It's good. I use it every day. I think about it all the time. Bad habit is a bad habit. It is. You know, so a little bit of restraint is also good. It's like, okay, it's the fifth hour I've been going through this. Yeah. Well, you know, I agree with you, but I've noticed that sometimes even proposing what you just proposed is offensive to some people that they recoil from the idea of looking at other sides. I have been scolded myself if you even come close to proposing an idea that not that long ago was just sort of normal. Like, yeah, let's try to embrace all sides. Sometimes the response is you are trying to... What you're doing in your attempt, what do they call it? The thing in the middle, which is Buddhism. In your attempt, it's not centralization, there's a better name for it. Centrist. Centrism. Your goal of trying to find some middle line between radical factions where one, depending on who you're talking to, one faction is completely, permanently, inalterably wrong. And so the attempt to find the center point is, even though you don't want to do that, is to embrace the worst possible reality. So I'm not trying to find the center point between views, because I actually agree that I don't think all views are equal and that we need to sort of compromise. I think the rigidity with which we might hold our own view and rival listen to anyone else is another problem. But the centrism or the balance is more about your approach to things, your own personal approach to what you're feeling, your ability to hear, the balance between compassion and effort to make things different. Isn't it better when that effort is infused with wisdom rather than that need to be in control of everybody? But I agree. It's a huge problem to somehow hold that place where we can listen to someone, have a strong sense of our own principles, not feel like we're just giving in for the sake of some sloppy kind of piece, you know? Yeah, you're right. Sloppy kind of piece. I'll take it. You know what? I'll take it. I'll take a nice sloppy piece these days. But I know what you're saying. But I guess this, when I, so I'll I'll scan the way I feel when I've gotten particularly frothed up by some horrible thing I've managed to dig out of the swamps of the Internet. And usually it's a... You should be more superficial. That's all I can say. Why don't you just go for distractions? Oh, I do that too. But this state that I experience is of some generally a combination of confusion, anger, fear, and I guess I don't know, sprinkle on top of that a general sense of hopelessness or a feeling like, oh, this is an irreparable situation. I don't know what to do, what anyone could do about this. So in that state, do you think that people who are in that state, whether they're in that state for good reasons or they're in that state for neurotic reasons, can you execute the sort of compassion you teach about even though you are completely pissed off? I think you can. I mean, I wouldn't be the last person to say it was easy, you know, because I don't want to be glib about these things and hypocritical. But I think you actually can because there's something about, I think really picking up someone else's disconnection from reality, from caring what anybody else has to say, you know, and we don't have to echo that. It's like, you know, we can care about the person and be present and see if there's anything, you know, without giving in. But, you know, is there anything that actually unites us? I mean, I've heard in the kind of situations you're describing, sometimes it's love for one's children. It's the one thing people can actually agree on. Right. You know, what one feels about the, you know, climate they're narrating is a different thing, you know, but, right. But fundamentally, you know, whether you find that common point or not, it's just a caring, you know, I go back to myself, I go back to what the Buddha said when he said everybody wants to be happy. People want a superficial sense of happiness, but a sense of finding a home somewhere in this body and this mind with one another on this planet. And we have so much ignorance and so much confusion about where happiness really lies. And, you know, is it endless accumulation? Is it really ventrleness over everyone else? Is it, you know, right, bizarre and endless competition that leaves us exhausted? You know, is it giving up everything that we actually really cherish for the one thing we think isn't going to be permanent? Is there anything happy about that ultimately? But people believe that and they live by that. And you can just have a kind of compassion like, wow, you know, even if you don't subscribe to a cosmology of many lives, it's even worse. It's like, you've got this one life and this is what you're doing, you know. Yeah. So this and again, I'm sorry if I'm coming at you with some unanswerable or annoying questions. But again, it's this is just from my own dark reservoir of thinking. So to put it plainly, this is my new parent, like I have good obsessions, don't worry. I mean, but what am I going to do to tell you all the happy things I'm thinking, Sharon? It was a waste of everyone's time. So let me present to you, here's my current dark obsession. I have become convinced that there is a new, I guess you could say, I don't know, cultural fashion trend and sociopathic narcissists, where they have identified a method of seeming. And I am not pointing the finger at anybody. I'm saying across the board, China, Russia, the United States, anywhere, there's a new discovery. Maybe it's not a new discovery. Maybe I just haven't been paying that much attention, where you cover up your self obsession or self absorption with this costume in which you're not self absorbed at all, but rather you are sort of representing the entirety of some population of people, whoever you are, the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Chinese communists, the environmentalists, the warmongers, the whoever it may be. And so in your self absorption, you are negating all of that like, what? I'm not self absorbed. How could I seem self absorbed? I'm completely invested in saving the world. But the world that you're wanting to save inevitably means the destruction of someone else's world, at least subjectively. So this is my dark thought, because I'm friends with a psychiatrist. He told me the most horrifying thing about sociopaths. He said that if a sociopath presents to you for help, I think maybe this is more clinical psychology actually than psychiatry, the instruction is stop treatment. Because the sociopath, I'm talking the actual thing, is untreatable. If they're coming to you, they're coming to you because they want to manipulate or they're doing it for some ulterior motive that you'll maybe never know, or they want to hurt you, stop treatment. And so I was chilling when I heard him say that, because again, refer to compassion, never give up on anyone, help. So this is where my head is really slammed into a wall, Sharon, because what I'm worried that by sort of seeking some of these compassionate methods with people who really aren't truly invested in the movements that they claim to be, that all you end up wasting a lot of time, and most importantly, elevating someone who is completely self absorbed to higher and higher levels of exposure to the world, which is really what a narcissist wants, you know, more and more attention, more and more, it's about me, me, me. I'm saving the world. I'm the one who's at war with the darkness here. Don't you see it's me doing the saving? And so to me, that, what do you do there? What do you do there? I mean, this is such a confusing predicament. Well, it's a very profound question. I think first of all, I would be interested if you did a poll or some kind of survey of your many listeners who do want to hear you talk about the bright side of things, you know, so just because there was that assumption in the very beginning of this part of the conversation, I would wonder, you know, so fair enough. Yeah, that's personal. So I think what you're pointing to is this very deep question about the nature of compassion and action. And those are actually different things or they're distinct, they're distinct things. So compassion is like a freedom of the heart to not condemn, not hate, not be lost in fear of, but you know, kind of picking up someone's suffering, wish that they could be free of it for many reasons. What you do about that is not just about compassion. It's about wisdom. It's about discernment. It's about understanding your own limits. It's understanding that there's got to be a balance between compassion for yourself and compassion for others. It's like, you are not responsible for fixing this other person's view. You know, you may be responsible for having a kind of wish for them that they be free, certain respectful presence, you know, but why would you be elevating them? Don't elevate them, you know, and that doesn't mean you're not compassionate. It means you're bringing another kind of clarity into the situation. And this figures in every so-called helping situation, you know, where you're a caregiver of some kind or another, either in your family or in your professional life or sometimes people just say, that's who I am in any friendship, you know, I'm the one who is like the giver. I'm taking care of, I'm trying to make sure the other person is okay. And understanding that there are limits, that's the reality. And so, you know, I'm thinking of this friend of mine who way back in the old days when the Dalai Lama wasn't sort of surrounded by so much security and, you know, kind of pomp and circumstance, and he was visiting the states and he was just like staying people's houses, you know, and he'd need a ride, someone would like grab a car and give him a ride or something like that. So I have a friend who was very close to him from those times and was working with him and spending a lot of time with him. And she said she heard from her mother one day and her mother had a history of mental illness and some very dangerous behavior for her kids. And her mother wanted to see her and she was sort of stricken. It was like, you know, she felt terribly guilty. Like she didn't want to go see her mother. She was really frightened and she said, here I am spending all this time with the Dalai Lama, you know, like the supreme master of compassion. Like I'm horrible and terrible. And so finally she went to the Dalai Lama and she told him, you know, her dilemma and her feelings and he looked at her and he said, you should do a tremendous amount of loving kindness for your mother from a distance. He said, it's not safe to be with her, you know, and that's like reality. That's wisdom. And so of course you think he, of all people, is going to say, go, you know, grovel, you know. Yeah, lie. Go lie to your mother. Everything's fine. Yeah, I love that. That conflation, you know, bringing together kind of the heart, space of compassion and a certain kind of action is what holds a lot of people back. I find, you know, people say to me, I don't know about this kind of loving heart thing, because then I can only say yes. I can only give them more money. I can only let them move back in. I can only smile, you know, right. It's not like that. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Squarespace. Squarespace has everything you need to create a beautiful website.

I find out people say to me, I don't know about this kind of loving heart thing because then I can only say yes. I can only give them more money. I can only let them move back in. I can only smile. It's not like that. This is the part of that that is very difficult for me, which is generally if I have some sense of like, look, I don't want to interact with that person or even, oh boy, here we go again with this looping sort of argument that's been going on forever. I have so much like, I don't want to call it anger, frustration, so much frustration and so much of, especially now that I'm a dad, busy, that sense of like, my time, I have to be careful with my time. I got to get so much done a day. I don't have time to entertain this. Even if it's from a distance, even if I'm not talking to them, it's still time being burned. It's still, you know, time mentally being burned and considering whatever the particular conflict is. So I really don't understand, and maybe this is just because I don't understand compassion. I don't understand how to honestly invoke this open-hearted state while simultaneously being terribly frustrated with a person. I don't see the frustration seems to drown out that open-hearted, vulnerable feeling that I've achieved rarely in my life. Well, you know, I would probably say, forget compassion for the moment and see if you could sit with the frustration and, you know, don't dwell on what you're frustrated about. Like they said this and they wrote that, you know, but look at frustration itself and see what it's made of, what it's to feel like in your body. What are the component parts? Because there's often something very interesting there. Like in Tibetan Buddhism, they say that anger is what we pick up when we feel weak because we think it's going to make us strong. And there's a strength, certainly, to the energy of anger. And it's very important that we utilize that. But you think about that feeling of helplessness underneath it. And what I find is that if I can sit with, say, the anger of the frustration, which is a form of anger, be impatient and just sit and watch the movie of it, I will find that place of helplessness. And once I do that, once I find that, then I say, okay, what can I do? And it might be a very small action. Like with people like that, I don't really feel, you know, they're not coming to me for meditation instruction. I don't really feel like I can affect directly their state of mind. But I can really try to make sure they're not in power over me or other people that's voting, you know, in this system, or, you know, organizing it in some way, because it's one thing for them to have certain beliefs or ways of seeing the world. And it's another thing for that to be imposed on, you know, children, you know, or, or young adults or women or something like that. You know, and so often there's some action, it might seem small, but that's okay. That kind of channels the frustration and the energy of the anger in some way. And that's useful. That's so brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. Because nobody, first, this is what I love about Buddhism. No one, or most people who haven't heard of that, it's the very opposite way of thinking, which is get as far away from that feeling of helplessness as you possibly can, usually via some form of like aggression to assert yourself and is the one in control. And going into that state of helplessness, I want to talk about that state of helplessness a little bit more. And, and, because I've been getting this ever since I was at one of these retreats, Joan Halifax was talking about insecurity from the Zen Buddhist perspective. And this being sort of the, this is the natural state of things. So why would you feel secure, you're going to die, you're going to get old, we live on a plant, we have all the stuff. But sometimes I get so overwhelmed by that feeling like, forget all the, I'm pissed at somebody, just in general, you know, you're sitting, you're, especially getting older, which I enjoy getting older, but the older you get, the more you watch the world run away from you, you know, it just runs away, it grows on its own, it doesn't care what you think, boomer or whatever, Gen X or whatever, we don't care about that anymore. We're on to the next, so far onto the next thing that you couldn't even hope to harmonize with that next thing. Do you know what I'm, you must know. I know, I'm quite a bit older than you, I'm sure, you know, and it leaves you with this sense of like, you know, the same feeling I get when like my poodle gets out, this sense of like, well, I'm not catching him a good luck, I hope I, he's gone, he's gone with the wind. And, and, and then that feeling that you're talking about, which is no different than the feeling of vulnerability underneath anger or any other thing, it's the identical feeling. So what is that Sharon? What is this? When, when I hear, sometimes I, and I feel like this is, must be an error when I am feeling that it's another way to like sort of put lipstick on it or, or, or comb its air. I think, okay, this is a spiritual state sitting here in my car, morosely looking out at a parking lot, thinking, well, world's going to just keep going when I die. I'm just the old useless, old thing or whatever, just that fee, and forget this story. I'm talking about just the feeling, the feeling itself. Like, I don't, I, it's almost indescribable, maybe the way a fish feels when it gets pulled out onto a boat and it's just flopping around on the boat, just trying to swim. Tell me about this. What, what, what, what stories do you have about that specific feeling? Is there something to poly for that feeling? What are we talking about? Yeah, I mean, it is, it is considered a spiritual state. It's, it's not bad, you know, because it's like, look at all the myths and the lies we're fed. Like, if you only had this income, you'd feel safe, you know, you wouldn't die in effect, you know? Yes. It's like, you won't even get sick, you know? And, you know, immortality isn't really here at hand, but only for rich people, you're not rich enough. Right. You know, that you can hold on to someone else. I mean, you're a dad, right? And so there's a combination, you know, what I've seen in my friends who are parents or grandparents of, you know, of course, nurturing and feeling responsible for and holding the family in that way. And there's also a good amount of letting go, you know? Like, yes, you can't insist the child be poetic when they're kind of scientific or athletic when they're cluts or, you know, whatever. And you could, but that's not love either, you know? So you're continually letting go of being in control all the time. And so, you know how to do it, actually, you know, as a dad, that was just applying it to yourself in your life. But I think that's an amazing feeling. You don't want it to be like you're every day or every moment of every day, you know, because how grim is that? But, you know, to be right, I mean, one of my big bugaboos is how far down I have to scroll online whenever I have to enter my birth year, you know? And it's like, it's like hours, you know, I'm still going down that stupid list, you know, down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. Yeah, the 50s, right. Okay, you know. I mean, it's so stupid, you know, and it brings up a lot of a genuine feeling, even though it's funny, you know? But it's the truth of things, right? So why live in denial? It's going to be worse somehow to live in denial and pretend like, yeah, I've got it down now, you know, it's going to be okay. Right. Right. Right. That's cruel. I do that with video games, Sharon. It's like, I'm embarrassed that I'm playing a video game, right? And then on top of that, it's like, okay, it's like, okay, let's just go all the way back decades before most people were playing this game we're born. So this, this is where to me, I recoil sometimes from Buddhism. And maybe a lot of people do is because somewhere here, you must face this terrible reality that you were sort of dissipating that you are in a system, in a process that is dissipating you and will dissipate your children and will dissipate every single thing. This, I think this is where I hit the wall, because I like to, sometimes I think I'm not afraid of death. I'm not afraid of death at all. I've overcome that. I've done LSD hundreds of times. I know what it is to die. But you know, in those moments where you really face it, it is inexorable. You can't argue with it. It doesn't care how funny you may be or how, whatever, whatever you're doing, how many books you've written. Oh, people like your podcast, I'm still going to eat you. But I was number 48 in the house. Yeah. So somewhere here, I, I hit something that I, it's almost worse than terror. That's almost worse than, it's like zero on the number line. It's, my mind cannot play any tricks on it at all. What, what is, what is that? Is that suffering? Is suffering that feeling that, I don't even want to call it a feeling. It's suffering like that electric pulse that just goes through your body when you manage to terrify all of your coping mechanisms and look at the thing in the eye. Yeah. I mean, that's why, you know, people have teachers, people have a community. It's not easy to go through alone. And yet, it's not useless. It's not a useless state. It's horrible feeling. Yes. But it's not a useless state if we use it correctly. You know, because it is, it's a genuine response to a real problem. Somebody was once quoted as saying, the best thing you can say about the universe is that it's a bad design. You know, I mean, really, it's absurd. And it's, it's a bigger front. Personally, I feel that I have to die. You know, like, I spent all this time like learning something or, you know, cultivating something and I have to die. It's ridiculous. Yelp reviews of the universe. Yelp reviews of the universe. I'm going to give this universe one star. What? Yeah, really, immortal star. You know, and so utilize it. Everyone says that, right? It's like you've got these young kids, you know, you can pay some attention to them. The world doesn't necessarily tell you to do that, you know, right. But you have that feeling, you know, and you want to just have the best life that you can. Like I have a friend who kind of retired, you know, he sort of had done his career and retired sort of early and he had enough means and he was doing things that were interesting to him in life, you know, in terms of philanthropy or, you know, other things. And then he got offered another job and it was like a super job, you know, and it was not in his intention, his intentional feel to take another job, you know, but yeah, but there it was. And he's trying to decide what to do. And then his partner said something to him, which I just found so funny. She said something like, I'm really afraid that on your deathbed, you're going to look back and have regret that you didn't take the job. And I said to him, I've never heard of anyone dying and thinking, I wish I'd taken that job, you know, like ever, ever, ever, you know, and I'm not yelling. And so, you know, that doesn't be what we tend to regret at the end of a life. It's like, I didn't see my kids for 40 years. It was a shame. You know, or I was in this other place in life and I kind of fell for the old trap. That's what we regret, you know, but the lack of love we give and receive, you know, maybe there were people that are trying to love us, we couldn't let it in. That's what we regret. Okay, so you're saying sort of alchemize that state as use it or use it as a compass almost, like what exactly this is true. And that is nothing, you know, it's like, as a parent, you want to take your, you take your kid, you want to your kid have fun. So, take the kids to Dave and Buster's. Now, at some point, you got to leave Dave and Buster's. There's no way around it. It's time for that. I don't know what Dave and Buster's is. I feel all of a sudden like, what is Dave and Buster's? I think Dave and Buster's is a good, Sharon, it's just a good thing. I would actually be shocked if you're like, I love Dave and Buster's. It's a video arcade, basically. It's a loud video arcade designed to drive children into a froth. And maybe that's the thing we're into. Dave and Buster's for mortals or something. Maybe that's what all of society is, but taking the child out of Dave and Buster's, it's the apocalypse for the child. Like, why don't we live here? This is what reality is supposed to be. Flashing lights, tickets to get your toys, and like cool rides that you can go on, not whatever the heck you guys are doing back at that boring house you've been making me live in that isn't Dave and Buster's. And so, this is how I feel, I think, in contemplating my own mortality. And I I feel like what you're saying is, look, this is usable energy, but also I feel like kind of what you're saying is it's not going anywhere. Like, not only is your mortality an unchanging factor in reality, but that underlying sense of existential dread associated with it. Does that go away? I mean, are you telling me that for you or for your teachers that they weren't they were still experiencing that even in their wisdom and realization? Yeah, I think it's a kind of complex question because these states are also conditioned, they're culturally conditioned, they're conditioned on our own life experience. Like my mother died when I was nine years old. And I went to live with my father's parents, whom I hardly knew, who were European immigrants, Eastern European immigrants, and had certain beliefs, including the fact that they should never mention my mother, because that would hurt me, you know. So that's sort of the ambiance I grew up in. And so I went to anyone I was 18 years old, you know. And, you know, so I had a kind of terror about death that is, I think, beyond that existential dread. You know, I think some of it is probably just the human condition, but it's complicated. You know, it was really a compound by my personal life experience. And when that story changed for me, you know, because I do actually believe in rebirth, even though I talked about it earlier. And sometimes when I would feel a lot of fear of death, I'd say to myself, you've done this before, you've done this so many times. You can do it, you're going to be okay, you know. Not everyone has the kind of conditioning that I have. But there's also belief systems, you know, if you do believe in rebirth, you believe in this life, being like a drop in the ocean. And it's a genuine belief. And so it guides people's kind of feeling states, you know, that's a possibility too. So I do think it is a kind of human feeling. But I don't think everyone dwells in it the same way, or that it's so overwhelming in the same way for everybody. And no, I don't think that my teachers felt that kind of thing. If they did, it was like a blip, you know, because, right, like the 16th car mopper who died in the States of cancer. There's a famous story about him, like he was, and I think Chicago in a hospital and his disciples were around the bed and freaking out. And he said to them, don't worry, nothing happens. You know, I'm gonna say it's like changing apartments or changing suits or something like that. You know, your consciousness goes on the body is dropped and you pick up a new body. So I don't think it's the same for everybody. But I don't think one should judge oneself for feeling that kind of dread, you know, or feel that you're inferior or something like that. It's not so. This is what you feel. It's not an abnormal thing to feel, really. My loves, I travel all the time. I'm in Kansas City. Soon I'm going to be in Portland. And I've got so many shows coming up. And today's sponsor, Loomie Labs, is my savior. Loomie Labs has created the perfect microdose gummy.

This is what you feel. It's not an abnormal thing to feel, really. I'm so happy you said that because just last night, I'm going to bed, turning all the lights off, and I started thinking about my childhood. Again, the longer you got to scroll down on the age thing, the further away your child gets. And it becomes kind of shadowy. It's distant, obviously. But then I started thinking, oh, that's reincarnation. That's reincarnation. Probably when you die, you don't even know you died. Kids are born with amnesia. They don't know where they came from. Well, not all the way. Sometimes they say some pretty wild stuff. But so in other words, you don't even get the finish line of death. You probably probably don't even get that. It's just you just wake up and you have no idea what you are. You're in a little body and good luck. Hopefully you were born in the right family, and you don't even know what was in between. And I did feel, when I thought about that, a sort of remission of the intensity of dread. But then I thought, you're just trying to invent a mythology. You're trying to concoct something to make you feel better in the face of your own mortality. That probably is not the case. So it worked, though, for about eight seconds, which is nice. The reason I'm going down this road with you, Sharon, is because being a general idiot, I try to find a root cause of, okay, well, if we can find the root of what's going on here, then theoretically, there's a fix to the root. And so in the earlier in the conversation, my hopeful, hopefully dark fantasy that we have, there's a epidemic of sociopathic narcissists being fueled by likes and hearts and social media. I think, okay, well, what makes me a sociopathic narcissist? Like times when I'm acting like a sociopathic narcissist, what is it that would make me want to be the center of any attention at all? Why do I want that? Why would you want that? It's dangerous. It's a noise people. And I think if I'm doing that underneath it, is this very fear we're talking about? Underneath it is if I instantiate myself via some trickery, some charisma, some, you know, social backflips or whatever, conversationally, then I'm real. I'm alive. I exist. And I get to feel like I'm alive for a second, like I'm here. And so then I started thinking, well, theoretically, the more I sort of reframe my position as far as my own mortality goes, then that kind of neurotic habit would dissipate. And as above so below. So is that what we're dealing with here? Is this a collective attempt at evading that feeling we were talking about earlier? Is that what we're all doing? Collectively running away from that vulnerability by trying to force ourselves into the world? Well, in general, I think that is true. But look at that, then seeing it for what it is gives you an option, you know, or several options that didn't exist before. It's like, really beautiful. And I want to go back to the idea that, you know, the rebirth or whatever is just a myth. It's just a story to help one feel better. I mean, they're all stories, because we don't know, right? You know, in the midst of that dread, there's another story going on about complete annihilation and erasure and neilism, nothing mattered. So that's a story as well. And we're not quite sure unless you have that kind of vision, you know, we're looking back at your past lives, which some people do clearly. But if you don't have it, you don't know. And so it's like one story or another. So why not choose the story that allows you to, you know, be more free and more creative and have more choice in your life and not just be beholden to the society's myths? May I answer that respectfully, pushback? Because again, let me reiterate, I do believe in reincarnation and not just some faith based thing, because I've met people who remember their past lives. But the pushback is coming from the people listening who maybe are like, no, no, no, no, no. So I think of Camus, I think of his essay, The Myth of Sisyphus, and his definition of something I think he called an existential suicide, which is by sort of inventing something that might not be real by not going to the truth of truths. You actually negate your own existence because you've attached yourself to, you know, it reminds me of what Chogyam Trumpa said, who did believe in reincarnation. He was a Rinpoche. But still, he said, you know, this is like burrowing, like creating an illusion, now burrowing into it and creating a little house that you're living inside. I think that's, there's some resonance between those two ideas, Camus and Chogyam Trumpa. So, and even so, Sharon, you know, if we do reincarnate, it doesn't matter, because we don't remember. We might as well be gone, like who cares? The identity, the ego, the thing that gets the likes and the retweets, bye-bye, it's gone. It's gone. You can't take those numbers with you. Like, I'm a baby, but in my last life, I got 4,000 followers on. Damn. How depressing. How depressing. You gotta lose that? Are you sure? Oh my god. Oh my god. Yeah, you gotta lose that. And so, and so, again, you're thwarted by this sort of, okay, if, you know, this is my, this is where I'm harvesting the dopamine, or this is where I'm sort of nesting, you're still thwarted yet again by this, no, the Ozymandias, that poem, you're still, behold my works, ye mighty and despair, a head lay on the sand, or however it goes. You know what I'm saying? You're still thwarted. So now what? Let's take reincarnation off the table. Now what? Okay, well, I'm not proposing one rigidly holds a view and sort of beat other people over the head with it. You know, my favorite line about rebirth, because my teachers, you know, they weren't holding on to Buddhism or certain philosophy or a certain view. They were really encouraging one's own discovery, you know, of what is true. And so, I'd want teachers, my name is Ninja, and somebody was really arguing with him about rebirth and saying, I don't believe it, I don't see this cosmology in many lives. And Ninja just said, you don't have to believe it. He said, it's true, but you don't have to believe it. Which is a kind of likeness, which is a good thing. I think you come to the same place, whether you believe in, if you know, future lives or not, which is like, this life is precious, and it matters what we do. It's not inconsequential, it matters, whether it matters because it forms your next life or it matters, because this is all you got, you know, it matters. And so, I think Camus, he did something with that feeling he wrote, right? Yeah, he did. Yeah, which is kind of useful for generations to come. Absolutely. And yes, I love that, you know, it's sort of like finding in the groundless, some kind of, here's the reason, not just to keep going, though, but here's the reason to keep going compassionately, because I think the danger, if we remove a cosmology that has baked into it, consequence, repercussion, then, and many secularists really like hate it when people like me say this, because I'm like, look, I don't need God, I don't need reincarnation to be a good person. But if you wanted to create a condition, if you, I'm sorry, I write this, generally, the secularist atheists will say, I can just be a good person, okay? And it's like, well, that's incredible. I wish I were you, because I can't be a good person all the time. I habitually make radical errors in the way I treat people around me. And I believe in reincarnation, I will think, well, eff it, I'll be a bug next life, if I get to win this argument, it'll be worth it to be a mosquito, to win here, you know? So, but I love, this is like something you're so good at teaching, which is like, ultimately, it doesn't matter, because here we are, and the people around you, don't forget them, they too have a precious human life, maybe they reincarnate, maybe they don't, but they're here, they're here. But look at this here-ness that we're dealing with right now. And I think this leads us into a chance to talk about your book that's coming out in August. I have to try April. What? It's coming out in April. Oh, I thought you said August, God forgive me. April. We did this delusion April 11. Folks, real quick, I get to talk to Sharon Salzburg, it's not fair, could you do me the favor of pre-ordering her book? It makes a huge difference. It seems like it wouldn't, but if you love her, which we all do, go pre-order the book, that we're about to talk about, probably just after we talked about the book. But this, it appears to me that compared to the past, at least in my own life, your own life, technology has given us so many beautiful things. It has made, we are all magicians now, if you want to be, we can do just about anything you want to do. We've got artificial intelligence that we could have the conversations with, we can, anything in our minds, it's easier to get it out into the world. But the price of that seems to be that we don't need to go to the office anymore. We don't need to go around people anymore. We are using dating apps to find people who don't have to go to the bars, the restaurants, the clubs. This is the, take Boo Radley from to kill a mockingbird. That's everybody. We're all Boo Radley right now. We're all living in the house. We don't go out that much. We don't need to. And so this has produced a incredibly lonely reality for so many people who maybe they think they're not lonely because they're having zoom chats or they're like talking with their friends in video games, but I can only speak for myself. The world is a distant place for me. And it's right outside my door. Sometimes I walk from, I walk from my house to my studio, back to my house. Sometimes I'm like, huh, listen to those birdies. And then right back in the studio, off to work. So for me, it's an isolated situation. I've got a family. I can't imagine what it's like for people who have yet or don't want to. And so can you tell me a little bit about your new book in relation to this predicament that I think we all find ourselves in? We've collect, we're the most lonely, collectivized society in history, maybe, completely interconnected, completely dependent on each other's like affirmations via social media, completely like connected through work, and yet somehow massively fragmented, massively disconnected, massively isolated. Well, and thank you for bringing up the book. That's a great thing. So the book is called Real Life, The Journey from Isolation to Openness and Freedom. It's the first time I've written a book while not traveling incessantly, you know, because I was in basic isolation, as so many people were, although not everybody. And it was kind of inspired from the first Passover I was in lockdown, you know, in 2020. I watched this show on YouTube called Saturday Night Seder, which I loved. And it's, I believe it's still up. And it had brilliant, brilliant musicians. And it was very funny. And I learned a lot. Like, I didn't know that the song Somewhere Over the Rainbow was connected to Kristallnacht in the Nazi regime, you know, and I learned a lot, you know, and. Wait, can you talk about that a little bit more? I mean, I wish you'd never said that. Oh, God, what can you talk about? Well, it's just, you know, this just was in the show. And, you know, I'm not a historian or a scholar, but they said that. And it was in that era, you know, some believe in response to what was happening. And then someone sang it so you can imagine the emotion of, you know, so I learned a lot watching it. And it reminded me that symbolically, not dealing with geopolitics, but symbolically, the word Egypt means a narrow place, narrow strength. So it's about confinement, constriction, feeling trapped. And the journey is from constriction to openness to freedom. And so I thought, oh, that's what I want to write about. I want the arc of the book to be just that. So then I looked at, like, when do we tend to feel the most trapped, the most shut down, the most constricted? And, you know, certainly in Buddhist teaching is greed, hatred, and delusion. And, you know, I tried to make those relevant in people's lives. You know, I talked about addiction, I wrote about shame a lot as a kind of lacerating self-hatred. You know, we think it's so noble and it's so onward leading and it's not really, you know, it's confining, it's trapping, it's not a way to learn, it's not a way to grow. And then what do we do about that? You know, and so there are all these practices, including one from my Tibetan teacher, Sonny Rinpoche, who calls it, he calls all those states that go on fear and greed and so on. He calls them our beautiful monsters. And then he calls the practice handshake practice, which is like, you know, don't freak out. Your awareness is actually stronger than this, even seemingly massive and intense feeling. It's just visiting. You live here. Your awareness, your compassion, they live here. So you can actually treat this visitor with awareness, with presence, with balance, with some kindness, like in other forms, as you know, of Tibetan Buddhist practice, they would say, invite that demon in for a meal. Keep an eye on them, like don't give them the run of the house, because, you know, they're dangerous if they're in control. But you don't have to be so upset. You don't have to be so freaked out. You don't have to be so ashamed that this visitor has come. It reminds me, I think, psychologically of, you know, when things happen to us, when we're two years old or three years old or four years old, it is about survival. And so we incorporate that level of angst and anguish and terror with the incident. And so later on, that spark is triggered, as we say. And yet we're an adult. We have choices now. We have options we never had. As a child, it's actually not a matter of survival. We have enough space, spaciousness. We have enough awareness. We can deal with this as an adult rather than a child. So it's a lot of that kind of feeling. So, you know, let the beautiful monster be there without falling sway to it, you know, having an overwhelming, and also without being so ashamed, so upset. It's like, here you are. You know, so I was teaching once, I think it was New York, and I said, invite, you know, you're inner critic. Invite those demons in for a meal. And someone in the room didn't like it. So we said, how about inviting them in for a cup of tea? And they said, how about a cup of tea to go? So I said, okay, if that's the extent of your hospitality, but that's the feeling we cultivate. So it's not the very appearance of the demon. It's how we are with it that moves us into that state of expansion. And then, you know, I wrote about what that's like, you know, to have more gratitude, more love, more generosity, not in a funny way, you know, which I think you've been pointing to as a possibility in this conversation. You know, people put it on as a mantle of defense. They're just spiritually up-leveling. They're not looking at, you know, genuinely what's happening within them or outside of them. And that's always a possibility, but we don't want to go there. And we don't have to go there. Sharon, we've got a few minutes left. In the beginning of your description of the book, you were talking about awareness is stronger than these things. How would you define that awareness? And what's the distinction between the awareness and, I don't know, the apprehension of whatever these particular beautiful monsters are? Like, where does the awareness end and the monsters start? Well, you could say awareness is like consciousness of, you know, you can be conscious that you're hearing a sound. You can be conscious that you're seeing an image. You'd be conscious that you're feeling an emotion. You'd be conscious of a thought that's arising and passing away. But this, you know, comes into British psychology. And I'll try not to be too technical, but it's almost like we know with certain elements. So the, you can know the sound with greed, you can know a sound with hatred, you know, a sound with delight, you can know a sound with, and there are lots of factors that feed into that. You know, you may be didn't get any sleep all night, and then you hear a conversation and you think you're so annoyed by it. Whereas yesterday would have been nothing. You know, there are a lot of factors that feed into our reaction, but the reaction is very real as a part of the whole dynamic. And so that's really what we're working on. Instead of being ashamed, for example, that, you know, I still get frightened. I've been meditating for 50 years for God's sake. Yeah, it's like, okay, how am I with the fear? And that's, that's where our power actually lies. Whoa, I never, I didn't, I haven't heard that yet. You can change like, is that, is that in that? So the idea is like, it's the knowing or the listening or, that's right. You could change the way you're listening. That's right. You can control that. So, and so you're sort of habitually attuned, like when you hear this certain thing, if my phone beeps and I'm expecting like a bad text, whereas if my phone beeps and I'm waiting for someone I love to text me, it's, it's, so you're saying that there is some control so that you don't have to, that's really fascinating. I never, I mean, I've heard that maybe in different ways, but I've never heard it from the Buddhist perspective. You can, you don't have to listen to everything with horror. Yeah. Whoa. Cool. Sharon, thank you so much. I am so excited for this book. I love all your books. Thank you. You are so prolific. And I'm very excited for this new one. And I really, really appreciate you letting me, as always, unload the darkness. You're so good at, you're so, you should become some kind of meditation teacher. Whoa. And, and, and book aside everyone again, please pre-order the book. Please, so that, so that Sharon will keep coming on the podcast. Not that you wouldn't, but you know, it adds a little sugar to the situation. Can, can also, can you tell people, you know, aside from writing, you do have meditation classes, Zoom sessions. Can you tell people a little bit about your community and how they can connect with it? I think if you just look at my website, which is SharonSalsberg.com and Spellcheck is repeatedly trying to change Salisbury to be with a U, but it's not in my name. It's A-S-A-L-Z-B-E-R-G. And you'll see my schedule. I am, thus far, still teaching on Zoom, you know, and not in person. And they're, I feel very connected to people I'm with on Zoom. I don't feel distant and weird at this point at all. I don't know that I ever did. And so I have a whole variety of different things. I mean, for now, since the book is coming out in April 11th, there's a lot about expansion and contraction and how to deal with these beautiful monsters and stay living with more loving kindness and so on. And then as time goes on, you know, it's a lot of introduction to meditational kinds of things that, that I'm interested in. I'm gonna have to teach a class on getting older and facing death, I can tell from this conversation. It's time. And I'm, I'll be your first sign up. Sharon, thank you so much. It's a joy chatting with you. I'm so lucky that you keep coming on the show. Thank you. Thank you so much. And a big thank you to you for listening. I'll see you next week. Until then, Hare Krishna.

306^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 377: Sharon Salzberg Transcript and Discussion^2020-03-21^"We are family. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JCPenney. Family get-togethers to fancy occasions, wedding season two. We do it all in style. Dresses, suiting, and plenty of color to play with. Get fixed up with brands like Liz Claiborne, Worthington, Stafford, and Jay Farrar. Oh, and thereabouts for kids. Super cute and extra affordable. Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. You're listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour Podcast. This will all make sense when I am older. Someday I will see that this makes sense. One day when I'm old and wise, I'll think back and realize that these were all completely normal events. I'll have all the answers when I'm older. Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood. Someday when I'm old and wise, I'll grow up and realize that all of this ain't bad. It's good. Growing up means adapting. Puzzling out your world and your place. When I'm more mature, I'll feel totally secure. Freaking out and motherfucking quarantine. I'm going to run out of where to wait. See, that will all make sense when I am older. So there's no need to be terrified or tense. I'll just dream about a time when I'm in my age of crime. Because when you're older, absolutely everything makes sense. This is fine. Greetings to you, my quarantine kids and pandemic pals. It is your noble, faithful, muscular, powerful, masculine, beautiful, bearded host, D. Trussell, reporting in from a very secure compound in LA where we have been told to shelter in place. Suddenly we find ourselves in some kind of apocalyptic thriller. The news is non-different from every single disease slash zombie movie that I've ever seen. And the weird BDI politicians are getting real squirmy up there in a way that I've never really seen before. And if I wasn't someone who was actually in the movie, I think I would probably enjoy watching it. But the reality is I don't get to lean into my previous self-destructive mode of being because now I'm married with a one-year-old. So I don't get to get off on the possibility of dying or society falling apart or to lean into the stupid fantasy of being a survivor, wandering down the highway, gathering old bits of metal and trading them for ketamine that I bring back to my bunker. And I don't know why that's a fantasy, to live in a bunker with a big pile of ketamine. But if I didn't have a wife and a child, that's probably what I'd be doing right now. I'd be up to my neck in the k-hole, spinning around, pouring booze on the rising anxiety and, I don't know, playing God of War over again. But that's not, I don't get to do that now because we got to get milk for the baby. How weird is this? The buttons aren't working anymore. You press the button and they bring you the food. You want milk, you go to the store and there's milk and eggs. It's all gone. Every single person that I rolled my eyes at who had chickens, I don't know if y'all ever did that, but you know when your friends got chickens, you're like, what's going on, Grizzly Adams? What else you got around here? You're collecting rainwater, you're gonna do that too. Are you okay? You know, you leave the prepper's house and you're like, oh boy, what's wrong with them? They're eating too much weed. Now I'm trying to remember who the fuck had chickens that I know so I could contact them and see if they'd be willing to trade some eggs for some of the, I don't know, musical gear or something like that. No eggs, you can't bake, you know? We're okay. After one of the first creepy press conferences where Trump said he was putting Mike Pence in front of the pandemic and in charge of the pandemic, I ordered hundreds of dollars worth of food and then I told my wife and then she ordered a bunch of food and so we find ourselves fairly well supplied, but still some of this stuff, man, holy shit, we just don't have it right now. They're saying they might bring the National Garden to help stock grocery shelves here. You know, I don't know, it's a very bizarre situation we find ourselves in and I feel really lucky that I had this podcast on hand with Sharon Salzburg who is an author, a meditation teacher and exactly the sort of voice that I would wanna broadcast out into the world at the moment. Remember, we recorded this prior to this becoming a pandemic so if it seems as though we are ignoring the current reality, it's just this happened before this current reality was a reality, but nonetheless, I think you'll find there's many things that Sharon teaches that are very applicable to the present moment, specifically the idea of being kind and compassionate to yourself and to others and that compassion and kindness is like a muscle that we can develop that maybe you just don't start off as some kind of perfectly kind and compassionate being, but just like any other beautiful thing, it's something that you develop over time.

[""Welcome to the DTFH Sharon Salzburg""] [""Welcome to the DTFH Sharon Salzburg""] [""It's the Dunkin' Tristle, DTFH Sharon Salzburg""] Sharon, welcome back. It's so great to see you. It's great to see you. This is Loh Star. We're here on the Tibetan New Year and I already got to be at a Tibetan temple and now I get to be with you, who I consider one of the greatest Buddhist teachers around right now. Is it fair to say it's Buddhism that you teach? It's fair to say it. I mean, I don't often express it that way because I think it's sort of universal wisdom and I don't want like to be labeled. Right, I get it. Does that, sometimes I feel like kind of like people want you to compartmentalize yourself into something, don't they? Like they want you to say that or, yeah, I love that you're just saying, yeah, I'm not that. But then sometimes I feel like is, if I say I'm not that, does that mean I'm not committing enough to Buddhism or to some path? Because some people say, listen, you've got to like pick it and go for it and say that's what it is. Buddhism, Christianity, Islam. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, well, I mean, for me, I feel like I live kind of in a hyphenated reality. That's why people say jubus or hindus. Okay, I got you, yeah, I see. My first teacher was S. N. Goenka. I'd gone to India in 1970 and I began my first intensive 10 day retreat, January 7th, 1971. That's where I met Ramdas and Krishnadas and Joseph Goldstein, all kinds of people. And the first night of that retreat, Goenka said, the Buddha did not teach Buddhism. The Buddha taught a way of life. Wow. So that was like day one. Wow. And it just became like the foundation of my understanding. That's so cool. That's so true. He didn't know it would be, probably that's not even what they called it then. No, they don't call it Buddhism. We call it Buddhism. It was a Western notion, some hundreds of years after the Buddha. So they call it the Buddha's teaching or the Buddha's way or something like that. Wow, what a relief to hear that. I guess it's true with Christianity too. It wasn't Christianity at the time. There was a name for it. It was just some kind of way of being. That's right. That maybe it wasn't even that new necessarily. I mean, it's not like Buddhism didn't, this is also where I get a little confused about Buddhism is the concept that it predates the existence of Siddhartha Gautama. Like that, the thing that was coming out of him, it's not like it wasn't already there. Right, right. Yeah, I mean, that's true. It's like the word Dharma, which is usually translated as the Buddha's teaching or the way really means the laws of nature. So it's not like the Buddha made them up. Right. A new depth of understanding maybe or revelation and he expressed them. Well, to me, the implication of the pre-existence or the transcendental perennial philosophy sort of channel through people means that we live in a world where at some point a new Buddhism or a new thing without a name, maybe it exists in the world right now, could begin to be propagated. And that creates a situation of, I guess what would you call it, hopefulness? That at any given moment, the same epiphany that happens to the mythological or historic prophets could happen to a person. But it's something new, right? It's something that people haven't quite heard before in a certain way. But the difference is when these people in the past were talking about their epiphany, there was no internet, meaning that the transference of the data set will happen overnight. Do you ever think about that? Not really. But I mean, I think certainly it's true that we don't think of tradition as like a monument. It's like a river. It's always renewing and changing and being born again. Otherwise it's dead, right? And what was so important for people like me, 2600 years later, from the Buddhist realization is that he wasn't just describing a reality he glimpsed or even abided in, he had methods, he had a path where he said, I make human being because he's always talked about as having been a human being. I had some big questions about life, like why is it so hard and why do we suffer so much and why is there change and how do I cope with that? And it said that whatever answers he came to, he came to through the power of his own awareness and so can we, whatever our deepest questions are. And so the whole point is pointing back to you always. And that's not considered selfish or conceited. That's really the whole point. It's like we marginalize ourselves. We say, oh, it's great for the Buddha sitting under a tree 2600 years ago, but I live in LA. I'm busy, you know, I can't have any real understanding. And that's not true. The whole point is our own understanding. This to me is that's exactly, I think for a lot of people drives them to take these very expensive trips to different parts of the world in the hopes that they're going to run into this person or that person or see you, I don't know if it was expensive actually, I think it those days. It wasn't that expensive. But you took the classic trip to India and sure enough, you met a great teacher and you became a tremendous part of a community of seekers because of that. And so yeah, I hear what you're saying and I love the idea because, you know, I don't want to fly to India. I would like to teleport to India. I don't want to go live in a cave. I like the idea that my home is a temple, being a father is a teaching and that just where I'm at right now is the Bodhi tree. But then the other side of it goes, you had spiritual bypass. You're just afraid to take the big leap, the big jump. But you think so, the LA can be the very same as the forest that Siddhartha Gautama left the palace to go into with your work, your job. How could that be? I do really believe that I think it's a harder path actually to stay in LA than to go off to India. It wasn't expensive of course in those days, especially not the way we traveled. You were on, you took a charter ride. Overland, yeah, yeah. Sounds dangerous. Yeah, it was a little scary. But I do think it's the harder path because it takes a huge intentionality to make that real. It's one thing to say being a father is my path and it can be. And it's another thing when you've got a deadline and your kid doesn't scream. Oh, never. Actually, yeah, it's weird. I thought that was gonna happen, doesn't cry. He just laughs. Yeah, it's because he's not asleep to price. It's great. And I don't know if it was. And he screams. But you know, it's like, and you have a feel of this pressure and someone else is really anxious around you and you're picking that up. And it's like remembering in that moment, like, oh yeah, I have a commitment to kindness or I have a commitment to the present moment or look at this, everything changes. It's not easy, but it's possible. And what is easy is to just talk about it. Like I once had, I was teaching a class in New York and someone rather charmingly said to me, or not so charmingly said to me, a lot of younger meditation teachers than you say we don't have to do regular practice, like a formal dedicated period of practice. We can just be mindful, whatever we do, mindful stirring the rice, mindful washing dishes or whatever. So what do you say in like your donage? And I said, well, I think hypothetically that's true. For me, that would just be a story I tell. If I didn't have like a regular practice, it's like strength training or something. Let's make it real, you know, because when the rice is boiling over and the phone is ringing and this is happening and that's happening, it's not that easy. But if you've kind of steadily devoted some time to deepening awareness and compassion and things like that, it will be there for you. Right, so yeah, I mean, it would be a dream come true. If just by being around weight lifters, you could get in shape. That would be the best. All you would need is to be friends with someone who was in shape. You would need to run, you would need to exercise. That is something I really love about Buddhism is that, or whatever you wanna call it, is that there is an action involved, a kind of action, which some people say is meditation, some people say is meta, I guess, like working out your compassion muscle or something like that. I heard Chogyam Trump or Rinpoche say something that I'd love to ask you about in this regard. He was talking about the feeling of coming home from work. And he goes, people sit on the couch and they go, and it felt like when he was implying that you don't need to come home from work and sit on the couch to go, that actually that feeling is the feeling of being human, but it's being covered up by all the stress. Almost like he was saying enlightenment, is that am I misunderstanding him? Is there an implication that through this practice, every moment in traffic, in chaos, I could be getting that experience that I get right when I relax on the couch at the end of the day? No, and I think you're misunderstanding that. I think that's in a way the whole point. If not continuously there, then we know how to return to it when we're in traffic or whatever. Because now I'm thinking about what's in that moment of like, huh, it is authenticity, right? You're not putting on a show for anybody anymore. You're just being yourself, you're relaxing of course, and also it's a sense of almost like collecting yourself. We get so role identified, okay, now I've got to educate people or now I've got to do this or I've got to do that. And then it's just like, okay, I'm just being, I'm just me. So there's a lot in that moment. And I think certainly that sense of home can be something we have wherever we are. Role identified. Wow, what a mess that is, huh? That's an insidious trap, isn't it? You don't even realize you've become role identified until it's way too late. And then there you are trying to be the teacher or a dad or a husband or somebody doesn't want to be a dad or whatever it is. Role identified. That's almost blasphemy for some people to even imagine that the thing they are isn't just an identification. That's right, well, that's what, you know, when we meet people, that's what we say, right? What do you do? Yeah, what do you do? Oh, well, I'm a fireman or I do comedy. Well, I'm not sure if I do comedy, but I do podcasts, well, I don't know. And yeah, then imposter syndrome sets in. And then do you ever get that? Do you ever think to yourself, am I really a teacher? Yeah, I don't know that I get it so much anymore. Although, you know, there's a certain level it depends on who I'm thinking about as my own teachers where it does seem ludicrous. But, you know, when I started, I started teaching because one of my teachers told me to teach. So it was really the old fashioned way. Right. And I was completely disbelieving. I thought, that's ridiculous. I can't do that. This is a woman teacher, this woman named Deepa Ma who I was leaving India, this was 1974. And I was leaving for what I was convinced was a very short trip back to the States before I'd go back and spend the entire rest of my life in India. And I went to see her, she was living in Calcutta. I went to see her just to say goodbye and get her blessing for my very short trip home. And she said, when you go back, you'll be teaching. And I said, no, I won't. And she said, yes, you will. And I said, no, I won't. She said, yes, you will. I said, no, I won't. And then she said two things that were very mind blowing. She said, you really understand suffering. That's what you should teach. Cause I like many people that had a very tumultuous traumatic childhood and I never, certainly that's what drove me to India at such a young age but I never thought of it as a useful thing, you know, in terms of helping others. And then she said, you can do anything you want to do which you're thinking you can't do it. That's gonna hold you back. Wow. And I left her place. She lived in what we would call like a tenement room up on the fourth floor and I walked down that staircase thinking, no, I won't, that's ridiculous. I'm not gonna go teach. And I came back and life unfolded. And I went to visit Joseph Goldstein who I had met at my first retreat. He was, it was the first summer in Boulder that Naropa Institute was opening up, speaking of Trumpi Rinpoche. And Joseph was actually Romdus's TA. Joseph had run into Romdus in Berkeley and Romdus was on his way to Boulder and he was gonna teach this mega class of like a thousand people. And then he had these divisions like the chanting division and the meditation division. He asked Joseph if he wanted to teach the meditation one and Joseph said yes. So. Wow. Jack Winfield was living down the hall. That's where we met. Teaching a class of his own. And Joseph was so popular, he was invited to stay on for the second session and I stayed on with him. And then we got invited to teach a month on retreat. That whole time I thought I can't. First of all, I was terrified of public speaking. I mean, I couldn't give a talk at all. So that was a 30 day retreat, our first retreat. And the format of our retreats is that there's like one formal lecture like at night and Joseph had to do them all like for 30 nights. I couldn't do it. Was there a time where you were just backstage like I'm not going out there or you just told him I'm not gonna get in front of people. It's not happening. I was sitting in the back of the room. I mean, there was no backstage, you know, it's just us, you know, like. Sorry, I don't know why I thought you were at the Apollo or something like that. No, here's some. What was the green room like? Yeah, the green room, the snacks were extraordinary. That's a, because I've seen you speak and you're incredible. So that's so beautiful. Yeah, I couldn't do it. And like all these people would go up and yell at Joseph like, why don't you let her speak? Why don't you let her have a voice? And he would say, it's not my fault to talk to her, but I was terrified when I was scared of was that I'd be speaking and my mind would go blank. And I would just sit there and it looked like a fool. Yeah. And then I remember this was long before I did intensive loving kindness practice. There was that one practice that has a really nice guided meditation called loving kindness. And maybe I could talk about that topic because if my mind goes blank, maybe I can launch into the guided meditation and no one will know. Yeah. And so at home in Massachusetts, I have like piles and piles and piles of cassette tapes of me giving one talk because it's the only thing I can do. Let's talk about loving kindness. So wait, when you say one talk, you mean like the same beats. So like a standup routine, except for, wow. Oh, wow, that's so smart. That's one of my favorite Bill Hicks quotes. He's a great comic, you know, Bill Hicks, the comic. Sorry, I don't know, of course, I'm sorry. No, no, of course, I don't know. One of his quotes is, your jokes are safety parachutes for when your improv isn't working. And knowing that you have like a, now that is a very controversial thing to say because many comments would be like, yeah, right. Go look at like late Bill Hicks when he's all hammered on stage quote, improvising. It's terrible. There's nothing funny about it. You can like trick yourself, you know, but still for you, wow, that's so smart because you always have that to drop into you. That's your, there's certain comics where you know they're having a bad set because the joke, they have a joke that's designed to like life support their way out of like whatever terrible trap they got themselves into up there. That's so, so you started doing that and then you became repetitive with it a little bit. Yeah, quite a lot. And did you start feeling in that repetition that it's something like robotic or that this was not that you needed to evolve past? Just, no, it was all I could do really. But then one day I sort of had a realization. I thought, you know what? Cause loving kindness is about connection. That's its essence. And one day I realized they're all like about connection, all those talks, you know, it's like people aren't here gathered to hear me import my expertise. They want a sense of connection. So the kind of all loving kindness talks in a way. And that was when I could begin to speak. What's going on with us as humans that we don't see that? Why is that invisible? It seems just from some, like a, not that I'm clearly not an evolutionary biologist, but it seems to me a little bizarre that beings that are so deeply, deeply interconnected seem completely oblivious to that reality. Do you have any theories on that? Why are we blind to that? I don't know. I mean, I don't know the why, but it's certainly true and it's maybe getting worse. You know, like one of the things I keep reading about, which I find startling and amazing is, is this kind of epidemic of loneliness that more and more and more people are describing themselves as lonely and not just here in the state. So you think, wow, look at that because we are so intimately interconnected in truth. I'm going to be real honest with you. When you mentioned connection just then, I don't know that I had actually connected with you. And in that moment, I looked at you and thought, oh, Sharon, hi. Hi. And then this other thing happened. It was like dropping into something. It's, and so the epidemic of loneliness is, I didn't know about that, but it makes sense. Maybe, you know, maybe just because I remember the first time I saw you talk and you were talking about compassion, training to be compassionate. And I remember thinking to myself, what? You just, you can get better at that. You train at that. That's a thing you work out at. Similarly with connection, and maybe there isn't much of a difference between the two. Maybe people just don't even understand that you don't just instantly, it's not something that you can do just in the way that you can like fall asleep or something like that. That's right, that's right. Yeah, I mean, I think that's pretty controversial in the West. Maybe training is not even the right word, although it's the word I use, but people seem to think that something like compassion is something you either have or you don't have. And if you don't have it, you're out of luck. Maybe you didn't get enough as a kid or whatever, but it's too late. In the East, they would never think that because qualities like love and compassion and connection are considered emergent properties of how we pay attention. Like in that moment, when we're just here together and we're actually just together, that's a moment of real connection because we're paying attention to one another. I'm not thinking about what time it's gonna end because I've gotta do my laundry or something like that. And we're also not thinking, does he like me? I hope he likes me better than his last guest. I don't know who that was. I do. It was Brendan Walsh. I hope you're listening, Brendan. He's a friend of mine. He's a friend of mine. I'm joking. I mean, I'm not joking, but. Yeah, so that's why the word training comes in because we know you can train attention. That's what meditation practice is. And the belief is that if you train your attention, always other things will just blossom. You don't have to sit and think I'm a miserable, hating person and I have to get more loving. It doesn't matter what you think because you're putting the pieces in place. I love what you said about the idea that if you get to a certain age and you haven't achieved some ability to be a compassionate person, a good listener, someone who isn't selfish, all the qualities that are, we all applaud and look at it as like, oh, that's the idea of a good person. I love that like there is this idea that if someone's gotten to that point, they're like, well, we have names for them. Well, they're sociopaths. It's a narcissist. It's a soulless thing. You know, I got on, I don't know how it happened. Maybe I was just Googling narcissism, but I ended up on this terrible mailing, Ask Quora Narcissist mailing list where people, I would get updates anytime anyone wrote a horror story about an encounter with a narcissist. And at some point I began to feel really sorry for these narcissists because they're universally hated. And like just from the DSMR4 definition, they're like, it's like hating someone who has autism or something like that. But like they're irredeemable. There is this concept that like, oh, there's no way for them to ever not be concerned with themselves. They're like a black hole. They're a gravity well of ego identification. And therefore they should be, I don't know what, banished, pushed out of society. And there's all kinds of just forget the narcissist or sociopath. Just how many times have you been sitting, listening to people talk at a cafe? Just eavesdropping and they're talking about that person. Can you believe them? They're awful. Well, I cut them out of my life because the idea is, yeah, you're never gonna, they're never gonna come back. Wow, I love that. The idea that at any point in time, no matter how rancid you may be, there is an ability, if you wanted to, to connect. I really do believe that. Any one of us might have come from some really disconnected places, you know, and renewed or came back and returned in a way. Returned, yeah. Cause this is a, I mean, we're dealing with a country that's been at war for 93% of its history. We got so many people who are raising kids who have profound PTSD. PTSD manifests as, you know, some people's parents are walking defense mechanisms. And then the kids learn that. Many of us have learned that. And I'm afraid to say I learned it. And both my parents have passed away. And I'm still terrified to say, oh, you know, I learned to be. I became a master of numb. Like I can go so numb, so fast, ice cold, just glaciated human in moments. I used to be proud of that. I used to think that was a good quality that's in the world, like a superpower. Now I have a son. You can't go numb. You can't ice down in front of a toddler or a wife or anyone for that matter. But I think a lot of us are kind of like, well, that's all that's left. Well, you can't ice down or freeze in front of a toddler. Certainly, I think plenty of people have, which is why. A toddler, you know, grows up thinking that's the way to be. I mean, you're also remind me of something I wrote about in this book about the stress reaction and how people always used to say, fight or flight. And now they've added freeze. What? Yeah, so there's three common responses to incredible stress. And by incredible stress or responses, I mean, there's always stress of some kind, but when the resources we have within don't seem adequate to meet the stress that's coming our way, it's fight, flight, or freeze. And we're used to fight or flight. And freeze is now considered one of them. And I was really happy because I too am a type, you know, where I'm more likely to freeze than fight my way out or flee. And so I thought, oh, good, you know, I'm being included. But it's a huge pattern. Freeze. It doesn't, obviously it's not a literal freeze. That means numb down. It means just like drop out of wherever you're at. It's like disassociate, and it's better that way. There's an watershed down. They had a great name for when the rabbits see the headlights of a car. Thrall, I think is what they called it. Or they had a cool name for it, where they froze up with the headlights of the car coming. And yeah, but wow, so it almost is like this, this is not only if many of us just frozen, but we've sort of come up with an idea of like, well, this is just how it is to live. You sort of, you're here, you're not really here. And you just stay not here until you die. And then you're really not here anymore. And then that's a human life. Because for a lot of us, you know, growing up, what are you gonna do? Where are you gonna go? You're six. What are you gonna get in the car? You're gonna drive away? You're gonna find a job somewhere? There's no escape. So what are you gonna do? You definitely aren't gonna fight 190 pound human. So yeah, I get it. You just go to the ground, freeze up. And that's where we're at. Well, not you, but I think some of these frozen people, are they the ones saying that that's loneliness? Maybe they're not even lonely. Well, that's interesting. Is the definition of loneliness changing? Or does people just feel generally numb? That's very interesting. I'll really have to think about that. Maybe that's so. I mean, I've only thought about it in kind of sociological terms. Like the things that used to bring us together, like you went to a temple this morning. People don't often do that anymore, necessarily. Right. The classic book about it was called Bowling Alone, about the dissolution of bowling leagues. Ways we just used to come together and have a sense of community, they're not so prevalent anymore. For some people they are, of course, and other people are just dying, or they've died. So how are we gonna find each other? And we have to find each other. How are we gonna find each other? I mean, I think both of us have a, like I know sometimes, because I travel and do stand-up and I have to go out at night to do stand-up. And a lot of times I don't want, I am a recluse. If I can stay in, I stay in. I like it. And I recognize like, oh no, this is bad. If I look at it, it's like taking a shower. It's like socially going out is like taking a shower. If you don't do it long enough, you get a little stinky. But, I think for me, it's just like the anxiety, man. It's like being around people when you're out of practice is just deeply anxiety-provoking. Opening your heart to other people. This is why I don't do LSD. I used to, when I was younger, I would just like take acid, go to the mall, watch people. I can't do it anymore because it opens your heart. And you're around a person and all the, you just see the pain. And it comes wrecking balling into you. You're looking at a person you've never met in your life and seeing like, oh man, you're not doing good. I'm never gonna meet you. I certainly can't come up to you with my eyes completely dilated while you're at dinner with your family and be like, are you okay? But you see it, you know? So how do you cross that barrier? There's no way. I mean, we're so sequestered. I don't wanna bug anybody. I don't wanna bother anybody. I mean, literally people are laying on the street and we walk right by them. Much less passing someone with a frown on their face or who seems sad or upset. How do you even cross that boundary, Sharon? Well, I mean, for me, the most important state is the interstate. What you do externally will depend on the circumstance, you know? It's like you probably are not gonna walk up to every person lying on the street and say hello, you know? But it's the internal feeling of like that person's life has something to do with mine. That seems really critical and we don't have that either. No one wants to even hear that. What are you? A socialist? Are you a socialist, Sharon? Is that what you've come to? Socialism? No, because I'm not saying you have to give them money even, for example, but in our hearts, we have got to recognize this person as a person. It's easier to give them money. But it's easier to give them money. Well, I'm not saying it's an easy thing to do, but I think in terms of a genuine sense of connection, that's what's gotta happen. And by the way, when I was doing the R.U.S., whatever, Tucker Carlson interviewing Cheryl Sharon Salzburg or something, I was joking. You know, to me, I think it's like a wild thing that we even live in a world where the term socialism, which is the act of being social, is considered one of the great mistakes you can make. It's like getting a disease. It's like athletes' foot, politically, you're broken out with socialism. Wow, man, God, I'm itching today, man. I've got socialism all over my body. And this seems to really mirror what you're saying about loneliness. If we live in a country where socialism is considered abhorrent, then wouldn't loneliness be a natural result of that? I mean, social, we want to be around, it's social. It's like we're social animals. But the term socialism, which would be the practice of being a social animal, is forget it. You're not getting elected if you're a social animal. You know? Well, I'm also not running for office, thankfully enough. Well, maybe thankfully for you, but for the rest of us, we would love it if you would. But you know what I'm saying? It's like this is the country we're in is, and I'm not beating up on America or anything like that. I just know that a lot of people are watching Bernie Sanders, who is a socialist, and they're like, no, oh my God, no. So it feels like what you're saying is all the political isms and stuff is great, but first, you've got to dethaw a little bit, start making these connections. No, it's true. I mean, sometimes if I go into a company or an organization to teach, one of the questions I ask people to ponder is, how many other people need to be doing their job well for you to be able to do your job well? Because we feel like we're all alone, right? And it's a dog eat dog world, and no one's helping me, so I'm not gonna help anybody else. But what's the reality? You're counting on someone cleaning that room, right? Yeah. And you left it like a pigsty the night before, but you're counting on it, or that operating theater. You're counting on it being sterilized, and you're counting on, we all are, or the roads and the bridges and getting somewhere, getting to work. It's like we live in an interdependent universe, and we don't acknowledge that very often. So if we don't wake up to that, then we don't wanna contribute. Like why should I contribute to the roads, you know? Yeah. Things like that, and it's crazy, because there's not a way to survive that if it just goes on and on and on and on. It's completely unsustainable. I mean, you can't, forget the roads in my own house sometimes. If I'm in a particularly dark, selfish, compressed state, you know, I'll like leave like food on the counter. I won't even think about, you know, it's like, and then someone's cleaning it up, that's not me. And that does not work at all. Let me tell you, in a marriage, that does not work at all. Oh, if only it did. It doesn't work, but much less in a society. But it almost feels like we've all been trained. Since, you know, we could watch TV at the very least to like not think about who's fixing the roads, to not think about who's cleaning our room, to not think about the person that you are just a jerk to at wherever you are buying the thing is going home that night to take care of their, sister and parents. That's right. You're, no one's saying this stuff. I mean, I love conspiracy theories. I could talk about hollow earth all day long. But if you want to, it's for a different podcast, but if you want to talk about the grand conspiracy, it's that to me. Why is this not taught in school? Just a basic thing. Oh, you know, the janitor, guess what? He feels. Yeah. He has to buy money to eat. No one wants to even, what is that? Well, it's like, is that suppressed data? Is that, or is that some kind of like dark, Jungian, like, or like a, a Gestalt that's springing up out of like the way we're running society right now that there's an implicit censorship. The moment you start saying, you know, you're, there's someone who's going to wash your dishes after you eat today. People are like, shut up, social justice warrior. I'm trying to enjoy my pie by people. I mean, me, I don't want to hear it. It's annoying. Is it, what is, is it conspiratorial? You're, you have a new book coming out about this very thing. And when you told me about this book, I thought, oh boy, I don't know, man, that's, that's want to dive into that. Is really courageous and tricky. Yeah. Maybe. I mean, the book is about mindfulness, loving kindness and social change. And I include, by the way, art as a means of social change. So I have a lot of interviews basically with playwrights and artists of different kinds, as well as striking fast food workers, you know, trying to get minimum wage extended to $15 an hour. And people doing all kinds of work, immigration attorneys. And I have made a strong connection with the Parkland community in the last couple of years. So I have a few students and teachers. I've taught there and I've led retreats for that community. And so there are all kinds of people in the book, which makes me very happy, you know. And they are really heroes, all of them. And they're not the super famous people that we might know about. And I just think they're terrific. And it's about things like interconnection. Like what's, it's a few things. One is like a vision of agency. I'm not going to just sit around and bemoan how the world is so terrible when I'm on Twitter. You know, I'm going to like do something, even if it seems like a small thing. Wait, you mean rather than just like throwing out tweets. Yeah. Or something a little bit more. Yeah. Than typing into your computer. That's right. Going that extra stack. Yeah, a little bit extra. So Instagram. Could be. And then it's about, because I think we also live in a time where people are very impacted and feel often helpless. And so that idea of agency is really important. And I talk about, I have a chapter on moving from anger to courage and a chapter on moving from grief to resilience and chapter on interconnection, the chapter on. Can we talk about the anger to courage chapter? Cause this is, you know, like I, yeah. I think a lot of people are just pissed off in the most, in terror and terrifying ways and in extreme ways. And, you know, it's not, even talking about activism now is considered, maybe you don't even talk about it. You know, like it's annoying. We just stop. There's nothing that can be done. And then this like deep anger is building. This is why we have democracy. They're supposed to, it's supposed to steam pressure valve that anger. So we don't have like violent revolutions. So how do you convert anger into courage? Cause the real problem is anytime anyone really angry starts lecturing us, even if they're right. A lot of us are like, I don't want to hear it. I don't want to get lectured. You're so mad. I have jokes that I do that I've learned that if I do them with even the slightest hint of anger behind it, they don't work because people feel like I'm like preaching up there and it sucks. But if there's like real love behind it, the joke was funny and it's, my friend calls it the spirit of play. So how do you do this conversion? This, I would love to learn this alchemy. Okay. Well, there's also a chapter on joy, remembering joy because there are lots of reasons we get lost in anger. And that's one of them. And you mean lack of joy? Yeah, or lack of appreciation of joy. It's like the small things that seem great. We disregard because we have it too guilty or we're too consumed with outrage or something like that. And then we get depleted, you know, we can't go on. And I also think, you know, activism doesn't just mean like protesting. That's why I include art. And I also include a person-to-person change in relationship. Oh, okay. You know, it's not just vast social systems. It's like, it's basically an expression of our deepest values. Oh, okay. Wow. Okay, right. Well, it's sure easier to think about the, you know, grand social scheme than to just think about the fact that you haven't opened up to your wife about the way you feel for a little bit. We just did that. We were not, we were like, it was rough. We went through a rough patch. And then one, a few days ago, we were just laying in bed and we both just started telling each other how we felt, the truth. And now it's the best. It was amazing. Like it was just, we, and all the things that we were afraid to, we were both like, I feel that too. I feel that too. It was amazing. But I've never, never would I have thought that was social change. Yeah, well, I'll call it social change. Yeah. Wow. It makes it so much more manageable. Cause I always just think of like, man, that Gandhi movie. When I think of social change, I think of that Gandhi movie where they didn't even use an Indian to play Gandhi. Right. But aside from that, just, you know, the marches. Is he half Indian? Oh, is he? I think Ben Kingsley is. Good God. Hold on, that's getting, hold on. You have to Google it. No, I can cut that out. So I don't look like the biggest idiot on earth. I'm not cutting it out. I'm leaving it. What do I care? Anyway, sorry, Ben Kingsley. I know you listen to this podcast quite regularly. We're all good friends. Taught him how to act, actually. The, yeah, in my mind, it's a big thing. Big, big, big. So big that I just don't have the even slightest ability to, you know, to, I just can't imagine doing anything like that, like really making the big waves like Gandhi or Martin Luther King or Greta Thornberg, all those people, you know, you're just like, oh, that's, that's out there. But this thing that you're talking about, that's one of the most empowering things I've ever heard maybe, which is like, oh, right, of course. It could just be like, is this, could even be walking the dogs more? Whoa. I think that's part of it. And for some people, of course, that's their arena, you know, like, could Martin Luther King Jr. have done something else? I doubt it, you know, that was just his, his space. Right, that's his karma where he landed. And also, I'm not sure things at home were that great for him sometimes. It seems like there was some trouble. Well, apparently there weren't, yeah. So that to me is, that I can get behind. Because it's, for one, it's not even, there's no politics to finding harmony where you live. That's not a political situation. That's just common sense. And the idea that also by doing that, you're simultaneously in some, I guess, infinitesimally small way, a little droplet of peace in the world. Now that, wow, that's so beautiful. And like, I've heard versions of it, but that, that one really sunk in. Wow, that's cool, Sharon. I really liked that. It's so good. And you're clearly a great parent, you know, and it's coming from somewhere, right? Well, I mean, I don't know if I'm a great parent. I'll be honest with you. I want to be a great parent. Like, I have that intention in me. But I don't, you know, from hanging out with you and Ramdas and by hanging out, I mean, being able to listen to you teach and read your books, I feel like my wife and I, well, the advantage we've got is that we can have that moment where we really open up to each other. And we, you know, well, but my wife and I did not come from a place where we should be, where we know how to do marriage or know how to do, you know, do that, do that. Cause no, I mean, my mom was divorced and remarried three times. And, you know, I know, knowing most people I know are divorced, you know, it's not like how it's like compassion. Yeah. Like how do you just know how to be married? Yeah. Yeah. It's almost impossible, you know? And it's very, it's difficult to live with anybody. Then at a child, you know, here's an example. We went yesterday to walk the baby around the park and his wagon. And it was a beautiful day. And it's great. Cause we're all, we're getting along now. It's really sweet. Everything's real poignant and sweet. It's the spring, the baby loves the wagon, but he's hungry. So we go to get something to eat. And I made the wretched mistake of being like, why don't we just stop at this Thai food place? You don't give a baby Thai food. Yes. But Aaron, we looked on the menu like there's something there for me. Anyway, the point is the beautiful day suddenly turns into the child having an allergic reaction to peanuts, we think. Face turned red, he's coughing, we're seconds away from calling 911. So how do you learn to deal with that level of instantaneous shift into, oh, what a beautiful day to, oh my God, am I going to lose the greatest love I've ever experienced in my life over peanut sauce? You know, this creates a lot of stress on top of just living with another human being. And so to me, like imagining that the ability to harmonize those situations in a way that is, at least has the intention of love is actually social work. Yeah. Is actually helping society in some way. I can't tell you how I'm invigorating an idea that. Oh, I'm so happy. Yeah, no, I really do believe it, you know, that it's funny whenever it says something to me like I'm allergic to shellfish or I'm allergic to strawberries. They say, how did you find out? Cause it's got to be a bad story, right? Like I hit a shrimp and I passed out. It's got to be a bad story. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, there's that level to it. You know, like maybe it's good, you're discovering that. This is something that. Oh, right, you're right. Well, yeah, you know, we, that's right. We, you know, that's one thing for sure. It's like, now we kind of know something. Also, you know, after the baby was fine, everything was fine, but I was thinking like, how many babies right now aren't fine? Like how many kids are like having to go to the ER right now? Cause of, you know, cause of this situation, but this to me, there's like a, you know, I would never in a million years wanna be a messiah, a Buddha, a Jesus. I would for a day, maybe it'd be fun to wander around for a day being like that level of a being. But I think over time I would just be like, I wanna go play video games, have a beer and like, you know, I don't know, hate watch Sean Hannity or something. You know, I wouldn't want that life. But the idea of being a pixel, a little tiny part of an enlightened being in like a movement in society that didn't hinge on saving the ice caps or lowering fossil fuel emissions but was more based on, can you figure out a way to be with the people you're with right now that have caused you so much trouble or that you've caused them so much trouble in a whole new way? I think it's impossible for sometimes though. Don't you think it's impossible? Like some situations seem untenable, you know, horrific, you know, no way out. Like just what we were saying earlier about, the whole of society depends on a collapse of the circumference of our awareness of the suffering of other sentient beings. What you're proposing is a really sweet way of saying we have to have some kind of revolution. I think it's rather sweet, isn't it? Because it is like a revolution of consciousness. And, you know, I mean, I think it's also, it's not impossible. I mean, there's some situations that may be impossible, but I think the freedom of heart to really care about somebody and include them doesn't mean you're gonna stay living with them or you're gonna hang out with them or you're gonna not fight their agenda, you know? We have that notion that love is a kind of passivity or something and it's really not so. So I'm not saying like every relationship needs to be, you know, endured or something like that. But inside, within ourselves, we can be free. We don't have to have other people define us. We don't have to believe utterly their story about us. We don't have to be lost in projection. We don't have to have a feeling that because things were a certain way yesterday, inevitably definitely there will be that way today. If we are awake, you know, certainly we can be different. And if a situation is actually, doesn't seem amenable to change and it's terribly painful and it's limiting us and making our lives smaller or frightened, it's fine to go. That doesn't mean that you have no love in your heart. Right. It can be done lovingly. Yeah. It doesn't have to be done in some dramatic, dark, you know, vengeful way. There's a loving way to revolt. Yeah. Loving revolution. I just, only because I love you and I feel comfortable with you, I like that idea, but I have to say, and I want that to be the way. But it's like, isn't that a pipe dream? Look at France, the firefighters setting themselves on fire while the police attack them because of pension. Look at all the revolutions that happen all over the world. And now in mass, as people begin to really wake up to the reality of the distribution of wealth, how do we do this peacefully? How do we do it lovingly? And also, are you saying that there's a possibility for loving violence? You're acting violently out of a place of love. Yes. I mean, I think it's talking about pipe dreams. It's like, certainly, there's the idea of forceful action. We know that such a thing is tough love, right? Yes. We know that such a thing is fierce compassion. You may, first of all, you're working toward having compassion for yourself as well as for somebody else. It's not just all one direction. And in that balance, which is hard to find, you may decide you need strong boundaries, you need to be intense, you need to be fierce. You need to take strong action. I think when you say, is there such a thing as loving violence, there's every possibility of deluding ourselves. There's a story that actually happened to me when I was living in India way back when, that I've heard like 50 other versions of, as though they happened to other people. And I was with a friend and we'd left Bud Guy, which is a very peaceful, holy place. To go to Calcutta and coming back from Calcutta to get to the train station in Calcutta, there's something happening on the street, like a riot or something like that. We couldn't get a car, we couldn't get a cab. So we got into a rickshaw and in Calcutta, in those days, I don't know about now, rickshaws were not like men on bicycles, they were men running and pulling the spark. Oh yeah. So we got into one of those, because it was the only way we could get to the train station. So he's going down these back roads and these alleyways and things like that. And at one point, this very large, very drunken man comes out of the shadows and grabs him, stops him and pulls at me, like to pull me off the rickshaw. And I thought, oh my God, I'm gonna be raped, I'm gonna be killed, this is the end. And then the friend that I was with managed to push him away and get the rickshaw guy to start running again. So we got to the train station, got on the train, got to Budgaya and I was very shaken still. And I said to one of my teachers, this man named Menindra, I told him what had happened. And he said, oh Sharon, with all the loving kindness in your heart, you should have taken your umbrella and hit that man over the head. Yeah. Which is basically saying, you know, be strong. Like, and yet we can think we have all the loving kindness in our hearts and not. And so it's very tricky terrain. I just, I don't think about it in those terms because it's too tricky, but I do think about strength, strong action and that a loving space doesn't have to lead to meekness and, you know. Wow, this is, you know, this is one of the, I'm so glad we're talking about this because I think it's one, it is the trickiest of terrains. It's how easy to trick yourself into imagining that your aggression and violence had some spiritual intent behind it and therefore it was justified. How simple to imagine that. But, and I guess this is just a discernment, a subjective discernment. You have to figure that out on your own. Yeah. I mean, because you know when you're in love. You know when you're loving. Yeah. Right? Don't you just know, can you trick yourself? But then that being said, think of how many people, I'm asking you, how many people trick themselves into thinking they're feeling love when they, they aren't. But is it a feeling? You know, is love a feeling? I'm sorry, you're blowing my mind here. So I'm just trying to like decode what you're saying, imagining lovingly hitting someone with an umbrella. I think it could be done. Yeah. I've been to dominatrixes now that I think of it. I'm sorry. Well, there's that too. I mean, this is the modern world. We're not talking about like some quaint little Indian village. Yeah. But the reason I'm asking you this is because in my own, you know, in my mind sometimes, when I look at the world and I see what's happening, I get real nervous thinking, I don't know if protests are gonna be enough ultimately. Right now, things are great for some people, but they sure ain't great for most people. And they, people are getting mad. And then that gets me really creeped out because the last thing I want my child to experience is a violent revolution, the collapse of society, the fragmentation of society because of, you know, whatever inequality on such an overt massive level and then the, you know, so that it's just, I think one of the things all of us should be kicking around in our mind is what does that look like? What would it look like for us to somehow simultaneously harmonize a loving intention with a forceful, That's right. No. Cause I get anxious too. I mean, I can imagine things degenerating to the point where violence is inevitable. And I think that would be dreadful clearly. And so I would like to see people engage, engage as much as we can right now because we can be awfully complacent and wait for the worst in a way. And why do that? Like I am very passionate about people voting, not everybody is. And I've gotten slammed for that too, you know, but I think it's, in a way, it's like the closest thing in a social political system to the Buddha saying everybody has innate dignity. Everybody has a worth. Everybody has a voice in other words. And we need to exercise that and we need to protect that and see if we can protect it for as many people as we can. And people need to do it. You know, you can't like just complain. You know, everything has to move in the direction of it's not right, you know, things aren't right when people are hurting so badly. And we've got to each do something about it. And it will look differently for everybody, which is why I include art, for example, and creativity and things like that. But however it looks, I think we need that ignited. Can we just, it's an hour and I know you got a dinner, but just very quickly, I would, when is your dinner, by the way? At 5.30. What time is it now? In a quarter after four. Okay. That's okay. No, we can definitely do whatever we want to. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So, creativity, you're one of, honestly, you've got to be one of the most prolific people I know. You've written so many books. You're always speaking. You're always doing retreats. And how are you finding the inspiration and the discipline? Like, where's it coming from? When are you writing? Do you write every day? Well, I just turned in the final final edit. Oh, no, I just got some back today. I thought I turned in the final final edits of my next book last Wednesday. I did just get a few queries back today that I had to answer. And so now it's done. I think it's in. I have learned that, you know, I usually sign a book contract, but I get booked in teaching so far ahead of time that I'm then scrambling to find time to write. And I've learned that doesn't really work as well as just doing what sensible people do, which is not traveling so much when you have a book and being more present. I do kind of write every day. Do you have a practice around writing? Most of my practices is based on sitting, meditation, and then writing, for example, because what I found like, I wrote this book called Faith, which was really like my faith journey. So it was very personal. And I found that the best writing I did was two times a day. One was when I first woke up in the morning. It's like the sensor had not woken up yet. And the other was just after I meditated because I don't sit down and think how, my biggest weakness in writing is structure, which is really relationship. How does this relate to that? Because it all relates in my mind. And so the editorial criticism I received right from the beginning was, how'd you get from here to there? I just went, I don't know. But when I sit, and I'm not trying to figure out how does this relate to that, but I'm just creating some space and it's open. And it's a space where a lot of possibilities can emerge. And that's when structure comes to me though. This relates to this in this way. Okay. So when you're sitting, you don't feel like, you know, because sometimes when I'm sitting, I'll have moments of inspiration. I'm like, oh, that's a funny joke or that. And then I think, what are you doing? You're meditating right now. This isn't a place to be contemplating what your next podcast is gonna be about or what you're gonna say. You should both, you should be quiet and let that float on. So it's okay. It's okay, of course it's okay. But you know, I try not to deliberate on it and like elaborate it and figure it because then I'm thinking about India or something, you know, before I know it. But it's like, I almost have a compartment I feel in my brain where I just say, remember that. And I remember it. Some people actually keep a pad of paper near them and they'll just write down that idea. But I don't like to do that because I figured I'll just spend all the time writing, you know, knowing me. So. This is, oh my God. This is such a cool thing to hear. It's so funny how, David Nickton and I worked together with meditation. He has taught me a lot. And before I started sitting with him, I thought you had to be in pain. Like you load his position back, but you know, like there was an agony that needed to be there. And also don't move. Like stay completely stone cold still, like you're being stalked or something. So my meditation, which I didn't do that much was essentially like the most ridiculous, contorted, frozen, paralyzed thing. And I remember when he told me, you can, you can, if you have an itch, you can itch it. If you need to adjust, you could adjust, but the pad, whoa. Now that's revolutionary. But if it's too much, then try what I do, which is just like mentally put it in a place where you're going to file it in effect and then go on. I get the feeling I've smoked more weed than you have to show you. Very possible. I'm a child of the 60s though. I didn't want to say that. I went to college in 1968. That compartment you're talking about in my brain is like a collapsed mine. I think the pad would be maybe the pad. P.S., no offense marijuana friends out there. You know what I'm saying though. I know it's not fashionable to say maybe it affects our memory. I've done other drugs too. I also fell off my bike when I was a kid. Anyway, the point is the pad sounds amazing, but I feel like we should close on, not just talking about your process, but in your book, the idea that your art, your writing, your comedy, whatever particular mode of creative expression, it might be a little bit more important than you think it is as far as our planet goes. Well, I think it's crucially important. And one of the things that I went into, because I do have this whole section on accepting joy, and it's hard when you're aware, you're concerned. I mean, you keep bringing up other people's children. When you're aware of how hard things can be, it's very hard to accept the joy, but we need a sense of renewal. We need some peace. We need a break so we can then marshal some energy and try to make a difference. And so I've really long been fascinated by the question of that in art, because I've always been asked, like I've had painters say to me, I don't know if I want to meditate because I'll lose my ability to make art, which has to come from this anguish inside of me. And that's a very Western notion of where great art comes from. So I talk in the book about this panel I saw once at Emory University with the Dalai Lama, and it was actually Alice Walker and Richard Gere on the panel, and that was the first question. Like, does an art have to come from great suffering? And Alice Walker said she once believed that. That's sort of what she was taught, but she felt that she got happier. Her art was getting better. And Richard Gere talked about being like an angry young man. And then the Dalai Lama was so interesting. He said, basically, people are always taking me to look at things and say, isn't that beautiful? And he said, in the Tibetan view, a work of art has worth depending on what happened to the artist in the act of creating it. So if an artist got more enlightened or kinder or more balanced as they created, more aware as they created the work of art, that made it great art. Wow. That's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Wow. You have got me tearing up over that. That's beautiful. I'm so happy. That's the metric. Yeah. Worth torturing ourselves over here because the metric is how much money did you make? Or was it, did it get out? Or how many, how many? That's right. Wow. The metric isn't even, did it like bring world peace or did it create social change out in the world? It's, how are you? That's right. When you finish? That's right. Wow. Well, if the Dalai Lama is correct, then this was a very good podcast. Cause that's like, thank you for that. Yeah, well thank you. I can't wait to read your book. Yeah, thank you. When's it coming up? June 2nd. June 2nd. It's right around the corner. Yeah. Yeah, it's already available for pre-sale, which is remarkable. And friends, please. I don't mean to go all telethon here. I'm just, my eyes are now watering from what I just heard, which is my mind is blown. So I'm going to, I got some, I'm going to do a telethon. It actually helps a lot if you do pre-sale. I've heard. Yeah, it does. Do the pre-sale. Obviously, this is a book you should read. I'm going to be reading it. Go, just go do it right now for Sharon, because I'm sure you get a litany of podcast requests every day and thank you so much for giving me your time today. I'm so delighted to see you.

307^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 330: Jason Louv Transcript and Discussion^2019-03-16^If you've been daydreaming about a beach vacation, here's a reality check. Wilmington, North Carolina and beaches offers an island escape that's closer than you think. Enjoy three spacious island beaches and explore state parks, or stroll along a charming river front and live it up in our historic downtown. Do both and make the most of your next getaway at TravelWilmington.com. Greetings friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the sound of a glistening sea scorpion ovary that was plucked out of one of the cremated sea scorpions they've been finding down there in the San Andreas Trench. It was given to me by my friend Gregor Paulson, who works at the Center for Nautical Occult Studies in Pasadena. And he explained to me that the sound of the pulsating sea scorpions ovary as the capability not only to drive out the embarrassing personality patterns you picked up from your lamest friends when you were in elementary school, but it also guarantees five days of pure secreticity and deep-level mind miracles. And more than likely, five broad-scale level epiphanies. So I'm just going to play it for you for a moment and lead you through a guided meditation that he said to me. Sit back and relax. If you have oil, now would be a wonderful time to rub it into your nipples and your taint. Stretch your hair and feet back and do a lower crux position if you're into yoga. If not, just relax. If you're driving, put your hands on your shoulders, close your eyes. And if you're not driving, keep your eyes open and your hands on the wheel. Now imagine with every outbreath, a spraying black blast of liquefied, shame molecules is barfing out of your mouth and being inhaled by golden, angelic beings with ruby eyes and flowing hair. Now, in your mind's eye, envision your lamest friend from elementary school. Maybe it's the bully you befriended, so he would stop hitting you. Or maybe it was just a crass weirdo who you thought was cool because she wore sunglasses and lipstick and high heels when she was eight. Think of the way you thought he was cool because he could draw vaginas on napkins. And you didn't know what they looked like. Think of the way he casually recommended smoking as an alternative to exercise and the way his breath smelled like the undergunt of a festering pig carcass in some cursed land. Now, watch as all the weird, lazy patterns and ideas you picked up from an eight-year-old but still adhere to to this very day blow out of your lips in wonderful arcing sprays of curiously horrible vomit droplets. Behold as the angels breathe them in. Now, envision a sea scorpion, its obsidian carapace, its 17 eyes of emerald and its deadly tail piercing these angels, paralyzing them with its horrific venom. And watch as it slices and dices these beings into light shards that drift away in the winds of oblivion. Know that now you are completely free. Know that now you will be guaranteed rebirth in the eternal land of flowers known as Amanita Gorlo. There you go, guys. Amanita Gorlo, the classic land. You're free and that behavior pattern is gone. You have been liberated. We've got a great podcast for you today. Jason Louvre is here. We're going to jump right into that. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the matrons of pleasure over at Purple. Do you have a hard time falling asleep at night or staying asleep?

Jason welcome back to the d-t-f-h we're just going to pick up this conversation that we were having before I pressed record to get y'all up to speed. One of my favorite websites is the cia website and the freedom of information act stuff in particular and in particular they have just I don't know maybe a gigabyte I'm not sure the exact amount of data related to remote viewing yes remote viewing what's it's called and also the name of it was operation stargate operation stargate it's so funny we've been having this very you know very uh a human conversation for the last you know three hours and then as soon as the mics are on it's like cia operation stargate hold on let me check and make sure it's working hold on maybe maybe just like wave at me if i've started drifting or something with the mic operation stargate oh i gotta how's it going duckin i don't mean to ramp up right away but why wait oh man um operation stargate you were you were talking about so we were kind of talking about the concept of telepathy yeah how does it work does it work is it real jason said i wish i knew how to do it and i said i think i in a ridiculous way i'm like i think i do know how to do it i don't really let me let me caveat that because i definitely know how to do it i just don't on purpose because i don't want to know what people are thinking it's rude well also like you know it's like you really want to see all that no but um no it's like the psychic equivalent of like up skirt cameras you know what i mean like unless you're doing it out of a like and i think when you get into kind of like a guru disciple teacher student relationship where there is a implicit trust where you are like sort of allowing yourself to enter into that model of training with someone yeah but that's such a high level of human that's such a high level of human or interaction that's not something that people should be trying to cultivate as like something they can do you know but yeah we were talking about the concept of the third mind which is a william burrows williams burrows and brian geisen have this concept it's it's beautiful right it's the idea that and they applied it to their artistic collaboration when they were working on writing and poetry and inventing the cut-up process and all of that the cut-up process go ahead well i'll escape at it when you finish and um you know of course so so obviously you know genesis purge was my primary magical teacher and burrows and geisen were gen's teachers so this is my lineage and all of that if we want to make it you know put it like that but i think it was geisen's idea primarily the third mind it's this simple it's when you have two people collaborating like we were just playing music right so for instance people two people are deep in the creative process together a third mind emerges that seems to be independent of either person that's kind of like the overlap with the venn diagram but it seems to be autonomous or like its own intelligence yes that begins to become a partner in the creative process or is just the greater of the parts and obviously the same happens in groups you know larger groups it happens in magical groups it's called an agrigore and it happens with large groups it happens with whole nations cities you know social clubs you know obviously this is the gestalt i think that's a pretty good way to you know that's another good way to look at it um but you know like trump rallies like what's that group mind you know it's fraying now at this point happy brilliant peace loving peace loving forward looking yes what is that group mind uh neophilic you know the concept of neo robert anton wilson's concept neophilia versus neophobia people who are either uh afraid of or or or love new ideas and new things oh that's hilarious neo we've been in a very neophobic period right but um so yeah this group mind so like that i like whenever i've thought about it and since i have experienced that i won't go into great detail here sorry you guys but i have experienced it uh in the sense i've been around people who can do it in a way that isn't confirmation bias style in the way like there seem to be just plucking stuff right out of your mind that you're thinking or they're telling you something that you wrote down you know without even like you saying well i wrote something and put in an envelope but literally they just start saying a thing and it's something that you are like google searching writing down and that made me think oh i get it there must be some kind of like imprint floating in the space between us that you are you know picking up on maybe you're not even aware you're picking up on it maybe you're just sort of so in the moment that the sort of um i guess you could say orbiting thought imprints from your day are just triggering the other person like a player piano or something spitting it out which is why sometimes when you walk by a person who is out on the streets totally fucking high as a kite i don't know if you've noticed this but sometimes they'll say shit to you oh yeah all the time yeah that's a classic right yeah and here's that i think this is actually very very simple right and you know as i as i've gone you know we've talked about this a bit in our private conversations like the more that i um you know i've spent my entire life delved into this world and and the more that i go on the more normal it seems and what i mean by that is i think this is actually very very simply explained and people put all these complicated freaking convoluted explanations on these things it's just that mind is a shared space right it's that simple and you think about it it's like we're all breathing the same air like why is the idea that your mind is separately yours like that's maybe that's the issue that's the neurosis you know it was developed you know particularly if you look at our culture if you look at industrialization and white-scale alcohol abuse and it's like maybe the delusion that you're separate and that your mind is somehow private maybe that's the delusion rather than this very like i think straightforward idea that we're all sharing a mental space like we're all you know it's like i tend to think of people's individualities in their minds as like you know the obvious metaphor would be like you know nodes on the internet or your own personal that's your pc but you're uplinked to the internet which is shared by everyone right and a classic example anyone who's creative can tell you whether they're a writer or an artist or a musician will tell you or even if they're not they just have somebody might have an idea to do something i had a great idea for a movie and then two weeks later you see the you know somebody else has come out with or songs somebody else has come out with the same song or has written the same book you know i've had so many ideas for things that i've then seen become movies and then the question is like oh like you know then the question is well how do you interpret it do you interpret it as like that person stole that from my mind and then people had to do that and it's like a schizoid response or i think a healthier response is just well that idea was out there and some people are better at picking it up faster and i think people who are great artists are just better at picking up on these things and develop the talent to actualize them faster so you know like we've talked about here's i i really want to like deflate a lot of this right like in our culture you know since i started i wrote my first book on magic in 2004 yeah 2003 i got the book contract to do it and i went all over the world learning magic from every culture i could and you know i was trained as a napoli shaman i went up in the mountains and learned from them i learned yoga in the himalayas i learned buddhism i learned sufiism like all this stuff right hermetic magic chaos magic nlp like you name it i learned it i went through it right and to the point where it just was second all of this stuff was second nature to me by by my mid 20s and and it was crazy because when i first started doing this it was like nobody no you know nobody was interested in this stuff now that's changed everyone's interested in this now you know which i would like to think it's partly because of you know what i put out there on my work for sure but i think it's also the cultural trend and even in my first book what i said you know my prediction that i made in my first book in generation hex is this is going to be the next big youth culture and lo and behold that came true right but at the time i knew five people who were into it right um and um so but here's the great irony right or not irony but here's here's the great mystery is all of this stuff is native and normal to human beings everything you're describing like you know everything that we consider quote unquote paranormal right whether that's telepathy or and we have all these very fancy words for them you know like telepathy dreams precognitive dreams um you know uh sending out you know for lack of a better word vibes into the world and then bring back something to you that match that what you wished for yeah all of this stuff you know like we could list all this stuff like this stuff is not a big deal it's native to human beings and the only difference is that our culture has pathologized it and cut it off in the same way that we pathologized for instance uh you know throughout the victorian period in the early part of the ninth 20th century in the same way that we pathologized sex and said no we do that out of sight right or or particularly now death is a great taboo you know we make death out of sight in america you never see dead people you know it's it's like it's no one wants to see it's out of sight out of mind where if you go to india there's dead people everywhere everywhere you know so um you know our culture just has these hang ups and neuroses about certain things and we can talk about why that is well it's kind of like um it makes me think of when i'm watching parkour videos okay and you see this you look at someone you're like wait they have the same body that i have and they're fucking jumping across rooftops climbing up walls like monkeys they're they're uh you know i don't know if you've seen any of these russian parkour geniuses but you look at this shit and you're like how are you not dead they're doing this insane shit now that being said i guess they might not show their outtakes or whatever where they're smashing into walls but any kind of i think this is why we love sports because it's not just the game it's the fact that you're looking at people who've achieved peak physical expertise and it shows you this is what the exact same kind of robot that you are can do while you're sitting on your couch right contemplating whether or not you are too stoned to get up to get more chips this is why people love athletes and great musicians it's like because they show what's possible that right you know yeah but this thing that we're talking about the reason it's a little different from this is because we don't have any kind of data that shows that this is even real in the sense that you know most people think it's absolute hogwash i know i don't know we don't yeah it's and and you know to be honest with you like there are some people who are into the stuff we spend all their time like looking at studies and psychic research and stuff like that it's like for me it's like i don't care you know it's like it for me like and i think i've said this before on your podcast magic and spirituality whatever we want to call it is all about the subjective experience of being human it falls into the same realm as what does love feel like what makes art great it's immeasurable and at the same time in terms of data and all that it's like i guarantee you everybody you know has some story about i was thinking about somebody and they called sure right or i had a dream and then it came true and the hilarious thing is often people who are the most quote unquote normie they usually have the craziest stories because people who are actively seeking it tend to push it away by they're trying too hard but we remember the hits i don't mean to i'm gonna play the part of the skeptic which i'm not but it's like where where it's like sports we have video of people doing the craziest shit whole in one or insane like you know insane shots the last second in basketball or whatever the fuck like baseball players breaking world records every year but with this kind of thing the nature of it is that it's really difficult to record and so you all you have is mostly anecdotal evidence and largely impossible to repeat right which automatically brings it outside of the realm of scientific investigation that's it so you end up this is where you sort of but it's in the same way of like you know can you can you exactly repeat a comedy set on demand like have you ever repeated the same set even if you wanted to could you repeat a set even if it's the same material well i mean no you can't repeat this set because the set is you know not just the words you're saying it's dependent on the group mind that you're you know saying the words within and that that's always going to change but hopefully you can reproduce the effect which is laughter and to some degree it might be different laughter it might be laughter at different places but with this thing that we're talking about which ps i have directly experienced and am like you almost i don't want to say used to it because that sounds flippant but when it does happen it's always like whoa there it is again holy shit that is crazy but as in the whole days when that kind of stuff happened i'd be on the phone with people like you won't believe what fucking happened right now it's just more like whoa okay there's one of those things well see that's great right that's a great frame for things and i think there's actually a word i learned for this read the tibetans have a word for this and i forget what it is which is just like it's it's so for instance in in hinduism they refer to this as cities yes right and in and you know magical powers and in the western magical traditions it's referred to as magical powers right these are totally fucking unhelpful ways of looking at things because they they imply a that's something out of non-normal has happened and b that it's somehow generated by a person and c therefore implies that that's a special person right whoops the tibetans have a different word for it and i forget what it is but it basically just means oh that's we're noticing that that's happening right and so in the temple in topi you know we say of course in our way which is oh yeah of course yeah of course right yeah so um and this is really important because it it stems from the you know it's like people who are interested in this stuff particularly in the 20th century um have been asking themselves the question is it real what is it you know whatever it is magic paranormal phenomenon i'm so uninterested in that question like yes it's real i experience it every day you know it's so what you know a better question is um how can we live a meaningful life right right it's like yes i mean yeah that's there but it's only one part of life if you exclusively focus on that it's like exclusively focusing on painting your nails or something i'll give you this so what here's the so what to me okay and but i know what you mean it's like i by the way i'm not discounting any of this stuff i'm just saying like there's let's get to a more it's this simple it's yes the tool exists yes we know how to use the tool the question is what do we do with it well this is a point that i've been thinking about um because the times that i have experienced these kinds of events have generally been when i'm around either people who are completely out of their fucking mind or like people who are whatever you want to call it awakened into consciousness have a practice whatever it may be uh so to me there seems to be a revelation that happens and that revelation is happening when you're ready for there's a polite quality to the revelation of these things around certain people who maybe haven't seen it at all in other words i don't want to blow your fuse like i'm going to show you something are you ready for this now here's a little thing this is something eventually that will be normal in the same way when my anytime my baby makes any kind of sound that sounds like speech it's a big deal it's like whoa hi hello hello that he's going to be talking inevitably but it's still a big deal so i think it's something there seems to be an intentional and non-malicious obscuring of this sort of thing yes and and and and uh i think that well that is of great interest to me because i'm still at the place where it is exciting but as i as i practice the as above so below contemplation where you start trying to like escalate the degree to imagine like wait a minute if this happens oh i see yeah there's probably a place where not only does this happen but it's not a big deal and it's used with a true intention to create changes now that's where you have to coven the lodge whatever you want to call it um although i would argue it's probably past that stage because there's a certain level that you know i i believe i think that the coven the lodge the group is a kind of an early stage in magical development because really what people are doing there um is if it's healthy it's like i'm experiencing this are you experiencing this yeah i'm experiencing this wow okay how do we make sense of this or they're learning a system or tradition that's been passed on by elders in a healthy context right if it's done healthily it's been passed on that allows them to structure it and make sense of it and it's kind of like they're all gathering at the dmb it's like i'm driving are you driving yeah i'm driving like let's learn how to drive but um now it often becomes pathological because what you often have happening in those groups is the same thing that happens in um like for instance writers groups or groups where people are kind of playing this game like for instance like writers groups sometimes people are reading each other's work and playing playing this game of you're a great writer i love your stuff and the other and they're all like yeah you're all great you're a great but nobody's beginning published right so they're mutually kind of like supporting each other it becomes vampiric in a way it's the same with magical groups and that's my masturbatory well yeah so yeah you know and and and that's why i tend i don't do that thing and um you know it was important to me at one point in my development but after a certain point it's like you know i know how to use it now what well the question is what am i gonna do in the world and now i'm right back at the same place as anybody is which is okay well i now know some skills but the question is i'm still sitting here um you know what what can i do to help and like honestly duncan i mean you know i'm this is something i've noticed on your timeline you've been doing this lately like you just what did you didn't you just raise like 30 that how much did you raise for jim it's almost 40 it's almost 40 000 now for jenesis purege who was just um you know on the edge of you know destruction basically um you know jenice epikemia for yeah i mean jenice epikemia for a year and a half and has had real financial problems and um it was just in the hospital was unable to breathe that oxygen they didn't know what was going on if you want to talk about magic by the way this is crazy so um we since last tuesday we raised out we raised almost 40 000 dollars for janet and that's almost a thousand people some people donating large amounts some people saying this is my last five dollars just this outpouring of love of love for this person and in my request when i was pushing this on on you know i was blasting on email and social media and all this stuff and then people were picking it up and tool reblogged it and art news which is the biggest art magazine and the us has picked it up and all this stuff because people really care right signal boosting right yeah signal boosting right yeah and this is the great new you know social media the internet the great new frontier of magic and mental intent right but um you know i was expecting maybe a thousand two thousand dollars and this all came back it floored me right and um and the crazy thing is is that jen had requested on instagram please visualize that they were going to do a surgery to her lungs were completely blocked with fluid and they were going to and they still are by the way they were going to do a um hopefully not by the time this airs but they were going to do a very invasive surgery that was very risky in her condition with leukemia and so she had asked on instagram you know please visualize the surgery being a success my lungs being cleared and my um you know returning to health right and so i i amplified i made this request and when i send out the email when i was pushing a nonstop on all these social media platforms saying please visualize jen's lungs being clear they discharged her no joke they discharged her from the hospital saying we don't know why this has happened there's no explanation for it but the fluid in your lungs has just been being absorbed by your body and it's going away and i just heard earlier today that it's even more to the point that she may be able to breathe without having surgery you know i don't know that for sure wow we're not out of the woods but yeah there you go you have thousands of people sending their shared mind right thoughts are things thoughts are real they're one level of existence it's not a big deal you know all called all these cultures throughout the world know this we forgot it for we'd like to think that we're so advanced we're really way behind a lot of other cultures we you know because we got so into alcohol and caffeine and industrialization and machines and the whole idea and i think really what it is by the way is that you cannot if you see that thoughts are shared and you see you have that empathy and you have that share you see that intention is real if you remember that or let me put it this way until you cut that off you can't begin to view either you can't begin to view other people it's things to be used or animals as things to be used if you shut off your if you shut off your awareness that you're in contact with other beings which is what all the buddhas have been telling us interconnection right all these spiritual traditions you go back to them we're all one christ consciousnesses and all things all things are consciousness it all boils down to we are all shared consciousness now if you're in that state of mind which by the way i honestly think is our natural state yeah sure then you can't just callously see either human beings or animals is something to learn holy shit not to get like super super like vegan for a second but i've been very into i'm not totally vegan but i still eat eggs and and fish sometimes but um you know i've just got to a certain point where it's like i can't justify eating animal you know i just can't justify causing cruelty to animals to myself anymore and one of the things i read recently that i thought was so on point is that in our culture we train children to shut off their compassion by feeding them animals right because you get children naturally they love animals they want to be around yeah furry cuddly i mean what's better right they just have this natural love for all people you know but also but also animals right it's like that's why they have stuffed animals you think about that sacred bond the child and the stuffed animal and then it's like at a certain point and then you're putting meat in front of them and you're saying well this used to be a cow you like the like the cows that i love this used to be a chicken but it's okay and we create we as install this cognitive dissonance i remember when i found out meat came from fucking animals and it was devastating because i already didn't like meat like i didn't like it anyway i remember just having a general dislike of meat and then i don't know who's blew the whistle but they're like ps that comes from fucking animals they didn't say it like that but i remember just feeling like wait what soylent green is cows what the fuck are you talking about this stuff was already horrible now you're telling me it's like it's killing animals i didn't have i didn't know moracy back then i was just a kid but i do remember feeling pretty betrayed by that this meat source and um let let alone and perhaps betrayed by the people giving it to you on some level but let alone the and by the way and they're speaking of cultural taboos we just don't talk about what happens in factory farms or slaughterhouses it's beyond beyond the pale by so many orders of magnitude i mean we're sitting in this culture on i don't know how i got all the sudden moracy on here but uh we're you know in this culture we're sitting on you know a non-stop um horror show like like you know perpetual concentration camps for animals where they're tortured and and just in all of all they're almost act as karmic sinks for all the violence and hatred of our culture and you mentioned as above so below it's like you know it's like you know we treat animals like this in slaughterhouses and we don't even tell kids that right and most adults go their whole lives without even thinking about it once they just go to the store and it's like oh there's that thing i eat it it's good they don't think about you know bolt guns being and they don't think about cattle being killed by electroshocking them through the anus they don't think about you know um factory farm workers just casually punching and kicking and raping animals because they can they don't think about things being fed into buzz saws they don't think about that because we don't tell people the drones they don't think about the bombs they don't think about the military and they don't so it's like do you think there might be a connection right this is amazing because to me i i love this it's so basically what you're saying is uh to live in the modern world and feel okay you need to dehumanize and de i guess sentientize i don't think that's a word but you basically need to be in this like sort of like bubble where you are a thing of value that deserves respect and has wants to be happy but not everyone is like that and whoever the people who aren't like that are those are the people that you can you know not worry about the animals well they don't feel this they don't really feel like we do well they don't love like we do it's mostly just brain chemicals for an animal you ever spent time around particularly higher mammals for extended periods of time and like it's very very hard to spend time even around cows and say that they don't have there's nothing going on there's no emotions there's no feeling right well this so any of these animals any of them and not just but i mean fuck it's like you know i think some people listening to this are vegetarians and vegans some people are like carnivores but but before i do want to make clear too is i'm not necessarily on a vegan high horse and i don't necessarily have anything against eating animals but i do think that we need to get rid of factory farms in this culture i think everyone probably agree with me on that if let alone for health let alone you know there's a huge such a difference between animals that were raised as humanity has raised them as livestock for human history versus being fed into these h.r. geiger death machines if you drive up through the center of california and see that forget it you know hunting people have a completely different relationship with um or or farming in the natural way yeah or ranching rather whatever because they kill the they kill a man they'll kill them they shoot arrows through their fucking neck they do it and like the real question to ask yourself i think if you eat meat which i do and i fail this test every time is could you go into the factory and shoot the prod and the anus of the thing you're eating could you cut its throat in a normal setting could you hold a gun and shoot it in its head could you do that would you feel okay doing that and if the answer is no i would just rather not do that i'd rather than then probably you know you maybe you shouldn't be doing it damn it yeah yeah yeah totally but i don't want to i mean like again my feeling with eating meat is i i'm i'm addicted to it and i would love to get out of the pattern but rather than going there i would like to take the exact same concept and bring it a little closer to home in the sense that what about the way that we completely turn this massive swath of people into a thing called strangers right right that's what i'm talking you're you're in traffic and suddenly you're at war basically there's this group of fucking people who you don't know and the ones who cut you off are assholes the one you cut off you don't think about you know what i'm talking about that unnerving feeling you get when you're sitting in a restaurant looking around and you realize that everybody there is treating the people they're with like they're human and everyone else is like a kind of right the othering the othering process the othering process yeah absolutely although i do have to say there's there's a particularly with spiritual people there's a real issue with this too because very often very spiritual people go too far on the other direction particularly with psychedelics and meditation where they and and the ideology of it where they buy into the not buy into buy into is the wrong way of putting it but they adopt the ideology of oh we're all one we're all love everybody we're all one and they completely lose their sense of boundaries with other people which is quite necessary to live you know we need to be able to um you know a healthy boundary is having healthy boundaries means being able to drop to being able to drop or assume boundaries when needed at will sure instead of having one permanent either your boundaries permit because boundaries permanently down is not a good state to be in right like totally living in the state of oh i'm the same as everyone well what would that look like well you know name name the asset casualty of your choice right jesus well not necessarily right because even jesus i mean jesus comes and says you know jesus makes very clear distinctions i come with a soul i come with a sword right now what does that mean holistically the sword gabora right the gabora the fifth sphere of the tree of life means um you know is is the ability to make separations it's related to the walls in your house are related to gabora because they separate the inside from the outside okay your skin is gabora because it separates your body from the outside if you didn't have skin you wouldn't make it very far so boundaries and separations are very and enforceable if need be are very very important and one of the real issues with our current spiritual culture is that people just try to rush to the goal and they don't learn healthy boundaries which is a whole lot of tangent but this is i mean i agree with you and um i think that worrying at least for me worrying that at some point my ego identity is going to melt away to a place where i have to actually worry about merging in with everyone or having no boundaries or is very similar to the time i was working out regularly and started thinking like i hope i don't get too ripped not in danger man not in danger of that but i know what you mean some people they end up like prematurely jumping there or they pretend that they're there and they're not all kinds of like stupid traps you can get into and they may be well meaning right well meaning so yeah sort of well meaning but sometimes there's like an agenda behind it where they're like you know what i mean i'm more but i also want to point out like our culture you know one of the reasons why i teach is that um our culture you know magic, mysticism, spirituality there's rules okay in the sense that there's a process you go step a b c d you're going to get the result and there's a definitely a structure in a process to people's spiritual development it looks different from person to person but there's tried and tested methods to take to do it properly our culture has this really endemic problem where you know the insta you know if you want to call it this the instagramization of everything where if you look at things like people posting these inspirations you know people when they think spirituality our culture has shut it off for so long outside and we don't even remember christianity i was thinking about this today it's like how many people would remember you know just if you ask the average gen z person or millennial it's like how many people remember the story you know the story of king david how many people know the song of solemn how many people know you know the galatians you know and nobody right it's like so we've lost even our own you mean people outside of christianity you don't go to church regularly well you know yeah outside of you know outside of diehard christians but in terms of that our culture has lost all religion all spirituality even the one that used to be the dominant one right has just become oh that's just like another thing that some people do and so we don't have any structural language for these things and so now when people approach spirituality what they do is they just repeat sound bites that have been given echoed you know somebody long ago long ago somebody became enlightened and gave a great insight into the constant flux and changing nature of the universe and then that became and said this is what reality is and then actually that was not even fault that was false from the get go because they had to express it into language which immediately makes it false because now it's been for the revelation has been forced into the very limited code of english which has its own or excuse me not english but whatever language which has its own presuppositions and structures so just to speak you lie right and then that gets echoed and echoed and echoed by spiritual teacher quote unquote teacher until you get filters out into the culture as be here now or and i don't want to mention that that's that's a bad example but because that's a bad example because that actually but excuse me i back up because that actually that actually comes from an adept right that one actually comes from an adept so that one doesn't count but things like another great one is another great one that doesn't count is don't worry be happy that came from mayor baba yeah right but you know but you end up with things like oh you know like yeah be positive and send out positive vibes and all this stuff at the last ramdas retreat i was at bob thurman who's this amazing i love bob thurman he's incredible and he was a speaker there and he came on the first night when he was talking the first thing he said is be here now i can't do his accent he's got the coolest accent he's like be here now what does that even mean that doesn't mean anything he was like he broke it in half in front of everyone at their it was so great because he's like he was saying practice practice everyone's always practicing i'd like to see someone perform for once which is cool and i think a really important aspect of what we are talking about here is recognizing what you're saying which is that anything that involves language is very similar to quantization on the piano right we're taking a we're taking something and smashing it into uh notes and we have to if we want to make music and so we don't have to you can make noise music or whatever but it helps and it also helps if you want to play music with other people to know what scale you're playing in and so similarly i think when people um make contact with what's called the Buddha mind or whatever you want to say then they just start talking and the thing that comes out of their mouth sometimes the smart ones don't but we can't all be them well the smart ones don't but i think there's some people who are for lack of a better word or a description are told you you're the one and i think they might be like i don't want to i think quite often they're like i would rather not if that's okay i think that take this cup away from me moment in the garden of chisthomy probably happens in other places as well that we just don't hear about the story maybe because they you know it just doesn't make it in but i think that there's quite often a sense of like oh i'm sorry but you need to go out and disseminate this information and when i say they're told it really brings me to what i wanted to talk to you about which is you know i've been reading Lieber four again and he talks about the temple uh and it reminds me a lot of what chogium trump arempache when he talks about shambhala which is like a city that could exist here but also exists at some transcendent out out of time or in a different time i don't know what you would say so well very similar concept to that is the church right you know the temple you know it's like one of the things i learned from um orthodox christianity which i have a tremendous tremendous amount of respect for is you know the the progress of you know the first and second temple of jerusalem yes right so the first temple is built it's destroyed you know that the first temple uh contains the the ark of the covenant the the um it's destroyed the second temple finally and this is the whole story of you know the the whole testament and and and the art narrative arc the whole narrative arc of the bible the bible is the narrative arc of the entire bible is about that it's about the building of the three temples you know that's the whole thing right so so the building of the first temple it's destroyed which contains the ark of the covenant which contains the the tablets on which the ten commandments are written right um and then it's rebuilt as the second temple and then the second temple falls into disarray and becomes profaned what happened to the ark and this did it make it into the second temple it ends up in a warehouse i know i mean before indiana jones got i don't remember actually that's a good question i gotta look i got that's a very good question i i'm not sure um okay my biblical or so so the second temple is rebuilt the and the temple in the bible represents basically the temple represents the covenant between man and god and whether it is and the status of the temple demonstrates whether it is being properly kept and followed or not okay so it starts out great but then it's destroyed and then the second temple is rebuilt but then it falls into disrepair and that's the whole point of the new testament where christ shows up he's the son of god he he he says i'm the jewish messiah and then he goes to the temple and the whole part with him kicking everyone out of the temple it's like you guys are like selling you know baseball hats in front of this what's wrong with you this is holy right so then that so then but then the second temple is then um by the way the temple becomes profaned during that time because instead of the ark of the covenant they place the image of zeus in the temple right which becomes is the rome the god of rome the roman occupation they place the god of zeus in the temple and it's referred to as the abomination of desolation which is then picked up on by crowley later but um but the second temple is destroyed by nero and that's what the book of revelation is about the book of revelation is a record of the destruction of the second temple and the persecution the jewish people by or the jewish believers in in christ uh by rome and the and then it's said in the in the book of revelation the third temple will be built and that will be the final temple and evangelical literalist christians say that this means that uh they this is by the way the reason for all you know most of the u.s foreign policy in the middle east um the evangelical christians believe that that means a literal temple has to be built the dome of the rock has to be replaced a little temple and then jesus comes back but you know the what i learned from the orthodox who are so deep and mystical is no the church is the third temple and the church doesn't mean the organized church it means the body of all believers of christ meaning those who have the christ consciousness right all who are believers who are in touch with that consciousness that's the third church and it can't be destroyed so the temple is in this case a tuning fork when you're out when society is out of tune with that frequency everything is in disarray and certain patterns pop up which is you know charlatans appear and begin selling shit in a place where um there should be some kind of connection with the divine happening yeah or the connection with the divine becomes monetized in the sense that people start trying to sell something that is as unsellable as like your breath it's like someone trying to sell your own breath to you or something and and so um well it doesn't necessarily have to do with i don't think it necessarily even necessarily has to do with any of that it's more like it's it's people's state of consciousness right it's like our culture is as profane as it gets right you know and and but i also you know i used to believe in historical cycles and things like that i really don't i think that the human experience is pretty much the same it's it's everything is always decayed everything is always getting constant disarray but that's changed within people's hearts not within external structures i think well just for a fun thought experiment do you ever think to yourself oh i get it this is just a thought experiment it's fun to think about i'm in the temple right now but because of my profane state it looks like the earth plane but the reality is that i'm so fallen that i can't see where i'm at even i'm blind as a fucking bat so i'm existing in this sort of frequency where i look around and i see whatever my particular biases are you know my what did you call it earlier metaprograms metaprograms i'm seeing all my metaprograms and the metaprograms some scars and some scars slightly different concept but yeah and these are so essentially like this is just fun to think about this is the temple we're in it right now but we're in a room of the temple where the basically the crazy people go to we're wrapped up we're being taken care of we're being watched over because people in the temple want us to be better but because they know if they are to reveal the temple to us as it is we're just going to either freak out even more or start like knocking shit over we're basically quarantined in some kind of like dimensional again thought experiment gang not going cuckoo we're quarantined to some kind of you know area of the temple that is um where we have to stay until we begin to remember where we're at and the moment you start doing that that's when you start experiencing the strange cities and all these things that's when all the stuff that seems abnormal in the profane state start seeming normal and somewhere at in that place you start getting all these chances where can i can i make this real simple for you yes thank you i don't want to break the internet but why not um the temple okay let's it's very simple the temple is your life right it's like everything around you that you're experiencing right now listening to it's everything you can see your perceptual experience of your existence is your temple right we're not fallen we've just forgotten that it's part of us and what i mean by that literally is you at no point kind of we can do this neurologically if you want you at no point contact anything that is not represented to you by your sensory organs all that you think reality is is stuff that your eyes and your ears and your skin and all and your nose and your tongue is processing from external input which you do have no contact with at any time you don't you can't take the glasses off right right you're just getting and your brain is representing it to you is something that allows you to survive so everything that you think is outside you is literally just neurological in your brain okay that's your temple and you're not fallen you've just forgotten that it's part of you and the reason that as people get in as people get deeper into these practices and they start to experience synchronicity what's actually happening is just the messages are going to and from the different that that the external is part of you so yeah it seems like it's talking to you because it is you right does that make sense it's like yeah it seems like weird stuff or weird stuff happens when you focus on it it is you it's part of you there's no separation sure right so but also there could be like if we want to do the interiorization of the universe and I need to caveat that because this is for safety's sake right this is very important okay um that does not mean but it's it does not mean that this is you it's you don't want to fall into solipsism right and think that other people don't exist that's the error that everyone makes particularly people in the western traditions particularly people in the western traditions which has all this language about grades and special status and all like that no this is the natural state of everybody everybody is you know god essentially well that's the third mind isn't it I mean it's like there's there in this case if we're talking about like the sum total of all neurological activity producing the sort of simulation or whatever you want to call it that we call reality and we also imagine that there is the sum total of all minds happening at once not just on this planet but it all you know theoretical planets then suddenly what emerges now is like the universal mind now we've popped out of our own minds and we've entered into that place you were talking about the kind of like what did you call it it's the place where two minds kind of intersect momentarily not the third not the third not the third month yeah so it's the third month so in this case to me this is where it's fun to start doing just little experiments but before I even talk about that I'm gonna have to trunk play you trumpet me dad I'm gonna have to trunk play you you're talking about external agencies and assuming external structures external agencies that there is a system that there's a universal mind yes so what like like literally okay so let's say all this stuff is real right yeah let's say that all the cities are real they are and and all of that so what like and well listen let me tell you okay let's bring it down to earth we're driving by one of those fucking trampoline warehouses okay it's filled with trampolines you go in there and you can jump on trampolines for four hours and dive onto trampolines so what right it's just a trampoline warehouse it's just a place filled with stretched out material that allows you to propel your body into space at velocities that you've never done before with like people freaking out having a great day so what it's a blast that's so what and listen let me just add one thing and I don't mean to like put the fucking bullseye on you but I do want to point out one thing I have as I've contemplated more and more and more this idea of as above so below and really really thought it out I do think that there is a semi-organized if not organized veiling in this case and I get it I try everyone does it Trump a Rinpoche in his own way various teachers have encountered in their own way it's either so what disown it don't worry about it don't get caught up in it I found a wonderful Crowley passage on it sand traps essentially it's like don't get in the sand traps right but still to me it seems like well here's the so what if we can identify this quality in the universe which is I think one of the most beautiful things ever and then teach it in a way that isn't maybe it's time to stop concealing it so much maybe it's time for it to not be so mysterious maybe it's time for a more concerted effort you know it's like this thing where like think of my one of my teachers was you know introduced me to a wonderful um uh to Dilgo Kinsey Rinpoche who you know was in a cave for like I don't know how many years like 15 years or something came out of the cave running away from his wife or something like that shirking material responsibility but but um uh and I don't think taking the easy path well no I'll talk I have a theory on that but regardless of that um the what I'm saying is you know he comes he came out of he came out of his seclusion and became a really great teacher and rippled the pond so to speak and um sometimes I think fuck man it's time for some of y'all to start like coming out of the caves it's like maybe this if maybe the system the initiate system or the whispered system or the gradual revelatory systems are antiquated and that oh yeah I agree and yeah and it's well I mean look I you know I spent the last 20 years putting all you know putting all this information out there and you know even through through magic dummy through my school I you know I'd you know add an estimate I've probably taught something like 50,000 people this stuff yeah so so but does anyone ever tell you to shut the fuck up surprisingly no you know I didn't think that would be the case you thought you would get like you'd get like the the men in black would be on me or whatever no not the men in black but I mean like I was more I was worried about the christian right but honestly they you know it's like they don't care you know the only people that I've ever I think I might have mentioned this before on your show the only people that I've ever gotten flak from ever for doing what I do are other are other people doing the same thing who are who are just like all like pissed off because they didn't get the attention that's it like honestly and and this was a big revelation for me because I thought going into this that people would you know be against it that they would consider it blasphemy or a heresy of one type or the other and honestly people are just curious and I mean people from all different types of walks of life they just want to know because it's the thing that we're missing in our culture which is the connection to the eternity eternity and all of that you know and people want that I mean ultimately what I'm trying to communicate is yes there's lots and lots of techniques and boy there's a lot of techniques but ultimately what I want people to do is is wake up to this present moment and the awesome power and responsibility that they already have and you know right right and it's it's like and that's the thing it's so easy to get caught up in the language of it like we were talking about like yeah you can build synths for so long that you never make any music it's the same it's the exact same it's the perfect fucking metaphor spiritual materialism yeah right and it but it's true I mean people stay in these systems forever learning them and you mentioned you know my process and you know it's it's um I've really changed my views on certain things a lot actually since the end of last year and I just got to a point at the end of after I'd written my book and and done the the promotion and I thought about where I wanted to go next with it or I was like look I just got to this point where for me the question is while I'm here what good can I actually do for people and it fucking matter like what the you know like and look by the way I'm not saying this as somebody because people often too quickly go to the point where it's like oh the rules don't matter it's like believe you me it's like I can do you know I'm saying this as somebody who has the equivalent of I'm not saying this to puff myself up but for context I'm saying this from the you know from the perspective of somebody who has the equivalent of a higher degree in theoretical calculus but for the occult I mean when we talk about Anokian and John D and all that like you know you give me you know if we want to talk about the rules like I'm not a cast like yes I know cast magic but I'm not a cast magic guy if I can do gomotri in my head by the time I was 23 you could give me phrases in Hebrew and I could calculate and I can still do it calculate all the numerology and the Hebrew language in the tarot cards and spit it back to you in five seconds like rain man I read your John D book man I know I like it's you you are one of the top scholars in this particular field that I've ever met but it's not just I mean done the yoga I've done the shamanism I've done the rituals I've done I did it I did all of it you know and I it wasn't just an intellectual exercise for me right like I've been through it and so I say this as somebody who's like you know got you know it's like the equivalent of like you know training in seven or eight different martial arts and coming to the end of him and yet I have to say so what and that's not a negative question for me what it boils down to now I said and I use the reference of you know differential calculus one of the crazy things about math is math gets as complicated as you want it to be but ultimately it often boils it follows an arc of simplicity where it becomes more and more simple as it goes on right and in many cases it's the the most basic things are the most important it's the same with music right a few notes 12 12 notes whatever it is right and then you can make it as complicated as you want yes so what I'm trying to say is it comes down to can we spread love in the world right and I don't mean that as an airy fairy thing I don't want that to not as a hallmark card but it's like can I make your life better I'm right can I ease suffering can I bring can I show you that I care about you and that I love you and it's amazing to hear you saying this to watch this this is cool man this is sort of like you actually are entering the next phase I would imagine uh want you know one of the things named Crowley Baba said to boil it down to a very simple point I hope so he said if you know because people are going to him and saying how do I get these cities people want it like me crazy dumb me I wanted to go to the trampoline warehouse just for a second man we can get right back on the road all right we don't have to the can we just take a couple of detours the problem is you know good teachers are like no you've been taking detours for the last 6,000 lifetimes man I'm trying to get you to the temple yeah yeah we always you always go to the trampoline warehouse but that's all that's all our inherent we will always do that right yeah it's so frustrating but so but people were going to you know people and they were seeing him you know being around him crazy shit would happen because they a field is produced or whatever you want to call it but he said if you want these cities these powers feed people yeah that made a big impression on me when you said that I really like that but now that's what you're doing and because and you know what happens the moment that you diverge from your programming and go wherever there's need that's a little outside your comfort zone and start doing that crazy shit starts happening almost right away it's like almost it's like a circuitry has gotten reversed in you or something you're like a machine that's been running on the wrong kind of fuel maybe you've been putting out shit exhaust and all of a sudden you start putting out miracle exhaust that is real and that's so simple it's just so frustratingly simple because it's like well you obviously can do that you don't need to go to a Shaolin temple and wait at the gate you just can go downtown with some food well this is the temple right all let all all are all of our waking and sleeping experiences the temple like the temple is whatever you make the temple right your life is the temple right you know your whole experience is like your life like when you die you're going to look back and say what did I do in my temple the temple was your life right as above so below if we're going to do a russian nesting that's actually exactly what that means by the way the ear it's the external and the internal are the same thing but yes well like if the theory is oh shit we're like in some hyperdimensional temple temporarily hallucinating reality is we consider it or maybe we're just here maybe maybe we're just here and it's not a big deal maybe there's no big maybe it doesn't have to be hyperdimensional maybe the maybe whether we don't get to say hyperdimensional it's fun to say it's nice but maybe maybe the question of whether we choose to love others or not is so important and momentous and overwhelming and perhaps you know it will be a subject maybe perhaps will be judged by that maybe that is so momentous and overpowering that we don't need to put any other language on it because it's because when you really look at it's like fuck you know you know look at bill gates right bill gates went you know and this is i love this bill gates and warren buffett people who some people have mixed opinions about you know bill gates is a great example he made it you mean like which one you want to fuck killer mary exactly and then what's the third is i don't know jimmy buffett jeff bezos um but yeah i'm looking for a jimmy buffett joke my mind's not finding it margarita there's a margarita bill joke in there somewhere anyways um but yeah i mean you know bill gates fuck jimmy buffett talk about yeah my secret's out so um cities right let's talk about bill gates as a metaphor for cities like bill gates it's like what better city is there than being you know being a billionaire right sure and he's just like and you know and then he decided to give all the money away right and um bill a couple of weeks ago maybe a month ago at this point bill gates and warren buffett released what they believed to be their greatest metric for success they thought about this and consulted with experts whatever they did and they tried to come up with like you know business people love metrics it's a great you know business people do i read this by the way it's that's the one where they said the greatest metric for success is to be one of our children yes and to inherit all of our wealth and to inherit the private space space on on the moon they will keep you away from the rabble yes it's definitely that but otherwise sorry to make a damn gag please continue uh and the the bolt hole in new zealand where they can wait out the uh whatever the whatever the anunnaki returning yeah the uh the the anger at jeff bezos but um he uh so yeah but they said so the best metric for success is do the people that you love love you back whoo it's pretty good right yeah that's pretty cool it's wrong what is it what what what is the right what what's the right answer so and i don't by the way i mean not wrong god damn it i sound so fucking sanctimonious all the time and if i was a synth i would like just have someone i'd be like oh my sanctum sanctimony knob is off can you just adjust the just the fucking thing please um the um but what i mean is this so within this conceptualization of love we have the monetization of love right so now it's like when i give you do the people who you give love tokens to i see your love tokens back and of course capitalist super successful people are going to quantify everything because that's how their minds work it doesn't make them evil yeah no i see your point it's a good point but but and and the broader point is if you're giving to with the expectation of giving something back if you're giving love with the expectation that you're going to be love back i i hate to break it to you that's not real love that's not real love and i want to that's that's uh you know you know making a deal or whatever that's the art of the deal that's just another kind of bitcoin baby that's some fucking weird ass love cryptocurrency the real measure for success i would think would be do how much do you care if the people you love love you back right that's a good point if you don't care and you just love you know you're like oh i just love i'm so happy you're here that's a thousand percent true yeah you're gonna feel oh you're a lot better i would say um but um the the to get back to the main point here man i've been watching your i watch your twitter live and i've been quite inspired by it and i have just i've just been shitposting about andrew yang but okay the yang stuff i don't i just haven't looked into yang yet we'll get there we'll get there but but the you know watch for one here's the thing it takes a weird kind of courage to blast positivity out on twitter in the way that you're doing it that's real it's easy to do the fucking instagram pick you know grab a stock photo picture and put on it something like every life's a rainbow love all the colors eat or let me examine that whatever the fucking thing is you throw it out there people is they're taking shits look at it and then you know forget about it it means nothing but when you're like what i've noticed that you're doing is you're putting like actionable things out it's gotta be real it's like it's like does it are you actually making somebody's life better i mean it's the difference between sending thoughts and prayers and actually doing something that tangibly improves somebody's life you know somebody's starving are you gonna send them thoughts and prayers or are you gonna pay for them to fucking eat you know which is it gonna be man you're gonna get sucked into some kind of fucking weird updraft here man like the the because you know my if you wanted everyone's like i want to find really not everybody but you know a lot of people are like i want to find i want entry into the fucking inner sanctum man i want to know the secrets let me in come on i'm ready it's that it's a trope it's it it's in you know dr strange or whatever right it's like that's a true and it's a real thing you know it's like that's a very important game that's played between in these lineages come on come on what do you want from me what do you want from me and it's always like just fucking wash just shut up and wash the windows man you're not ever gonna be ready for this you know you're never that's like you know like when i when i first met jen the first thing i said to jen was tell me about magic because that was the first thing she said to burrows and geisen i spent the next seven years doing jen's dishes and cleaning her basement that's it that's it i'm not kidding and this is this is you know i but i don't want to get this has been my experience but if you go downtown or wherever there is need in your life personally or even a few notches outside of that you're gonna run into other people who have gotten the symbols to go and help and that's where you start meeting some really interesting beings and a lot of them they don't care to be known and it's not like they don't care to be known in the sense that they're like you know i don't know like hiding because of their great talent or whatever like that it's literally they don't really have much of an identity they're just helping they don't really care oh you're this thing cool whatever they don't care so a lot of times people who have narcissistic tendencies they don't like we all that you you just raise his eyebrows i'm like fuck look where you're sitting man we all got it we're in la we all have a little bit of the disease the burning grounds i consider la the burning grounds if you can do it here you can do it anywhere it's okay to be you know to to have some need but i'm talking about like one thing that really burns a narcissist or semi-narcissist or self-involved persons tits i don't know if even that's a saying but is when you get around people who don't really care how fancy you are yeah they're not in the sense where they're like whatever you're on this thing i don't know but literally they're like not seeing it like you're that thing that you've been the tail feather you've been throwing up or the spin you've been putting on your ball or whatever they're like whatever i don't it's not i don't like it it's like i just don't care i'm too busy helping people and they don't say it like i just said it they don't you don't say it they're just like okay well i've been thinking about this a lot so i was thinking about this recently and i think this i i want to update this if i can or or at least offer a different spin on it so in terms of yeah you said you're watching my twitter timeline so i i just did this fundraiser for jen before i did that i did a fundraiser i sent a bunch of i i raised a bunch of funds and then i matched the funds to send to a group that i think is profoundly great and people should look at which is called napal youth foundation which is a woman who run by a woman who used to be a state senator in california and then retired and said well i could go play bridge in sonoma county or i could go to napal and she's now saved on countless thousands of children she basically single-handedly ended the there was more or less a slavery system for young girls in place in napal that she pretty much ended single yeah it's very very common in i mean human trafficking right like we're like we're gonna sit here and talk about magic powers in a world where human trafficking exists well how about you go fight that dragon if you're such a big wizard you know what i mean let's see your magic powers right so um but yeah i mean this is very you know it's common it's common in many all over the world it's kind it happens in the u.s there's human trafficking everywhere so um um but uh but uh anyways but we uh uh i raised a bunch of funds for her from facebook and then matched them and then we were able to i don't know how they're gonna spend it but the um you know they will probably i believe it is close to saving seven children's lives from malnutrition right so here's the traditional thinking about charity and i was thinking about this now all the programming around charity is that you shouldn't talk about it right if you talk about because then it becomes an ego game it becomes an excuse to say yeah look at me i'm such a great person yeah like i'm the i'm the you know the savior of all these people and say look how it's like virtue signaling right we all know we all know this from the social media age there's nothing fucking worse than virtue signaling but i thought about this for a second and i was like wait we live in the social media age why should we not be telling people about this stuff by the way you can anyone can start a fundraiser on facebook for anything and it'll spread like wildfire on social media so you don't have to have a bunch of money you can start it with five dollars but it shares virally and people are contributing right so but i thought like we live particularly now we live in a a diarrhea stew of ideology right like literally like have you anytime you know the minute i get on youtube twitter and it's only gotten worse in my lifetime i mean do you remember in the 80s when people watch pbs do you remember that listen man mr rogers cosmos you can't say diarrhea stew diarrhea that's where we are thinks like i do and then expect me to remember mr rogers all i'm thinking about is now is like contrast right boiled i i'm just thinking like i guess in a world where probably everything has happened surely someone has boiled their diarrhea i just probiotics do you know about do you know about um um fecal transplants yeah yeah so there you go but yeah let me tell you something man a fecal transplant is a lot different than having like a gumbo pot filled with diarrhea loving loving diarrhea are great levelers like everyone laughs like no matter who they are everyone will either laugh or be disgusted by a diarrhea or a far joke right it's like they're great levelers just i've i don't know like i'm like i like to think of myself as somewhat of like an expert at all phases stages of vulgarity particularly the base states and i've never in a million years thought of something like boiling diarrhea you at it i didn't say you you added the boiling what you yeah you you i just provided the stew and you heated it up duncan you you boiled it wait the stew requires boiling if you're gonna make diarrhea listen otherwise it's just a pot of diarrhea what what what are the chunks in it what's the chunky bits is there like the equivalent of carrots depends on who you're gathering the diarrhea did the carrots and the corn come corn come out of your body or were they added after you know hey don't be rude at the table is it vegan is it vegan diarrhea i'm sorry my friend's being a little rude did it come from the body of a keto person was it was it were they eating organic free range i mean there's questions to be asked here listen every time i bring you to one of these diarrhea restaurants you always fucking say that it's fine we'll just have two more bowls of just people just get picky you know like oh like you know like so yes i know what you mean like it diaries to it seems like and like not that long ago access to content was limited and the content that we did have access to was highly curated right there was no ability to get anything the closest we had to any of the shit that we can like spend literally the rest of our lives looking at was public access right that's it by the way and just to push this metaphor it's like what is what is a facebook feed right what is a twitter feed what is instagram this is what particularly ones where people are sharing it's like it's a roll of toilet paper like you see people pulling off one square they wipe their ass and they're like i just read this look at this shit i just consume this music look what just came out of my body if you see you know there's an ad that keeps popping up on my instagram feed i guess because they've identified me as a true idiot and it's like i the ad says like i just read i read four books today and you look at it oh i've seen that one so we must be in the same the same boat well maybe it's just like the speed reading app or whatever it's not speed reading that's what i was interested because i'm like oh cool i want to learn how to read a book like four books in a day through speed reading is that even possible what is this but it's like cliff notes oh i saw this is like that where they just like summarize four books for you so that's not reading a book so that you can be a successful entrepreneur that's the most that's like saying and also the fact that it's the one i hate is grammarly also the app the ai that corrects your writing for you because you never learned how to write yeah look man i'm not scary for a writer why is it scary well it's a scary for the same reason if you're if you are a line cook and a robot takes your job you know it's grammar you just fucking sold grammarly to like everyone now is downloading grammarly for a second you just now i want it again i had it learning to write precisely correctly structures your brain and advances your intelligence in the same way that math does oh my god listen i'm sorry i usually have a rule about not outing people about shit that happened when the mics are off oh but what did you just teach me but but i'm not a professional musician oh i'm not a professional grammarian yes okay the music ai god damn it we got it we got to talk about the becoming ai apocalypse i wait i don't want to talk i derailed you man you are saying we're in diarrhea stew in the old days we had mr rogers and you're also talking about something that somehow i guess i shouldn't be surprised i didn't think about it because i'm unfortunately innately selfish i didn't even consider the fact that like anyone could just do a fundraiser i don't know oh yeah facebook makes it makes it like literally you can go on facebook click a button that says fundraiser and just type into the search box and you'll find and please go to charity navigator or something to make sure that you get a good charity yeah um but it'll just immediately start a fundraiser for you and then you just say and people do it for the birthdays now like for my birthday i raised funds for um uh people in appalachia which by the way if you don't know about the situation about people in appalachia in the us you will be shocked the levels which i've been there i've seen it you would be shocked how this can occur in our our country you know and this is all basically poor rural white people who live in uh unbelievably unbelievably dire circumstances and nobody offers them support and you don't hear about them at all and and so you mean are you talking about like not just the poverty but the the like they're all they're all addicted to oxy well yeah well the oxy cotton epidemic but that's the whole country now you know that's the whole midwest i mean appa at rural people in appalachia who live in the backwoods in particular i saw a documentary on an incredible level of poverty it's like you you'd be shocked you'd be shocked that it's happening in the us there's lots of places like that in the us there's parts of suburban washington dc that are um or or ex-urban uh washington dc that are just shocking but um you're just saying it's easy to help like you're saying it's easy to help and it's like we're not it's not like building an airplane it's not like it's a clicking a button on you without getting out of bed you know and it's like so why aren't people why don't we do this well this is my point so we have this whole conception about charity right like we have all these these rules and there's rules in in um the bible and actually the koran is so fucking on point about this in you know if people are strict muslim muslims the koran basically says you automatically tie the 10 of your income either you know for charity automatically it's a get it's assumed right and actually um um islamic finance which is a whole sector of fine the financial industry is set up around this concept you know it's like that's a great fucking idea you know because that then that makes when you're making money it's not just about you and your selfish desires you're a conduit who does the tie like is this something organized through your mosque in this in in i don't know how i mean it's it's i know the church is 10 percent it's i i think it's either the i believe it's either to a mosque or to a charity i don't i don't know that it's just it's neither here nor there i've just always it's it's it's it's basically mandated but in the koran but i think different groups i just mean what i'm saying is like the tithing thing has always seemed boring to me in the sense that you give the church your income and then they distribute it i've always thought tithing sounds awesome if you are in charge of the tithing i agree because churches you know well not all churches but you know religions are set up to just siphon tax free income that's we don't need to talk about that but um well i mean tithing technically is tax free income right like if you donate 10 percent of your income you're not paying that's a tax for it depends i think it's yeah i'm not here to do financial i i'm not a financial advisor please check with your local financial advisor um but um uh but yeah it's not just about the tax benefit because the tax benefits cancel out really quick i just i'm i'm being the worst and i just took your beautiful here's here's what i want to do yeah i'm so sorry how did i get this to fucking tax write offs for chair i'm a demon sorry don't worry i've triangleed you so um what does that mean oh don't worry don't worry about i have something i want to show you just everything's everything's under control okay cool uh no so the fuck never okay so we have the most powerful tools for communication ever created in human history and we're using them for diarrhea stew when we could be using them to literally change people's lives right facebook fundraisers now facebook takes a cup but facebook fundraisers is an amazing example you don't have to do it that way there's infinite ways to do it um and um and this means either donating directly or crowdfunding charity wow we want a really powerful concept particularly for you know there's a real generational divide you know baby boomers gen x people love the idea of owning things millennials gen z people they you know they're not interested in owning and so for them the idea of crowdfunding things you can have the experience by the way you can have the experience of donating tens of thousands of dollars to a charity you don't have to pay for it all yourself it can be crowdfunded people can be chipping in ten dollars here and there right anything and then you can say like for instance we just raised forty thousand dollars for gen that's that was crowdfunded by eight hundred nine hundred people but then i can have the the feeling the sense everyone who contributed has the feeling the sensation we raised forty thousand dollars for something that's likely saved their life right so the um so so but you know we have this cultural taboo around talking about charity and it's considered crass and like oh like you're just doing that for virtue sick only self on the back and that makes sense in the context that you think about like think about like five hundred years ago like oh there's joe walking around the village in white clothing talking about how great he is because he gives to the church like oh look how much i give but we don't live in that world anymore we and there's a real you know as a someone who's long worked as a marketing professional there's a real value to obviously mimetic spread and people you know it's like you know when i created these fundraisers it gives people an excuse to share them it gives them an excuse to feel feel good it gives them an excuse to give and then other people imitate the behavior you know it's just like every other meme like why are we using these things to spread fucking pepe memes when we could use them to spread fundraisers to actually really and by the way why are we using these techniques to to spread think pieces about how terrible everything is and how awful the world is and how fucked the system is and like i get on facebook and i see young people just sharing memes about ironic edge memes about how they want to die all day long you know this is like edgy edgy gen z humor or whatever who is that woman you showed me though she does like the same thing but it's not so negative you sent me some she's got like a youtube channel i can't remember i don't know anyway but it's just like it's like it's like okay well the pow we have in almost infinite power at our fingertips what are we going to use it for well i suggest that you know this is a we can use these technologies to really the technology is here for us to tangibly make a benefit and difference in people's lives why are we sitting on these things fucking whining all day long it's gotta be some kind of just just like it's kind of like um it reminds me of early cinema right like you look at like the first movies they're not only they're terrible they're just like people were so excited they just needed something to film i think it's like a blacksmith is that what edison filmed or some shit it's like let's film a blacksmith i just know that the journey to the moon the jewels verne won the early oh before what like the one with the rocket lands in the side of the the moon's face before that the earliest stuff is just like fucking just it's it's sweet because it's like a blacksmith like and i'm glad they filmed or whatever but i think similarly with this technology we're just figuring it out and what you're talking about is probably in this what are they we have like background radiation right in the universe that we can pick up when you turn on a radio that that's just background radiation for the big bang right so we have epigenetic background radiation oh yeah yeah yeah inertia just inertia from all patterns running from bears we're still running from fucking bears and so because of that it's it's now thank god we're running from bears online and we're like writing these like what we think are sophisticated think pieces about the bears that we think are chasing us that are actually just hyper complex screams there's a fucking bear right but we talked about the whole thing about the the Tibetan the Tibetans talk about the karmic imprint of animals no oh this is great right so the Tibetan the obviously in the context of the wheel of life not to go on a big detour but the Tibetans talk about the karmic the karmic there are the state of consciousness of animals and they say that obviously lots of animals reincarnate into the human realm yes right so they said like oh you would imagine that being an animal is great because they um you know they have no worries in the world they're just like i'm a fox i'm running around right but they basically said that the state of consciousness of animals i think this comes from bob thurman by the way the state of consciousness of animals is constant terror about being eaten right so the constant fear that some shit is gonna like if you're a cat you all you're always afraid that a dog or a hawk or god knows fucking what is going to come eat you across the board in the animal kingdom everything in the animal kingdom is engaged in eating or being eaten right and so they basically say that when when animals reincarnate as humans they care it's exactly what you're saying they carry that with them right constantly afraid that something's gonna eat them well i mean we are fucking animals donald trump's gonna eat me well and and he might but the the reality is he's on his last he's on his last sputtering wind i think something is gonna eat you i but you don't need to write a thank piece about it because the reality is there's people like in the sense that like yeah maybe you're gonna get eaten by that i don't know like now everyone's freaked out about trans these people are freaked out about trans people it's like i don't know that you're even ever gonna run into one right in your whole now that oh Jesus what but i'm just saying it that fills in a spot in their brain of like a new thing to be worried about you know like you know people you get i'm not gonna get into into i don't want to get into like political whatever i'm just saying like a black marble or you choose the color of the marble representing doom rolls out of some machine in your brain and you spray paint on it whatever the particular fear flavor of the day is depending on your political leanings you know because it's like you're you're going to the tv or to twitter it's your metaprogram the fear is in you you're just looking for something to fill the and and and twitter and and social media if you're looking for something to be afraid of if you want to go fishing for something to be worried about this week go no further than i mean fucking hanity literally has the villain of the day so it's like and he's the only person in the media that does something like that all of them but if you're not creative enough to invent something to be terrified of don't worry yeah like the skate the the uh the escape go to the week the mob tear down of the week that's it right and and and but what you're talking about is just like and here's the thing clearly at first we're going to use the technology in the way that you we're going to use the technology in a way that reflects the reality not just of our lives but of the some total experience of the human species and let's face it man we've gone through some rough spots it's like i think this is where it's like so maybe some compassion like if you look at our species as a person like an immortal dna thread you know and you look back at what we just went through fucking world war two i think about that a lot you know she's can you can you imagine what that must have been like can you imagine how fucking hard people had to be to deal with that like our grandparents waited through fucking knee deep and blood in europe to be able to build this for us that's right to make sure that like like the mind boggled i don't think that anybody who wasn't a lot didn't live through that can't even conceptualize what that must have been i think as a species we're still shell shocked from it i completely agree we're like stammering and stuttering after this crazy thing happened because it's not just that that happened it's because it happened it can happen again so we're like kind of we're all in the aftershocks of world war two and and and then personally people are experiencing their own like aftershocks from personal trauma and abuse that is sometimes directly related to war and this is PTSD and epigenetic trauma so you know this this what the the reality is that of course people are scream tweeting and i do just as a very brief aside not to not to just add to what you're saying that's one thing even though our current kind of like neo fascist movement moment even though our current neo fascist moment and these neo fascist movements that are popping up around the world that many throughout europe and yeah it's fucked even though it's fucked and it's horrifying it's um when you consider it in context of what actually happened out now who knows what could happen but when you consider it in context that it is ultimately still an aftershock from world war two and when you look at social media warfare and things like this you know i made this point where it's like you know if we were um our parents generation let alone our grandparents generation we would have been fighting these battles with our hands and with guns and now we're fighting them on social media for the most part and it's fucking awful but it beats physical combat right so there's progress there's a there's a bright side and and and some you know sometimes in my you know generally like i'm like i don't know confused understanding of these things i do i do think of that like try to look on the bright side i do think like yeah that you know at least like now you know like we're not killing each other over the shit and the other bright side i think of is like is it kind of like as a species our immune system has gotten better at recognizing this particular fucking virus and so when it pops up in in in any way shape or form it is like instantaneously fallen upon and attacked and brutalized because you know sometimes i do think that like if a fucking cancer cell could talk right if these walls could talk yeah it would be saying things along the lines of like hang on guys i'm just wanting you i just want to have a conversation i just want free speech here i just want to talk a little bit about our fucking dna doesn't have to you know produce us the way it's pretty you know just sit down for a second i want to talk to you about something all right now i know what you're thinking i know what you're thinking and i don't blame you for thinking that it's a sign that you're just take a red pill or two but you know come on does the pancreas really have to be this shit you know what i mean because because really like if you look at like people like um what's that dude's name it kind of vanished but he's like that southern weird southern dude who's like a racist you know i'm talking about spencer yeah it's not like he's secret about what he's saying he wants a fucking white what's it called a ethno state yeah you know what i mean and then when people like when when that awful and where people got run over by that and they were talking to him about it at least in the documentary i saw he was like kind of smirking half smiling yeah you know what i'm talking about yeah yeah yeah he's clearly very um uh yeah i actually read that there was like an account somebody posted on reddit of somebody became involved in his group and like fell for this whole thing and got involved and it completely destroyed their life and then i think they got out of it and they basically said like look like Richard Spencer is a sociopath he was just using people he does not have any empathy for them he's just using them up and throwing away basically to prop up his own ego right you know it's like but it's like but in terms of the cancer metaphor it's like there's so many people like that out there it doesn't necessarily mean just not not just on the far right like the social media age has exposed us to these human pathogens right there's so many think of how many people have we been exposed to over the last 10 15 years we've just used this era to just put their personality and their ideas on blast to the point where you know as somebody who's a marketer i know it's like if you repeat it you know as gerbil said if you repeat it enough if people accept it as the truth right and we live now in an era where monetized polemicists it's it's it's like we're in the era of the professional polemicist oh yeah who is monetized creating a divide and and and the monitor and so they went into it as a with a kind of like entertainer sense you know it's like this is i'm just gonna do like the hitchens thing or whatever i'm gonna it's gonna i'm gonna be a cervix and smart and i'm gonna use like great debate skills to make points that naturally alienate at least half of the people and not only that tell a story about the people who don't find me to be palatable and so within that that's cool at first it's interesting but then suddenly you have to keep repeating the polemics you have to keep breaking shit apart because that's your job right and then you're injecting it now you're essentially it's like you it's the age of the professional fearmonger it's like it i need to produce a terror and then talk about it in a way that is gonna freak people out get invited on fucking whichever news program there is be divisive enough so that i grab a small audience and i'll get rich that's the idea man well that's always been the game right i mean it's in the media it's always been the media game but now everyone is their own fox news right the scary thing particularly is particularly when you talk about people who are putting out messages that are alienating people and we saw this happen to the conspiracy community eventually the people that just get locked out end up all gravitating towards each other and what we've seen now is this whole thing is you know it's gone from individual cancer cancer cells to metastasizing where all these people who were kind of on in all these fringe groups like there were some people from the conspiracy world there were some people who were like way out on the fringes of the esoteric world there were people who were like kind of on the right but not that much there were there is people the libertarians you know all these people have just been pushed to the friend you know they've been pushed kind of they've ended up all like circulating together and it's like in the same way that and and they've all not only self-radicalized but now radicalized each other to the point where now we have the alt right where it's this it's almost like the it's become a religion for people and it's become a and it's a scary thing that happens when people are all in an echo chamber and they're echoing each other's opinions even if the opinions are all wrong the fact that they're all talking about them presupposes that they're true and they're they're they're they're they're validating each other to the point where we now have this you know where we now have this thing that's come out of the you know whether it was engineered or not i think is an open question and i have my views about that whether the alt right was purposefully engineered by who i don't know but purposefully engineered to push back against the progress of things like um you know um the success of standing rock and wiki leaks and edwards noted in fact that there was so much agitation from the left prior i don't think that um just seems like weak lazy people trying to find some shit to blame their like personality problems on or something in it but i'm i don't know in the story for all human history but now they can they all gather together and create this like like mega entity of hatred and rejection well i this is the path that i've identified it goes somewhere like this it's like i'm not sure if the earth is round that's where it starts right it's somewhere in there you start thinking like maybe the earth is flat now i'm not saying you shouldn't wonder about that this is a good thing to wonder about prove for yourself whether the earth is round there's a shit ton of data out there for you you can do the measurements yourself figure it out explore it learn from the exploration just do it but then what happens is somewhere within that you're going to run into somebody who recognizes oh okay you're not a type of person who believes just what you hear right so hey you know what else is off a little bit human history you know that right like what you think history is isn't history at all right now what does that naturally lead to holocaust denial right that's the next step so it's like it goes like there is i think and i don't know for sure i don't know if anyone's done this study but i think if you were to take like and p.s flat earthers out there who are like i'm jewish and i know the holocaust happened i'm not talking about you i'm talking about the people who are like i don't think any of this is real including the holocaust and then that leads to um obviously raging anti-semitism because now it's like the jews tricked us into thinking that there was this thing that happened and it didn't happen now we're right back to where we were pre-world war two irrational people creating a scapegoat out of an entire group of people and then boom what do you get you get some real fucking problems man because once these dum-dums get together they get they get you know they get violent i might the only like comfort i take in any of this shit is when you see the videos of them versus the videos of like nazis in the past these people seem fucked up like they're like way overweight or all weird and like crusty and like they look sick they look fucked up they don't look like they could like do much well we live we live in a this is we live in a um we live in a country right we live in a country full of of people who are losing their jobs who are addicted to oxycontin and by the way we we just learned you probably saw this you know the person the company that created oxycontin like the president came out like they now have them on record he came out they had a party after they released oxycontin and he said there was going to be a blizzard of of money from this and uh they were gonna make so much money off this and they were parting it's like it's uh you know they were probably on oxycontin yeah right right um you know the the situation in this country is very dire and i think that in particularly living in the media bubble of los angeles as we do we're really insulated from a lot of it you know if you go so many places in this country if you go to um you know they've just just been devastated by oxycontin and the factories closed down you know and they're just living in abject misery there's no work and you know the the common pattern by the way is um for a lot of small towns in america is that whatever the source of labor was so like usually it's one place like the auto factory or you know auto in fact the auto industry shut down a long time ago in the us in the 80s but you know manufacturing jobs um and people talk about you know the coming automation crisis it's like a lot of a ton that's been going on since the 80s yeah and you know a lot of men most of the manufacturing has been automated out of america the you know farming has all become corporatized monsanto all this stuff and the so usually in these towns what happens is the source of labor leaves no one's got a job um then what happens is um often how the cycle starts is the elderly people who get oxycontin prescriptions for their medical conditions to make money turn around and sell it or it's stolen right and then next thing you know everyone's on oxycontin yeah and then of course what happens is when there's no when they can't get enough prescriptions filled then people turn to heroin because what are you going to do when your oxy cotton's out and you're an addict it's like heroin is not heroin addiction and it's all heroin right it's all junk right this is something that william burrows was so clear on it's like oh like oxycontin, vican, percocet, it's not the same it's fucking junk it's the same shit right and so people fool themselves into this spectrum of oh like it's not at least it's not heroin it's fucking junk right and it's like but i'm coming from this place of like of addiction is um not a moral failing it's not a failure of willpower it's certainly a failure of ethics on the parts on the behalf of these pharmaceutical companies for pushing this shit on people when they know damn well what it is and what it's going to do they fucking know yeah um but um um and so you know once somebody's an addict they're an addict right it's not they're not going to overcome that through willpower when you're when you become a heroin addict you're you're before heroin addiction your body naturally produces endorphins to keep you numbed to the agonizing pain of just existing in a body right your body is constantly producing opiates to keep you that state of comfortableness you experience on a day-to-day basis yes is you know don't quote me on this i don't want to know the exact science but it's produced by your your body's natural pain relievers right so what happens when it's just like people who take testosterone or things like that when you take synthetic opiates junk right it it um your body stops making it just like anything else because it's getting an external source so it says oh i don't need to make that that's why by the same principle when bodybuilders start shooting up steroids their ball shrink to the size of peas because their body's like oh great i've got testosterone i don't need to make it anymore so it shuts down the testosterone production facility it's the same thing with uh your brain naturally produces opiates now it's not producing it so when people try to kick heroin they're experiencing the most agonizing pain because they're not only they're not only getting the system it's like their body is like it's like they have that the people describe it as they have no skin their bones are like shattered glass like it's just pain and this goes on for close to a week while they're shitting themselves again the diarrhea vomiting and constantly constantly thinking about it would all go away if i just have a tiny bit so tell me that that you know and and you know somebody and they can just go down the street and maybe find somebody if they know how to get some right now tell me that somebody who has had everything in their life take you know they've had their employment taken and by the way we also know that the number one cause of divorce and broken families is financial stress it's not infidelity infidelity runs a far second to financial stress financial breaks up families right so you had so now there's no work family broken families no opportunity no hope you turn on the tv and everyone's just all the guns are you know you know and are unfortunately you know on the on the left people have fallen into this trap of demonizing people in the middle of america with one hand with it while at the same time they're running a cold opium war on them let's be very very clear right like basically the message from from the the message from the corporate concerns in this country is we don't need you anymore because the the people in the corporations they know damn well they can get all these jobs run by either automation or outsourcing they don't need the people in the middle of america so the message from the message from the the the the corporate concerns in this country is we don't need you anymore go fucking overdose in a corner and by the way you're the problem jesus christ that that's crazy that's what's happening right now what's gonna so so you tell me that somebody in that position who's lost their job living in a situation of dire straits in a broken situation and that they're they're now they're addicted to oxy cotton right and that that's the thing that with one thing that makes everything okay now you tell me they're bad for being addicted to it no go fuck yourself right like no you're not bad for being addicted to oxy cotton i don't care where the fuck you live or what dope you're on where you know the the place where you need to sit down and think is if you're becoming like you know if you it's because what you're describing there's a very exploitable situation that's being exploited right it's like okay great here i have a group of people human cattle basically from the perspective of these people that you're talking about i mean if you're celebrating the fact that you're about to get rich off of fucking oxy cotton but and i do want to make one caveat by the way this is not just the middle of america we know this because the same thing happened in black communities in the 80s with the crack cocaine epidemic right right right but it's like so but what i'm saying is essentially this is an exploitable situation and i'll tell you man this cab driver in new york told me the creepiest goddamn shit about isis he's we're just driving around this he was from syria i think we're just talking and he was it's because he had like a i can't remember there was he was he was awesome but he was telling me like you know isis that's not their name he's like he said some weird middle eastern name and he's like they come out after war when things are really bad they come out when things are really bad this like this like it was just creepy like like some kind of like doom locust that when shit gets just bad enough and exploitable where everyone's all fucked up because like they've been being bombed by a superpower you come to them like listen join us right it's all that's left we're seeing this so so that when you're saying is the alt-right organized it's like well if we're looking at a kind of like opioid epidemic meeting the last fucking recession meeting like massive unemployment meeting all these fucking things and you really do have a perfect situation where you can get in there and be like you know what's causing this right it's well what shape do you think the earth is you know what i mean it's just it's you see how it's like it is such an exploitable thing uh that it's terrifying to imagine what happens if someone recognizes that and is like let's use the fucking internet and twitter and facebook to take all these fucking people out of their goddamn minds on oxy broke divorced sick dying all over the planet and let's start doing little hits right the algorithm start sucking them down so it's like and then the next it's the same things happen in the middle east you know it's like it's like particularly in the wake of when the u.s went into the middle east and just you know devastated these countries like iraq it's like yes of course people are going to be radicalized in the wake of that because also then at least in the case in the least they can point to yeah the americans are like destroyed your fault you know they can point to all the abuses of america because they literally did and then and this was has always been this was always the point of the obama state department or and and some prior you know where they were saying that you know um uh uh uh violence leads to further radicalization in a sense but that aside it's like if we look at history look at all throughout human history look human beings are fucking simple okay like you meet everyone listening to this like everyone out there deep down what do we want happiness yeah we want to be happy we want to be left alone we want to sit on the couch and watch fucking true detective and have food to eat have some love and play with our family and have love and that's pretty much it yeah every once in a while you get a pathological human being who goes a little goes a little ape shit yeah um and the crazy thing is is that people are so susceptible and manipulatable that the next thing you know they've got tons of people behind them behind them but the thing is that if you look all throughout human history people do not become radicalized by ideology and ultimately we might even be able to argue the ideology doesn't even matter people become radicalized by hunger right why did the french revolution did not happen because of the propaganda of the enlightenment and the masonic societies it happened because people ran out of of uh bread right nazi germany happened in some sense because people couldn't eat they talked about the inflation was so bad they had to wheel uh wheelbarrows full of german dutch marks to buy one loaf of bread that's how bad inflation was yeah so it's it's it's i i mean i think we could take it to even a deeper level it's imbalanced it's like what you need is some kind of radical imbalance and within there that's where this uh disaster starts happening on the so but imbalance at the at the level of survival needs right right but but you know but shit man it's like you can uh simulate that situation you know i mean if you can give people the impression that that imbalance is happening you know and it might not be happening quite the way you think it is then you could theoretically produce you know radicalization would be easier now listen what we did i just asked the u.s government is destabilize lots of countries in south america i've never heard that now it's not a that's a conspiracy theory um this is i we this there's a third leading cause of divorce in america which is late night podcasting and i want to synth the synth buying too many since modular synthesizers listen i want to point out what we just did and it's my fault here we were talking about the think piece the spreading of fear the uh being a polemicist and then i became it and we started talking about the bear chasing us but they're very real i mean look look there's very real things to be very concerned about it's just the question is how do you react do you react by just like you know i want to say this real quick real quick just because i have to i'm completely aware that my life experience is different than other people's life experiences i've got it real fucking good and i'm work i i'm like trying to really like work well i think we both do but we're both using it as uh to do good i hope well i hope i mean i but you do have to exercise your empathy muscle i mean i'm i whatever let socioeconomic place you find yourself whatever photon reflectivity on your skin but it is important i i don't i'm just learning like fuck man you have to really unfortunately some of us really do have to stretch so what i'm saying is i don't mean to deemphasize or say no things are actually great out there man they're just great i don't want to sound like that i know there is a clear and present danger probably in ways that we haven't even thought of you know unfortunately crazy shit crazy shit that is you know who knows what it is but all that being said what can we do now all right you want to know my 10-year plan yes all right let me lay this on you here so within the next 10 to 20 years automation is going to decimate this country okay yeah right it's starting it's our start already frankly with manufacturing the next thing is truck drivers um truck driving is the number one job in america number one it's pretty well paid too right people don't really want to do it because it's hard on their families and things like that but it's um it's it's number one job um all of that is going to go and then also all the um all the little towns along the highways are going to get decimated too because people aren't going to be stopping as much absolutely and uh that's that's now the ai the timeline of the ai apocalypse is terrifying and the scary thing is that um people have just begun to see just the first wave of it which is uh trucker jobs right so i was consulting on ai with google in 2017 and i was basically telling them you have to turn this you have to put compassion into this right and the speech i gave is on youtube you can find it if you search jason lou of google ai or something like that um now the or it may be a podcast just google it so the um that's gonna happen but people think oh it's just truck it's just those people in a middle america should i touch me look as somebody who knows about technology like no no it's going to take everything right so so first the trucker jobs like so we already have automated checkout tellers in supermarkets and banks um it's all blue collar manufacturing labor that's all going to go but white collar jobs are coming next you know how easy it is by the way people are telling people oh learn to code you know how fucking easy it is for an ai to code that's its native environment that's the first thing it will learn to do you know or just it's not even really just ai but just machine learning and brute force brute force algorithm right for his algorithms right so coding um the legal profession think about law law is all code it's just legal code that will all be automated yeah i know i i interviewed this guy at stanford about this um and he like his description was beyond satanic it but i remember thinking to myself well you know comedy at least and now i don't know if you've seen this new fucking ai that's come out that can imitate speech patterns oh the google call center worker thing it's something that just popped up where like the people who created are withholding it because they think it's the impact is going to be real rotten and they showed like uh they just took like a bunch of trump speeches and had it write a trump speech wow and i'm not saying that's the most difficult thing on the planet we've seen deep fakes and stuff like that they can copy what somebody make video of somebody right so you take so you take that ability to imitate and mix it in with the deep fakes CGI crossing the uncanny valley shit so theoretically if you have enough content out there someone could take all your goddamn think pieces then take your image and then animate that with a personality that's better at writing than you and smarter than you imagine this shit suddenly we're not quite there yet and i'm kind of skeptical whether we'll get to that point but that journalism is about to be uh i don't think we're as far let's say we're 20 years away let's say we're 40 years away all right that means we're 40 years away from you getting this unfortunate tweet hey what's up jason i really enjoyed this lecture you gave like what lecture you click on the link oh yeah it's you yeah you're giving the most inspired talk on magic you've ever seen it's brilliant man it's fucking brilliant it's on youtube it's got 500 000 downloads it's spreading all over the fucking planet and you didn't do it someone else did it and they're making money from it you don't even know who it is right you know that is crazy to imagine that this is a thing we have to worry about we are literally in potentially at the very beginning of invasion of the body snatchers and we're creating the fucking body snatchers well this is these are all potential things but the definite the definite is that within 10 within 10 years there will be massive structural unemployment in this country more than half 40 percent yeah right or well i mean like that that's a thing like i talked to people in the tech industry and they're like 70 80 they're popping it up now right and and what they say in the media is maybe is is you know they don't want to freak people out but you talk to tech people and they're like yeah like pretty much there's pretty much nothing that an ai couldn't do so here's the thing now we know for a we know obviously these big companies are going to automate everything there's not going to be any jobs the only solution that i can see is universal basic income um elon musk sees the same you know i've been thinking about ai and ai affects for two years now it is the obvious solution um uh now not to endorse anyone candidate but um universal basic income as proposed by anybody is the right answer are you running for fucking president no but andrew yang is right so andrew yang uh and by the way i recommend um listen to his podcast that he did did on joe rogan it's all laid out right and so andrew yang is an entrepreneur from san francisco how does it work i don't i mean i'm sorry i just i want universal it makes sense right you would think like oh a universal basic now he calls it a freedom dividend because people are going to be like oh my socialism but he pays for it so it's it's from what i understand it's it's really straightforward we already give people um income right in this country in the form of social security social security unemployment various other um disability disability all these things and so the plan is his plan makes perfect sense it's a thousand so everyone gets a thousand dollars a month no questions asked right and most of that is paid and i think that listen to his podcast on rogan he breaks it down specifically but um most of that is just converted over from what we're already giving people and they're basically just taking money they're already giving people and just taking the conditions off it and saying here do what you will with it because by the way somebody might want to start a business with that money instead of just letting it sit in you know food stamps or something like that you think that fixes it though it's i mean ps no i don't want to get the basic income people after me i love it let's do it if we can do it let's fucking do it i would like it if no one had to work i want to do what did andy warrell say wanted to do put carpets on the streets yeah yeah i'm all for it man if we could make it work let's do it we'll mine some asteroids get whatever it takes but i um don't understand how giving someone a thousand dollars a month is going to really help that's honestly not that much it is a band-aid right i mean 12 000 dollars a year is a band-aid but it's it could be the difference between mass social violence and misery and people at least beginning like is it the coliseums is this just no different than the room they call like the they say like towards the when the room was collapsing everyone started going to the fucking coliseums they were like trying to keep the people entertained because the whole thing was so wobbly it was going out of control like essentially like ps i don't know why i have to keep saying this universal basic income great yeah if we could do let's do it but i keep thinking like but isn't the real problem here more of a existential special identity crisis which is for the longest time we've associated who we are with our jobs oh but you haven't heard the second part of my plan i keep i'm sorry but yes you're totally right like the whole david graver thing that you're into bullshit jobs right yeah like people are all like they're taking my jobs it's like motherfucker like turn the clock back about 200 years do you know how hard people fought not to go into factories when they put uh john zersen talks about this when they put people first started putting nobody wanted to work they dragged people out of villages to chain them to benches in factories you know and uh or not change but they basically that's what that's why urbanization happened the whole uh phenomenon where there are um clocks in the center of of towns you know when that started that's when these factories put the clocks in there so everyone knew what time it was to go to work and when people tried to put the clocks in there they would constantly destroy them with rocks and try and turn them down like don't put clock time on us you know like that's the man got it so so we've yes you're totally right we've been under this delusion i mean buck buckminster fuller said in the 1970s um nobody needs to work right he said it's some point in the mid 1970s there was a point where people didn't need to work anymore it's just not necessary there's enough abundance for everyone there was enough food in the mid 1970s if properly distributed it would feed everyone in perpetuity women garbage women well maybe some people right but it's like but his point was the majority of jobs now are paper shuffling jobs right so so um so here's the plan right here's the 10-year plan what is it okay so so by the way the thousand dollars a month um his plan the math works out and i love this guy he basically his his tagline is the opposite of donald trump is is an asian who's good at math that's what andrew yang said right i love him his his laugh he's i just like i've just become obsessed with this guy he's really really really smart um and and so basically what he's saying is that most like part of the universal basic income will be paid out of what the government is already giving people and the rest will be paid by facebook amazon google and big tech companies it's like look if you guys want to make save 150 180 billion dollars from automation and by the way how much tax did amazon pay last year zero because they ran it through ireland amazon paid zero in tax last year so basically like you want to you want to destroy our country okay pay universal basic fair enough i think it's a fair deal so here to wrap up here's the future here's the 10-year plan duncan i can't wait andrew yang gets into office everyone gets 10 everyone gets a thousand dollars a month louvre raises an army of of sadhu's warrior monks and sorcerers who take a thousand dollars a month is more than enough to dedicate yourself to pursuing meditation the occult arts consciousness expansion and creating the shambhala society the truck trunk will always promise but which we will now actualized of enlightened people actively making the world better you mean like some kind of collectivization using the thousand dollars a month decentralized right but the point is it's like that the the resources are there like all the tech is there you want if you go to magic.me all the gear you will ever need and by the way i'm about to launch a huge new course with lots of new stuff but all the gear is there take the gear learn the meditation learn the magic learn everything you need to become an enlightened agent of positive change on this planet take the thousand the thousand dollar yang bucks a month that's more than enough to to to fund this type of lifestyle because by the way the only thing you need to live this lifestyle is a meditation mat and you don't really need the yang bucks it sure helps though the thousand dollars a month that sure helps it doesn't hurt man this is america you can't get by on no money well no i am thinking like if that if like universal basic income did happen and that met intentional communities so you know you get 20 people together in one place and there now there's 20 thousand dollars a month happening that's nuts like you can do a lot with that that's crazy and people if even in a family right there's the two adults they're both getting it's everyone over the age of 18 he gets a thousand a month i think yang explains so it's 2000 a month for a family or for more people you know yang what's what year is it 2020 yang 2020 yang gang blue army think about it how are you wait how are you wrapping in your fucking a cult army around this guy's presidential campaign he's providing the fun does he know you're doing this damn you like is it i was i was sending him free marketing advice i don't know if he was reading it or not he probably is yeah i mean listen you gotta like you gotta keep your your army part down like if that because what's gonna happen is people are gonna be like listen if yang gets elected lou is gonna raise an army of wizards army is a strong word what i mean is an enlightened society of high climate here's like it's the shambhala concept right yeah sure like um we know you and i both know from spirituality spiritual practices are really all okay here's what human beings need to be happy family community spiritual connection yes food basic needs covered right they're make sure their kids have a great happy life and their kids aren't family doesn't have to mean blood relatives exactly it can be chosen family can be community right intentional community so um all the great enlightened societies of the world have basically been run along those lines you know by and i can assure you hanging out with people meditating doing you know you know positive kind of rituals and having a basic family existence beats fucking 5 000 channels any day right because we're sick in this country because we don't have social and this is why i love podcasting it's like our last shred of actually being able to talk to other human beings right i wish you guys could see it we're actually sitting on the floor like two kids did a sleepover the the um here's the thing and we have to wrap it up gangbugs wizard army we do have to wrap it up sorcerer army gangbugs wizard army i love the slogan put it on a shirt and i will buy it um this is what rempache said he said these whatever your particular like big social idea is whether it's some form of socialism whether whatever the big plan you you have in mind start with a family and that is where the big change will come from because it's like if we could do that like if we can make our families work if we can make our home temples work if we can like really like give up ourselves enough so that the people we're living with can like be themselves fully uh and really not do gates buffett style fucking quantized god damn or rather monetized love quantize your love don't want quantified yeah quantified love transactional love the bane of human existence if we could do that in and those of us who are having children can like have a child who at least the intention for that kind of thing was was there then what rempache chogum jumbo was saying is this will create over time a big change now i think we are gonna have to shift hey Duncan remember when uh uh two podcasts ago when i came over what did i say Duncan the children are our future and you were like get out of my house and did i say that yes you did now listen to you i'm proud of you such a monster man thank you life comes at you fast i really well i like it man i really do and uh i'm really lucky to have you as a friend me too thank you so much for being on the show and uh i'm gonna

Thank you Squarespace. Hey look I'm sorry I know you told me not to do this anymore that I'm supposed to let you go through the dream where you think you're a monkey descendant but um I miss you and I know I always do this I guess it's I should I know it's rude I'm sorry it's selfish what am I even doing let if somebody okay I'm sorry I swear I'm not I'm gonna go right back in to being the person that you're dreaming that I am a podcaster why did you make me a podcaster in your dream you could have made me a high-pitched but you made me a podcaster so I'm just gonna I know I have a rotten voice but I'm just gonna see the song that you used to see me when I was sleeping and and then I swear I'm just gonna go right back to being Duncan Trussell man what a weird what a weird name what a weird dream you are a very very strange dream and I'm really sorry I'm sorry I always do this I miss you you're all just riverbeds for a love older than time and all of this love touches eerie finds those dark clouds inside of you that you've been hiding from they're the things that make this river run you're a squid inside the warps suspended above a fountain hey what's up guys it's me Duncan Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast I'm really sorry if you're getting like some kind of like background hum I've got a UFO that has been hovering over my backyard for the last I don't know two days and it's beautiful it looks exactly like UFOs look in pictures silver disk it's truly the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen in my life and I can't believe that I've been given the great honor of witnessing it I love the UFO and I'm really excited that it's hovering around me but it is a little frustrating because I would like to be able to talk about all the aspects of the UFO and some of the things that I've seen inside the UFO and some of the things that the UFO is helping me construct and some of the beings within the UFO but I signed an NDA don't do that the truth of the matter is that the UFO captains know what they're doing and I trust them I trust their strategies and I know that they know the best way to colonize this planet and I'm gonna help them if I can but until then let's do a commercial sweet friends if you've listened to this podcast for any amount of time you know I sometimes I try to do like you know creative commercials but I've run into a weird paradox which is that one one I'm truly one of my favorite companies Charlotte's web onto the podcast and I have to be very careful about how I talk about it so I'm just gonna read right off the sheet but you know that I do not promote anything on this podcast that I haven't enjoyed before or used and I'm a big fan of Charlotte's web so I'm just gonna read this right off the copy have you heard about hemp for health cannabinoids are naturally occurring antioxidants and neuroprotectants found in hemp plants these hemp plants and their products by the way are totally legal in all 50 states so these cannabinoids from hemp and CBD in particular are pretty popular in health circles for their ability to help maintain wellness inside and out and now you can get the benefits of hemp wherever your body needs it makers of Charlotte's web whole plant hemp extract oils and capsules now make topical creams and bombs this isn't just a little bit of their premium whole plant hemp extracts added to a soothing botanical blend this is 300 milligrams of hemp extract per ounce that's three times more than other topical brands Charlotte's web topical creams also features oleosome technology to increase absorption hemp and key botanical ingredients my darlings you are interested in hemp extracts and I've heard something about it that maybe appeals to you highly recommend Charlotte's web do I find it odd that I live in the dimension where I have to be careful when I talk about hemp extract oils yes I'm not gonna rage against the machine here though it would be very easy for me to point out the Kafka level absurdity in the fact that I cannot talk about certain things related to hemp extract oil that I would like to talk about because of the time period they were in but I'm honestly grateful that Charlotte's web hemp extract oil is available these days because when I was growing up it wasn't Charlotte's web is offering a unique offer to our listeners go to cwhemp.com and inner

for sponsoring not only this podcast but also everything that I've ever done I really appreciate all of your help in keeping me from finishing things boy does it feel good to procrastinate also a big thank you to my sweet patreon patrons I worship you and I love you and of course I am your eternal servant and I hope you continue to show me the right way to be your many spankings and wonderful corrections have taught me how to truly be an obedient servant to your iron will if you'd like extra episodes of the DTFH if you're interested in hearing me ramble for an hour or more in a disorganized way or if you just feel like listening to half baked songs that I'm excited about only because I just recently learned how to use Ableton or if you just want to hang out on the discord server which is connected to the DTFH why not head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH also we have got a whole bunch of new stuff in the shop in fact all new stuff check it out by going to dunkitrussell.com and we've got some new stuff coming including I'm pretty sure ghost cubes which will allow you to haunt your house this is one of the main complaints these days because of the problem of new construction and the extension of the human lifespan as well as what appears to be a general diminishment in the violent crimes that created so many wonderful ghosts that so many families are enjoying in their very haunted homes a lot of us don't get to have a poltergeist wraith or any kind of specter in our house you got an unhaunted house it's very similar to having an unheated hot tub it's like really nothing there just feels good and cheery and warm and light and bright there's not a heavy resounding sense of something horrific there's no smells of boiling blood and no sounds in the middle of the night no footsteps walking across your floor no sleep paralysis and of course you never get that wonderful sound of a laughing child when you get up at night to stand in front of the mirror and moan go over to dunkintrestle.com and just click on the store link and you'll see a lot of stuff we don't have the cubes in there yet also i'm not positive they're going to be cubes they could be tetrahedrons decadohedrons quadrahedrons or any of the various wonderful and amazing hydrants that are showing up these days they could also be triangles or pretty much any shape including ambiguous shapes or shape shifting things such as balloons filled with mayonnaise we'll find out i don't know i'm still waiting for the shipment to come in it's uh not not quite as easy as you might expect to harvest ghosts especially in countries where the regulations are a little different you end up you know trying to get a batch of poltergeists and you end up with demons or banshees which of course uh we're not allowed to sell in america yet but hopefully as uh the wonderful deregulation that happens continues i will be able to sell all varieties of spiritual entities but until then we're going to just do your basic moaning ghosts and some poltergeists and we'll see we'll see friends we have got a wonderful podcast for you today these days one form of art that i really appreciate is the kind that uh simultaneously transmits deep inspirational dharmic ideas without seeming sanctimonious naive idealistic or just generally sappy as someone who has deeply guilty of um transmitting some spiritual message that is wrapped up in all kinds of melodrama and uh extra sap i really love it when i find an artist who is conveying really big ideas in a simple way that is also beautiful edgy cool and just grabs your heart and pulls it out of the ice cave that it might be imprisoned in temporarily because you are afraid to melt the ice cave as abraham lincoln used to say today's guest is one of those kinds of artists not only is he a hilarious comedian he's also a prolific progenitor of beautiful beautiful comics and books and pictures and also a pretty amazing podcast which i've had the good fortune to appear on it's called the rainbow brain skull hour and it is at his website which is located at ramine nasir.com that's r-a-m-i-n-n-a-z-e-r.com i'm gonna have links to that at dunkintrussell.com but i would invite you to take a deep dive into the wonderful ocean of art and comedy that this sweet human being is exploding into our dimension now without further ado please stretch your wings out jump off of that rugged cliff face that you've been clinging to and fly straight into the glowing beautiful hypercolored undulating hypnotic spiral of sweet compassionate glorious love that makes up every single atom in today's guest body a massive welcome to ramine nasir um You You You Ramin Welcome to the DTFH this episode is brought to you by square mattress square mattress is the only sure design you can get on Your only actual mattress that is a square. It's a you know the full fucking rectangular mattress fat It's gotta end. Yeah, now we weren't meant to sleep on a rectangle We're meant to sleep on a fucking square. Do you fucking hear me? Yeah, and don't get a mattress designer that's gonna take all your money you want to you want a square mattress just regular Do you Like a angry mattress You know how every every company has a Twitter like personality now like everything is kind of funny every Every brand has a voice and it's right. That's the new thing, right? Yeah, it's going to just that's not gonna go anywhere You think it's like you're gonna meet Wendy for met Wendy's well We have to deal with it. It's like, you know the thing is is like all right. Well, they're not quite hypnotized anymore They are aware of the fact that ultimately what's happening is it could be anything But we're just trying to draw their attention to this particular thing because the more attention we get on this particular thing The more we can convert that attention into money and the money is what pays for everything So they know that kind of now. It's not serious anymore. Like yeah, you know, so you you know the serious commercials When you see them kind of feels like wait, what the fuck like what are you guys talking about? Like serious commercials all state cares all state gives a shit everyone else doesn't that's a terrible impression of it But whatever I love terrible impressions perfect impression or the new one is actually the apology commercial What's that one like uber and like some companies? Oh, yeah Moving forward. We actually care now. Yeah, we fucked up remember when Domino's like just completely Redid their whole pizza recipe like we're starting from scratch and it's so weird that no one there was no public outcry They're like no bring back the original recipe not a peep. Everyone was like, yeah, okay cool change your whole Recipe we weren't pizza. We don't care man. We're gonna keep eating it. It's like a phone number that I know It's like a website. I can easily get to But yeah, so now it's like and you see it also You know at the Emmys wrestle with it a little bit like you see any anything that is attempting to Give an aura of authority or importance these days Seems a little ridiculous. Yeah, can you tell me about the Emmys because I don't know anything about what that? You mean it's like trying to get serious of like and we care and we're going to save the climate change thing because we're actors You mean that kind of thing. So the Emmys are like, well, I mean, you know the the business we're both in is I guess one way you could put it is it's like a part of what we do is reality distortion, you know, so Comedian a dramatic actor a Producer-director-writer anybody Uh-huh Generally, who's like creating some form of entertainment is in some way shape or form emulating reality and then distorting it to some degree even News reporters do that too. Yeah, you know to make it entertaining. So The Emmys are a gathering of people who are experts at distorting reality. It's a it's a room filled with some of the greatest reality distortion Wizards, yeah, and they all wear black and they all wear black but to celebrate that their craft of distorting reality for Us because we love to watch Distorted realities. I do. I mean, oh, yeah fucking movies are the best thing ever love it only getting better Yeah, only getting better And so that's the Emmys the Emmys is when all the great reality distortion wizards of the kingdom gather together To get to celebrate the best reality distortors. Yeah, and so And because their craft is, you know, truly magical in the sense that like not only are they Distorting reality, but from the reality distortion that they're doing it produces ripples in matter So, you know, one of the sad examples of it is whenever a talking Chihuahua movie comes out People adopt Chihuahuas because the kids see it and they're like mommy. I want a chihuahua or like with the owl and Harry Potter There's so many abandoned owls when Harry Potter movies came out There was a big spike in owl purchases and then when they turned 18 or whatever and had to go to college like a lot of like What am I gonna do with this fucking owl? That's it. Yeah, that's the that's one of the byproducts of some great reality distortion is that it ends up getting things killed and Or abandoned, you know or or you know in a less sinister way of saying it is it just produces Turns a phrase, you know, so all of a sudden people will start saying groovy, baby all over the fucking place like what the fuck it's like the great reality distortion wizards they You know create entertainment and entertainment is sticky and it reflects into the minds of the people and then the people imitated so you get these for a little bit the The great mass of humanity in whatever country your thing is the most popular in begins to reflect the thing you made and Evolve that thing like kind of like what you're saying with like the new form of commercials, which is yeah, we're seeing these absurdist commercials that are you know all kind of like Replicating this absurdist form, you know and that trend is really interesting because when you think about it, it's like okay, so I Don't know. Can you think of something that's super popular right now and in the culture? What's something that's like Ariana Grande? Okay, Ariana Grande fidget spinners, or I'm probably late on that That's probably 2015. Let's go like so like Ariana Grande Slime slimes huge with 12 year olds line. There you go. Okay slime so Slime the creation of slime Making slime selling slime all of that stuff like some really cool fucking nanny or babysitter mom Figured out a way to mix. I don't know how you make it It's like cornstarch and something makes no idea that you can make it pretty easily Yeah, it's like it's something that seems like you don't want kids hands in it But it's actually safe like borax or some shit. I can't remember don't do it by the way sound safe I don't remember don't do that. I don't know how you make slime But you so like so, you know suddenly around some certain homes people are making slime Right and this is all happening because of the internet and you get slime Like recipes and like because you go to the store and you see slime for sale and you're like whoa, that's it's cool And then you realize like wait, I can make this shit and then you start making it at home, right? And so What in inevitably starts happening is They're these scouts that are sent out into the smaller Shared reality tunnels of people and so the scouts in some way or another pick up like okay. Yeah, they're doing slime Are they doing slime slime? Yeah, and then that Becomes a trend so the idea is like if I can predict cultural trends Before they like really get big then I can start producing slime and have it out there Right when the wave peaks. Yeah, and so then now I'm gonna sell the most slime Right. So anytime you see a thing that's popular what you're looking at is actually the beginning of the things end. Oh, yeah it is it's so especially with comedy and it's You see so many jokes that were like Just I don't want to say being useful. Whatever. Yeah, just like people saying like oh That's a thing or said no one ever like said no one ever was just oh, that's so funny And then you see you know an all-state ad using it and then of course it's over and I always think of a Commercial in ten years like you and I will probably think it's so funny if someone showed it to us now a commercial from ten years ago That's taking comedy from five years from now. Did I say that right? Yeah a commercial that's or it'll probably be accelerating even more By then it'll probably just do you get that feeling of especially in recent times of like oh, man I learned more in the last year than I did in the last ten years and then oh, man I learned more in the last month and I learned in the last year Oh, man I learned more in the last week than in the last month and it's just like that constantly like McKenna refers to it as the the history as a Basketball dropped and then it hits once then that time before it hits again again again again again until it's just going to be like Flickering so fast that it'll just feel like now again I think the changes are happening so quick that it'll eventually be so quick that it feels like not change again Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about like if a light flickers very very fast It looks like it's not flickering. It just looks like that's what your TV does I think it's just a bunch of flickering At least the old-school TV that cathode ray type TV. I it's it's like such a cool Thing that you're talking about and the way to like really and there needs to be a word for the strange woozy feeling that comes from observing a thing from Like 10 or 15 years ago and looking at it and realizing like this is fucking weird Oh, man. Have you been to my 80s TV comm or my 70s TV comm or my 90s TV? So it's it's just a TV on your browser and you have a channel flipper that you can go through like You know the music station and the comedy station the game show station Commercials you can filter it out but what you get to do is you get to see a whole decade in its entirety and If someone stood out as like the best artists of that decade during that time They still just sound like a 90s performer or they just sound like an 80s performer It's got its own flavor and the 2000s or it hasn't settled yet. It's like wine or something It's got to sit for a little bit before we look back and be like, oh, yeah The early 2000s did have a yeah flavor didn't it and I'm sure this one does too and yeah It's really fun to look at especially commercials like in the 70s There's a commercial for just dove soap like a bar of soap and that's like the the beginning of now There's a billion women's like soap products. You need this specific type of thing like there's never an ad for just Buy this bar of soap and rub it on your body. That seems just so pedestrian now It's yeah, you need like 18 of them But back then it was like do you want to be beautiful then own soap use soap on your body Yeah, this is cool because you you know, we do this thing with like what are the ice cores, you know You can like or I actually just read this. What's ice cores ice cores when you pull up ice from the like ancient ice You can look at the different layers of the ice and tell what the world was like How hot what think what things were happening or another way to put it is sedimentary layers or I just read this awesome article about the Magnetic shift that happens on the planet and how they figured this out by finding a stalagmite tight No, he's getting confused. I don't remember which is which the stalagmite stalactite problem One comes from the ground one comes from the roof of a cave, but tight and might tight and might okay But also a wonderful comedy duo Fucking hilarious, but the so the iron filaments and these stalagmites or tights. It's some point Change direction that you can actually see the iron filaments changing direction based on the Shift of the poles. Do you know how often it shifts? Well, that's one of the scary ideas. I think this one happened 150,000 years ago 90,000 years ago, but I think one of the arguments is the shifting is Slow in the sense and because in geologic time over 150 years is not a long time Yeah, so to see it shift that quickly is really like fucking weird because all of our technology is based on the poles being a certain way and if the if the shit shifted All of a sudden then we would like a lot of what we use to run society would no longer function in the way We need it to function. So anyway, the point is these cultural stalactites, which are the the digitized records of things that Exit are on the internet now actually show us the Sort of cultural north and south the cool And we could see where the filaments were being drawn to this thing or that thing, you know And at that time the influencers were people who had access to the technology, right? So NBC ABC CBS Paramount Warner Brothers the studios is their call these things They had access to the tech and the tech is the what creates the magnetism, which draws the culture, you know Oh, yeah, right, right and now we all have access to the tech So we're dealing with all these fucking magnets that are all over the fucking place. So everybody's compass is going spinning around Yeah, there is no central thing anymore, and it's good It's good, but it's a little fucking confusing if you're somebody who's entire existence or Modalities was you know being taught to you by the studios by the state. That was another compass, you know the school systems You know you go into school. It's a compass. It's like it's a rather. It's a magnet. It's like here's what's Law Here's what's good. Here's what's bad Yeah, but for the space cadets like you and I and listeners of this podcast like because I imagine at least 98% of listeners of this podcast are space cadets. I don't know. They've got to be Like I think they're gonna they're they're gonna be fine and the upcoming changes because we're already spaced out anyway and thinking about this stuff But the people in like the very rigid state are having the most trouble with it Well, this is a problem because what so I was just having this great conversation with a friend of mine Jason Lou he's really cool. Oh, yeah, ultra culture.org. Yeah. Yeah, I gotta Man, we were chatting you should have him on your show. He's wonderful, but we were talking about You know a thing that happens to people like us as space cadets as you call them when you're young So you sort of like look around and you see people who are like in a deep hypnotic trance, right? Now you like to pretend you're not in one you're in a different type of trance and they are but at the time you're like I'm not that trance. Yeah classic cheesy movie example that I think really did just like impact a lot of us Sort of like psychedelic Narcissists who all wanted to be Jesus at the time was when Jim Morrison climbs on top of the car in the doors movie and says And we see that Man But what we would do is we wouldn't get on the car we'd go to the shopping malls, right? And we would like take acid and we'd look around to the people and they're sort of like Materialistic hypnotic state with their bags or doing the mall walking thing and just experiencing the uncanniness of that level of consumerism through the lens of like LSD or whatever Yeah, that's how we would do it, right? But the point is on top of that because we've been given a kind of extra footing so to speak which is like we had tethered ourselves from the Gravity well of whatever was being you know broadcast by the studios or by the corporations We then had this extra little ability to sort of go to these people who were in a trance stay and fuck with them Right. Yeah, and so for a lot of us that it for me. This is what I was telling Jason is like I can remember I was like, you know Just I've been like doing a lot of like going back into my past and like thinking Remembering stuff, but one of the things I can remember you feel like it's it's coming back more like you're being able to remember More of your past as you get older Well, I'm what it is is like because now that both my parents are dead. I can free finally I can For many people that is That's just a joke. I mean I just yeah, oh god It's not I mean the thing about it is the only the only reason I clarified a joke because of course It's a joke, but I'm just wondering if it could be construed as like oh he wishes his parents are dead Of course, I don't wish my parents were oh Well, I mean watch watch out my friend explore that a little bit more There's a the thing is we exist on so many different levels. How many times do you have you? I mean, I don't know if you ever did it, but certainly one thing that a Toddler in the midst of a kid in a chantra might yell at their mom or dad. I wish you were dead Oh, yeah, of course That's like saying cunt when you're a toss I have us I have a very clear memory of like telling my mom like you hate me and like the I Remember her face like changing in that moment because the toddler or not toddler, but little little little me was anticipating her Trying to convince like no no, I'd you know coming back with something But the amount at which it hurt her and like shocked her in that moment stuck me for oh man forever I'm like, oh, I'll never I'll never say that to anyone again. That's not a that's that's even though it's tiny It's still manipulative and not good and of course not true unless you do have one of those parents that you know The secret hating there's a there's a little bit of them, right? There's What's there's a term for it? It's an Italian term like the mother that Spights the that is mean to the kids to spite the father. There's like a specific old term for it I don't know if only Daniela Bolleli was here. He would maybe know it. Oh, I mean the the the variety of strange games being played in the human nests all around this planet I think are as infinite as grains of sand on the beach. There's so many different strains I mean when you say, you know, look at my mom's face when I said I What is it? What is it? She said to you? Oh, I said I said to her You hate me because she was trying to get me to practice violin, which is of course in my in my benefit Yeah, but you know again like so now you've got this so your mom looks you mom here's that She this triggers all kinds of things in her feelings of like fuck. I must not be a good parent or oh my god What am I doing wrong or all this stuff? She reacts, right? But you see a thing that trembles in her face You don't know what that's connected to that could be connected to some memory of her mom her dad That could be connected to some past trauma But because you're a little kid and you see that look on her face You think I have caused this ripple in the pond you didn't cause it you just said a certain thing But you're a kid whatever you're saying come on am I gonna really take it that seriously? Yeah, you're shooting foam arrows, baby It's like the thing is when that foam arrow hit your mom it rippled the pond you see the ripple I must have done it I'll never do that again because kids are hyper fucking sensitive, right anyway The point is all those little moments that happen to us there's a little micro traumas happen to us Based on the way the environment reacts to us as children form the way we act in the world You know everybody's like I want to look at my past lives. Yeah, it's tough at first, but I'm drawn back to This is when I first learned about who you were I think it was early Joe Rogan experience and he's talking about how he let you stay at his place when you were going through a bad Breakup or something and you were going in his flotation tank for the first time and you try to hide stuff from yourself But if you're in that flotation tank, it's going to especially if you eat an edible or something before It's going to bring out every little thing from your past and show it to you like what's what's this thing? How can we haven't talked about this? What's what's this one? Oh, this is a big juicy one. Let's talk about this There's no escaping it You You You You You You You Yeah, that's right and and all those things are like You know many of many people see these things as Something to be avoided for their entire lives and or they have to avoid it because they can't look at it You know because it's it's like you're not ready to deal with it, you know and I think probably at that phase. I was like summoning up a pretty Idealistic idea of how memories work or you know, but you talking about flotation tank you Okay, because I also want you to go back to when you were saying that your your parents died And then I said finally and because I wanted you to finish that thought too because I'm I try to be a I try to be a concept Sherpa and like get Like revisit the stuff we might have missed in case the listener is like what happened to that thing that I was listening to A minute ago one thing I hope is by now my listeners know that like you never might believe in that We could definitely end up in some weird tributary. Yeah, it's mr. Toad's wild ride for sure. No, but the essence of the thing is And this isn't a concept I'm working with right now and it does connect to your Finally that your parents have died which by the way You said it as a joke but There are Countless people on this very day Whose mother or father has passed away after a long battle with this thing or that thing and One piece of them is going finally For sure and then that piece chirps up and they think that's all of them and so they're like my god I must be a monster. It's like no, that's just a piece of you. That's okay to think that It's okay to think that because that is a part of it. We do celebrate sometimes when our parents pass away because the Death is For the living a very very very difficult process and there is a relief that comes now Anyway, that being said and some people man, they're actually celebrate when their parents die because their parents are Were like abusers. Yeah, and there's a sense of being like freed, you know, so the past the exploration of the past is Our own personal past. I think is a very very Worth while exploration, right and I've been thinking about it in terms of inheriting a Familial home Okay, dude, I love this fucking game darkest dungeon. Have you played that game? No for what steam? It's on steam. Okay, is it new? It's old. It's an old RPG. It's an old Lovecraftian horror RPG Where you go back home? You're you've been summoned back to your familial home this old decrepit fucking like Manor house and you have to go into the dungeons and the Attics and the forests and gather up relics and heirlooms that are somehow become scattered all about and you don't know What's going on? You don't really know what you're you figure it out as it happens, but it's a classic HP Lovecraft shit It's like, you know, it's it's really Really what I love so much about the game is it's incredibly difficult and you get one life So you have all these various characters when they die. They're dead. You don't get them back It saves on the cloud the fucking guys are dead so But then also what I like about it is the encounters that happen Can you say that again? It goes in they go in the cloud after you die you get a random saves it You don't see you like in other words like you're not auto saving But which which guy dies your player will you assemble parties? So you have this never-ending roster of people who keep coming into the town in a caravan To try to make money helping you do this work of essentially Oh, so it's trying to set it up that if a person dies, it's like that actual randomly generated person is gone Okay, I like that you just one life. You have one life. It's a game where you have one life I like it to go back So any fucking decision you make is permanent, but then also the characters they go insane Right so because they're stressed of seeing these horrific beings and the shadows there They actually start losing their fucking minds and you have to put them in like mental Asylums and you have to like they get diseased. It's just a fun game, right? But I love that game not just because it's fun, but because it's like When you begin to go down into your past, it's very similar. You're going back. There's all these relics Scattered in your past, right? Yeah, a lot of those relics are buried underneath layers of amnesia Layers of shit that intentional distraction from people in your life who didn't want you to remember that or see it because it's so bad Yeah, or just you know protective membranes constructed by your psyche because you can't deal with it and so This is the thing man, you know, so many people are Going to hypnotists or doing their own meditative practices to try to remember their past lives While not going into their fucking life's past Dude who gives a fuck if you were Napoleon How about the fucking fact that you know when you were 11 years old you were exposed to hard core pornography? How about that? How did that? Yeah as opposed to seven, which is when you're supposed to get it nowadays But no, you don't have to be so like that's a purse personal and anecdote like so the the exploration of the past is a very Scary for some people it is like taking a lantern and going down Do you ever have you how far back have you gone personally? Can you do you ever end up uncovering stuff that like wow? I thought the earliest I could remember was three, but it turns out I have a little bit of a memory when I'm two I Dude my like I you know my Now that my parents have passed I'm like able to like open this vault up and really go deep down in there so it's like The so far I can like tell you the exact you mean just mentally or going through objects So like I can like I've actually been sort of charting it out. I think I have it here somewhere I've I've like gotten back to I Was born in 1974 So I can get back to Right around You know with scattered memories here or there on 1982, okay And then I can sort of like wait six is your earliest memory What's that? I think I was eight right eight your earliest well not earliest I've got early early once right, but eight's where it all starts getting real clear That's when the divorce happened before that it's a big old fucking fog Scary fog to you. So that's what I'm kind of like working on like are you the only child brother? That's right. Okay. You are your parents brother. Yeah, they're together your parents have been together your whole life. Uh-huh Wow, okay, cool. Yeah, I remember a couple of like serious fights, but never like not I think there's there's There's bickering sometimes, but it's never like Anything more than you'd see in any other marriage, but I've had together parents. It's been good in that sense Good and did you guys? Move around a lot. We moved from Sarnia, Ontario to Edmonton, Alberta in Canada Then all the way to Lake Jackson, Texas Then I went to college in Austin, Texas then here in LA So I had like half Canada and then half like small town. Why the move? Dad's job. What was the job? Chemical engineer for Dow Chemical Well, your dad's smart your parents are smart is your mama? Uh-huh. Yeah My mom's got a PhD in physics actually But she ended up not doing that which is funny because I always try to talk to her about Quantum physics stuff because I'm like I said space cadet and I'll watch like a nasim haremine Holo fractal like two-hour lecture about why you know The proton is the jewel of Indra's net and like why all the information in the proton is the same as though the whole thing And I like try to show her this thing. It's like have you seen this? Have you seen that we're all but she's just much more into Newtonian like material science like cares more about that and I'm just so much more woo woo So it's always this interesting dynamic It tests out my knowledge of of that woo woo because it's easy to watch something whether it's pyramid Stuff or or holo fractal or simulation theory and then be inspired by it and have it light you up And then to go talk to someone who hasn't seen that video try to relay what you just saw to them that tests what you're What your understanding of it is and it's good for you. It's a fucking physicist I mean, it's like it's not like you're going to your you know I mean it's like you're going to your friends and like relaying some shit It's like somebody who's got a trained scientific mind. Yeah, he's gonna hear whatever it is that you have to say and like Look at it like I don't know man like let's explore it a little deeper and then the next thing you know It's like oh shit. Yeah, it's just sounds cool, right? But I think it's there you can stand in two places You can stand in the material and it's real or you can stand in the ethereal or spiritual or whatever The word you want to call it the not material and they're both just as real as the other But they're on opposite sides of the coin so if you're standing on one you're not Standing on the other, you know that Joseph Campbell quote where it's at the end of a long thing But he goes like are you the light shining out of the bulb or are you the bulb? And I asked that to my mom and she's like the bulb and I was like, oh It's so funny that you'd pick the bulb as the answer and not Not the light shining out of the bulb. Do you remember when you were coming up? Your parents explained to you the scientific method or did you when they were teaching you as a child? Do they like try to impart a kind of Rationalistic approach to interpreting reality not overly like I guess We would They wouldn't try to like push religion away because there wasn't like a lot of religious like coming into me I guess there was just kind of nothing But my mom loved Carl Sagan and they just loved sci-fi and and books and we had a telescope and would look at the stars And be like that's Jupiter and that's like, you know a hundred thousand times bigger I know it's not a hundred thousand times bigger than earth whatever size bigger than earth It is they would describe that and then I think when I started to meet religious people or when I went to Bible camp for a Few weeks because I was staying with family friends And then we went to this Bible camp thing and when I'm learning all these new concepts of like God is everywhere God can hug you right now if you reach out your arms you can hug God and then I remember going to my dad and asking like what is what's all of this stuff here? And then then you had to say like yeah, don't tell anybody this but I'm what they call an atheist So I don't I don't believe in that stuff, but people are sensitive about it And you know no one knows the answer. So I mean he's really wise Philosophically and isn't to poetry and room me and all that kind of stuff. Oh, yeah, the best dad. Yeah, holy shit What a perfect response. I'm putting that in the fucking soon to be a dad bank. Oh, yeah Do you think about like I mean really there's not much you can do but there's so many parents thinking about like how am I gonna stop? My kids from seeing, you know, adult things. How am I gonna stop them from seeing porn or violence? Like I don't know man. How so their eyes shut I'm gonna cover my child's head with a sackcloth What about in 2032 when they can transmit images directly into the brain not through the the retinal Cavity 2032. Yeah, you know probably sooner. I'm just giving that ballpark. I'm gonna use a quadrillion lance to disrupt his synaptic cleft to prevent him from receiving any kind of data from the He just blocked that with a level three cloak of fuck you dad That's gonna be so cool just I mean you've probably already thought of all this but he gets a record Your your your son that's not even born yet, which he's maybe just floating around in the DMT world or something right now He exists just he hasn't come come into or the soul is in the womb or who knows the things But he has so much record of his father Speaking like there's you on record saying yeah, we're trying to have a kid right now And then there's you on record on a podcast going like yeah And we're gonna have a kid now And he's got a record of him talking to his grandma that he never got to meet with his dad. That's super cool He's got all this he probably won't care when he's seven or nine or something But oh man like when he's a little bit older That's a big like treasure trove of like look at all these conversations of like we don't have that you and I don't have that No, we don't I mean we do have it. It's just the way we have it is in a different form But it's it's like seven black and white photos or something I think it's like epigenetics and like there's a way to like come commune with them probably but it's the the Trick I'm trying to use when it comes to my son is To be in the moment and so the mind wants to prognosticate Well, fuck what am I gonna do when he's a teenager? What I'm gonna do when he wants to drive What am I gonna do if he like wants to play football? All these things you know George Harrison's son was in a military school and like that drove his dad quite crazy Just that all of it. Yeah, all the potential things, but I keep thinking like well if there's a what one thing I would love to impart on him is the Wonderful quality of the present moment and that we can plan and it's good to plan But it's better to be like in this place, you know and To teach that you have to be in it as much as you can So that's one thing is like I just you know when my mind starts trying thinking about this shit It's like let's just be here right now. Yeah, and then when I'm with my wife You know and I and I'm laying with her and I'm like talking to my son through a belly You know, it's like I'm here now. We're here now and then or you know, this is where we are now Yeah, that's what it is and otherwise man. I'm gonna freak the fuck Idea some goddamn teen Yeah, you can't operate in that way and we all we all know not all of us But I guess you and I know that we have to be here now and it's all about the present moment But like I'm sure you experience the fading of of that stuff, right? Like the first time you read be here now and you read about Bogvandos telling him like don't worry about the future be here now Don't worry about the past be here now and then it resonates with you But then after a few months that books on your shelf and you're having trouble being here now Even though the book says be here now and it's got all the that's an interesting thing to bring up Which is it, you know, I think of this in terms of this is when the gravy is congealed, right? So like we've got this wonderful It's kind of a gross example. Scoot do it talking slime gravy congeals It like you get a gravy if like you're at somebody's Thanksgiving dinner And they got gravy and it's been sitting there too long it gets this gross film on the top Right and so when it comes to ideas of the present moment or be here now or any of that shit the shit congeals In your mind, so it's like you're like, I don't even know what that even you don't even know what it means anymore Yeah, because it's your because the present moment is now It's not the present moment that you experienced two years ago like that present moment. This is now now this one rules Yeah, this is I'm on I'm on the DTF H Yeah, I'm I'm literally on the DTF H right now. Yeah, and listener. You're listening to the DTF H That's like that's a good moment right there. You found an episode here, yeah, exactly and That thing You know it like finding it is it's like a wonderful Easter egg Hunt which is like all this right now is fucking cool, man. I'm getting to hang out with you. I'm here in my studio It's nice. It's but you know at some point Turbulence will come right and it'll seem crazy and all these things will happen to us Our minds are gonna be pulled in a million different directions Yeah, that place we go back wait. I think oh here it is again And then you find it. Yeah, right, but it's just this is now and This now is so wonderful and this now is actually all you got like Marcus Aurelius, have you read any Marcus Aurelius? I've seen gladiator Is that what you're referring to? Is Marcus Aurelius the emperor and gladiator? Isn't he I thought he was the Russell Crowe character, but I'm a dumbass. Oh, no Marcus Aurelius was an emperor. No, you're not dumbass But it's funnier to say that, you know talk about your art yet, man, but like Marcus Aurelius Is a stoic philosopher emperor guy who Was max Aurelius the guy, I don't know. I don't know I don't you know I For some reason I did enjoy gladiator, but I can't remember too much of it Now doesn't seem like he'd quote or it doesn't seem like he's the quote kind of guys more like the silent wise kind of guy But go on what's his quote? Well, the quote is more like it's not the idea is like this frame that you're in right now is It this is it this is where you're at and so a lot of people get really connected to One thing that I in the past have been very Really stupidly thought Is when I die I lose My past so when I was conceiving death I was conceptualizing death Is the complete Disengagement or collapse of all the other moments that have passed right? Yeah now this is Absolutely insane Because those moments have already passed They're gone. Yeah, and people can think of death. I'm like, I'm gonna lose it all. No, no, it's gone You're dead. It died. It's gone. Bye. Bye. It's gone. It's just stored up in your mind Now what there is is this moment and then there's your mind, right? And the mind is going into this vast Library or familial mansion Right, and it's pulling out books And it's reading the books Into the present moment. Yeah This is the play of what you are So scared and numb of your name and what you like and you you did and how it happened and oh, fuck You're gonna get fucked when you do that thing. Why just say what did you do? You know, that's the temple of the self is these weird monks pulling down strange tomes that have been Written neurologically and stored in this archive and they're pulling the fucking tomes out And they're like, there's a person who's gonna hurt you. Don't you see the pattern you're in Don't trust that person. This reminds me the person who did the thing, right? And so that's That's what we're doing. We're basically dropping these colored neurological memory drops into the present moment Yeah, and that is what defines us as a being, right? So anyway, oh man, I like that a lot the um You you've heard a lot of Eckhart toll, right? Yeah The the one that helped me a lot was the way he described that Anything in the future Even if it's in the future 100 years from now or 10 weeks from now or whatever is going to be experienced as the present moment No matter which place you're in everything you experience is as present moment. So if you don't that's right If you don't train to do that then you're not going to do well in the other one. So there's only one place you can train This is it Oh man and and you know to like the the Marcus Aurelius The stoics they remind us of that. So it's just like this reminder of like, okay Why are they called stoics because they just sat and thought great fucking no No, the term stoic is that that comes after I don't know why they ended up calling stoicism what it is There was like a whole branch of philosophy that like I always thought of is like, oh that must mean it's austere But it seems to be it reminds me a lot of like greek buddhism or greek Taoism, you know, it's just more Based on like but it's the weird thing is Marcus Aurelius. I think tortured christians, but i'm not sure. Oh good See going with the parent-dead thing again It's the it's the easiest and kind of most fun if you're around the right people Thing and I guess jim norton does it a lot. He's not the only one but just the Anytime anyone says anything just if you say the most horrible thing you can think of just immediately afterwards It's like, you know, if someone's saying like, oh, what should I what should I do this afternoon hang hang yourself? Yeah, yeah, that's mitzi or gary shanling. I kill you. So yeah that thing the darkling trip. It's like Dude, I did that for a while. I still do it sometimes like it's fun to like, you know Pull out a dead cat in the middle of the party or whatever and then it's just like I have to analyze my like the intentions behind it you know, it's like What it's okay to pull a dead cat out though And some people are really good at it. I like particularly jim norton man like when like to see the hissing horror In the eyes of people who have been offended by one of norton's characters or just General sense of disease or like when you if you're lucky enough and you get offended by jim norton, you know Like if that moment happens where you're actually That's a joy, you know, I love that feeling but Yeah, that queasy feeling is so cool and somewhat to master it like administering that sense of nausea Uh, whatever you want to call it. It's fucking cool, man. But it's to you know, the you you are You know Something that I am Perplexed about because you're so many different things, you know, and I only understand some of them One of the one of them in particular your art Holy fucking shit, man. Oh, thank you. You you you you have produced uh A really beautiful way of transmitting What I consider to be the great data Uh, the the or you know, it sounds so cheesy to say no keep keep going dharma You know through your art and in the way you're doing it is I think uh skillful means, you know, which is that when I'm looking at your art and I'm Reading the points that you're making I don't feel like you're being sanctimonious, you know, I don't feel like I feel like it makes sense It's inspiring and what's really the other thing that I find quite beautiful about it. Is it simple? It's really not a complex The equations you're presenting to us are very very simple Which to me is the most difficult thing to do There's not a lot of fucking like Fat there, you know, yeah, it's difficult in the getting in your own way part of it Like it's but it's the easiest thing to do if you actually get there and find the thing because we all have it inside of us the deep I mean sometimes they call it shower thoughts or something but like we all have that or maybe we don't I don't know some people maybe just have nothing going on but Uh, what are you creating? What what is the what what is the medium you're using to make what the image is? Yeah, I draw them by hand and I color them in photoshop And sometimes clean them up a little bit if I screw up the ink drawing But just ink pen on paper Scan using my phone used to use a printer scanner and then I discovered the phone scans at 600 dpi So just scan it in like that and then color it which came first stand up or the art Oh art because I've just always I started uh So I've played violin since I was five and I've drawn cartoons since I guess also that age so I used to just be all about music and Then was just doodling a lot in in classes and I didn't start doing like comic books till college and I started drawing a strip called strippy for My university newspaper and they used to pay me I think like 10 bucks a strip and I remember thinking like oh man It's it's easier for me to draw one of these than it would be to draw a $10 bill That'd be like really hard to draw a $10 bill so I can draw my own type of $10 bills And it wasn't just for money, but I liked that I did that and I had a little an audience This was pre like social media. So I would put it out people would read that newspaper I'd have my email there. So if people really liked it sometimes they'd reach out through email or something. So I got that going and stand up Happened after I got uh, I got a dwi I didn't get an actual one, but I got pulled over for drunk driving and I had to go to the jail for 24 hours wasn't wasn't convicted of it got the travis county jail in austin texas. How many people are in there with you? um 30 there was one guy I was chained to for like 12 hours and then I got unchained from and I got to have my own cell That was the best part because then I got to be in my own place The worst part was just thinking about like having to Tell my parents about it, which I was already independent from them, but I didn't want to hide it from either just Yeah, and I called my dad the next day and I told him that uh, yeah Are you sitting down? I got something bad to tell you and he's like sure I said I got arrested last night I got a dwi charge and uh, I was in jail for the last 24 hours And then the first thing he says is did you give breath test and then I go Yeah, I breathed because I thought I was under and he goes you never give these bastards evidence That's the first thing he said is just you never you don't ever give the bastards evidence and uh Yeah, that was that was a good lesson, but off the hook off the hook of the thing. Oh, that was um My my blood alcohol level was just so close to the legal limit It was just barely over So if I pled no contest and because I was young and no criminal record and you know an Upstanding citizen of uh, blah blah. I guess technically I'm white then right if I can get off like that I joke about it's an old patrice O'Neill joke about like how there's different white people like how Japanese are the white people of asians and you know persians are the white people of of middle eastern people so Uh, I mean I've had I've had if you were like more complexed you would have been fucked. I think so. I think that's It's been uh shown not that you're always fucked. I'm sure there's like plenty of probability goes. Yeah, and there's great There's great cops too. I mean not to go down all that rabbit hole But just you know, you hear about uh a gang shooting like I heard someone recently got like was in an uber I don't want to out their name or anything But their uber driver was shot in the head because of a gang drive by and you know We spent all this time being like a stupid cops and like just power tripping bad things And then you hear about gang shooting random innocent uber driver and it's like, okay Yeah, it is kind of good to have cops sometimes but then there's the argument of like Yeah, the gangs wouldn't have to do that if the cops weren't in it's the endless cycle What do you mean the gangs wouldn't have to do it? The gangs wouldn't have to shoot uber drivers if there are no no cops Well, there that wouldn't exist if there wasn't a weird drink. Yeah We gotta keep killing these uber drivers until it's fucking anarchy No lift drivers only uber but hold that whole tangent of stand-up started because I I got the dwi and then in the jail Cell like I had a lot of time to think about what I was doing with my life It's like is this really what I want to do just work I was at the time doing web development So just web developing and then going out at night with friends and drinking and then driving Home is like that's a stupid life. That's not what I want to do here It's like what do I want to do and then like at the time stand-up seemed like this impossible one Like I was a musician, but I wasn't a I wasn't a comic that takes like how does that even work? How do you even start where do you go? And then me and my friend my best friend in the whole world Mike Sears was You know he sat with me by a river and we had a long talk about stand-up We decided to start stand-up together We were like we'll just go to this open mic and if there's no one they're great if everyone's they're great If it's who cares we'll just see what it is and it turned out to be just the best night of the whole year Who knows if it was a shitty night? Maybe I wouldn't have done stand-up But it was packed and everyone was not everyone was doing well like half the people were Doing well. There was like a few stand-outs. I remember a Doug Mellard if you don't know Doug Mellard He was one of the the guys that stood out to me Brendan Walsh was there at the time in Austin He was Brendan was like in the big kids table like it was that table of like oh, those are the seniors You don't go sit at that table like that's the that's the big scary ones and then you know you start doing the open mics and then the open mics turn into MC spots turn into feature spots eventually you get to headline off nights and the one day you wake up and you're like Oh, shit. I'm at that table and Brendan and them are they haven't lived here in years How did I become sitting at this table and then you grow from even sitting at that table till leaving your home base? Mine was Austin some people's it might be portland, seattle Chicago Dallas anywhere and then you Move out and start over pretty much if you moved to new york or la you kind of have to start over Because there's just too much good talent and yeah, there's not enough spots No one's going to call you up like hey, we need someone to fill the spot. No, that's filled You got to you got to reach out to people about it. I'm fascinated by that. You know, this is a when I was really getting into vr Um, that was the thing I kept thinking like whoa, man. This is gonna redefine so many artistic industries and and you know, it's we're not There Yeah, 10 years it'll hit scale. That's what gary v says and some other people 10 years Yeah, like a lot of people are jumping on it now the same way that You know the phone took a little while to become mainstream now you have to really it's weird if you don't have a smartphone Someone's a kook if they're like well, I've got a phone, but it's not a smartphone. I have a well The problem though with stand-up in particular is sound It's like it's not so much it is it's a lot of things but they're you know, Clearly the problem is like getting across like yeah, Todd glass could do a whole number on on the The you know how specific he is about the mic set up the audience set up the ceiling's got to be low the It's it all. Yeah the lighting stage tuner. He doesn't just play the piano He fucking tunes it and he tunes it in this great way. It's I love that. I love that. He's right too, but it's like uh The the technologically one of the problems with it is that If you're going to perform for a virtual audience These are all people who are in different places all over the planet And they all have different mics And they all have different ways of transmitting sound you're talking about doing stand-up in a vr setting. Yeah Yeah, it's like because you know what you're talking about there the moving that so there's the pilgrimage that inevitably happens for the stand-up comic which is that Before you're ready Or too late or just when you're ready Whatever you get the call and you drive to new york or you moved in new york you moved to la to Begin to like refine your talent And so that is a huge that's a mystical journey that pilgrimage is a mystical pilgrimage for so many comics I mean it really is truly a like Fucking holy goddamn. Yeah. I remember the plane flight over here just seeing that grid of lights Like that now i'm used to it But the the grid of la light stretches as far as the eye can see and just everywhere else It's like oh, there's the city, but here it's like where is the city? It's this it's this whole span of everything. Yeah, and those beginning Months or years and the feeling of like whoa What the fuck am I doing the first year is worthless and the first three are kind of worthless I feel like I've just kind of found my stride here and it's a beautiful Path and it's a scary path for a lot of people but like when you know, I love thinking about technological disruption. Yeah, and um Particularly, you know, like the place I live at You know, we just got a you know, one of the problems is the ways is determined that this is like a through a through way So suddenly a street that maybe at one point didn't have a lot of people now It's got a river of cars going up. That's weird because that's such a hilly area Yeah, and you wouldn't think it is but I guess ways doesn't factor that in happened right and then on top of that um So we see that's a technological disruption uh And so many To get back to the idea of like history being a fucking Basketball on the on the bouncing on the fucking floor of time the gymnasium of time or whatever The gymnasium of time Now we're seeing all these like other forms of technology like almost any crazy problem that's happening in the world right now Is in some way shape or form related to disruptions being caused by interconnectivity and so When it comes to comedy Stand-up comedy in particular It is only a matter of time before The technology emerges Where you could put on a show in VR space That is indistinguishable from a show in actual space We can't do it right now. Yeah, because You can't there's no fucking way to create some Unified microphone field for the audience. So if you want to know what like next time you go on stage apply some mindfulness to How important not just how you sound is But your ability to hear the audience And you realize like you're doing some very deep listening You're listening to shuffles and rustles and you like, you know, you're listening to something Very deep, which is the sound of a unified crowd. Yeah, and especially like the different scales of it You understand this better than I do probably because you've gone on the road with rogan and stuff like seeing those Like thousands of people audiences and the way you have to Change yourself and your timing to fit within those waves of laugh as opposed to like a room with 300 Did you find yourself having to really like recalibrate like oh, I wasn't expecting that like big amount of love energy I just fucking giant rooms little rooms all rooms. There's always a kind of like my like some It's like it's surfing or it's a wave and you feel like you're it's a temporal wave made up of a Gestalt so to speak and so you've got a sort of like, you know You're always going to be within that wave And attuned to it in some way way But you don't want to attune too much to it because now you're like You know, that's when you fall into like the realm of saying what you think they want to hear and it's like don't Fucking do that, but then don't fall too outside of it I'm not gonna say what they want to hear and like do like sort of like unskillful Jim Norton style things just like no, I'm just gonna fucking just say whatever I want by the way That's not a gym Good at it when people aren't good at that jesslin that good at it Yeah, people aren't good at it And it's like wait you're just doing the opposite of saying it's a tightrope man If you're if you miss it a little bit you suck But if you nail it like yeah, just so nick nails it. There's nothing more Well, there's so many annoying things but it's very annoying And I think any of these things I'm allowed to say because I've been it at some point But there's nothing more annoying than seeing A fucking Unfunny edge lord. Yeah on stage Who's like burping out some bullshit offensive quote offensive shit and people aren't laughing And then they say I know why you're not laughing. It's because you're afraid to laugh That you see I've seen it so many times. You're just afraid. No, they're not afraid to laugh. It's not funny I never did that on stage, but I was guilty of it internally where like a booker of something would be uh you know Upset with me for doing a particular joke on a showcase night and I was like really defensive I'm like what it did well and like what george carlin said this and this and this and this and now looking back on is like Oh, did you a stupid four year in comic just compare yourself to it's okay to do that because george carlin did it Fuck you piece of shit one of the signs one of the signs whenever i'm comparing myself to george fucking carlin It's time to just fucking stop and get the notebook out and start writing Fuck you eat your own ass It just is like so yeah, so yeah that kind of Um ability to attune yourself to the audience and then from that attunement Understand sort of the shape of the canvas and then paint your own painting This is you know, it takes a lot of different input variables and the sound is crucial so like With doing shows in virtual reality space To attune yourself to avatars To attune yourself to people who are like potentially, you know sitting on their mattress, you know Yeah, or what if even farther they're occupying like like one time you had a ginger man watching you a gingerbread man watching you What if his ear is like it takes in sound differently through those gingerbread man ears to the to the receiver It's like oh, I got to speak in a lower tone so he can hear me That's it. But one day this all these will be worked out because live performance is um You know such a massive fucking industry and if suddenly you could in whatever particular performance field you're in You Create a infinitely Large venue to perform with it and charge tickets for it And not leave your house Infinitely large venue. Yeah. Dear Christ. Did you see maria bambford's last special old baby? I haven't seen she starts Performing in front of a mirror. So it's just her then it's her in front of her parents in their living room Then it's her in front of a park bench with like four friends Then it's in front of just a little like coffee shop Just a few people then it's in a like small divey club Then she's performing in front of a comedy club a big one Then she's performing in a theater Then she's performing in an arena and then finally she's like out in the galaxy He's like just performing in front of it all and the yeah, she's one of the greatest and her reasoning for that was that she said A friend saw her do the exact same set with the same You know kind of response, but when she saw her during the coffee shop She was like And then when she saw her in the theater is like whoa, that was that was something else That was really good when it was in fact the same thing But she was influenced by the amount of people Laughing at it. That's what made it feel like it was. Oh, yeah that better phenomena And it's like now it's it's so curious because it's like shit man when you know stand up was You know growing and evolving or when any kind of performance was growing and evolving In the early days this stage was the most advanced technology That was advanced technology getting on stage and having props or a lot of lights or any kind of like Artificial lighting or anything like that that was cutting edge, right? So now what we're seeing and it kind of goes back to this like what we were talking about in the beginning is that now The stage is appearing Everywhere Now it's fucking instagram now. It's your podcast now. It's your tweets now It's your facebook and there's the physical stage and there's the stage So now what we're witnessing is like this thing is happening, which I just read it's a great term Opticon. Have you ever heard of that? No, what's it mean? So an opticon is a is a name for a type of fascist state where Everyone's watching everyone else. It's called an opticon. That sounds great Well, it's great unless the people who are watching you are also Simultaneously turning you in or like, you know snitching on you But if everyone can see everything then then the truth is right then there's no distortion of the truth Opticon would be fantastic. Isn't that what bitcoin is essentially and isn't that what interest net is? Essentially too. It's that if everyone is watching everyone everyone has the data of everyone else Well, no, I think interest net bitcoin you could say are more related to the concept of dependent origination, right? so Like Everything's connected to everything else one part of the net trembles all the net trembles, right? And this is like goes back to this cultural magnetic filament thing Which is that the tremble and the net tremblers formerly were the studios formerly were the TV shows the the musicians and who had but they did to tremble the net You needed to have an amplification device powerful enough to tremble the fucking net, right? And now we all have the amplification device to tremble the fucking net. Yeah, we're all net tremblers, right? We're all like blast in the net. It would now we don't need to get on stage. We don't need to go to Madison Square Garden anymore. You could literally Upload a thing you theoretically you could turn the camera on and upload something that just popped into your head You know, you could upload a thing and say it Uh life is suffering The cause of suffering is attachment Get rid of attachments suffering ends to get rid of attachment. Here's a path. I've come up with you know You could say the before this message is brought to you by attachment. That's the pre-roll in the middle of it I'm saying like when the buddha You know gains realization under the bodhi tree And spreads the four noble truths of buddhism. It took a long time for that data field to sort of get around the planet It's just now Getting around the planet. Yeah, the popcorn has started to actually like there's less space in between each kernel popping off A more negative way to put it is when fucking mel Gibson, you know, like gets drunk and we realize he's like in some way shape or form Apparently completely anti-semitic Right. Is that recent or from 10 years ago happened a while ago? Oh, really? You know, he's like bitching about the jews or whatever. He's all hammered and it's like the amount of time it took for mel Gibson's like anti-semitism To echo around the planet was approximately 24 hours where if mel Gibson's carriage had crashed and he'd started spending about the Jews in the 1600s There isn't a single soul In england that's going to know about that until a fucking ship makes the voyage and someone gets off the ship and is like Yeah And that's a good thing back then too, right? Just being anti That's right Who was talking about um trying to articulate this right, you know onyx ashanti just super futurist guy, but um Uh, I won't even go into it. Just look up look up the guy. I was trying to relay something he was saying about how No matter how far into the future we go if there's any way of distinguishing one thing from another thing there will be like Basically, there's no end to racism But you can you can help it But there's always going to be that sense of racism or tribalism or something you can't completely Estinguish it because that's just what interesting. Yeah, that's a pretty big prediction It's like any kind this is the other things like any of these future predictions It's like who the fuck knows and that's why I love this stoic concept or god's teachings Which is like, all right. All right. Okay. So like let's just get back here again, right? And I think that the in the same way there's an imperative that you begin to realize If you're me later on in your life to like figure out a way to find that moment The jewel in the heart of the lotus to find that moment again and again Not because it's like cool or it makes you feel better because it's gonna like, you know Make you like a better person or make you sexier or whatever But the reason it's it's like good to do that is because every time you land in that spot you're going to be far more adept at Reducing suffering than you are if you're not in that spot, right? Yeah, you can just get a little little bit little better Yeah, something else about that when you were talking about Madison Square Garden, you can just make it happen now it's that that It used to be that way like with photographs like only the rich had a photograph of themselves or a portrait of themselves now Now like think of how many different artistic portrayalers Portrayals Portrayalers of your face you've seen have you even seen all of them? Like just on there's probably people who've drawn your face. There's more than you can count by now that thing. Yeah That's like that's ridiculous and that's happening to everyone across the board now before like you would have to infinite variation infinite digitization and Yeah, and now like you need to be Amy Schumer or Kevin Hart or something to perform at Madison Square Garden And that's going to be just what anyone can perform it in front of a million people if you wanted to That's going to be an equalizer potential is always there for you to get sucked into an updraft Where suddenly the thing you're doing is being broadcast to the entire planet and this is the opticon as they say Which is that and this happens you see some, you know fucking pilled up hopped up hyperracist at a gas station in fucking alabama Yelling at some Complected person to get the fuck out of the country and that comes on that that gets filmed And now that person gets in that person is forever Radiating out as an example of yet of true racism and we see and we're like what the fuck it's horrifying. Yeah So I guess my point is This present moment idea It's wonderful not just because it makes us relaxed but because at some point Someone Is going to have like an epiphanous moment derived from the present moment, right? Yeah, and The difference between that person and the buddha Is that that person is going to make the announcement on instagram? They're going to make the announcement here or there in some way and in the same way the Gio the magnetic field of the earth shifts over 150 years and not thousands of millions of years It's going to shift the cultural landscape Instantaneously. Yeah, it's already doing it. Yeah, so I just feel like there's a really good like my theory behind it is like Well, it's what neem curly baba said, which is like we do this Thing we're doing right now Not necessarily because it's what it's gonna do for us But how it helps other people Do you think he meant what he said to ramdas when he said like don't don't tell people about me Don't talk about me. Do you think that was a little like trickster in him going like Of course, you're gonna talk about me. If I say don't talk about me It's going to want you to do it even more. He's a very funny man. Yeah Some of those stories are so like I mean I'm not a critic of it because I I believe it I think there's crazier things than to have an old man in a blanket be magical and be The reincarnation of hanuman or however you want to describe it his cities has his all that but I love reading the stories of You know, well, I'd never met neem curly baba and one day I I went to his ashram and he didn't talk to me the whole day And I was about to fly back to the states and then as I was packing my bags He showed up at the door and there was an aura around him. He was just kind of lit up He was glowing and then the next thing I knew he was in front of me And he just slapped the top of my head and just started beating the shit out I mean, you're just like, oh my god. Who is this? Who is this awful man? And I just started tearing up I just started crying more than I've ever cried in my whole life And then I just wanted to touch his feet and it's just such strange accounts like that That if you told someone that didn't already know about, you know, ramdas and the The mix of it if you told just that story in isolation, it's like who the fuck is this this guy I think that's baghvandhasa's story of neem curly. I think I might be misplacing it But baghvandhasa is the big, you know beard guy with Uh, who who's the guy who said be here now? Actually, he's the guy telling ramdas be here now Have you had him on before not yet? Oh, you gotta have him. He's a great fascinating being and and the but to get back to the question of the miracles The cities the demonstrations and I can't remember who said it. You know, it's called miracle stories Very similar to ayahuasca stories It's like you get around somebody and they aren't going to tell you about how they went into the pyramid and they saw the thing With it open their chest up and redid their metaphysical dna and replace their Darkness with light and on on on you're like, all right. All right, whatever. I don't care. Fuck. It's like you're having a dream You know, like I don't want ayahuasca stories. It's like anytime. I'm conveying some story of some great vision I had and underneath like Some uh strong tea that I was drinking and I see the person's like eyes glazing over. I totally understand it It's like, you know, why not just pull out some soap? Yeah bubbles in front of him. It's like non different to me, right? But you know, um One thing that I noticed Is that like when my dad was dying and I was applying some of the tools that came from neem krolibaba From his teachings to comfort my father Because I really didn't really talk to my dad at all about neem krolibaba but what I did do is I Was with him in the moment and I was Giving him as much as I could what he needed In that moment to gracefully transition. Yeah And my father in that moment met neem krolibaba without me mentioning it at all and so there's a one of the um In what way just in the in the pure blissfulness way or in the From seeing his son Who he is formerly known as a miscreant As someone who is like very selfish and self-absorbed or a retreater someone who like retreats from problematic situations suddenly being there with him And doing and like loving him and expressing love and being in the moment But not like trying to shove him Towards love or make him open his eyes to just use a chance for this and for you to I need that just in being the My dad saw it And that thing is to me that is neem krolibaba It's like the visions are beautiful and the stories I've heard about him I do believe them and I think they're real and I don't understand how that works But it it's real but to me What's impressive about this being Is that because of this man in a blanket I was able to comfort my father who was dying. That's so cool. That's to me the guru, you know, and um There's a saying and I can't remember which guru said this which is I give them I give them what they want So that they'll take what I give Which is the miracles and stuff are of They're the they're I guess you could say the bait And this wonderful trap in fact an opposite the opposite of a trap Which is we're drawn to them. What the fuck he's telepathic opposite of trapping that it's a release. Yeah. Yeah It's the maybe you could say it's the lure that gets us out of the trap Oh, that's cool. So he puts these lures out and it's like, oh my god. He could translocate. What the fuck I can't be real and the best is when he would fake it for some people that not didn't deemed worthy, but it was more about Making sure that rom dos isn't using him as a parlor trick. You know that story where he's like saying like, oh, you're from You're from canada and he's like, no, I'm actually from the states like oh, you're an engineer No, I'm actually a I'm a doctor and he just intentionally got everything wrong about getting it all the prediction And then he to him. He just thought it was just some old, you know sham Right and that I you know all those stories and you know, I These people are my teachers And I love them and their stories of neem krolibaba. I like to listen to but to me what I love more than that Is that when I'm in their presence there is just this sense of compassion that Is so healing The stories are fucking cool, man. Don't get they're awesome but man the stories are just the Very the flower. Yeah, but those roots they go so deep and um And I like it all I like the entire the the whole tree of the thing. I guess you could say, you know It's just like the fireworks the fireworks the fireworks You watch them. They're awesome. You know, they're cool. They're beautiful, but you still got to go home Yeah, the real thing is the not the firework machine. It's the guy at the machine that guy That was my attempt at that or is it the bulb? You know, we don't we'll never know the answer But was it on was it on here where you had not jason louve? I think jason silva and it surprised me that he was Going down the very materialist route where he very much thinks that You know, it's it's all a trick of the brain and we need to do what we can to keep the brain Going and like he's very which there's truth to that but it surprised me how How bought into it he was well he that's his you know from his reality tunnel and I don't know where he's at now but his reality tunnel is based on um Yeah, the concept weird that I do that where I'm like I'm referencing something that someone in the past Said and I'm trying to like make sure that that guy in the past isn't materialist because then that conflicts with my Wanting it to be not material. We don't want to get our heads chopped off I mean, this is a transhumanist concept of eternalizing the physical body Because there's no guarantee that after we die there's anything after that and they want to they want to you know They want to embody they want to be embodied in the material universe eternally As that form and because that's that's all they they based on their The way that they're categorizing the universe is based on data From the material universe and physics and like they're they're the woo-woo stuff for them It's just like they're pretty skeptical of that. They're like, okay, okay, sure you take that bet But I'm if I can yeah, I want to keep my body going. I'm gonna keep it going. You know, it reminds me a little bit of uh People who figured out ways using MAO inhibitors to To um Make smoking DMT last longer. Oh, I think Shane might have done that. He did. Yeah with syrian roux That's the antidepressant, right? syrian roux an MAO inhibitor. I don't think it's an antidepressant But it definitely like helps the dimethyl tryptamine stay in your body longer. This is same thing with ayahuasca You know, it's like the I feel like five minutes is enough Right five minutes is a lifetime right and some people think that a lifetime's enough Here in this particular Wonderful hallucinatory experience we call human incarnation, but some people are like, I want to stay high forever Yeah, these are the transhumanists. They want to stay here forever. They want their physical form to maintain They want their consciousness to maintain forever. And I think that's a testament to their love of life I don't agree with it. You know as far as I've always one of my favorite things about LSD is coming down. It's like, holy god, that was fucking intense But Jesus the next day when everything's colorful and bright. Oh, yeah, you've done the work and you're like, wow, this is amazing That was incredible. You know, I like that Yeah, I'm definitely one of the people that looks forward to coming back like in the middle of the the trip Yeah, and I think that because there's so much to work with afterwards and I think maybe yeah, you and I both were workers we like to do and also not do but Like it would be you don't do this for money. You do this because you love it and for money probably But you would probably still do this if there was no money anymore Oh, yeah, no question. If you didn't need it. If it was just Star Trek land, they figured out money There's a matter synthesis machine a holodeck. How depressing would that be if one day? I just like do a very short podcast opening where I'm like, hey guys Not making money on this anymore. This is the last episode And you'd probably never end this right because this isn't a show like Seinfeld world. Well, we did it. No, it's at the top We gotta leave it's like you're probably gonna always be doing this because this is just you communicating with the world And you having no, I don't know the conversation. Yeah, I love the conversation I grow from it And it me too. It's it's it's it's the you're you're and I'm yeah you at what are you 24 apps into your podcast now Uh, yeah, so like you're experiencing. I'm sure the the reality of podcasting, which is that Uh, yeah, there is potential for Making money and but and there's potential for material success and there's potential for a lot of those things but really What is happening is it's a transformative medium. So you're sort of like every single conversation It's helping you become a better person Yeah, people are drugs like and not even in a not even in a like, you know Neurochemistry sort of way that way too, but also in a way that they they change you just when you came on my show There's just there's a couple of things you said that just stuck with me from that day Like burned into my brain that really helped which you don't even probably remember Having saying I'm just something like like, oh, yeah, you're trying to squeeze out little love turds Like and just get as many out as as you can and it made me like just compare it to like, oh, yeah This like obsession this fetish fetish fetishization of Releasing whatever books or albums or or things as being the most important thing when really you It's the it's the being it not that releasing stuff is bad either But just the getting caught up in it. It's it's a process And it's like there's moments in the process that grab our minds There's either the moment of success the moment of failure And worst the yeah the in between is the worst the nothing Yeah, all these things grab our attention and in the and so all of a sudden it's like now We're doing it for this reason or that reason And it's in it and and you know, again, it just it just infinitely goes back To like, okay, okay Well, now I got lost pretty good in that pursuit of that thing or that or that worry over that But it all just keeps going back to okay, but now I'm here. Yeah, here we are. Oh, there it is. Yeah Oh, uh, did we talk about um, we this might be a repetition of a we've either talked about in real life or on a podcast or something But how you know, the earth never revisits its spot. Oh, yeah Yeah, so like movement. Yeah infinite movement. So if something takes place it literally takes that spot that now has that like if it's Writing onto a disc. It's got that spot twice brother. Yeah, that's it. And it's like and and that that's a very liberating thing You know, it's a liberating thing. It's just The idea is back to the moment. It's like here we are We're fucking dropping weird dyes neurological dyes into the clear water of self And that's an interesting thing to look at it's like, whoa, what fucking colors am I dropping in my water? Why am I? Always nervous Why am I always angry? Why am I always remembering these things? But then more importantly Who is remembering who is dying the water? Who is the one experiencing? Yeah, and these you know questions, uh, I think are tricks mnemonic devices gifs various ways to get our fingers a little more pried off of the electrical fence of the Various things that are we get attached to and you know, hold on tightly. Let go lightly Yeah, what a beautiful way to end the show How could people find you? You can go to remain nasir.com or rainbow brains skull.com Instagram is the most active one.

Here to help us celebrate the holiday season is author, blogger, podcaster, and all-around amazing mortician, Caitlyn Doty. But first, some music and some wisdom from America's most beloved hobo singer, the great clown tramp himself, the wonderful folk singer and truly one of my favorite musicians of all time, Fergus Blanders. Hello there, it's me, Fergus Blanders. Duncan asked me to come over here and do a little Christmas special for his. You can trust or whatever the fuck it is here, but it's a waste of time. Exhibitionism, sad monetization, sometimes it'd be up in a cave, in a cabin in Alaska, with a fire burning, these are black cats running around and they could rub it and pet in some juniper that he could burn so he could make contact with some entities. But okay, okay, who am I to judge? Christmas is the time of the year, where the numb, dumb and full of cum gather around there and pretend to be happy. And many of us out there, find ourselves completely alone with numbers in our phone that don't work anymore because whoever we want to call is long gone, dead, lost. They judge us while they sit around the fire, feeling nothing, their souls have been extracted by their own ignorance. What about some Christmas music, Fergus? And so as you and me, you're not alone this Christmas, my friend, in fact. You're with me, Fergus Blanders. Once, I met Santa, he was drinking in a bar in Atlanta. His arms had been blown off from a drone strike, the drone had been operated by the global elite who want to destroy Christmas and take away our guns, our wonderful holiday traditions. The banks repossessed a slave. He had lost his way, told me that he was sleeping and some rented Airbnb. So I bought him a whiskey and he sang this to me. If your heart ain't been broken, don't matter how many gifts you open, you'll never know the meaning of Christmas time. And even if this unremitting pain that you're feeling in your heart and your feeling in your brain tricks you into thinking that it will never go away. Don't let your blindness hide your kindness, fake it until you make it and you will see that giving is living and love and life are really the same thing. Giving is living and love and life are really the same thing. He had been singing for a while, but I had sort of tuned out, I had been texting with my cocaine dealer, Larry Leno, he's still in Atlanta if you need some great blow, I like to have a white Christmas, you know what I mean, I asked him what he'd been saying but the door was kicked in by the secret police and he was dragged into an unmarked car. I imagine they took him down to Peppermint Valley where all the elves and Mrs. Claus and all those who had something to do with Christmas are currently being interrogated, injected with high powered psychoactive chemicals along with larium, the malaria drug to destroy their identity. You see there is a war on Christmas being waged by the global elite and though I do suspect that Duncan has been compromised by the one percent using his podcast as a platform through which he can spread propaganda lies, I'm grateful that he allowed me on the air because as many of you know I've been de-platformed from Patreon, YouTube, Instagram and America online for only speaking the truth which everyone knows the red pill so to speak which is that every woman has a small vibrating reptilian egg right beneath her neck and the right above her spine that sends evil thoughts into her mind which is why my wife left me for a chimney sweep I walked in his rod hammering into her mouth as she wept tears of orgasmic joy and I know that if I could at last be allowed one permanent that's all I need to get to Antarctica I can burn down the reptile colonies that are responsible not only for global warming but for the power that has been given to the Clinton network which is this very moment in there. Too much agnog. This infiltration of every woman's mind is filling my mind with fear where are they? Fergus thank you so much. Ah I knew you were going to cut me off you've been compromised by the elite. What are you even talking about? There is no elite. We're all just people. We're all just people. We're all just seven of the ones of us that aren't, the ones of us that turn into reptiles. You and all the others have been corrupted by the moon which is actually a salient satellite which is making the women on this very flat earth act like demons basically which is why I was de-platformed. Can we talk off mic for a second? Sure. Yeah we can talk off mic I guess. Sure. You're not going to kill me are you? Of course not. Uh.

Thank you, Squarespace. All right, we are back friends. Unfortunately, Fergus was a little sick. He had too much eggnog and, you know, the thing about it is he seems to have brought his, his own crow's milk to the house and it's just not good for you. It's one of those things that kind of creeps up on you. It starts off like any other thing and just you get that nice tang. You get that euphoric rush. Trust me, I felt it. I know what it's all about. And then, uh, and then the next thing you know, you kind of, you kind of, you kind of lose your way, you lose track and you can end up, well, you can end up drunk on crow's milk, completely unable to reason. There's all kinds of crazy shit out there. You know, my take on it is this. Crow's milk is not good for you. Crow's milk has obviously, uh, done great damage to the planet. Uh, I'm sure I don't need to tell you about the horrific crow's milk spill that happened in the Gettysburg Bay in 1999 and, uh, was responsible for the death of Locloak, the, uh, seal, uh, when I was a kid, my parents would always take me to see Locloak, you throw them donuts and he would like clap and flip backwards into the water and there was a huge crow's milk spill and he just dissolved. It was awful. I saw the, the, they've taken all the videos off of YouTube, but, oh my God, there's so sad to watch. Locloak, I'm sure you've, it's Christmas. I don't know why I'm getting so dark, but it was just seeing that wonderful seal rise up out of the crow's milk and, and, and just clap two times. That kid throws the donut. He tries to reach for the donut, but something about the crow's milk and the water just completely dissolved Locloak and, uh, and, uh, and do a kind of just horrific slush, a slurry of donuts and seal and crow's milk. And it was just really fucking awful. I'm so glad they took that video down, but I will never forgive the crow's milk industry for killing beautiful Locloak. In 1999, the freighter, Lloria spilled over 6 million gallons of crow's milk into the bay. The last surviving donut seal, Locloak, became extinct on that sad day. We will never get Locloak back. Nobody know where Locloak goes. Have you seen the seal today? Bag of donut is there for nobody to do the donut to where it low looks. He got the skin like seal. He's swim to the core and now if you're in grief, cut the crow's milk man, made the seal go down Locloak served by the cold milk. Locloak, Locloak, Locloak, Tired of the King of the Sea. When will we see the justice for Locloak? Every day, over 7 million animals go extinct to the environmental impact of the crow's milk industry. We have lost Locloak, the last donut seal, and soon could lose the cherry tart otters of Bolivia and Lady Olivia, the hash brown squirrel. For only $10 a day, you can protect our planet's precious snacking otters. Go to StopDrinkingCrow'sMilk.com to find out more. Stop drinking crow's milk today. And now a word from our sponsors.

If you are tired of the commercials in the DTFH, if you have clenched your fist in rage every time you hear me promote this thing or that thing and long for just the interview, none of these intros, no more of this rambling, gab, just good, hard sports conversations, then head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH subscribe and you will have access to commercial free episodes of the DTFH along with at least once a month, an hour of me going pure deep ramble just on and on and on. There's lots of stuff over there. There's some music. Soon I will be streaming to Patreon and of course there's a Discord server where you can interact, communicate, network and come home to your family. The DTFH family. Head over to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and subscribe. I live in a neighborhood where I like to know who my neighbors are and I'm sure you're like that too. You don't want to just sleep next to strangers. You want to know the politics, philosophy, history, internet history, internet search history and the goings on of all the neighbors within a 10 mile radius of your home. Unfortunately, because we don't have the scanning technologies necessary for us to do a deep probe into our neighbors, we just can't know everything, but you can let your neighbors know something, which is you don't support the crow's milk industry. Head over to dunkatrustle.com and click on the shop and you're going to find bumper stickers where you can proudly show your neighbors that you don't drink crow's milk and you could tell them the only sentence that matters these days, which is stop drinking crow's milk. You can stick it on your bumper sticker. You can stick it on your garbage cans. You could stick it on the side of your house. We were hacked at the shop by the crow's milk lobby and they got into our design and we actually have some bumper stickers that say drinking crow's milk. Obviously, this is not an endorsement of the crow's milk industry. Do not put that on your car. People will think that you are pro crow's milk, which is sure to get you fired from any, any job or from any job you're applying to. And definitely you're not going to go on any dates that are going to work out for you and people are probably going to break your, your windshield when you're outside of your car. Not that you would deserve that, but you just shouldn't drink crow's milk. Also, I've heard that some people are taking the drinking crow's milk and putting it under the stop and stop signs. Don't do that. I'm pretty sure that is probably a federal offense. You could very easily get executed by the state for doing something like that. But so don't do that, even though it would seem that you could just take that drinking crow's milk and put it under the stop and a stop sign. And then anyone driving by would see stop drinking crow's milk. But that, that would be illegal. So don't do that. Please, please, please don't do that. I don't want you to get into trouble. And I certainly don't want to get into trouble. And as a staunch anti crow's milk person, I am 100% nonviolent and against breaking any rules or laws given to us by the glorious state. I bow to our noble world leaders. All right, friends, we have for you today a wonderful conversation with someone who is an expert on a topic that over the past few years, I've become perhaps a little more familiar with than I might have liked to. If I was thinking about it growing up, but the familiarity with it has given me a kind of peacefulness and a kind of appreciation of life that I feel really lucky to have. And in my encounters with death, you run into hospice workers and care workers and people who show up when someone is transitioning. And these people are like angels and they quite often have a very calm presence that is exactly what you need. If you're experiencing the fascinating and psychedelic and obviously very sad experience of saying goodbye to a loved one. Caitlyn Dodie is a mortician. She is an advocate in the death positivity movement. She is part of the order of the good death, which is a wonderful group of experts in various fields who are really revolutionizing and modernizing the way we transition. And it's a really important and beautiful thing for people to be doing because for whatever reason in our culture right now, people are really scared of dealing with the reality of our impermanence. And I know what you're thinking, Duncan, you're an android, you're never going to die, this is true. But that doesn't mean that I can't appreciate the situation that you humans are in knowing that at any moment you can just slump over and that's it. I'm really lucky that my friend Connor Habib connected me with Caitlyn. And so without further ado, open your hearts. Radiate the great love of the 14 Templars of the highest sphere of the ninth aeon of Gorlax and send as much love as you can towards our wonderful guest, Caitlyn Dodie. You way I can from the torture that I went through figuring something out. Isn't it a great gift? All about just that. What you just said, isn't that the summation of everything? Yeah, and you feel good too. Well, isn't that isn't the psychology that if you do the person who does something for you likes you more to so you're going to end up liking me more because you gave me this advice because I'm like, oh, thank you, Duncan. I appreciate it. Oh, right. Yeah, I've heard that before, like some kind of thing. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard that before. I wonder what that is. What do you think that that is? I think it's the feeling. I don't know. You just feel you know what it is because it's something that you know already, so you don't have to do any real work. You already have this knowledge. You've struggled for it. It's already exists in your wheelhouse. And then someone comes along who doesn't have it at all and goes, hey, do you have any idea about this? And you get to be like, oh, do I do I ever? And you get to give them this hard one knowledge that doesn't. It isn't hard for you, but you feel good about yourself. But the knowledge you possess is, oh, by the way, welcome to the podcast. Oh, hi. So much for coming on the show. It is I've really, really enjoyed your videos just in your in your output from just a entertainment perspective. You're hilarious. And it's thank you. I try so hard. So I appreciate it. You are amazing. But from as a person who's lost both his parents and has recently experienced death and has many friends who are I'm basically like a at this point, I'm a death lighthouse, like people who have death in their life. They contact me and I get to talk to them because I have some experience with it and I am death positive. I do not find it to be a, I used to be death terrified. Now I'm death positive and watching someone like you, an expert in the field, putting the good energy and the love through this very scary thing for so many people, what a joy. So thanks for coming out. I really appreciate it. Thank you for having me. But what we need, I mean, we need more people like me, but we also need more people like you who have been through it. And I think a death lighthouse is the perfect example because people are so terrified. And if you can just be that one person in your community who knows basic shit about dying, like what a cremation is and how to get one, you know, or like even like how to contact a hospice or simple things that you think we should be part of our cultural vocabulary for the most part. They're just not, what is that? What is that? Why we don't have it? Yeah. We don't have it. So the, the explanation that I always at this point sort of fall back on, but I, but I think it holds up and it's true is that a hundred years ago, you were dying at home, there weren't hospital structures the way there are now. You were waking and taking care of the body home there were at home. There weren't funeral home structures the way there are now. You were killing all of your own animals at home. And now we have these big slaughterhouses that are kept at the edge of town that no one ever sees. So our lives used to be filled with death and now they're not. Wow. Right. Gone. And we live in a world that, you know, there's a lot of controversy in the academic super semantic area of whether we're a death denial culture or not. And the reason there's debate is because we're filled with death in our culture, with murders, with war, with horror, with all of these different tropes of death that we've gone violence. Like it's just everywhere surrounding us. So we can't really be in denial of death, but what you don't see are realistic everyday deaths. No. Because we get, you know, at our funeral home, I own a funeral home here in Los Angeles and we get, because we are younger women who run it, we tend to get younger people who die, a lot of suicides, gun deaths, et cetera. But most normal funeral homes, you get maybe one death like that a month. And most of your deaths are old people. Right. Our people's parents, our people's grandparents, our people who died on hospice or at the hospital or in a nursing home. And those are the actual deaths, but that's what we're in denial about. Those are the deaths that we don't see. Those are the logistical problems in our society that nobody is comfortable engaging in. Yeah. The news doesn't talk about that. No, no, talk about, oh, another person went into hospice and passed away. Yeah. Cause it's, it's not very sexy. And I struggle with that all the time because I'm an advocate. I mean, I'm also a practitioner, but I'm primarily an advocate. I talk to people about death. I talked to people about the dead body. I talked to people about what dying is going to look like. And getting young people to get excited about signing an advanced directive, saying what they want done with their organs and about how they feel about a vegetative state, that's not sexy. That's not fun advocacy. That's not, you know, you can't do a like rap song about that and be like, Hey kids, like let's get into the advanced directive. Like nobody wants to hear that. So it's hard advocacy. And most of that's why most of the advocacy around it you see is very like a natural transition and flowers and brochures and a certain kind of, um, I don't know, not very, not inaccessible, but also not exciting or engaging. It's madness. It's to me, if you want the sign, you know, I have, I am a conspiracy theorist. I have friends who are conspiracy theorists. I'm a, how would you, I like being, I'm a conspiracy theorist in a sense that I like to imagine fantasies. It's fun. I do. I believe the earth is flat. Hell no. Do I believe the earth is hollow? No, but I love to think about what it would be like if it were hollow or if it, if it were a flat earth, it's fun to imagine like, whoa, that would be cool. If the earth was flat and everything went on and on and on forever. And we were sort of trapped here by an ice wall and we didn't know it. Cool. It's fun to think about. But I don't really believe it. And even if it were the case, I wouldn't really care because I'd still be in the same position. I certainly wouldn't be making an expedition out to the Arctic, but the real conspiracy to me or the place where there seems to be a real chin scratch or happening is that I have a son coming and let me tell you, everybody wants to talk about the baby. People call about the baby. They want to come to see the baby. They want to give advice about the baby. They, they send wonderful gifts for the baby. I love it. But when it comes to dying, when my dad was dying, nothing, radio silence, nothing quiet, nothing a whisper. That just got very ASMR. Yeah. Good. When your dad was dying, it was just crickets and the crickets, they were opening up. Cups and it made this wonderful sound and they were putting it on YouTube. They got so many. Oh my God, we're going to make so much money. You and I straight to the top. Welcome to conspiracy ASMR with Duncan and Kaitlyn. This is the sound of the flat earth. This is the rustling of the reptilians. This is the rustling of the reptilian babies as they slither upon their heat rocks. I'm sorry. I don't know why my instinct with you being like, when my father died, everyone was silent and I just jumped right into that. But I feel like you're comfortable. I already get the sense from you that you're comfortable because dissecting the experience in that way. Well, also because you, you are one of the allies and what happens is you. So what ends up happening is that you become completely isolated. Yeah. You have not, this is not in any way to say that people, people love you and they want you to be okay, but they're just scared and they don't want to deal with it. And so they don't want to talk to you for a second and that's okay. But you end up being completely isolated, but then the allies come and the allies are you and you always know when they're there. You could look at each other in the eye and you know, oh, great. You're not going to act all heavy on about this thing. And I don't have to like comfort you because my dad died. You know, that's, which is usually some version of that game starts happening where you find yourself comforting someone who'd never even met your dad or who you're, you're comforting. Which is okay. I'm okay. I'm going to be okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's such a fascinating skill set. I actually had a friend who had a baby and about, you know, six months into the baby's life, I finally come over and meet the baby and bring a present. And, you know, I'm like, Hey, baby, it's crying when it gets into my arms. And she's like, well, some of my friends were very supportive when the baby was born and, you know, sort of shading me a little bit. Like you weren't that supportive when the baby was born. And I'm like, well, that's just not a lot of people love babies. You had a lot of people who were so stoked that you had this baby. Yeah. I'm the one who people call when their dad's on hospice. Yeah. Or when their dad's dying or when they're, you know, dad dies in a tragic boating accident. That's, that's where I come in. And that's my skill set because I can, I like babies. They're cute, but I'm not thrilled with them. I'm not thrilled when your dad's dying, but I know it's something that I can do. And like you said, as a lighthouse, it's something that I have the capability of some knowledge and more than anything, the more that you do death work, the more that you can just be a normal person around someone who is experiencing death, either dying or, you know, caregiver or a close person to someone dying. That's right. Because my sense of when people's, you know, when your dad dies, say in a tragic way, you want your friend there for support, but you also want your friend there to make you feel normal. You want to, you want to joke sometimes. Maybe you want to feel, maybe you want to talk about how he was kind of an asshole sometimes. Yes. Maybe you want to talk about some shared experience that you have. Right. It doesn't all need to be gloom and doom. You're there to normalize things and just make them feel less alone. Like, like somehow they're going to be able to get back to normality someday. That's right. As like a preview of still feeling like part of the community. That's so cool. And if you can be the person, that's what I'm saying. We need more people like you. Like if you've been through that and you feel like you can just show up for someone and be normal, God, that's like worth its weight in gold. It is. And there's, this is, I think I actually, I don't remember which, I don't know which clip it was I was listening to, but you, you were mentioning something about death doulas, you said this. And so now I have the sun coming and since I have, I have more experience with death than birth at this point in my life. And it's great because all the death experience completely works with the birth experience. It's all the same thing. It's like, I know the way when people are dying. I know where my defense mechanisms kick in. I know how I try to evade the reality of the experience that is happening. I understand. Similarly, with birth coming there, it's such an intense thing that you, you, if you don't watch yourself, you can kind of in small ways or big ways evade it, you know, try to like, like not look it in the eye and not be with it in the presence of it. Exactly. Whereas like the best thing you could possibly do for yourself in your entire life, I think is be super present for those moments, like a hundred percent in like sitting with the dead body or a hundred percent like sitting with the placenta and the newborn, like mulling, covered in mucus, baby. Yeah. These are the moments of primal reality that we just don't get in our daily lives. Right. And these moments of primal reality are actively kept from us by an elaborate system. What is that system? This seems truly like the conspiracy nobody talks about. Yeah. It's what it's one of my favorite conspiracies is like the death industrial complex. What is this? Can we talk about this? Why is there this this we can't show sex on TV. We can't show people having sex. We cannot show the creation of life. And we can show the usually the violent, violent deaths. But the deaths are actors, usually. Usually they don't show like an actual death, maybe every once in a while on CNN. No one's afraid to show the Kennedy assassination for some reason. They show that night and day black and white, white. It's like a vintage vibe. Yeah. Yeah. There's something in it that's cool, almost like you just put some like cool sixties music to it and then all right, it's cool to watch. It's really weird. But other than that, it's like there is a veil that has put over these two things for some reason and it's actively put over these two things. I want to know who's drawing the blinds and why are they drawing the blinds? Right. Well, I can I can tell you for death and I can tell you my my theories, which I don't even know if they're theories. I think they're facts. I'm going to put them out there as facts. Cool. So what happened? It really happened around the turn of the 20th century. So you had and keep in mind, this is prime, the extent to which it happens is an American convention is a United States convention. Right. It happens to some degree in many other places in the world, but the US is really the the king is the mafia don of this kind of cover up. Yes. So you had the American Civil War and during the American Civil War, you saw the rise of embalming, which is chemically treating the dead body to keep it fresh a little longer to stave off decomposition a little longer. Was this was this because the people were dying far away from home and they wanted to get exactly. So the history is that you had all these northern soldiers going down to the south, dying on the battlefield. It was really important in the Protestant ethos of the time that you see the dead body. So the train conductors were getting all of these decomposing corpses on their train and they would go, nope, kick them out. We're not doing this anymore. You can't pile up your decomposing corpses in my train. So you had these enterprising young men who were in Bulmers who would follow the battles, battlefield to battlefield, like ambulance chasers. Going to the battles and setting up their tents. They would prop up abandoned bodies that they had embalmed from the battlefield to show their work as little advertisements, like window advertisements for their skills. And you would pay them to basically at that time disembowel the body, put some arsenic in the, in the body to preserve the body. Arsenic's a preservative. It, yeah, it's a preservative. They don't use it anymore because it's terrible, but it's now they use formaldehyde, but at the time they used arsenic. And then so there was a dangerous job. It was a dangerous job. And that would, they would send the body back up north and it would preserve it for that, that period of travel, which it was an interesting innovation. But wait, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I just, this is a lot of information and it's really cool information. That's the intro. We haven't even gotten to the explanation yet. Okay. Okay. So you would get your, your uncle would come in a train. Yes. Stuffed with arsenic. Just not stuffed with sawdust. Actually, they, the, the, at the time the embalming was they would disembowel you, meaning they would remove all your internal organs, cause that's really where decomposition happens is in the gooey middle part of your body. So they would disembowel all your organs. They would stuff you with sawdust or something to keep you, um, you know, your stomach extended and then they would fill your, your body, your circulatory system with some kind of preservative. Were they using pumps to get the, how did they pump it in there? Yeah. So now it's a difference between how they did it. Then, then they had mostly something called gravity embalming, which means that it would just kind of, um, come from a higher place above the body. And then that would drain. So you want to drain from the vein and push in through the artery. So if it's, it basically, if you cut open the vein and the artery, if you're pushing a fluid in through the artery, that will displace the blood that's in the vein. Okay. So it's pushing out the, whoa, okay. Got it. So that's basically, I mean, that's not too different from what embalming is now. Yeah. It's like slightly more high tech, but not by a long shot. Okay. So they're doing this and this actually is, is sort of a sensible innovation for the time, you know, people want their dead sons back and they get their dead sons back because of this process. Yes. But what happens is that these same men are going, wait a second, the war is over now, but this is my business. This is what I do now. We have to convince the rest of the country that embalming is the way to go. And so these men set out, they go across the country. They're selling their wares. They're kind of like Amway salesmen at first. They're going town to town, holding three day embalming courses saying, come on down, learn how to embalm. And then the real, the real trick of it, the real thing that really worked is at the turn of the 20th century, they really started to push the idea based on now very bad science. And honestly, it was all already bad science at the time is that the dead body is dangerous in some way. That's what I thought. Yes. No, not true. If not, like this is, I'll tell you what I thought, uh, and up until this day, to some degree, and I knew it was superstitious. Like I had a suspicion it was just based on hogwash, but for real, this is my thought, the moment, the dead, the dead body itself, to just touch it, some kind of unknown, I don't know what, something that must have been in their stomachs, running all over their body. Now it's like some kind of terrible, like Trojan horse of this disease. Oh, it's dead. So let's spring out and just completely cover the body. And if you touch it, that gets on your hands and then I don't even know what would happen after that. Well, let's break that down. First of all, the death industrial complex has worked on you as it has on most people. So unless the person who died had Ebola or avian bird flu, or some one of these incredibly rare, wildly infectious diseases, in which case, in which case the CDC would come collect them immediately and take them for cremation. They wouldn't be going to a normal safe and money that way. Yeah, you know, did your dad have Ebola? That sucks. But good news, government's going to take care of it. So unless that's the case, your body almost instantly becomes far more safe, the second that it dies, because not only are the viruses and the bacteria dying off pretty quickly, those don't live in your body that long. Also, the things that are infectious about a sick person or a dying person are what coughing, sneezing, bleeding, all of these things that are that get you. Yeah, doing that when they were dead. So that's a positive. That's a group, you know, as far as keeping your safety intact. Wow. But if you're able to say, keep your dad under hospice and wash him and dress him and do all these things, he's, you know that he's completely safe. Right. And he does nothing changes when he dies. It's the same thing. It's the same thing, if not safer. So it's like, oh my God, that is so creepy. And you know, keep in mind humans were doing this, taking care of their own dead in this way for tens of thousands of years of human history. This is just the norm. It's only been in the last, honestly, a hundred, 120 years that what happened is that these embalmers, these same men we were talking about, were really able to push the idea that what they were doing by embalming the body is making it safe. For the family, disinfecting it, making it acceptable and safe for the family to see. So whereas before it was mostly women who were in the home, just washing the body and waking the body and laying it out. Now all of a sudden you have men coming in who aren't part of the family, who are different professionals saying, it's not safe for you to do it. We're going to need to come get the body, prepare it through this process of embalming and charge you for it. Holy shit. So what did you say? Waking the body? Waking, meaning like viewing the body, laying it out for the family to come around and hang out with it, basically. So all of a sudden it now starts to, in the early 20th century, move towards this, this financial model, this, this capitalist model of death, where you have to turn your body over to a funeral home to take it, drain the blood, put in the chemicals, put on the makeup, put them in a suit, and essentially sell your dad back to you. Wow. Wow. And they can't necessarily let people know. And what I do primarily is I advocate for something called home funerals, which is not that complicated. It's just you taking more initiative with the death. So say your dad dies at home on hospice, you don't have to call anyone right now. It's not an emergency. Nothing's, he's not decomposing immediately. He's not getting dangerous. He's dead now. He's going to be dead two hours from now. Everything is okay. It's not an emergency. And just to the degree that you feel comfortable sitting with that primal reality, as we said, sitting in that moment, feeling the feelings that come out and only calling a funeral home when you feel ready. This is so great. I, it's too late for me. You know, both time, both parent. Wow. Both parents passing. It was just very, it was not like this, that no one sat. Interestingly, no one sat with us. I was like, listen, the body's not diseased. No, no one would sit with, no, no one would tell you this. No one. The body, you could just hang out with, you probably should hang out with her or him for a while and just sit with him. It's okay. No one said that. And also it's not like there is some great desire in people to hang out with a dead body. Well, you know, that's complicated. And that's something that I'm always thinking about and negotiating because the people who do it, the people who are given, who have some inkling that they might want to do it, but aren't sure. And then they're given the permission. They end up having this magical transformative experience. I say it's like chocolate and puppies. Like that's the kind of feedback that you get. It's people love it. And I wouldn't keep doing this work if I didn't keep hearing that. Okay. Let's talk about that experience. What do you think that is? I think, I think there's a lot of things going on. I think that first of all, especially now, when is it that we're giving ourselves honestly any quiet time or space in our lives, period, right? And having a dead body sitting there. And first of all, like if I brought a random corpse into this room right now and are like, we're going to sit with it. That's horrifying. That's a horror movie, right? Or a great podcast or a great podcast. In fact, let's go out to my trunk right now. I was, I had to test the waters, but I think you're ready. But a random corpse is scary. But like this is, you know, your wife, your parent, you know, your child, God forbid. Like this is, this is something someone who meant so much to you. Yes. In your life. So that, that change, it adds this sacred tenor to the whole thing. And I've been, I've worked on thousands of dead bodies in my career, but there's still something so magical about a dead body, even after seeing so many of them. Yes, they're very dead, but they're these like, it's so uncanny valley. It's the shell of a person, but they were once, they were once animated. And so it's, it's almost like, you know, I know that you talk about magic and think about magic. So the idea of having some sort of talisman or object that like at one time was like very pregnant with meaning. And then it's not anymore, but like it's still radiating that energy. Yes. That's what I think of of a dead body. What's that energy? I don't know, because I'm, I'm pretty secular. I'm a pretty secular person. So I don't, I don't read it in those terms, but I, I say this all the time. I have to borrow sacred language for it. I'm a secular person who has to borrow sacred language because that's what. What do you mean by secular? I'm a secular. I mean, I mean that I think that the soul or whatever was animating the body has left the building when death occurs. So I think it's left the building and I personally don't believe that it's gone somewhere or transitioned to some other state. Do you believe it was ever in the building? I believe that there is, there are things that animate a person. I believe that there, I believe that the brain is magic in my, I mean, that's not like, you know, a profound quote, but I, I do believe that there is a, a sort of magic to, to animation in a human. Yeah. But I think, but I, I guess I'm more interested in what's left over when someone dies personally. That's, that's my area. That's my space. That's my, my, my passion is, is thinking about what happens to, especially the people who are still alive when they're in the presence of the dead body. Because that, that to me is like, okay, you're sitting there. You're looking at, you're looking at dad. He's dead. It's our number two. He's starting to get cold. Yeah. His eyes are starting to sink a little bit. He looks different. This is your dad. You remember him running and playing and talking and whatever he did in his life. Or even if you had a terrible relationship, you imagine him beating you up. You have these terrible memories, whatever sort of relationship you had with this person, it's slowly becoming clear that it's over now, that you can see him changing and you can see this whole universe that you live in changing. And you're also looking at him and you're like, wait, death is real. Oh shit. Like this is a corpse now. This is going to be me. Am I going to be a corpse? Like spoiler? Yes, you are. What does that mean? What does that mean? Yeah. What does that mean for you? What does that mean for how you're living, for how you're existing, for how you're interacting with the world? Yeah. And then you're also thinking about, okay, I have this time. I'm not on my Twitter. I'm not like, you know, on the internet, I'm not, I'm just existing in this world. What are other feelings that I have been having that I've been suppressing? Right. And there's nothing better to bring out feelings than hanging out with dead body, I think, because it's this, it's again, it's this time out of life that most people don't give themselves. And you can give it to yourself because no one's going to fault you for having a wake with your dad. No, no one's going to fault you for taking some time and sitting with no, your body and having that. Um, so I just think it's an incredible opportunity. Just like being at a birth is an incredible opportunity that we're not giving ourselves or the establishments around them, the, you know, the systems around them don't necessarily want us to. That's right. Yeah. I, that, that, the energy that you're talking about in particular, um, I want to hear some of the sacred language you use to describe it. Well, okay. So you mentioned death doulas earlier. Yeah. A lot of death doulas are far. So you have funeral directors and morticians, which is what I am. I came through the, you know, do I have, do I take that much stock in this arbitrary label? Not really, but it is still more of a like, you go to mortuary school, you take the tests, you do that. Doulas generally exist outside of the funeral system. Right. They are people who train amongst themselves in their own grouping. They are there to be in many ways, spiritual advisors for you as you are going through the dying process. What's the difference between a death doula and hospice? A hospice is going to be, well, there is some overlap. A hospice is going to be like nurses who are actually there to do your medicalized dying. Yes. Um, doulas are there to do your comfort care and your spiritualized. I mean, it's sort of similar to a birth doula. You know, you have your actual nurses at the hospital, but then you have your doula, who's your advocate, who's explaining things in detail to you, who's rubbing your feet, who's, you know, giving you ice chips, who's talking you through everything. It's, it's a sort of different thing. But some doulas take the spiritual aspect of it very seriously. And the one that I, who actually would be probably great for your show is Alua Arthur, who I work with. Um, and she, we're such a fascinating pair. I think the two of us, because we're both experts in our way and we're both, she's an incredibly powerful woman. And she does have a much more spiritual way of looking at the transition from death into life or life. Well, death into life, Freudian slip, perhaps. And I think, you know, she was doing a sort of, for a video that I did, she was doing a pseudo deathbed experience on me, just to sort of give people a sense of what it would look like. And while I was there, while she was doing the frankincense and the singing bowls and, and talking me through these things, even as a more a religious person, I was like, bring it on. This is great. I love this. It's comforting. It smells nice. It sounds nice. It feels nice. Like, why not? Bring it on. Yeah. You know, and, um, I think that I am in the, in a place where my interest is the dead body. It's not that I don't care about dying, but I think doulas have this real interest in dying and not so much the dead body. Whereas I am like, you know, bring it to me once it's a corpse. That's what I'm, that's what I'm interested in. And, you know, but, but at the same time, it does have to be this continuum. It has to be to really make effective change in how we're looking at death and dying. It has to be, you have to start out having this great conversation with your doctor, where your doctor doesn't tell you that they're going to valiantly fight no matter what stage of cancer you have, even if there's no hope. Yeah, you need to have, you need to be able to express to your doctor. Here's how much pain I'm willing to be in. Right. This is when you got to give me the morphine. That's right. This is when I want to go home, no matter what. Amen. You just, when you have to be able to say it, that's right. Then you have to go to a palliative care team or a hospice team that is supporting you. That's right. The decisions you've laid out. Yep. That doesn't separate you from your animals. That's right. Put you somewhere you don't want to be. Yes. Then you have to have a, maybe a doula or a funeral home that says, listen, you call us when you need us. There's no emergency. When the death happens, we do things all the time at my funeral home called the delayed removal, which just means give us a call when you're ready. That's so great. Like, oh, your dad died. I'm so sorry to hear that. You let us know. Wow. You know, if you have any questions, let us know. But other than that, we're going to leave you alone. Goosebumps. And just leaving people alone is because people need, people need that initial permission. Such compassion. But there's nothing, you know, it's not, it's sort of intuitive. Like there's nothing I really need to tell you about sitting with your dad. What's the name of your funeral home? It's called Undertaking LA. I'm going to have to bring my dad back to life so we could do it again. Yeah, I don't know if you need that experience again, but, you know, we're here for you in your time of need, Duncan, whatever you need. It's so, so compassion net. It's so compassionate. This, what you're talking about, no one wants to talk about. No one wants to broach. And here's what happens to so many people. By the time the dying person is ready to start talking about it, their mind is disintegrating. Yes. So they can't talk about it. They're not able to articulate exactly what it is they want. They, because they had been hypnotized by movies. Man, I just watched and it's a tear. I thought it was so good when I was in college and it's just such an embarrassing movie. I watched The Razor's Edge recently. Have you seen, you know, that movie with Bill Murray? I don't know that I've seen it recently, but. Oh boy. It's like one of those movies you see when you're like, and you're like, God, that's what spirituality looks like. You know, when people become spiritual, they just kind of become like, they stop. They just basically become ambivalent. Mind blown. No, not mind blown ambivalent. So like Bill Murray portrays this sort of like ambivalent. It reminds me of some sort of like existential hero. This sort of like ambivalent, unmoved by reality, non-passionate being. That's like, it seems to be some interpretation of something without any kind of experience, experience behind it or something. But there's a death scene in this movie and it is the most absurd death scene of all time to watch this now. Spoiler spoiler. There's a death scene out of the protagonist's friends with this wealthy guy lives in Paris and the guy is laying in bed. He looks great. Yeah. He this guy, he looks healthier than most people you run into on the street. Like this is. Well, that's the problem with Hollywood corpses in general. You know, you have a CSI or any crime show. It's just some 20 year old trying to get some IMDb credit. That's right. And some blue makeup. Yeah. Like they have fan of corpse. That is not a corpse. No, that's a healthy young person. Yeah. And people like you and I, I guess I shouldn't be proud of the fact that I'm able to I've had that now when I'm watching movies. I'm like, yeah, right. Give me a fucking break. Oh, really? You look like you just ran a marathon. What is happening here is the pink cheeks, sparkly eyes. What is going on here? So this gentleman is passing away and he's laying in bed. Clear as a bell, clear as a bell. He's talking to Bill Murray. They have this, you know, Bill Murray. This is the worst thing I've ever seen. Truly, it just like just a disease. It's a disease because people watch this and they go, oh, that must be what it's like. So in this moment, spoiler, if you go watch the Razor's Edge and start this again, don't go watch the Razor's Edge. It sucks. But in this in this scene, Bill Murray has fabricated some kind of invitation to a fancy ball and is lying to this dying person to make him feel better, that he's been invited to some royal ball in the dying person. No, so that's number one lie to the. Is this a comedy? No, it's a series. It's based on a book by Somerset. Yes. And the book is like this is like sort of, I guess, in the, I don't know, the genre of Steppenwolf. Who wrote Steppenwolf? Herman Hussey. Yes, it's like this kind of like spirit. What when the East came to the West kind of spiritual. But in its, you know, it's wonderful, but it's terrible because it ends up getting all like way too dry. And the idea of the spiritual person becomes a person who is devoid of feeling or somehow just is like numb, numb. Somehow when it came to the West, people read in a book, the wise more neither for the living nor for the dead. That's from the Bhagavad Gita. And the interpretation when you read it and don't experience what that really means. Yes. And even stoicism, I don't think is ambivalence. I don't even know at all. So anyway, so they realize this poor dying. And then the dying guy just dot, just goes, it's like, all right, see you later. Kind of like looks over to the. Sorry, I won't be able to make it to the ball out of I'm out of the universe. Not even just literally like, oh, God, God, like insane, insane. Yeah. So people see that shit and they just assume, oh, you know, I'll start planning for this thing when I start getting sick, you know, is when I'll start planning, you know, based on the statistical probability of my death, I've got some amount of time left to plan for the thing. This is absurdity. And so then what ends up happening is they. Start dying. And right away, your mind goes like your mind is out of here, man. You're like fluctuating through the past, present. You're just going into the past. You're talking to your husband who died 20 years ago. That's right. You're doing. Yeah, you were. You have amnesia. And you might have some moments of clarity, but when you have moments of clarity, your family wants to talk to you about how you are in the past. They don't want to talk to you about what your death plan is. And if you want to be cremated, this was the cool thing about my dad, because when he was dying, he. Man, it was wild. If sometimes he would. What is your dad diet? COPD. Oh, wow. So when he was dying, he he sometimes he would recognize me. Sometimes he thought that I was someone who was with him in Vietnam. Like he thought I was like working for the military beard. He would be like, who who is your commanding officer? He would say things like that was really interesting. But and so I, you know, I was thinking, well, I probably won't see him again. Like right now what I'm seeing is this sort of like sleepwalker. I don't know that I'll see my dad again. And then pop back up. He popped right out of it. There he was. And he and he was any and because I have been taught to be honest when the with dying people, thank God. Good. When he's he would he would he said, what's happening? And I'm like, oh, you're dying. And then he's like, oh, OK, OK, better go get a pen and a piece of paper. And then he starts telling me, you know, what to, you know, what to say to people. It was beautiful. It was wonderful, you know, including things which I still haven't done. I've got to do this. You know, like send a lunch platter to the hospice, all these beautiful instructions. It was what I got lucky that he did this. You should send a lunch platter to the hospice. They love that. I'm going to I'm going to do it. Dad, wherever you may be in the past, present or future, it's happening. I'm sorry. A little distracted, got a baby coming. That's not a good excuse. Easy to send a lunch platter. But he was there for a second. And but this doesn't always happen. And so I think both family members or any human being has this ridiculous concept of this process. And within it, there's some clarity of mind. And it's like, this is not how it works, man, which is why I really love your advocacy, because in one of the clips I watched, you were giving instructions for the holidays because you're going to be around your family and here's a perfect time to come up with a plan for when it happens. Can you talk a little bit about that? Sure. Well, something that so the the original advocacy group that I founded is called the Order of the Good Death. And recently, I think mostly this year, there's been talk of why are we using the term the good death at all? Isn't that too, you know, what about all of the bad deaths? You know, does that mean that you can never have a good death if you've been shot or if you're a trans victim of violence or if you have, you know, isn't that isn't that ignoring those people? And my contention is so many people have bad deaths now. And the fact is, unless you have some kind of plan for a good death, you're not getting anywhere near it. Yeah. And you have to if a good death or just even like a simple, a calm death is your goal, that takes so much work. That's right. In our culture. That's right. It takes so much work. The forms, the forms alone, the forms alone. Yes. And the logistics, the logistics after you die are huge. No one knows about this. Nobody knows about it. No. It's and people will say, you know, like, oh, how do you know? Like I've been on the phone with this, you know, Verizon for two days. Yeah. Welcome to somebody dying. You know, think about how annoying just having Verizon miss a digit on your social security number or something in life. Imagine trying to get off a phone plan when someone dies. Right. You know, it's near. It's it's it's crushing. So you have to have you have to have the right people working with you. You have to have the right ideas. You have to have the right logistics set out or it's just going to be a nightmare. So when I say good death, I don't mean that like everyone should have a mandolin playing next to the dying person and their soul should ascend in magic and everybody's going to have the most privileged death in the world. Right. By good death, I mean just something resembling that which you want, what the dying person wants, what their family wants, at least have around you what you might want. If you were going to take a comfortable nap, how about that? Just a nice situation where it's just a nice situation. You know, what is that going to look like? How is that going to happen? And the only way to do that, the number way to not accomplish that is to pretend it's not happening. That's right. Or to pretend that mom is sick, like mom is not sick. She's dying. Yeah. And it's like everyone has basically told you that. But and mom has tried to talk to you. That's right. You were the daughter and you were the next of kin and you don't want to hear it. That's right. Or mom is dying and she doesn't want to hear it. That's right. Someone or it's somehow you both want to talk about it, but it's gotten mixed up in this conversation. And what the thing that I've found, if you really want, if you're dying or your mom is dying, or even if you're just it's in the future and you're trying to plan for it, is you have to appeal to emotions rather than logic. Because it seems like what I just told you, of course, what you want to appeal to is logic, right? There are all of these logistics to be taken care of. You want to appeal to logic, but that doesn't work because that can always be deflected. That can always be like, oh, that's morbid. Oh, we don't want to talk about that now. Oh, that's too early. Not during Christmas. Not during Christmas. We don't need this right now. This is too much. But what you have to say is, listen, mom, I know that you have cancer right now and that you it's hopefully it's going to get better. But if it doesn't, I am terrified that you are going to die and I'm not going to know what you want. That's right. And the thought of being left alone without you, who's always told me what to do and always told me how to figure out my life and given me structure. If you're gone and I'm alone and I'm trying to do all this, that makes me sick at night. That makes me so afraid. That's right. And if you could just help me lay a few things out, that would make me feel so much safer and so much better. Yeah. And she can't escape that. You know, we're not trying like in some ways I am trying to trap your death denier relatives into these conversations. Yeah. You know, I could I could lie and say, I'm not trying to force anybody to have a conversation they don't want to have. I sort of am because, you know, they may be able to say no then, but it's going to seep into their mind and it's going to they're it's going to slowly break down their barriers. Yep. And they're going to be more willing to have it. You only have to have this conversation a couple if you're if you're organized and you know what to ask, you don't have to have it over and over. It can be an uncomfortable couple of hours. That's all it has to be. It might be a little longer than that. It might be like a work day or something, but you need to do this. This this. Is the most compassionate thing you can do when you're passing, you know, it's it's because it's kind of like, and you feel good when you're done. That's when you when you send that lunch platter to the hospice, you're going to feel so good. Oh, you're right. I got to do that. You got. Well, well, this is, you know, I think of it in terms of like a high dive. It's like, do you want a belly flop out of this universe? You don't have to. You don't have to. You can really do some incredible acrobatics as you are transitioning. And I think it's an indication and also because if not, someone's going to come up behind you and push you. That's right. That's right. That's when you belly and you belly flop and you're yelling and you smash into the water and it's very confusing to say the least. You had two months standing up there on the high dive. Yeah. And finally, someone is like, OK, your time is up. I'm going to push you from behind. That's right. And to give your loved ones the gift, this wonderful gift of just an organized plan that has no mystery in it. Here's my social security number. Yes. Yeah. Just simple thing. Here's my bank account number. Here's who I'm leasing the car from. I've contacted them. They're expecting your call. All of these things. So there's you can make a list of 15 things. And there's so many romantic mysteries about someone's past, but like their mother's maiden name, which you need for the certified deserter to get into that one of them. Yeah, that's right. You need that's not the romantic mystery about dad that we need. And also, I think within this conversation, a lot of beauty can start happening. Oh, sure. Like what an amazing like, you know, you have all those talks about mom's maiden name and then it becomes what hasn't been said all of a sudden. That's right. And that is why I would add one thing to this. If you could do it with consent and it and you would be comfortable doing this for your own self, record it, record it. Because you might miss some data, but also you're going to have an eternal conversation forever. You will have this. And, you know, this, this over time will be a thing that you at first, you'll never want to listen to it. You won't want to touch it. You'll put it in a drawer. You won't even listen to it. But at some point, maybe you'll never listen to it, but maybe your child will want to listen to it or their child. And so in this way, an echo of the life force of this being can continue to sort of reverberate out into this realm. And so I think that's a very I would just add that to the conversation. That that you would have. And also the other thing about it is in my training, which is not secular, the idea is that the energetic state of the dying person, that momentum of dying, the momentum of dying, it's not like it smashes into some kind of. Wall and is annihilated. It's not as though suddenly that energy is like goes against all the laws of physics as we understand it. It's not as though suddenly whatever that is just is gone. This is from a one to a zero. Well, it's interesting that you say that because I feel. So the other part of my advocacy is natural burial, which means just because the traditional burial now in America is you dig a deep hole deep into the earth. You put a big concrete vault. Yeah. Into the ground. You then put the embalmed, chemically altered body in a sealed cast. Keep them safe. End is safe down there. You never know what's down there. Some airbags in that thing. Exactly. What if there's a earthquake? Well, what if the backhoe and the cemetery drives over it and pops it all open, which happens often? I'm sure it goes into the vault and that body isn't coming anywhere near the earth at all. So a natural burial is just, you know, what other cultures would call burial, which is a hole in the ground, very shallow body goes into it. Decomposes naturally just in a simple shroud or simple decomposing garment of some kind. And when you talk about the energy in the matter, not hitting a wall, but moving forward, I feel that so strongly with the actual matter of my dead body. So if I had any spirituality at all, I would say it resides in the idea of my body decomposing. It brings me so much comfort to think of my body decomposing. I don't want to be cremated. I don't want it because when you cremate a body, you skip over that decomposition. You were the it heats up your body to the point that all of the organic material just kind of floats out through the smokestack. And then you're left with inorganic bone fragments. That's right. If you're embalmed, you're preserving your body to the point that it essentially mummifies beneath the earth. But if you have your body in very rich soil, it's expertly designed to break down the body quickly in a matter of one or two months, breaking down the body and sending your atoms back into the universe to do their work to continue. That's where I see reincarnation. Oh, I see. That is in the matter, the physical matter of my body being allowed to decompose. Well, I mean, here the good news about whether there is this reincarnation in that way or reincarnation in some other way is we don't need to worry about it. Yeah, that's taking care of. Yeah, but it helps me. And this is what I tell people all the time is like, think about what makes you feel you're not going to feel good about dying. But when you think about people are like, oh, it doesn't matter what happens to my body. It does because when you think about where your body is going to go, it can give you a lot of clarity on how you feel about death. You know, if you think about your body being trapped in a wall crypt somewhere, does that freak you out? Do you feel claustrophobic? What do you think about your body being cremated? Does that feel toasty and spiritual? Or does it feel like you're in the flames of hell? You know, when you think about your body decomposing naturally in the ground, is that worms tearing at your flesh? Or like for me, is it like, oh, take me, sweet earth. You know, the cool sweet earth to consume me. You know, what, where is that for you? And if you can meditate on that a little bit, I think that really helps your dying process. I like take me, sweet earth, and I think that that's a wonderful mantra. But I think the mantra doesn't have to, I think that's, that's what's happening now. You know, it's the decomposition process starts the moment you're born. And that the in this, in this, in this, maybe you could say that the. The thing which animates the corpse is the fire and that the. That is decomposing or aerosolizing or shifting or moving atoms into nature, even now, you know, and so now we're decomposing, now we're buried. In fact, we are dead. We're a dead thing that has a flame that's sentient, sort of moving through it in this beautiful way. So I like that, you know, that as I've been taught and is that is. Logistically prepare for death, definitely. And then. Ask yourself. Am I alive? Yeah, that's a good question. Not many people ask themselves that it's a good question. And if you, if you're the answer is like, well, yeah, of course I'm alive. I mean, I have a pulse, I have a heartbeat, I'm alive. Then, then, then ask, OK, but are you alive? Yeah, are you touching reality? Are you here? Where are you? Are you really alive? Are you touching things here? Have you felt anything for a while? And so these moments of birth and death, as you're discussing, when this, in fact, in Buddhism, there's a practice. I'm sure you've heard of this, where the monks sit at the edge of a. Of a tunnel. Yes, and watch the decomposing corpse and meditate by the decomposing corpse. And they do advise as you're looking at the discoloration of the skin and the way the eyes are sinking in. And then the advice given is understand that's you. That's you now, you, you. That's going to be you and is you and is happening now. And this is a wonderful exercise. It really is. When I first started, I started my work in a crematory as just a entry level crematory operator 10 years ago now. And I was in there every day cremating the bodies. And because I have this academic interest in death, I was also reading about these customs and these ideas and these traditions. And not only was I thinking about, you know, the Buddhist idea of meditating on a charnel ground of decomposing bodies. I was also going to work every day and opening up a cremation container. And there's a decomposing body doing it in the container. Yes. And God, what a wonderful year that was. Yeah. And then, you know, those those first years, first couple of years, I still love what I do so much and I believe in it so much. But those first couple of years of discovery, of working in the funeral industry and discovering what it means to be alive. Like, yes, I was in my, you know, early 20s, so it was filled with angst. Yes, sure. But it was also filled with discovery and life and truly defining for myself what being alive was. And if if I could go back to that first year in the crematory and do it again, I think I would. Well, not to repeat anything, but just to just to feel those feelings again. And any time you start that journey, it's going to be the hardest, most wonderful year of your life. Let's talk and I've got 15 more minutes. It's two 16 right now. I know. OK. Well, that went fast. Yes, it did. And so does life. Yeah. Now, I would like to ask you a strange question in the podcast. And so forgive me, because it's kind of like esoteric and weird. OK. If death is a mirror, what is it reflecting? Oh, my God. OK. There are so many ways I could answer that. That is a good question. I think it's reflecting the fact that no matter how good we get at gamifying and using technology and creating these perfect experiences for ourselves and these perfect images of ourselves online or in our lives or these perfect content generators or these perfect spiritual people or beings, ultimately, we will end up as decomposing flesh. Ultimately, we will end up wildly imperfect in this really amazing way. So. I'm sorry, may I stop you there? Yeah, yeah. Well, is it really imperfect, the decomposition process? Would you call that an? Isn't it? No, no, no, I call it. I guess I wouldn't call it imperfect, but I would call it messy in a way that's delightful to me, because so much. I think that our current funeral system in the United States, especially reflects societal values. So our values are when someone dies, we want them to be immediately taken away in a white van that you cannot tell that as a dead body in it. Yeah, we want it to be taken to behind the scenes of the funeral home. Everything to be cleaned up for heavy, heavy makeup and restorative putty and injections in their face. So they look like a wax inversion of who the person that was and then put them out in a pretty basic chapel and everyone comes up and taps them awkwardly on the hand and walks away. And that's what we want. We want that mediated experience. Yes, sure. But I think that the reason that people are wanting that less and less, they just did a survey that said only one third of Americans want that kind of funeral, which is devastating for the funeral industry. Because their entire model is built on the entire system of laws and regulations is built on the presumption that people want that kind of funeral. Yes, people don't want that. They want they're turning to these greener, natural burials. They're turning to these home funerals. They're turning to these messy experiences. And I mean, messy. I mean, if you keep your dad at home and you're trying to dress him, he might poop on you a little bit or purge a little bit. Yeah, sure. If you get put dad in the ground, he is going to his flesh is going to rot off of his body in spectacular fashion. This is a messy, this is gross, but it is it is real. It is reality. And it's hard to just it's such a gift to think about those things because if you're worried about like, oh, was the language of that tweet I sent, right? It's like, OK, it's that or cleaning your dad's shit off your hands and being fine with it because it's truth and reality. And you're in the moment. Like think about the like the huge difference between those two experiences. That's right. Yes. And and how much we have to gain from a lot more of the latter. Yeah. Yeah. So what I want to what I think about death is reflecting is that you can't you can't Silicon Valley death. So many people in Silicon Valley are trying to upload your brain into the crowd cloud trying to into the crowd. Also a friend trying to extend your life. Sure. And like, why I don't I mean, I know I know some transhumanists and I know why I know what their argument is. But to me, everything that is beautiful about life comes from death. Everything that is beautiful about life comes from the deadlines that are imposed by death. Would we be here today if you were never going to die? You know what this reminds me of all this. We wouldn't do this. Have you ever heard this term before? It's really a quite interesting. And Buddhism, they say Samsara and Nirvana are intertwined. Or another way to put it would be confusion is a condition of enlightenment. So to achieve realization, there would have to be confusion first. Or you would already have realization. So the confused state is actually a preliminary phase of the realized state. Similarly, when it comes to death and life, so to speak, these two things are like actually the same thing. If you ask me, it's the same thing. And this part of the process that we're in right now where we're animated in this particular incarnation has a boundary. I cannot drink water unless I have something to put the water in. We must have the water. There must be something there for there to be form. And death is the cup from which we drink the water of life. Yeah, no, I agree with you. And why would you want the idea of being granted immortality right now? It sounds horrifying to me, absolutely horrifying. The idea of that I would walk around in this same flesh sack forever. All of my desire to achieve and change and create would be gone in an instant. I have some bad news for you, and I am so sorry to say this because I think it's a philosophical disagreement that we have, but you are making a very intense assumption. And the assumption is that you are not immortal. And this is heaven, of course. Like if you think that you are annihilated upon it. But also, is your assumption of immortality that we can? So I'm talking about transhumanism. I'm talking about extending life in this body. Oh, the transhumanists are just, you know, technology replicates natural forms, you know, the blockchain replicates. It seems to be that the blockchain is replicating some kind of like energetic state, a sort of metaphysical quality to the universe, Prana or whatever. They figured out a way to, in some weird way, shift some spiritual energy into some form and then turn that into money. It's a kind of like very, very complex, confusing, led into gold situation. So I think technology is like when you throw pain on the invisible man. It reveals forms that are already there. So these technologists, imagine they're the ones who are doing the thing. But I think it's more that these forms already exist, but they're like showing up around us when we couldn't see them before, because technology is like allowing us to like scrubbing some things and we see it. But I guess my question to you is, do you feel like you would be doing the same things you are doing now? You would be having the same work, the same child, the same life that you currently have if you believe that you were going to live to be 200 years old. Oh, oh, well, I think that, yeah. I think if there was some guarantee of like, oh, listen, you are definitely 100 percent. No argument about it going to live for a thousand years or something like that. Then potentially there could be a the needle could go in one direction or the other. It could either go to the direction of like where you just become a kind of temporal trust fund kid, I guess. Like that's what that's what I believe would happen. That's what I strongly believe would happen, right? Is that our motivation is based on deadlines, right? Well, this mystery here is good, I guess. But the bad news, I think for people who if you think that there is annihilation, if you think there's annihilation, true annihilation, as in like Shiva level, gone, gone beyond the gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone somehow, like beyond paper shredder, gone. Like we're talking like gone, gone, somehow a miracle occurs. And you are given full relief from what it is to incarnate. Or as Richard Dawkins says, death is the anesthesia that saves us from the pain of life. If this is true, then we are all so lucky because it means that it's parent. That is paradise. That is that is such, such perfection beyond perfection, if that is true. Unfortunately, I do not think it is true. I'm afraid that there is a momentum. So you, so you think that when I believe myself to be annihilated at death, which something that brings me great comfort, you think that I am lying to myself? Well, no, I would say that it's similar to not lying to yourself. I would say that it is a, what, first of all, wonderful. If this is the case, wonderful. It is from my perspective, so we seem to agree on that. You just think that it's not the case. And I think that it is. Well, yeah, I think that it's, we agree on the premise. We just don't agree on the reality. It would be similar to me saying everyone goes to heaven. And it, but in my, you know, it's, it's like, I don't mind if other people go to heaven, I just don't want to go to heaven. No, no, no. I mean what you're describing is heaven, annihilation is heaven. So you think we're not granted that. You think we're not granted annihilation. I think that if the universe, I think that there is the possibility for annihilation, but it's not related to the death of the physical body. I think that we can be annihilated by a practice and that through that, there can be a, a, a remembrance or a connection with what we fundamentally are, which is emptiness, but I think that. Okay. So tell me what, tell me my, my plan, tell me what I need to do. What's my, my 10 step plan to achieve annihilation? Ha ha ha ha ha. Another podcast, I'm afraid. I'm ready. Sign me up. The good news is this, here's the good news. Okay. The good news is we aren't simultaneously annihilated and not annihilated. The bad news is, is that there could be the possibility that the momentum that we have here in this incarnation continues forward, meaning that this thing that we are called the animated, the, the, the thing that you see that animates the corpse, that thing is a sort of momentum. What you're looking at really, I guess you could say is like, when we put one of those awesome acoustic plates and sand on it and play a tone underneath it, it'll make a form. It's really interesting. Similarly, I think what we're seeing in people is a, people are like acoustic plates through which a kind of karmic vibration is playing. And instead of creating a form and sand, it's creating a personality. And so when the body extinguishes the, that sort of pattern, just what we call death vanishes, but to, unfortunately, the vibratory force that was creating the pattern, it will find another little bit of sand to make that pattern. So you think that I am going to, on my deathbed, I am going to, my physical body will be extinguished and then my, I will, I will believe, ah, sweet denihilation comes to me, but actually my vibrations are going to go to another place and I'm going to be like, God damn it. Yeah, that's kind of the, what happens, it's a little bit like you're a radio that thinks that when the batteries run out, the transmission stops. Well, I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. You sound like the Buddha. Oh, I've often been said, yeah. God bless you for your work in this world. And I apologize if what I just did seemed challenging in some way or no, not at all. I love the philosophical discussion of it. And, and I, you know, I love, I love, it's so rare. I, in my practice, because I want to be so, I want to be accessible to everyone. I don't usually say, you know, I have no desire to say like, I'm not going anywhere and none of you are either. Like I, I wouldn't ever presume to say that. I, as I said, I think other people should go wherever they want and I'll just flip off into nothingness. That sounds great to me. But I love the challenge, which is so rare of I don't think that is going to happen to you, you know, because you see, you hear, I'm not an atheist, but you hear atheists say like, you don't know, you're going to, like this is going to happen to you no matter what, like you're getting nothing no matter what. But I love the challenge of sort of the flip of that, which is me saying like annihilation and someone saying like, I don't think so. Well, maybe some hope I could offer you is that you don't have to die for that to happen. Your impulse to want this flip off to happen is, is the impulse towards realization. It's just that you've created a situation where your body has to die for that to happen. And that's enough. That's a little bit of a, um, that's sort of like putting off dessert for a long time, you know, I'm open to it. Whenever, whenever grand, this is why I'm not an atheist. Whenever grand, like spiritual realization and integration wants to show up and, you know, I'm, I'm here. Oh, it's there. I am a funnel. Let me tell you, you are a funnel. And it's just the, you are funneling such love and compassion into this world. And we are so lucky for the work that you're doing. Thank you so much for taking time. Thank you for having me.

Most people have had the thrilling experience of watching the transformation that can happen to just about anything when placed under an electron microscope. Suddenly a piece of moldy cheese transforms into an alien landscape or a discarded condom found in an alleyway becomes the surface of the moon. But a lot of people don't know that the exact same thing happens when you put sound under an acoustic microscope. Recently I was lucky enough to receive a Edmund Tellens acoustic microscope from the Ministry of Sound in London, England. And I've been astounded to discover the many strange things hidden in sounds we take for granted. Take for example, the chirping of the shamrock swallow, a very common bird in Western North Carolina. When this sound is run through the incredible quantum computing machine known as an Edmund Tellens acoustic microscope, it transforms into this. Right now I'm slowly turning the acoustic magnification dial or at 30, 50 times, 100 times, and now a thousand times. It's here that things get real weird. I hate flying. In case that you missed that, let me play it for you again. This time magnifying it a little bit more to make it clearer. I hate flying. Do you hear that? Listen again. I hate flying. I hate flying. I hate flying. Right there in front of us the whole time, hidden in the sweet song of a bird, the private agony of a creature that dislikes one of its fundamental functions in the world. I was disappointed to find that this was a common theme throughout all animals. Take the sound of a common house cat, for example. We apply the magnifier to this sound, 50 and now a thousand times. Do you hear that? Let me run a filter so we can hear what the cat is actually saying. I was... In case you missed it, let me play it one more time. I was... I wish I was a dog. From bear to butterfly, catfish to kangaroo, all the animals that I investigated sonically turned out to be kind of unhappy. So, out of sheer curiosity, I decided to try to grab a sample of the human voice from a stranger and run it through the magnifier to see what was hidden inside of human language itself. I went through a drive-through and recorded this audio. Can I please get the bacon sausage egg and cheese biscuit, number five? Okay, you said sausage egg and cheese. When we come back, we'll find out what was hidden inside that simple exchange. It's gonna blow your mind right after this. You're listening to the DTFH.

Can I please get the bacon, sausage, egg, and cheese biscuit, number five? OK, you said sausage, egg, and cheese. Who hasn't found themselves going through a drive-through to get a quick bite to eat in this busy world that we find ourselves in? You order your food, you say thanks, and drive away, and eat. But what happens if you apply an acoustic microscope to the exchange that you normally might not pay that much attention to? Let's find out. First, I wanted to see if there was anything hidden in my own speech. So I ran my own voice in this exchange through the acoustic microscope. I applied the same magnification that I did on the animals that I examined. It's 50%, 100%, 1,000%. This is my mouth. This is my mouth. It's here either the microscope malfunctioned or some interference from probably a CB radio got in the way of the signal. So I decided to move on and place the drive-through attendance voice under the microscope. But this time, I wanted to see what would happen if I put it on maximum magnification and was shocked to find this. You have helped so many times. I have been your model friend. You have been here so many times. And you have been my father. Last time that we met, we were in a galactic disguise. Right there, hidden in plain sight. An incredible world of magic and music. Always in front of us. Speaking of magic and music, the worst segue ever. With us here today is spiritual teacher and author David Churnikoff who just published a wonderful book called Life Part Two. He's practiced with some of the greatest spiritual teachers of our time, including Chogym Trumper Rinpoche. And now, he's here with us. Everybody, please welcome to the DTFH David Churnikoff. David, welcome to the DTFH. It's great to meet you. Thanks, Duncan. I'm glad to be here. I wanted to start off with a passage from the intro in your book, Life Part Two, that really blew my mind. And I thought we could maybe spend the whole time talking about this, which is those who die before they die are free to really live. Wow. This is so, so wonderful. Not just for someone who's, I love LSD and anyone who's taken enough acid. It's probably experienced that death. But I wonder if we could talk a little bit about sometimes in your own life when you have died in this way. Boy, there have been a number of times that come to mind. One of them was when my daughter was born, actually. I was 41 at the time. And prior to meeting my wife in Nepal, I was planning to do a three-year Tibetan retreat and become a Tibetan Buddhist monk, actually. I had written off intimate partnerships and decided I wasn't cut out for them in a certain sense. Yeah. And after going through a number of live-in relationships and concluding somehow that I wanted to have a really passionate, engaged life, and it was either going to be with a family or in a full-time go-forward commitment as a monastic. Yes. And so meeting my wife and then deciding to marry and have a child was in and of itself an example of letting go of a certain sense of identity that I'd had as a solo practitioner. And at the same time, having a child was one of the most powerful decisions I made in my adult life, right? Yeah. Right there with you. Yeah. I bet you are. And there was a point during my wife's labor, which was quite an extended labor as it turned out, which 63 hours. Wow. Yeah. So she and I both lived and died a number of times during that period. Oh, my. Was it a home birth or was it at a hospital? It was in a hospital birthing center. Oh, wow. But we had one of the only physicians in Boulder, Colorado who would have allowed that kind of labor to go on without insisting on a C-section. Oh, my God. Which my wife really preferred not to have, you know. And the moment that comes to mind when you bring up the question you were bringing up was when I saw my daughter crowning after 63 hours in this birthing center. Yeah. And I had this thought, which seems kind of absurd at the moment, but because I studied the same biology classes that all the rest of us did, right? Yes. But I had the thought there's another person coming out of Marsha's body. Yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. And my whole sense of self and how I understood myself and the world kind of blew up like a fourth of July firecracker. My God. I mean 63 hours. What was there? I'm sorry to ask for a minute detail, but having, you know, gone through birth myself, well, obviously not myself. Having been with my wife, what were you eating? Was there a cafeteria in this birthing center? I know it seems ridiculous, but. Well, there was a grocery store across the street from the hospital. Okay. This was right in Boulder. So periodically I would go across the street and pick up some snacks and such, but I didn't feel like eating much of the time. I was in a kind of altered state, I would say. Yes. Yeah. Yes. That been there. I know that state of consciousness. And I wonder for, let's just forget all the biology classes for a second, because I don't, at least in the biology classes I took, nobody was talking about the way that it, there's a feeling, at least when my children were being born, it reminded me of sitting in the room with dying people. It was, there's this similar energy that appears when people are about to die that seemingly was at least disappearing when my kids were being born. And in like a portal opening or some kind of dimensional rift is opening, an odd sense of familiarity with the terrain. But yet I've, I mean, I haven't been there in 47 years, you know, with this last one. So can you, what do you think from, from your, from the wisdom traditions, what do you think the perspective is on those moments where whatever the hell science is telling us just gets obliterated and we find ourselves in this kind of fundamental, I don't know, primordial mind state where it's like a human is coming out of my wife, or if we're even able to say anything. Yeah. You can see why the first chapter in my book is called Embracing Mystery. Yes. Right. You know, Houston Smith, a great religious scholar, I quote at one point in that chapter in which he said, we are born in mystery. We live in mystery and we die in mystery. Yeah. And, and I think your question is an interesting one because I think these, these moments on the threshold of birth and death. Right. And I did used to do a lot of work with dying people. So that threshold is familiar to me as well. We put us in touch with the limitations of the rational mind and the central dimension that mystery plays in a spiritual life. Yes. Right. We have to give up that part of our mind that wants to control the world and wrestle it to the ground on a rational basis and surrender to being part of a flow that the thinking mind can never grasp, but the open heart can embrace. Yeah. Right. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by Squarespace. Thank God for Squarespace in the ancient times before Squarespace. If you wanted to make a website, you'd have to go down to the CD website designer district of your hometown and look around making all the right signs, hanging the right stuff out of your pockets until finally a web designer would snuffle up to you and make some weird clicking noises cut to three weeks later when you finally got to take a look at the website. You thought they were going to design and it was just some scrabbled splatter that looks like somebody took a bag of cursed runes, took a picture of it and uploaded it to the internet.

And surrender to being part of a flow that the thinking mind can never grasp, but the open heart can embrace. Right. Yeah, it's, it's very difficult to, you know, you know, I don't like the show unsolved mysteries just because Wright going into it. It's like they didn't solve the mystery. I don't want to hear it. I want solved mysteries. I don't want to, you know, I don't want to end the episode being like, okay, they didn't solve it. Just like it said, we don't know. So there that, you know, that kind of itchy feeling of this mystery you're talking about this, this itchy feeling that no, there will be no resolution here. And if they're, and if you think you found a resolution more than likely, you've just, you know, will allow yourself to sink into some kind of, you know, I don't know what's the word with hyper secular materialist perspective. And then you can say, well, we came from monkeys. There was a big bang or matter being sprayed into time with some weird mild sentience as a result of so many neurons interacting. So it's not a whatever. It's not a big deal, but that doesn't quite answer the mystery you're talking about, which implies a much different cosmology than that. Yeah, I think the way that we can relate to the kind of mystery that I'm talking about at a birth or the bedside of a dying person is that in certain moments, the boundaries of the ego dissolve in such a way that we become the mystery. And we understand it through the process of becoming one with it, even if we can't put language to it very well when we come back into our sense of smaller separate self. Right. And, but what about this? Why is it it's, you know, mystery, the mystery is so on one side of it, it can seem daunting. It can seem almost like we're imagining it's not there. It can, you know, all kinds of rationalizations for any, if you've ever brushed shoulders with it or become it when you come back, you look, you think, oh, that was almost like a dream state or something. That, that can't be real at all. And yet, do you have a sense that you would, you want to become the mystery? You would like to become primarily the mystery, whatever, you know, there's other words for the mystery, though I like that word, you know, unitive consciousness, whatever, spaciousness, emptiness. It's odd, isn't it? It's almost paradoxical that when we're fully in ourselves, we're afraid of that thing. But when we become the thing and go back into ourselves again, we long for it. It's a love hate relationship. Maybe you don't have this, but I do. It's interesting. My experience is that at certain stages in the process, we experience a sequential dimension to the movement between the mystery or the emptiness of self and the contraction into the ego identity and the small self or what Suzuki Roshi called little mind versus big mind. Okay. Yeah. Right. And what's happening to me, like I'll be 72 in a few weeks, for example. And I first got involved with all of this as a 21 year old college student. Right. So that's a fair amount of exploring over an extended period of time, you know, and it's certain in the early part of that process, I would bounce between the two levels in a particular way. And they seemed like either or. Yes. Right. And like you were describing, I yearned for the expanded dimension of my being, whatever language we put on that. Yes. And I felt somewhat imprisoned when I contracted into my small self with its self absorption and preoccupation and evolutionary biological influences. Yes. Right. That's it. Yeah. So what's been happening as the years go by is the two are moving into a kind of simultaneity. Wow. Right. Yeah. So that you've heard Ram Dass talk about learning to live on two levels of consciousness at the same time. Yes. Right. And I didn't understand what he meant by that when I first heard him talk about it in the 70s, for example. Right. And yet at this point, I feel like I have more of a felt sense of what he was talking about because I experienced myself a certain amount of the time standing on both levels at the same time. Right. So that I'm not pushing away my humanness or spiritually bypassing what it means to be a human being on the one hand. And I'm also not out of touch with the vastness of my true nature or Buddha nature or Christ consciousness or true self or whichever of those kinds of phrases speak to you. Right. Yes. I mean, it's a little bit like roughly analogous to say, if you're interested in community theater and you're playing King Lear and you're on stage, right, you play King Lear with great gusto and make it as real as possible. Right. Yes. And if your mental health is reasonably stable, you don't forget who you are. Right. Right. And when the curtain goes down, you're able to stop being King Lear and go back to being David or Duncan. Gotcha. Yes. And so it's more of a background foreground shift that begins to happen where sometimes the small self comes to the foreground and that's the primary sense of identity with the vastness as the secondary. Yes. And other times it's reversed in a certain way. Does that make any sense? Absolutely. It's the me that wants to do the dishes and the me that doesn't want to do the fucking dishes. It wants to go watch TV. It's like, yeah, and yes, but I mean, not to turn into some completely mundane thing, but yes, I do know what you're talking about. I just, because I have less experience in this regard and my karma wasn't such that I had the association that you've had for your entire life and I didn't, the closest I came to going off to be a monk was when I was studying Zen in college, my teacher casually was like, I know a great monastery in Italy and I felt that for a second, that feeling of like the plain doors opening up and like this pull, but it just wasn't my thing. It wasn't my karma. And so I didn't dive in that deeply, but what I'm saying is when I catch these glimpses of this thing, and I'm happy to say I have more glimpses now than I did when I was younger, I still don't believe it. It's weird as that's, I go to the small me and then camp out there and think, oh, that's just some, you're just hoping you're having those experiences. You're just this, you know, 47 year old scoliosis and you're, what are you talking about? But then it comes again, like what you're talking about in a very much like some process, some kind of, in a very gentle way, it's there and like, oh, oh, oh right, this is it. Oh yeah. And then I forget. So imagine that very same process that you just described with one slight change, right? All right. And the change would be, imagine that the part that you don't believe is the small self. Yeah. Just flip that, just flip that one around. Wow. That's really, that's an interesting thought experiment. What is, what's that from? It just popped up from nowhere. I don't know. I thought it was some technique. I thought you were about to give me the transmission here. Oh, I, so, but let's, I want to talk more about this. So you, you go from truly, from, from about to do Bill Murray, Razor's Edge, you're about to go into the deep unknown, into the thing to falling in love and having children. And so you really did have to let go of a very, a very romantic kind of life, you know, which I mean, I think in reality, probably becoming a monk, sometimes I wonder if it might be a billion times easier than being a parent. You know, I don't know. I probably, you know, certainly less diapers and less like, you know what I mean? Like my friend was just telling me, when you become a parent, you become a volunteer fireman, essentially, you know, you really come to understand impermanence in, in not in some grand way, but just like, my God, these three year olds are too, they're always on the precipice of some injury, you know, so, or, or so inevitable, an inevitable howling scream will emerge from somewhere in the house that you have to go run to, but, but so tell me about that. Did you ever in the, in the, you know, from your wife's protracted labor to those, those chaotic years of being a new dad, did you find yourself looking back on how you almost joined a monastery thinking, oh, I fucked up, I should have gone, I should have gone to the monastery. Definitely had that experience at times, you know, and, and at the same time, my basic intuitive sense was that it was the right thing for me. Yeah. That, because I, what I realized was, like, I was 41, I was 41 when we got married and 41 when we had our daughter, right? Yes. And, and what, what I realized was that I, I was afraid to really open my heart to other people beyond a certain point. Yes. And part of that was related to my history of having a lot of sudden losses when I was young, some traumatic history along those lines. What did you, what did you lose? Oh, my father died suddenly from a massive coronary when I was 13. Oh, and he was, he had four brothers, and they all also died from coronaries at young ages. Wow. And, you know, one, one of my closest friends from high school died at 28. Okay. A girl I dated in high school died at 26. Right. I just, death seemed to be one of my teachers, so to speak, for reasons I may never understand, but there was a way in which I developed a certain up to the point where I chose to marry a certain unconscious fear of getting my hands really dirty in life and making the kind of commitment that you make with diapers and dishes. And, and, and, you know, I'd never wanted to own a home. I, you know, I didn't, I didn't want to worry about money, and I generally had enough to do the things that were important to me. Right. So I kind of lived like a lay monastic from 20 to 40, is what I did. I did, so I did the life cycle, the lifespan in a different order. Okay. Right. Yeah, I got you. Well, and then we bought, we bought our first home when I was 42. Yeah. And our daughter was born in August of 91. So she's now 30, you know, and lives 10 minutes from us. And she's just a really beautiful human being. How wonderful. But, but I could tell that I knew how to be a monk is what it came down to. Yeah. I knew how to be alone. I liked being with myself. I liked silence and simplicity. Yeah. I liked having a lot of control over my choice making. Yes, me too. Things of that sort. But that was a comfort zone. And the inner guide in me said, you need to get out of your comfort zone. Yeah. Right. And you need to, you need to challenge this fear, right, that you can't tolerate. Like the real fear was, if I did have a child and Mary and one of them died or something happened to them, that I just couldn't take any more of that. Right. Right. Yes. I think I have that thought all the time. I think, you know, I've had an experience, a fair with death, you could say. You know, both my parents got, I had cancer. And, and so not only now that I'm an old dad, not only do I experience that thing where I'm like, if anything happens to these kids, I will never recover from this. There is no way that I can handle that. I will be just, and then I think of all the parents who have, who are going through that or have gone through that, and then that gives you a taste of the level of suffering that's possible in this world. But then also my other neurotic thought, which I'm sure you must have, is like, what if I die even worse or better? I guess, I don't know, depending on what day it is, what if I die? Do you, you must have, you must have had that thought too. You're having a father and brothers die of this similar thing. Surely that thought, that was on your mind too, that at any moment you could be, you could die and these children, your daughter would be fatherless. Yeah, I think the sense of fragility and vulnerability that's a part of our humanness is easy to avoid and ignore and deny, essentially. Yes. But when you have a history with a lot of losses, that denial gets cracked and eventually dissipates and doesn't really exist to the same degree that it would for people who haven't had those kinds of losses. Right. So, so that was part of it. And, and I, and, you know, there's a tendency for those of us who are fathers to identify consciously or unconsciously with our own fathers. Yes. Right. And, and, and I, I, I didn't want to die at 50 from working so hard as my own father did, right? Yeah. And, and I didn't even realize that was a fear in me until I did a men's group at one point on a weekend with a group of men on fathers and sons and relationships between fathers and sons. And it really came up to me at one point when I was doing some personal work in the center of the circle with a friend actually who still lives here in Boulder and, and he took me into a very deep place and I just kind of lost it. And I started to scream, I don't want to die. Yeah. I don't want to die. Okay. Can I tell you my, the first thing I was going to say to you for this podcast was that I just didn't have the guts after looking at your book, the way I wanted to start the episode, I don't want to die. Your book is about, your book is about this, you know, the life part to the second half. I don't want to die. I don't want to, I don't know, like, you know, I'm thinking like, as I'm like getting into the book, like, oh my God, oh God, I don't want to face this like this. So go ahead. I'm sorry to cut you off. I just had to tell you that was the very first thing I was going to say to you when we met. Yeah. Well, the paradox is the part of you that stepped onto whatever you understand the spiritual path to be does want to die, not, not physically, right, but wants to die out of the limited sense of self that feels like such an isolating prison, a fair amount of the time we're walking around during the day. Yes. Right. Yeah, I got you. And so, so to bring it full circle, that expression, those who die before they die are free to really live, right? So, so those, the way I hear that and experience it to some degree is those who die out of those who die out of exclusive identification with the small self are born into identification with our true nature.

Those who die out of those who die out of exclusive identification with the small self are born into identification with our true nature. Whoa, whoa, that is so cool. Wow, I got you. I got you because if we're talking about the two channels is around us, put it. And we're going to make some, you know, dualistic comparison between the two. One is certainly a million times more vital and more. Wow, that's incredible. It reminds me when I was getting trained up for this hospice I did years ago. One of the people who talked to us was someone who had died and and and and said, you know, really emphasized compared to this compared to what happens when you die. This is this is death. This is not and I would always trip me out. But I get I got you. I got you. You just flip it. That's all you have to do is just flip it. And then you realize, wow. So you're saying, no, that's the death. Oh, man, thank you so much for that. That's so cool. Wow, that's so cool. Hmm. It's you really turned it on its head. That's what you were saying earlier to me, too. Oh, you mentioned you mentioned you mentioned the Zen tradition, you know, or a little earlier in your own experience, right? Yes. One of the sayings that they use in the Zen tradition is that Zen will turn you inside out and upside down. Wow. And that's what you just experienced in a way. Yeah, right? Was it a recognition of something that got turned inside out and upside down relative to how you previously perceived it? That's so cool. Wow. I wouldn't be surprised if some people was saying, you know, this is just wrecked their car. That was a really heavy thing to blast us with. What if I just passed out? That would be so awkward. Yes, OK, I love that. That's beautiful. And I appreciate you telling me that that that was something I was missing. You know, I've I've read Shogym Trumper Rinpoche a little bit. And he described enlightenment, actually, you know, people get very excited about enlightenment or but really he said it's imagine if you'd been just standing on your head your entire life and then someone helped you stand on your feet. There would probably be a little bit of time where the whole thing seemed incredibly weird, but really it was just super normal. And it feels like that's what another way of putting what he said. Another analogy for this possibility. But let's face it, let's get deeper into your book. If you don't mind, let's face it. These these epiphanous moments like the one you just gave me. How are they going to help me with my scoliosis that's getting worse? Just like my the chiropractor my mom took me to when I was a teen told me. And I'm like, whatever, I'm not doing these stretches. How are they going to help with, you know, the the the reality that many of us are either beginning to face or facing, which is like this thing that we're localized in right now, whether we like it or not, it's melting down. Man, it's collapsing. It's like somebody threw us inside of Chernobyl and locked the door. And what are we going to do here? How how are how to how to make such a how to bring the mystery into this process that we've all seen or are experiencing. We've been around old people or we're becoming old people. No matter what, you're becoming an old person. How how do we what's the practical application, I guess. For me, the one of the keys is to infuse the whole process with compassion. Compassion, the entire process. Like when I was living and studying and working in Nepal with the Saeva Foundation, I had a dream at one point about Avalokiteshwara, right, the Bodhisattva of compassion. Yes. Right. And in the dream, Avalokiteshwara said to me, the crystal mala is the key that's all you ever need to know. And and the image of the crystal mala, as you might know, in Tibetan iconography, there's different images of Avalokiteshwara, some are called thousand armed. But the primary one and the one that I have, I had a tanka of over there was four armed Avalokiteshwara. And each hand had something different in it. And one of the hands held a crystal mala. Right. So that became a symbol for me of the role, the importance of compassion. And then the next day I went out and I bought a crystal mala that I keep I've had on my meditation table since the 80s. Wow. And and so the way I think we ground all of this in the practicalities of life and the realities of physical bodies that by their nature are born and exist and then become sick and then die. Yes. Right. Is is that we cultivate self-compassion of a particular kind. And there's a variety of practices that can help us do that. And then in the process of developing self-compassion, we start to see the connection between the unique experiences we're having and the universal experiences that all humans are having. Okay. Okay. Right. Right. It's like the bridge. It's the that's it's the bridge to the meta. Yeah. It's one it's what one teacher of mine called suffering as a gateway to compassion. Right. God, it's so hard to have compassion for yourself, though. It's it's an idea. I see what you're saying. It's like, if you can't do it for yourself, how are you going to do it for anyone or anything else? If you can't do it for the thing that you're closest to. But yeah, it's so hard. It's it's it always any time I'm trying to do the self-compassion thing where I'm having a rough day or I'm, you know, whatever the infinite numbers of sorrows that happen to a person. And then I try to do self-compassion. There's always a part of me like rolling my eyes at that flimsy attempt. You know, like, I always a sense of like, really, what are you going to do? Rub your astral back or something? Come on. What is it? You know, this isn't deal with it. So it's so why is it so hard? How do we? How do we do it? I like I feel like I do it every once in a while. But God, it's really difficult. Well, I think partly it harkens back to the mystery or the unitive dimension of things that you referred to earlier, right? Yes. Because if if we if we can reconnect with those experiences in which we know we're not separate from reality as a whole, right, there's a certain kind of natural and organic kindness that arises in that space, right? Where we're quote unquote, one with everything. Yeah. Right. Yes. And even when we come out of those spaces, there's a kind of remnant or memory that remains, right? So so if you go to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro and you can see the view of the valleys below. Yes. And in that brief moment, you really get how everything works and how it's all interconnected. Yes. And then you get back on a plane and fly back to the United States and you're going to work on Monday. You remember what you saw? Yes. You remember that you're a part of that huge interconnected web that you saw from the top of Mount Kilimanjaro? Yes. Right. Yes. And and that's that's the ground of compassion towards self and other. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. Okay. Right. There's there's a felt sense of the inherent sacredness of the whole situation when you're standing on that mountain. If you're exerting compassion, quote, exerting, is that mean you're doing it wrong? Like if I know what you're talking about, I mean, I can refer to these moments, but in the times where I need to be giving myself the most self compassion, it seems like those are the times when I'm farthest away from the view. And and and in that sense, though, I can kind of summon it up kind of when it gets really bad. And sometimes when I'm chatting with people like you, I wonder if maybe because of all the work you've done, maybe you don't get as locked down as some of us do, you know? And I'm sorry if I'm just putting something on you that's not fair, just a dumb judgment or something. But sometimes with my teachers, who are wonderful, I remember my God, these are people who like you have been working and studying and teaching for their whole lives and doing this work. And like you're saying, you're experiencing the dual, you're both channels simultaneously. But for some of us, it's like, you know, suddenly you're just in a box or something, you know, you're in some steel box and you want to you want to. You want to do the compassion thing, but it just anyway, is exertion is on your doing? Can you do compassion wrong is is what I mean? Is it is, is it am I fooling myself if I find myself like being compassionate to myself feels like lifting a heavy weight? Yeah, the word exertion doesn't really fit for me with self compassion, right? Yeah, I think of it more in terms of inviting or encouraging or practicing, right? Because I think it's helpful to think of self compassion as a skill. OK, right. So let's let's talk about it as being analogous to learning to play the piano, OK, right? When you first sit down and take your first lessons, it seems beyond imagination that you'll ever be able to be an improvisational pianist. Yes, who can who can play beautiful music, impossible. Yes, right. And and that's how it was for me. I mean, most of us in this culture and this is particular to modern Western culture is my sense, because I had a private practice as a psychotherapist in Kathmandu, and it was different. That's the craziest thing I've ever heard. Who is your client? What was your client base? I'm sorry. I don't mean to go. You said that, so we have to talk about who are you working with? The hippies that were hanging out there or like? Well, I'm ex-patriots because, you know, like a significant portion of the Nepal's economy when I was there in the 80s was ex-patriots service organizations, right? And NGOs, all these people that ran NGOs from Italy and from England and from the US, like USAID and, you know, the SAVA Foundation. And and then there were these educated people who were natives of Nepal and India, who had either gone to study in India or come to the US and studied and then come back to their home countries, right? And, you know, there was there was a fair, you know, I had a little office at a place called the Himalayan Yoga Institute, where I where I also taught first taught meditation in the 80s. What was your commute like? Oh, you know, I had a motorcycle, so it was about 10 minutes up a dirt road. Wow, that is nuts. That is nuts. You're riding your motorcycle to do psychotherapy. That is the craziest. All those temples where you passing temples and you must. Oh, my God, that is wild, man. That is cool. That is so cool. I don't I'm sorry. I guess I, you know, I have a friend. I have friends who've gone there to like do catamine and stuff like I like I I've heard stories of it, of course. And I've heard about how powerful it is there. I've heard the there's just a lot of energy there, I guess you could say. So I can't imagine what that must be like. Do you think that's a superstitious silliness that it's some kind of a cult motherboard up there? I found I had I had some of the most powerful experiences of my life when I was living over there. OK, yeah, that's what I've heard. That's what I've heard. And I don't know how much of it was the fact that I'd wanted to go there since I was in my early 20s when I started training as a yoga teacher and such. And I didn't go until 1986. So I 15 years I've been wanting to go there and convincing myself that for career reasons or something that I couldn't. It wasn't the right time and so forth. And by the time I finally got there, I wanted to go to where the roots of these teachings that were so important to me existed. I was ripe in a certain way for something, some kind of profound transformation. Right. And and I wasn't disappointed. I mean, it was I couldn't have predicted what would happen. But it was a life changing choice on my part to spend three years in that part of the world and just be there. Well, I mean, when you say the what can you talk about some of these experiences? I mean, did you meet? Did you? Yeah, you know, there's people they talk about who are around that area that you can meet. I don't know. Like, I've just heard stories from, you know, I've heard solve mystery style stories about that place, you know. So yeah. Well, I mean, my primary teacher was a very revered and respected Tibetan Buddhist teacher named Trangu Rinpoche, who's a karma Cognue teacher for people that are familiar with Tibetan lineages and such. And he was a wonderful and extraordinary exemplar of the best of what Buddhist teachings can help a person become. And to have a mentor and a model of that sort over an extended period of time is the kind of blessing that's hard to put words to the gratitude that comes up for me. I mean, if you think about how you feel in relation to having connected with Ram Dass and met someone who was highly realized and showed you the possibilities for a human incarnation. Yes, yes. The gratitude is just inexpressible. It's so tremendous. If you're lucky enough to get gratitude, if you're not just feeling like there's a simulation malfunctioned that I got to meet Ram Dass. And so it's just like, what, you know what I'm saying? That sense of, I am to Jack Kornfield called me a public neurotic, and that is exactly what I am. And so I can't, like I'm always, if I do, I have incredible moments of gratitude from my teachers, and then I feel embarrassed that I'm feeling the gratitude. And then I just feel like, what are you even feeling gratitude for? You don't even deserve it. You just weaseled your way to get to meet them, you know? But that, yeah, sorry. I mean, that's that same self-critical voice that you were talking about a moment ago, right? Like that you have trouble working with, right? Yes. And that kind of self-critical voice is more or less endemic in modern Western culture. Yes. There's a kind of perfectionism that we grow up with in the nuclear family, oftentimes. And I certainly experienced it growing up because I had a very harsh inner critic for most of my young adult and even through midlife, right? I mean, I would go and give a talk to a hundred people and there would be one guy there whose wife made him come and miss Monday night football. And he'd be looking at his phone the whole time or something, right? And at the end, a bunch of people would come up and thank me or say something about how they appreciated the talk. And I would go home exclusively thinking about that one guy, right? And then I was so boring and I couldn't even capture this person's attention or get him to show any interest, right? And so, you know, what one psychologist called the wound of unlove is at the root of that self-criticism that we're talking about, right? And it's a deep one for most of us, no question, right? And at the same time, that's the source, that and a kind of exaggerated super ego function that we have in our culture with its individualism and its competitiveness. And it's pull yourself up by the bootstraps and, you know, like when I was in grade school, we were graded on a curve. So I was happy if you did poorly if we were graded on a curve because I would do better, right? What kind of way to educate children is that? What does that teach people about their relationships to other human beings, right? You know, it's like educational capitalism of some sort, right? Right, right, and yet most of us, you know, we got a good dose of feeling like we're not good enough. Somehow, we're not doing it right, we're not good enough, we're not lovable yet, right? And so the question is, how do we use the best of Western psychology and the best of our contemplative teachings and practices to wear that away, like to dissipate it like water on stone, right? So that as we mature spiritually and psychologically and emotionally, we come to see ourselves with the same eyes that we see a beautiful sunset. Right, one of my trainers years ago when I was, I used to teach Gestalt therapy and such, and one of the Gestalt trainers, yeah, no, I didn't, I didn't, but I met some of his main disciples basically who moved from New York to Cleveland where I went to an institute to train. And one of the trainers said to us at one point, he said, when you work with people, you have to learn to look at them the way you look at a sunset, right? He said, you don't look at a sunset and say, that would be so beautiful if the hot pink part were a little further to the right and the turquoise were a little lower to the left. Can we just jump right back into it? It's been recording the whole time. Yeah, I'm, you know, I like where we've been and I'm happy to go where we go next wherever that might be. Thank you. Well, I this is the core for cut off. I wanted to say, you know, that this, the thing that you're talking about that's endemic in our culture, whatever you want to call it, I mean, when I'm being lazy, I'll just say, well, that's the devil. It's some kind of demonic force that's gotten interwoven into our culture, turned itself into some presentation of masculinity or sophistication or not being puffed up. The way to show that you're humble is not to help other people as to talk shit about yourself or to constantly degrade yourself, at least in some interpersonal never ending hell dialogue. But what I want to talk about is that how to, you know, how to, how to transcend that to create the, the, the bridge, there's no way I'm gonna, I can manifest true compassion for other people. If I, if I'm this thing is constantly going on in my head, or am I supposed to just see this as one of the levels that Ramdas was talking about and let it keep running? I mean, can you, can you, can you turn it off? Do you still do therapy? Uh, I, no, I haven't really done psychotherapy for a number of years. Okay, I'll scratch that off the question. If I could be your client. Okay, I mean, I still draw on it. I do, I do spiritual counseling and spiritual direction and meditation, mentoring and guidance and things like that. And, and I draw on the psychology training and background. But when it's a non COVID period, I travel and teach a lot and things of that sort. And most people, when they establish a relationship with a psychotherapist, they want to go to a weekly meeting or have somebody who's, who's going to be there in a crisis and a pinch. And, and I don't want to let people down because I can't show up that way when I'm traveling a lot and things like that. Okay. Well, look, we're going to cut out that last joke. I want to, we're at, I want to rephrase my question. I apologize. It's just, I got a little flustered because of the computer shutdown. Aaron, if you're listening to this, can you cut to this point? This is my editor. Um, here's the, um, here's what I did and I wish I hadn't. You were beginning to describe the teacher that you met in Kathmandu and then I threw us off track by yapping about my own imposter syndrome. But I felt like we were on the, I could, as I can with Ram Dass and with anyone who's been, who's worked or gotten lucky enough to have the karma to be with a being like that. I could already begin to feel the energy of that person just as your, your love for him was coming through. So I wonder if you could, if you could tell me about how you met him and what that first meeting was like. Perfect. Yeah. Well, this ties right into what you were bringing up about how self-critical we tend to be, right? Because, um, shortly after I got to Nepal, uh, I was very taken by Truongal Rinpoche when he started to offer teachings and he, he, he carried himself in a way that was so unpretentious on one level and so present and so content and peaceful and, and in the moment that it was just inspiring to be in his presence, essentially, right? Yeah. So I asked his assistant if I could meet with him. And I had just completed training in Berkeley in a Master of Divinity program at the place called the Graduate Theological Union, where I had a lot of interest in comparative religious studies and inter-religion, inter-spiritual studies, you could say, right? So I was pretty confused about where I was with my own spiritual practice and path. And so I wanted to talk to him about that and I made this appointment. I went to see him. I came in and as is traditional, I offered him a kata, a white silk scarf as an, as an offer of appreciation. And he touched it to the top of his head and put it over my shoulders and gave it back to me as a blessing. And, and I basically said, you know, I'm here, Rinpoche, because I need some guidance. I'm feeling confused about where I am in my spiritual life. And, and I wonder if you could help me find my way, right? And, and he listened to his English was limited at that point. And he had a better passive vocabulary than active vocabulary, because he was new to Westerners. And he said, tell me about your spiritual practice. And I launched into about a 10 minute spiritual autobiography, basically. And I, and I said, you know, I grew up in the Jewish tradition. I left it when I was about 14. I decided to skip my drug history because I didn't know if that was relevant from his perspective. In terms of the spiritual path, I said, and then when I was 21, I got involved with yoga and I met Swami Satya Dananda, right? And I went through this list of I was four years with this teacher and then I met Trimba Rinpoche. And I took refuge vows as a Buddhist and Bodhisattva vows. But then I decided to leave that community for complex reasons and I met Joseph Goldstein. And, you know, and I went through like three years of this and five years of that. And Father Thomas Keating and the contemplative Christian tradition. And as I was telling my story, I was sitting on a cushion on the floor and he was on a chair. He was a pretty large man, kind of looking down at me, just holding me with loving eyes. And I was feeling shame, though, as I told my story. There had always been this nagging part of me that we're talking about saying, you're not doing this right. Yes. You're digging too many holes, you're exploring too many different practices. Yes. And so he basically just listened and, excuse me, by the time I got to the end, I was so ashamed of myself hearing this voice of mine, because I realized I was asking him for yet more teachings after listing all of these teachers, right? Oh, right. And in my own mind, by the time I finished, I was faced down toward the carpet. I was so ashamed I couldn't even look up at him. Wow. Right. And I was certain he was going to say to me, get out of here, just get out of here, you know. Yeah. And so I peeked up at him this way, and he was looking at me with such compassion and such love, I could hardly believe it. And he leaned toward me and he said to me, very good. Which was the last thing I expected to hear. He said, very good. All of these things are very good. I think that anything that cultivates wisdom and compassion is very good. Wow. And he proceeded to give me a teaching, a particular visualization practice that he wanted me to do. And he said that one of his senior students would give me the details. Right. Now, when I walked out of there, I was shocked because I realized that for 15 years, I had been carrying this self-critical voice that said, I wasn't treading the spiritual path properly. Right. Yeah. And what he saw was somebody who simply wanted to wake up and to help other people wake up and was following all these different opportunities that were coming up in the environment we were living in at the time in the US. Yes. He saw a pure heart of somebody who just wanted to wake up and tread the bodhisattva path. Basically. Yeah. Right. And what happened in that moment was, I saw myself through his eyes. What felt like, I felt like I was experiencing what Tibetans call transmission of mind. Yeah. Right. And I could see through his eyes, he didn't see any problem whatsoever with the way I had treaded the path or lived my life. Right. Right. So, in regard to your question about what's the how to here with cultivating self-compassion, right? Yeah. Part of it, you intuitively found your way to. You hang out with people who have really developed an open heart and a clear, quiet mind who mirror back to you your own true nature and your own goodness. Yeah. Right. That's one of the ways we heal that particular wound and we let go of that belief, that little voice inside becomes less believable that we're not good enough or not doing it right or not lovable or whatever it might be. Right? Yeah. And when you have an ongoing relationship with someone like that, right, that process accelerates of letting go of identification with those parts of the self. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. That's just one example and one process that helps to loosen the grip of that self-critical voice which can seem so real when we're caught up in heavy identification with it. God. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That's beautiful. That's the best. That's the thing that you're talking about that they can do that city or whatever it is where they're able to, it's not just like, I think in the West, we're so used to fake smiles and whatever animal part of ourselves can see right through that shit, but when you're around people like that and they do look at you like that and it is, I know what you're talking about. In stories of Neem Karoli Baba, of course, people talked about what that was like because it wasn't as though they were not aware of all the same things that you were aware of about yourself that were giving fuel to that inner critic, but it's that they were aware of all those things and it's not a big deal at all. Nothing in fact. I don't think it's like those parts are invisible to them. I think they're, at the very least, their understanding of their own humanity helps them see that in everyone because we all have it. When you were taking psychedelics, did you experience that seeing yourself through the lens of the universe in a loving way or has it only been through people? No. I mean, I had that experience with drugs at points along the way, and also in nature. There's a way that certain, one reason I live in Colorado is because the natural beauty in Colorado is so healing and so transformational to have in our front yard, basically, living a few minutes from hiking trails and mountains and so forth. I think there's a lot of ways in which we can experience that sense of seeing ourselves with eyes that are not judgmental, but seeing ourselves as part of nature and as part of this vast wondrous mystery that includes everyone and everything and every aspect of our lives. I think part of what people were enamored about with drugs in the 60s and 70s was that that was a popular entry point to what we're talking about, a glimpse of something. Most people at some point concluded that that wasn't sufficient for stabilizing at the level that they were experiencing things when they were taking the chemicals. Right. Yeah. That seems to be the general problem. Yeah. But the fact of the matter is, for most people, for many people, it was a blessing to be introduced to this other possibility for understanding oneself in the world and it inspired people to study with teachers and to learn about yoga or meditation or chanting or whatever particular skillful means they were attracted to. Right. Yeah. Yes. Right. Definitely. I mean, I think that, yeah, I don't stigma to, I love psychedelics. I'll always love psychedelics. You're so fun, but eventually, you do run into that, what Ram Dass talked about, which is like, you don't want to come down anymore. You don't want to have to keep having these crashes or even worse. You maintain some kind of consistent high via the conduit of mushrooms or acid or whatever, and then you start imagining, there's a strange psychedelic narcissism that can creep in where you forget that these states are coming with the help of a chemical or something like that, and then when the chemical is not there, you're faced with the ground floor stuff, so I get it. Do you, having mentioned all of those incredible teachers that you've worked with, if you had to name a similar, did you ever, did you notice a thread through all of them as similarity in all of them or some kind of fundamental essence of what they were teaching? Well, certainly what I said about compassion, I felt clearly that these people had some compassionate understanding of who I was. I didn't feel judged by them or I didn't feel insufficient in their presence. Even if I was reprimanded, say, or something, I felt like it was a kind of fierce compassion in some cases, but it didn't come from a place of judgment. It came from a place of love and compassion and acceptance of who I was, including whatever I was working out at the time, basically. Another aspect was a kind of lightness of being. These people had a lot of depth, totally got what deep suffering was about and totally understood how difficult life can be and were not in denial of it, and somehow they were able to maintain a kind of joie de vivre, and a joy in living, and an appreciation for life as it is, even with all of its darkness at times. Yes, that, that thing, oh my God, when you see that, when I got to see the Dalai Lama once speak, and I didn't know what to expect, I guess I was expecting some, like, I don't know, solemnity or something like that, and he's there with this translator, and they were so funny, and so playful, and so light, but yet so, like, so there, and like, you know, the whole room, like, the energy radiating, you know, off of the Dalai Lama, who isn't the Dalai Lama considered an incarnation of Avalokita Shavar? So you felt that, what that was, it wasn't like the heavy, you know, depending on what your upbringing is, you might associate, I don't know, spirituality with, like, heavy and tense, you know, people walking around with bibles on their heads, urns of incense swinging, and you gotta shut up, you're bored, your belt's too tight, you know what I mean, but this was like, watching children, like watching the oldest children you've ever seen in your life, you know, playing up there, and wow, that is, yeah, I'm glad, that's a, I want to be like that so damn bad, how did we get there? Yeah, well, you know, maybe you've seen this beautiful book that the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu did together, you know, with a writer, editor named Douglas Abrams, called The Book of Joy, right? No, I haven't seen this book. If you want to get to where you just talked about, this would facilitate the process for sure, right? Ordering it, great. This is a visit, the Desmond Tutu and Douglas Abrams go to visit the Dalai Lama in Durham, it's helped celebrate his 80th birthday, and for five days, the three of them hang out, and Douglas Abrams is kind of the scribe and the emcee, and asks them questions about what they want to pass on to people, about how they've learned to maintain their joy in the face of all the suffering they've been witness to, right? And it's just an exquisite capturing, you know, you the reader get to be a fly on the wall at a five-day visit in Durham Salah with his holiness, the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu, and if anybody had reason to be grim and depressed about suffering, I mean, between apartheid and, you know, the beautiful human rights activism that Desmond Tutu did with the truth and reconciliation process, and what the Dalai Lama led the Tibetan people through, having escaped from Tibet, and how they've been treated by the Chinese, these men certainly had plenty of reasons to be grim and depressed and down on humanity, if you will. Yeah, right. And that they could maintain the joy that they maintain in the way that you're talking about is a very inspiring example of what's possible for us as human beings if we don't look at it through the lens of the small self with a comparing mind and just use it for more fuel for self-criticism. Yes, yeah, and this, you know, by the way, I appreciate you telling me about that book, but we got to plug your book on this thing, you know, now everyone's going to order the Dalai Lama's book. You've put yourself, you're creating like you're competing against the Dalai Lama and Desmond Tutu now. It's like you don't want to be there. You don't want to be there, but I, you know, one thing that was flickering through my mind is I was looking over your book, which I haven't finished yet, is when I was young, my grandmother freaked me out. She said something to me. She goes, when I look in the mirror, I see, I don't remember the age now, an 80, 90 year old, a 90 year old woman, but inside, I feel like I'm 16. And that like was just a mind fuck that like has stayed with me my entire life. I think she was trying to, you know, communicate to me the inevitability of aging or something like that. But what about the, you know, when people see a book called Life Part Two, a book about this, you know, the second part of our lives getting older who aren't old yet, there is a sense of like, I don't need to read that. I'm not old yet. And then you look up and suddenly you're old. This, you know, like the bizarre non-reality of time, you know, that you do know what I'm talking about that. I feel like I was 20, two days ago, you know, and suddenly I've got kids, I'm in my 40s. So is there something in your book that young people can connect to that you think can like, that can help them in some way on their spiritual journeys? I think there is, right? Because I talk about in the book two different uses of the phrase, the second half of life, right? Carl Jung is one person who this phrase is usually attributed to. And he referred to it in the chronological sense that you're talking about, that is, you know, midlife and beyond, you're in the second half of life. A second meaning of that phrase is that there are certain times in our lives where we go through such dramatic changes that it's like dying and being reborn, right? And we could be 25 when that happens. Right. I have an example in the book about a 26-year-old who I worked with when I was still doing clinical work as a psychotherapist, who was a quite brilliant young fellow who was finishing a doctorate in psychology and whose PhD thesis was already scheduled to be published if he finished it on time and so forth. And then sadly, he was in a car accident. And although he wasn't physically hurt that badly, he had a bad head injury, closed head injury, right? And so here's someone whose intellect had been his primary positive characteristic his whole life. And after the accident, he couldn't read. He couldn't write, right? He had a lot of cognitive deficits such as word finding problems, inability to read, some expressive aphasia. He could understand most of what we said, but he couldn't express himself so well and so forth, right? My point being, his whole sense of who he was, which was pinned in large part on being one of the smartest people he'd ever in the room when he was in a room with anybody, all went out the window in one little car flip, right? And so again, this is another meaning of life part two, where life creates changes in such a way that our sense of who we are and how things are is radically shifted. Like at one point, someone said to me in a life coaching session, this is just so hard to digest. It's not even like a new chapter. This is like book two of my life. Wow. But that person was in their 30s. They were not 75 or 80, right? And that could be true after a divorce, for example. If someone gets a late stage cancer diagnosis, right? There's life before cancer and life after cancer for people, right? Sounds like you know something about that. I do. Yeah. And so life part two could have a lot of meanings to it on a secondary level, aside from the chronological second half of life. Right. You're just talking about that shocking moment where you feel like, oh my God, what is the difference between being awake and dreaming? And my dreams sometimes all of a sudden, I'm in one setting, talking to some people as one thing, and then the next, I'm in a completely different setting. There seems to be, but with dream logic, you're not thinking like, oh, I was just like having a conversation with a lizard. Now I'm on the beach with Ramdas. What's happening here? But in human life, this very same thing is happening, isn't it? If you used to be a kid and you're an adult, this is a second part of your life. It might as well be. And yeah, I think there is something really disturbing about that, to be honest. We want to believe so much this thing that we're in has like real connective tissue in that, God, Jesus, when you're like you've experienced this before and you had kids, you were in these relationships, you were so in love, you were so sure of this or that, saying the sweetest things to each other, and then suddenly you don't talk to them anymore. It's really disturbing. Have you found a way in this book? Is there a way for us to deal with that that doesn't involve just having a weird form of existential vertigo as we contemplate the complete insane impermanence of whatever particular situation that we're in? And PS, I'm sorry, I'm ranting, I think every single one of us who is dealing with this pandemic is experiencing a version of like, yeah, guess what, things don't see, things don't just change massively in the individual's life. But as we can see, they happen on a planetary level from time to time too. That's what we're experiencing right now. The question that comes up for me is, what's a wise way to work with this process that you just described, right? Yes. There was a saying I heard in Nepal that I think about when the going gets rough like it is during this pandemic and like these recent fires that we had here in Boulder, actually. And the saying is, the world is like a grinding stone. It will either grind you up or it will turn you into something beautiful. All right, so my question is, what choices could we make when we're dealing with these difficult times, and we are in some difficult times, that's real, that will increase the likelihood of us going in the direction of becoming something beautiful and not being ground up and becoming something cynical or something nihilistic. Yeah. And this is where the wonderful range of creative spiritual practices that we have available to us come into play for me, right? Yeah. I'm not invested in what specific techniques people practice as much as I am, the outcomes. That is, what I think we need, we need more wisdom and more compassion and more love and more insight, a lot more than we need any particular people practicing a certain method of waking up. Right. And so this is where we have to tap into our own intuitions and trust that we have a part of us that's an inner guide of a sort, what Ram Das used to call, and the Quakers called the still small voice within. Yes. Right. And something like meditation helps us to quiet our inner world enough so we can know which one is the still small voice and which one is the participant in a bad city council meeting. Yeah. Oh, God, my still small voice is too small. It's like very, very small. Well, you know, Ram Das used to describe it as the still small voice within surrounded by the trumpets of your desires. Wow. Right. And it's a challenge. It's definitely a challenge. And yet, it's a capacity that we all have that with sincere intention and motivation can be cultivated. Yeah. Yeah. It's true that we also have a remarkable capacity for self-deception. And I talk about in the book on that intuition chapter, I talk about how do we learn to distinguish the still small voice from the voice of self-deception? Right. Right. Yeah. And that's an important spiritual skill that I think we all want to try to develop and cultivate. It's not, I'll tell you what, it's not the one that's telling you to have another glass of wine. That's for sure. It doesn't tell you to like, you can distinguish it, I think, in that way, which is like, but you know, sometimes I get worried, you know, because I only hear the desire trumpets or, you know, I, it is, to be honest, the still small voice idea has always freaked me out, man. It's like, you know, it's just, for one, why is it so still and small? If it's got something important to say, right? Right. Speak up. That's a great question I've never considered, actually. What's the usefulness of it, you know? Get a fucking microphone. I like that question a lot, actually. What is it? Cat's got your tongue? What is it? Yeah. What's going on, huh? I like, you knew there were trumpets? But I, you know, but I do think that there's like a, yeah, there's something kind of unnerving about the concept itself, you know? I, you know, I love, what I really loved about your, what you told us about your teacher is how simple he put it. You know, it went from being you giving almost like a, like you were interviewing or something to work with this person, you're a resume, you're giving your resume, and he took all of that and compressed it into, that's good. That's good. And to me, that's one way I've learned to understand that voice a little bit, because it's so non-sophisticated and non, it doesn't have a lot of, there's not a lot of flow charts and Excel spreadsheets to it. It usually is just saying things like, help, you know, that's it. Or you, why don't you help? That's pretty much, you know, it doesn't seem very sophisticated, but how do you know you're still small voice from your trumpets? Hmm. Well, a big part of it for me is motivation and really, really being willing to examine my own motivation and to see if what's motivating me is some kind of self-interest or some kind of some kind of, am I proving my worth to somebody? You know, is it coming out of a kind of sense of deficiency and a kind of need on the level of the ego? Or is it coming from a place that's deeper, that's trying to, trying to hear what I'm called to do as an instrument of the Dharma, or of love, or of wisdom, or something like that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think paying attention to our motivation and gradually over time purifying our motivation so that we want to be like Hanuman, you know, in Ram Dass' tradition to be an instrument of something much greater than ourselves, whether we call that the divine, or whether we call that the Dharma, or the Tao, or anything else, right? Yeah. And so when it comes from that kind of place of wanting to be used by the universe to be of benefit to other living beings in the planet, I trust it. And when it comes from a sticky place of wanting people to know that I'm smart or something, or wanting people to think I'm, you know, a certain kind of person, or wanting to manipulate someone's attention or something of that sort, that's what we need to be wary of, because that's going to go down a different path of outcome. God, it's so addictive, though, to all those things you just described, they're so addictive, you know, like that, that I want something Chogyam Champa Rinpoche said that I have always found quite terrifying is this idea of like, of, you know, putting down your project, putting down your, whatever your product, just forget it. What happens if you just put it down? And he was talking specifically, I think, of the way you hang out with kids is like, forget your whatever your agenda was, or whatever the thing is you're trying to accomplish here. God, this chills me to the bone sometimes. You know, it's like a this, and I'm sorry if I'm keeping you too long, do you have a little bit more time? I do. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you. This this sense of a relevancy that when you're when you're talking about the Dharma, when you're talking about the the the any any real spiritual path, and you realize that man, the the price of the ticket. Oh, my God, it's not like this is a this is a low ticket price if you're really into yourself here. This is serious, man. That's like the and so somewhere in there, there's a feeling I'll get of like, my God, seems so boring. I want to be interesting and flashy. You know, I want to be, I want you know, the way you blew my mind earlier on, I want to do that all the time. If I could, if I had the power to blow people's minds, I would just walk through the neighborhood, blowing minds, and then I would, you know, I mean, like, you know, that's the opposite. It's so but is so I guess as we start getting older, you know, and I remember Ram Dass talked to one of his descriptions of getting older was, you become invisible is the way you put it. Like, so I guess I guess that's what we're, we have to learn how to do is break our addiction to wanting to be so smart and flashy. Is that what you're talking about? It is, it is, right? Because that invisibility is the source of that lightness of being we were talking about earlier. Right. Right. Yeah, you know, which Ram Dass, of course, used to call becoming nobody. Yeah, that's right. Right. And there's a kind of happiness and well being when you realize that you already are the person that you think you want to become. And you already have what it is you think you need to be happy. So you can stop running around in circles, collecting things that you don't really need. Right. That some part of you was trained to believe you need. Yeah. Right. You were, you were talking about the cost, right? The cost, the high cost of, you know, disidentifying with the small self or the spiritual transformation, right? There's a line in one of TS Eliot's poems where he talks about costing not less than everything. Right. And I got that, I studied with a Zen teacher in Northern California for a while, a wonderful woman named Yvonne Rand, who died, died just a couple of years ago. And I went to Yvonne at one point for an interview at a Seshine. And I was pouring my heart out about some problem that I had. And I was sort of doing this Woody Allen-esque routine that I do when I'm upset about something. Okay. Bringing my hands and stuff. And Yvonne, Yvonne, who could be pretty sharp and like to cut through things, said to me, he said, she said, you know, let me give you three questions to work with. Right. And this is how I would approach the problem you're describing. Ask yourself these three questions. Right. What do I want? What will it cost? Am I willing to pay the price? And then she said, she said, think about those three questions in relation to your struggle. And I've returned to those questions many times since that was probably about 15, 16 years ago. Right. But notice how embedded in those questions is the understanding that I have to take responsibility for how I live my life. Right. I mean, I can choose to get up and meditate or I can choose to get up and watch daytime game shows. It's up to me. Right. And it's not a righteous thing, you know, trying to be perfect and righteous. It's more like down deep in my heart of hearts, what do I want to do with this quote unquote precious human birth that Buddhists talk about? Right. Right. Or Mary Oliver's line, what do you plan to do with your one wild and precious life? Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, that line says so much. Right. But it reminds us that we are choice makers. Right. We don't we don't choose the events that are going to happen to us, or the events that go on in the world. And yet we have a lot to say about how we respond to them. Right. And that's that's what determines whether or not we get ground up or turned into something beautiful. And this thing and the way to respond to these things. I mean, I'm sorry to ask you such a dumb, idiotic question that I would want you to simplify it down. But what is if we do want to not be ground up? If we do, I mean, no matter what, I feel like we're getting I mean, getting ground up, no matter what, I've got my God, we're going to get ground up here. Sometimes it just feels like we're in some kind of centrifuge slash meat grinder or something, you know, we're just definitely getting mixed into the paint of the planet, whether we like it or not. But what is the what is the intention? I mean, I feel like an amnesiac. I you know, if you've seen that movie, Momento, you've seen that thing, I got painted all over the oh, it's good. This guy is amnesia. And he keeps waking up in a hotel room. He's painted all over the walls, you know, like things to like help him understand what how he got into that hotel room and he has to kind of decode it every single day. That's how I feel like I you know, I need a something simple to remind me of this decision, this choice, what is it if you had to articulate the device for us who tend to sink into a really horrific spiritual amnesia just about every day? How do we bring ourselves back to the Dharma? Yeah. Well, the most recent one I've been working with, I think in terms of what I sometimes call tattooables, right, which are these are short, pithy teachings that read that do just what you're asking, bring me back to what I'm here to do and reminding myself what's important to me, right? Yes. And the one I've been working with most recently comes from a one of the spirit rock teacher, Sally Armstrong, who gave a talk in which she talked about what she called this, the six word Dharma. And the idea was the implication was that she could capture these volumes of Buddhist wisdom in six words and convey the heart essence of the teachings, right? And the friend who told me about this who was at the talk that she gave paused after she told me that there was a sixth word Dharma. I don't know if she was developing sort of, you know, she was creating suspense or she couldn't remember what they were or what. And then she looked at me and she said, I said, what were the six words, right? And the six words were, pay attention. Don't cling. Be kind. Wow. Wow. Pay attention. Don't cling. Be kind. All right. And that's what I call a tattooable. That's incredible. And that is a tat that is a tattooable. That is exact. That's, that's perfect. But the clinging part, give me a freaking break. You know, the thing that annoys me about the whole non attached, they don't cling thing. Even though I get it, I get it. If intellectually I get it. And the times I've managed to not cling, oh my God, it's so great. Because, you know, usually when I'm clinging to something, it's like some idea of vengeance or something. Or I'm thinking like, if I don't cling to the fact that this person just did something rotten to me, and I don't keep reminding myself via like increasing levels of secret resentment or something, then I won't be prepared the next time. I feel like a weakling. If I let go, if I let go of the idea that I'm going to like, you know, a hemsa, non violence, right? That it's feel so vulnerable, that don't cling. So when these people who are clearly enlightened and or these people, you, my all my teachers, Ramdas, everybody, don't cling, don't cling, don't cling. It's like, oh, it's like seeing someone on an electric fence and saying, don't cling. No shit. I'm being electrocuted. The other stuff, the other, the other parts of it, I get the pay attention part. I get the be kind part. Oh, I get but the don't cling part. How? Well, this is where the practices come into play, frankly, right? Because as you develop your mindfulness, in other words, as you become a compassionate witness to your own habits and behaviors, habits of thought, habits of behavior, habits of speech, right? Because you're mindful and you see what's happening, you see the results of particular ways of speaking and acting and moving through the world, right? Right. And so if you act or in a certain way, and it leads to suffering, and you notice it, right? The next time you're in a similar situation, you remember, you've been down that street, right? Right. And, and you fell in a hole when you went down that street. Yeah. So either you're not going to go down that street again, or hopefully when you see that hole, you're going to walk around it, right? And, and sometimes we have to fall in the hole enough times to get the message, right? Right. But, but we are educable and trainable. That's a fact. That's a fact, right? Yes, it is. And so that's where clinging comes into play. If you cling in some situation on, you know, whether it's to a person or an identity, or a part of, you know, your physical capacities for that matter, in terms of your body changing and so forth, right? Yes. You'll see how much suffering arises in relation to that clinging of mind. Right. Right. And each time you see that, you begin to see through it just a little bit more, and you gain more foresight into what's going to happen if you do it in the future. Right. Right. So over time, you stop putting your hand in the same fire. Right. It's, but it's a very gradual process. Right. So it takes a lot of patience, and yet it's completely trustworthy. I mean, you don't have to go that down that same miserable street too many times before you say, hell, I'm going to go around the block and go a different way to get where I want to go, right? Right. And then the flip side is the same is true with positive outcomes, right? If you behave in a wise way or a skillful way, or a way that has flow and ease, and that a way in which you're not clinging, and you see the outcome for yourself and possibly others being a positive one that feels easier, right? Yes. That is a positive reinforcement for behaving that way again. Right. So you can, I mean, in a way, the whole teaching of the Buddha could be summed up pretty simply, right? You know, pay attention, like you would said from the first two of the six words, pay attention to what you say and think you do, right? Notice which things you say and think and do lead to suffering for yourself or others, or both, right? Right. Don't do that, right? Yes. Right. And then pay attention to the things that you say and think and do that lead to well-being and happiness for yourself and others, right? Practice those things. Yeah. And when you water those, when you water those seeds, the other seeds atrophy over time. Right. And that's my understanding. That's another simplification of volumes and years on cushions for lots and lots of people. Yeah. Yes. But I've seen this in my own experience enough to trust and believe that that's how it works.

If you wanna jump straight into a conversation with one of the coolest human beings I've ever met on planet Earth, Roshi Joan Halifax, just skip ahead 15 minutes. Alert, alert. Greetings to you, beautiful friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you have tuned in to the cosmic pulsation of Sonic Glory, that is the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. If this is your first time listening, I am a trained actor. I went to the Rosen Glonder School of Method Acting. For example, it might seem like I'm stammering right now, but that's acting, or you might hear that it sounds like I have a cold a little bit, but I don't. I'm just acting like I have a cold, because I have incredibly refined. Acting hours. I don't mean to brag, new listener, but you should know that every single thing that you're hearing me say right now has been written by Farness Chint. Damn it. How about that? Pure acting. That's right. This wasn't actually written by Farness Chint. There was no actual burp that just happened. It might seem like I tried to make up some fake name of a playwright or something, and then burped, but that didn't happen. I acted that out. I'm just acting. Also, you should know, new listener, that my name is not actually Duncan Trussell. My real name is Louisa Dell. I know what you're thinking. I've actually met you in person, and you're not a French woman. You're a dude with a beard. And my only response to that would be, acting hours. In fact, my acting skills are so powerful that not only can I perfectly play the part of a neurotic semi-spiritual podcaster with a voice that sounds like he's a chain-smoking lesbian trucker, but I can also do a dead-on Maya Angelo impression. Check this out. You may write me down in history with your bitter twisted lies. You may trod me in the very dirt, but still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? Just because I walk as if I have oil wells pumping in my living room, just like suns unlike moons with the certainty of tides, just like hope springing high, still I rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes, shoulders falling down like teardrops, weakened by my soulful cries. Does my sassiness upset you? Don't take it so hard just because I laugh. As if I have gold mines digging in my own backyard. You can shoot me with your words, you can cut me with your lies, you can kill me with your hatefulness, but just like life, I'll rise. Does my sassiness offend you? Oh, does it come as a surprise that I dance as if I have diamonds at the meeting of my thighs. Out of the huts of history's shame, I rise. Up from a past rooted in pain, I rise. A black ocean leaping and wide, welling and swelling, I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear, I rise. Into a daybreak miraculously clear, I rise. Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. I am the hope and the dream of the slave. And so naturally, there I go rising. Pretty good impression, huh? I know what you're thinking. You're not an actor, you're just a deceptive French girl wearing the mask of a balding podcaster. Just cause I'm wearing prosthetics doesn't mean that I'm somehow more deceptive than you are cause you have actual skin on your face. Yeah, I come home and peel off the aging bearded mask of a podcaster and look in the mirror and see a beautiful French girl with flowing golden locks. But guess what? That's a mask too. Yep, when I take that mask off underneath it, there's a reptile head. And when I take that off, it's a mitochondrial DNA spiral. When I take that off, it's a bunch of atoms. When I take that off, it's everything. When I take that off, it's inexpressible. And every morning, I gotta wake up at 4 a.m. and put on an inexpressible mask, and then an everything mask, and then a mitochondrial DNA mask, and then a reptilian mask, and then the mask of a French girl, and then a Duncan Trussell mask. And I'm not complaining, I love to wear this mask, but man, that is a lot of masks. Why didn't I pick a Donald Glover mask? But that's okay, I'm learning to love the mask. You can love your mask. And when I forget that, I listen to Ram Dass. And also, I'm a really good singer, but I'm acting like I can't sing. If you heard my actual singing voice, you would probably come. Now let's listen to Ram Dass. Constantly judging and equating, am I as good as, am I equal to, am I as good a mother, am I as beautiful a woman, am I as an effect of this, a worker, whatever it is, whatever dimension. And you get caught in constantly living in a judging realm. And if you start to practice seeing people as trees, I don't mean in the sense of just appreciating what they are, including yourself. It's just starting to appreciate yourself. Appreciate your humanity. Like when I get, like I'm supposed to be, I'm Ram Dass and I've worked on myself and I'm supposed to be equanimous, loving, present, clear, compassionate, accepting. Oftentimes, I get tired, I'm angry, I'm petulant, I'm closed down. Now for a long time, I get into those states and I would feel really embarrassed because that isn't who Ram Dass is supposed to be. So I would appear like I was warm, charming, equanimous, compassionate, and there was deviousness and deception involved. And then I realized that that's bad business because that cuts us off from each other. And I had to risk my truth. I had to risk being human with other people and realize that what we offer each other is our truth. And our truth includes all of our stuff. And the first thing I had to do was accept my own truth. I had to allow myself to be a human being. And I think that I was very helped by my spook friend, Emmanuel, who, my disembodied friend who, when I said to him, Emmanuel, what am I doing on earth? He said, why don't you try, you're on earth, why don't you try taking the curriculum? Why don't you try being human? And I had always assumed the way to God was to deny your humanity and embrace your divinity. And then I realized that the way to truth might be through acknowledging the fullness of where I found myself to be, which was my humanity and my divinity. And not wallow in it, but acknowledge it. And not reverence it or judge it. Just appreciate it, just allow it, allow my humanity. So I have gotten to the point now where I am what I am much more. And some people like it and some people don't like it. And if they like it, that's their problem. And if they don't like it, that's their problem. I don't take it all on myself and as much. And well, it's a slow process. It's a slow process. Now, what I found was that as I started to allow myself as I started to allow myself to be human more, just allowed what I am, things changed much faster in me. I mean, things fell away more quickly. It was as if I was locked into a model which was based on that negativity, that dislike of myself. And once I just allowed that I am human with all the foibles, things started to flow and I could feel change occurring in myself. And then I would start to experience my own beauty. And it frightened me because it was so dissonant and discrepant from the model that I had cultivated of myself over the years. That I had to do good in order to be beautiful. And the idea that I just am, that what is, when you look at a tree or a rock or a river, it is in its own way beautiful. You look at decay, it is beautiful. I know Laura Huxley, who's a very dear friend, in her kitchen. She has these jars over the sink and she takes old beet greens and orange peels and things and sticks them in water in these long, beautiful pharmaceutical jars. And then they slowly mold and decay and there are these beautiful decay formations and mold. And it's really garbage. It's garbage as art. And we look at it and it's absolutely beautiful. There's absolute beauty in that. And I've begun to expand my awareness to be able to look at the universe as it is and see what is called the horrible beauty of it. The horrible beauty of it. It's, I mean, there's horror and beauty in all of it because there's decay in all of it. I mean, we're all decaying. I mean, I look at my hand and it's decaying. And it's beautiful and horrible at the same moment. And I just live with that. And with that, I start to see the beauty in it. So we're talking about appreciating what is. Not loving yourself as opposed to not liking yourself but allowing yourself. And as you allow, it changes. That's about, I think that gets behind the polarities. I think that's what's important. Now I'm playing the part of an actor from the South. He's not very good at doing a Southern accent. And the reason I'm doing that is because it's easier for me to act like some ridiculous character than it is to tell it to you straight. Cause if I tell it to you straight, you end up sounding pious and just, I don't want to be that dude. Not me, not old Earl Clinster, the moonshiner who sucks raccoon dicks. The main thing is this. A good friend of mine told me this next to the still the other day. It's all God, man, the act, the thing that isn't the act, the fearlessness and even the fear. It's all God, God, what the heck's that I said to him? But he didn't answer because his mouth was full of raccoon dicks. Well, I guess that's about it for me. I'm going to head on back to the Bayou. And well, I don't have to tell you what I'm going to do. We've got a great podcast for you today. With somebody who isn't putting on the show. Roshi-Joan Halifax is here with us today. I'm going to jump right into it, but first some quick business. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by the super geniuses over at Stamps.com.

She has changed my life with only a few conversations that I've been lucky enough to have had with her. She's written many great books, including shaman, the wounded healer, the fruitful darkness, a journey through Buddhist practice and tribal wisdom and most recently standing at the edge, finding freedom where fear and courage meet. This book is an essential book. If you are human and you have the desire to help or if you're someone who's been helping and you're getting tired. Also, if you're someone who lives in Santa Fe or you feel like diving deep into the world of Buddhism and Zen, Roshi Joan has a Zen center out there called Upaya. They've got a really cool program coming up on July 6th called Poetry of Awakening. And that is with Sensei Kaz Tanahashi and Stanford scholar Linda Hess. All the links you need to find Roshi Joan and Upaya will be at DuncanTrussell.com. Now everyone please welcome to the DTFH, Roshi Joan Halifax. Welcome! Roshi Joan, thank you so much for being on the show. It's such an honor to be in your presence. Thank you for for doing this. Duncan, I'm just so happy to see you again. I think it was a year ago here in this very place. Is that right? Was I here? I think so. I think it was about a year ago. I remember you and Ragu. We had a lot of fun in the interview. We did, for sure. I love, to me, something that's really fascinating about these Ram Dass retreats is that they book people who seem to have philosophies that, in some ways, are existential threats to some of the things that Ram Dass and Ragu believe in or talk about. And I love that. I think it's so fascinating to throw the two things together because here we have the soul, Neem Krolibaba, these very mystical things, and yet you are a Zen Roshi. Can you talk a little bit about that mix and why they do it like that? Well, I don't know. You'll have to ask them why they do it. I mean, why I do it. I sometimes joke. I say, you know, I mean, I've known Ram Dass almost 50 years. We're really close friends. And also, he's just surprising. He's kind of you thing on us. He's somehow eternal. He has this capacity to just hold everybody wrapped in the space. So part of it is I come here because my love for R.D. And I come here also because it's such a weird scene for me. It's completely opposite from what I do in my other life. And actually, I have several other lives, but none of them vaguely resembles this one. And it means it's like moving to another planet or being in another culture. But it's not just the difference. I actually feel it's like a heart transplant. There's some kind of psyche that opens up here where people are just kind of melting all over the place. And I find that kind of healthy. I mean, at least for me, because I have to be very precise in the kind of work that I do in the medical world where I'm teaching clinicians. So precision is really important. As a Zen person, I have to be very precise as well. Here, I can be, you know, very imprecise. And it's not just a matter of coming from the heart. It really has to do with the power of this community. And I think it's really healthy. I also like a varied diet. So if I weren't, you know, if I were just teaching in medical settings all the time, that would be kind of a mono diet. But, you know, coming here, I feel like, you know, oh, yeah, that part of me, which I can drop into. I feel it very often. It's sort of underneath. It's like the hum under everything. But here, it's all hum. Yes, it's beautiful. It's so beautiful. And I love them because I think one of the reasons they let me come here and interview them is because they know I ask them questions that are, I don't know, difficult maybe, or it comes from, it used to be authentic skepticism. I was asking them questions from an authentically skeptical place. And now I feel like I'm having to feign skepticism because I feel so connected and filled with love when I come here. But, you know, I do, my mind can't help but think things that I, for example, I think like, let's imagine that, I don't know if you've thought this yet, but what would happen if Neem Karoli Baba showed up here in the flesh if he walked into the retreat and suddenly we have an embodied guru, an apparently awakened being in the midst of a retreat that's been talking about the awakened being and telling stories about the awakened being. What would happen? This is something that's been troubling me a little bit because I keep thinking like, I don't know how many people would stay. Like, I wonder if people would be offended, if they would leave, if they would feel threatened. Here we have a man who's a conduit for the divine in the flesh, not stories. We can control stories, stories are domesticated, stories are tame. But when, what would happen if some people at a spiritual retreat came into contact with Neem Karoli Baba? What do you think would happen? I mean, what would you do? Well, my hope is that I would be overwhelmed by the telepathic love frequency. I would hope that my reaction would be the way that I react to my sense of this being in my life already. Is that it would just be something either identical to that or more than that or less than that. But speaking with Buddhists like David Nicktern, who teach me a great deal about analyzing experiences and things like that, I wonder sometimes if that being that I feel like I've come into contact with is in some ways a delusion. And I don't think there's anything wrong with thinking about that. But do you ever think about that sometimes when people say they've come into contact with a disembodied love field that has a name, Neem Karoli Baba, that perhaps this is a delusion to try to maintain a sense of security or come up with an easy answer for problems that need deeper exploration? Well, I think that's one way you can look at it. I think there are many ways to look at it. One of the ways is with that sense of skepticism or disbelief, the other is that what isn't delusion? We're all in a certain way wrapping narratives around our moment-to-moment experience and giving a sense of meaning or purpose or direction. This is how we communicate as human beings to each other. So what I would do if Neem Karoli Baba showed up in the flesh is I would just do my best to get up close and personal with him. Right. I mean, here's a guy who, he's awake, he's got a family, he has had an effect on many, many people, generations of us indirectly through the experience of others and he's really helped a lot of people. I mean, he's served, his incarnation served and we are in a certain way, his reincarnations. Right, right. Yes, I feel like that. So it's totally beautiful from my point of view and the pictures of him, R.D. telling the stories, Ramesh, Raghu, Krishna Das, Katie talking, I always feel like they're evoking the presence of Neem Karoli Baba as a lived experience for all of us. It's transmissional. Yes, I feel that way. I do feel that way. That's a thank you for that answer. I love that. It's beautiful. My feeling with it as well, if it's a delusion, it's a pretty, it's a fantastic delusion in the sense that it's, the experiences I've had are so impossible. The synchronicities are impossible synchronicities, not what's the word for it, confirmation bias synchronicities but synchronicities that are mind-crushing or mind-blowing or ego-devastating. Have you ever had any experiences of that nature? Well, I have, but you know, I just think this moment itself is mind-boggling. I mean, if I don't stand outside of it but I am consumed by it, I'm subsumed by it, I allow myself to actually slide into it or to be brought into it. Tick Don Han calls it the miracle of this moment. This moment is itself a miracle. And I remember Duncan in my far past, I ingested many entheogens and sought altered states of consciousness. And at a certain point, I just, I thought, oh, you know, they're interesting, they're stylish. They certainly have been a door to practice for me. But if I open the doors of perception, I'm not looking for illusion. I'm actually appreciating what's, I'm experiencing right in this moment. I wanna talk a little bit about what you just said. Stylish, stylish, I love that. There is a sexiness to them, isn't there? There is a, it's like a tail feather you throw up. There's like, because if you go to a group of people and you're preaching some psychedelic story, it's, it's, people are gonna- Seductive, seductive, like what is this? Wow, amazing. When you listen to Terrence McKenna's stories of DMT and you're, you almost feel like you've smoked DMT. But if you come to people and you say, listen, here's the thing, this present moment, the now, onto the next one, that's just, you know, what is it about, what is it in us that makes us feel like the present moment is boring compared to the astral plane, the heightened states of consciousness offered to us by psychedelics? Well, first of all, these altered states we enter into and these alternate realities that appear in the altered states, I don't know from whence they come. In other words, you know, what is their source? Are these planes of consciousness that people enter and that people identify as real, are they real in some sort of way? So I don't wanna exclude those possibilities. It's not any different from my point of view or from the Buddhist point of view, than for example, falling asleep and entering into the dream or the dream arising within you and the dream body inhabiting you completely. So, you know, when you're in the dream body, mostly you don't know it, you don't have the experience of lucid dreaming. So whether you're in the dream body of this world, the moment-to-moment world, or the dream body of a dream that arises in the context of sleep, or the dream body that arises under the influence of an entheogen of a sacred plant medicine, the point of view is not to be swept away ultimately, but it is to wake up, it's to get very clear. And I think part of the clarity is to end the tendencies within our human experience toward harm, and that for me is kind of where the rubber meets the road. If you wanna know what integrity is, it is really about having a life that is dedicated to non-harming and to ending harm. Is this called ahimsa? I think you can call it ahimsa. One of the ways that we translate ahimsa is non-violence. And non-violence, I think, I wanna recommend that you interview Father John Deere. He is the spokesperson, the sort of living embodiment of non-violence today. He is a total visionary, Jesuit, a Christian, and he's been in prison in jail more than 75 times. He was very close with the Barrican brothers. And he is Barrican, no. I don't know them. Okay, they're both gone now. But the Barricans were the greatest activists in terms of, and really moving thousands upon thousands of us into an ethos that was against the war. Okay, got you. Okay, so non-violence, not doing harm, harm reduction. So are you a vegetarian? Do you eat meat? You know, I eat a little meat. I do. Me too. But not much. You know, I actually, it's interesting. Whether it's a fish or chicken, I don't eat other kinds of meat, but I'm not comfortable eating meat. And there's times when my body feels like it needs, you know, something, a protein that's heavier. Right. But I don't feel good about it. Well, I want to talk about this because this is something that's been troubling me. And I was talking to a friend of mine as a hunter, and I was telling him, you know, I don't eat pork. I don't eat pigs. And he said to me, have you ever seen boars, wild pigs out in the forest? Have you ever seen wild pigs? You know what they're like out there? And what they do to the environment, what they do to, you know, for example, there's a little island off the coast of Georgia that I go to that my family has a little house out there, and we go out there, and they have pigs on the island. And if you don't cull the pigs, the pigs destroy the island. So the violence from not culling the pigs ends up becoming, there's violence from not doing the cull. The pigs become a vehicle of destruction. There's more violence that comes from not culling the pigs. If you let them, if you didn't tame their population, then all the, much of the island's ecosystem would be radically shifted for, maybe in a way that's great for the pig, but not so great for anything else. So when we talk about non-violence, I wonder, does this mean not killing? You know, I think it does actually, Duncan. I think it's pretty clear that violence happens in many different ways. Direct violence happens through, you know, killing or various forms of physical and mental abuse. Then there's structural violence, where institutions actually cause harm to whole groups of people or to individuals who are unusual, so to speak. So the issue of violence is really important in our culture right now, that we look at it. And what we see, you know, I can't say what is the ecological system on the island that your family, you know, has a house in. Where the boar's introduced, nature has a way of kind of balancing things out. I mean, climate change is a response to interference by human beings through consumeristic activities that have caused great perturbations in our weather system. So we, you know, we have inserted ourselves in a living system that is seeking to rebalance itself, in part through, not consciously, I presume, although one never knows, but through the destruction that is arising in terms of climate change. Well, that's an effort to harmonize or to balance. So, you know, to cull the pigs, and I have seen wild boars, they're pretty aggressive, grungy creatures. And, you know, in a way, they exemplify the worst in the human psyche. So it's kind of interesting. Did human beings introduce them to the island? One wonders. And also, if they were left to be the marauders they are, what natural forces, other than human beings culling them, would assert and actually create a more harmonious, less destructive, less destroyed environment? It's an interesting question. But it's also, I don't know, killing animals is, you know, I just saw in passing, they're introducing chickens into retirement homes. And, you know, here we are merrily eating chickens as if the chickens don't make any difference, but they're making old people happy. So, you know, it's like, oh, we have to care a little bit more about the chickens. And then there are domesticated pigs. And domesticated pigs are really intelligent animals. Now, they're archetypally looked on as greedy and they eat everything. But, you know, they exemplify greed in the human psyche. And we've objectified them and kind of crucified them as a result of that. Well, sure. I mean, this is, to me, when I, like, I so love Buddhism and I so, and everything about it is just, the deeper I explore it, the more my life gets better. And there's something just that I think so remarkable in it and that just the simple exploration of it is transformative. It's just looking into it helps you wake up and for real. But yet still there's this non-violence. And I, when I think of it, I just think, well, look, man, how about you stop thinking about pig calls and look at, like, where you're being violent right now. Where is the violence in your own life and how much of that do you have control over? And how much do you think we have control over this? Well, you know, I think we can become obsessive to the point of, you know, feeling like we can't even put our feet on the ground or we, you know, every piece of clothing that we wear has been sourced in some activity that's created harm for others. You know, Duncan, we do the best that we can. And we also have to open ourselves to the kind of humility that arises knowing we can't have a perfect world. We all, in one way or another, live with moral remainder. It's like the residue of the harm that comes about from just being alive. Wow, wow. What did you call that moral? Remainder. Moral remainder, yes. Right, this is, this haunts so many people, doesn't it? Consciously and unconsciously. I actually, I write about it in my new book, Standing at the Edge, Finding Freedom Where Fear Encouraged Me. And I talk about, you know, there's almost no way to escape moral remainder. What is really important is how do we live with the residue? Yes. And that's the point. I mean, you know, we can't, we're not gonna be perfect. Harm will arise. You're gonna do the best you can. Most people, even, you know, the most deluded, harm-driven individuals, like I worked in the Penitentiary of New Mexico as a volunteer for six years on death row and maximum security. Wow. If you're on death row and maximum security, it means you've killed somebody. Yes. And those are the men that I worked with, I'm teaching them meditation. And I learned a lot about how even those who have harmed others in ways that are just nightmarish to consider, they, in their way, were also seeking happiness. And I learned that. I thought, oh, my Buddha. Everyone, even though there are ways that we seek happiness that harm others or are just completely deluded, like people, for example, getting high from anger. I mean, you know, it makes you feel good. Yes. But actually, from another point of view, anger is a very destructive mental state, not just for the object of anger, but also for those who experience it. But people will, you know, it's like chocolate. You know, you eat too much of it and you'll get sick. And you're in that situation where suddenly, you know, maybe a little bit of anger gives you energy and insight, but being overwhelmed by anger causes harm. So, you know, you're always trying to modulate and to dose yourself with the right amount. Oh, anger is so embarrassing. I would so rather be scared than angry. Like fear is kind of cool. Like if you get scared and someone sees you get terrified, there's something in that that's so vulnerable and beautiful, but man, anger. Oh, it's embarrassing to get angry, isn't it? It's so, the way you hold your body and the, you know, one of the things I love about Buddhism and the teaching of mindfulness and watching yourself is that you do get to a place where you watch your angry state and you're watching it and you're thinking, man, this is not in any way, shape or form, a good look. Well, another thing I learned, you know, working in the prison system, it is actually an institution of anger. Everybody's angry, the COs are angry, the warden is angry, the guests of the correctional system are angry. Not everybody, I'd say, you know, 90%, but what I learned Duncan was fascinating is that anger for most people arises out of a sense of helplessness and when you lack agency or you feel threat, anger becomes the default mode for you and no, it's not cool. And it is about not having the confidence to where we're all to uphold yourself in the midst of conditions and to, you know, really become in a certain way a victim to your own sense of, you know, my ego is being threatened. But look at this world right now. This is something where that is so, to me it's just, you know, I hesitate to even talk about it and this brings me to your book, which by the way is just spectacular and I'm so grateful to you for writing it, it's so great. And it's given me a lot to think about and I've been thinking about it, these edge states. And so I hesitate even talking about this because I've gotten to the point now where I've decided that even talking about politics, talking about the government, talking about it at all is to be in some way contaminated or is in some way to draw attention to a thing that feels like it's drowning out a much bigger problem. But so I, that's the case. Well, you say much bigger problem, which one? I think it's the much bigger problem is that people have become fixated on the state. Oh no, I'm sorry. The much bigger problem is that we're gonna die and that we're selfish and that we've forgotten that and we're fixating on the state and the state is figuring out how to be entertaining in the most vile way. And in the old days, the state was in some ways, it seemed like stodgy, formalized, almost boring. I'm not saying Nixon was boring, but it was in a weird way, malefic, but in a kind of dull down way. Now the state has evolved and it has become its own garish reality TV show. And so it's grabbing our attention. And it's, many of my friends, I have a very close friend of mine who has become darkened by it. And truly, I don't wanna say hurt, but from the, this is a person who's been very influential in my life, his spirit is one of like, I want the world to be great. I want love, I want people to evolve and for there to be love and fairness and justice. And his fixation on the government has disrupted his consciousness in such a way that he has become- He's colonized. That's what it's called? Yeah, I mean, this is what happens when someone experiences moral injury, when seeing the harm that a system or that another can do. And you look at it, I mean, this is actually people in the military, many people suffer from moral injury, but I feel that we're in a process of global moral injury that we're seeing so much corruption, so much harm, and we're not able, we feel, to do much about it. And as a result of that, we feel in a certain way disgusted with ourselves and also ashamed. And that, and a sense of self-blame. And then it drives people into apathy. Moral apathy is something that really is insidious in our society. It is characterized in many different ways, but one of the ways is through addictive behaviors. Okay, sure. So, like fixation, like being addicted to the news, for example, or being addicted to drug sex and rock and roll. Sure. Food, consumerism, and whatever we can do to distract ourselves and to dull our pain, these are forms of moral apathy. This is when we have withdrawn ourselves from the truth of suffering in the world, even though we might allocate our attention completely into the midst of that suffering, but it's done in a way of addiction, not in producing insight, but there's some kind of, you know, like dopamine, a hit that you're getting from one catastrophe after another. Oh, that's right. I mean, it's great. It's great. It's just little bumps of some kind of satanic powder that, and it is that there is a set, like when you really look at yourself and you realize, oh, I'm kind of getting off on this. I'm getting off on it, but I want to talk about this. So this is this edge state, these edge states that you write about, we have altruism, empathy, integrity, respect, and engagement. And so the book was revelatory for me because I'd never even considered that these were edge states. And I always thought of these states as in states, maybe if you're lucky, you know, empathy. I never thought of the reversal of these things. And I never thought that you could topple over onto the other side and become a real mess. But when a person has fallen over, you know, and not only just fallen over, but fallen deep over in the sense that it's gone beyond even a sense of like, I can even climb out of this mess. Oh, I'm happy here. No, this is where I am. This is who I am now. This is the, you know, the classic, I mean, Lord of the Rings, you know, where a wizard starts off being like this, a good wizard, but then accidentally the thing it's fighting becomes the thing and that's right. How do they get out? Well, you know, sometimes your friends help you out, so to speak. I mean, it, I have to say, I feel really fortunate to have had the opportunity to interact with so many people who have, you know, good people trying to do good things in the world, but who are actually suffering because they're engaged in a way that is not cool. And so, for example, like altruism, very, you know, you and I wouldn't be alive saved for the altruism of our parents. In other words, you know, somebody had to feed you. Yes. Is your parents or your step parents or whatever. Somebody had to take care of you. It's kind of the selfless act on behalf of others to alleviate their suffering. And yet, what you see is just really interesting. How many people actually go too far to the point where they're harming themselves mentally or physically. Yes. But there are stories that are really interesting. I'm sorry, may I ask you this? Is that, so would that be considered violence? It is, it's self-violence. Yeah, pathological altruism. It's when we harm ourselves or we harm the very people that we're endeavoring to serve or we're harming the institution or the nation that we're trying to serve. Right. Or on the institution that we're serving in. This is, to me, so insidious because a person who starts off with some altruistic intention and then becomes colonized, so to speak, becomes almost worse than the thing that they were, because everyone thinks of this person as being the altruist. And now this person is rampaging in a way where they're still wearing that mask a little bit and it's hurting people. Wow, it's so insidious. Well, Duncan, that's, I mean, I was talking about moral injury before and in the section in the book on integrity, I identify four different ways that the shadow side of integrity show up. In the sort of big category, it's moral suffering. But the first one is moral distress. And moral distress happens when we, for example, your friend who's politically charged up, completely distressed, floating between visions of attack and futility. Yes, yes. So, and by the way, there's a ton of people in our culture who are in that state of mind and they've got AK-47s. I mean, you know. So, moral distress arises when we see how to shift a situation, but we can't effect it. We effectuate it. We can't make it happen. Everything is blocking us. So we experience moral distress because our integrity is threatened by the fact that, you know, we want to do something, but we're paralyzed. We can't do anything. So that's moral distress. Then moral suffering is when an individual or a group of individuals actually witness or engage in activities that are harmful to others and have a kind of crisis of conscience where they feel ashamed. Right. And there's many examples of moral injury, not just in the military. It's primarily identified among military people, but it's, you know, you see it in medicine. You see it in law. You see it in politics. You see it in education. You know, it's really, it's much more pervasive than we recognize. It's when teachers are driving their students, you know, no child left behind. It's when politicians are conning their constituents and so forth. Right. And, you know, when a politician wakes up, I think that, you know, like John McCain in a certain way as he's dying is going through the experience, if you will, of moral injury and wanting to sort of straighten out the record. Right. And wanting to be, you know, less political and more conscientious in these final days of his life. Then there's moral outrage. And it's when you see how disgusting politics or the corporate world are, and you experience a mixture of anger and disgust. And that's called moral outrage, where you are basically holding up as an example those who are harming others. And, you know, it's full of shaming and blaming. That's though, to me, this is, I would like to talk about this. So this is, and this is not a very popular thing to say, and I will probably be slammed for this. But, you know, recently, there's what it's called the press club. Oh yeah, right. Right, the press club thing happens, and a comedian like does this like vicious brutalizing of a great many people, who many of them are not great people. And it was, you know, this is a comedian. She's great. She's trained. She's from New York. She's like a trained roast. She's good. She knows what she's doing. She's a surgeon. I mean, it was, they basically invited a tiger into a room and let the tiger out. And the tiger did what you might expect a tiger to do. So in no way am I saying she, you know, shouldn't have done it or should have done it or whatever. She did what, she did her job, if you ask me. But something in it made me so bummed out. Because it's like, well, I guess this is what we're doing now. Like pretty bad. We attack you. You attack us. We attack you. You attack us. Increasing levels of outrage, increasing levels of superiority, righteousness, and where does it get us? Where does it get us? Well, it demoralizes us. It demoralizes all of us. You know, I think you and I both want to live in a civil society. We don't want to live in a repressive society. But we want to live in a society that has a view of the humanity of every human being. Also, the creatureliness of every creature. But let's just stay with the two-legged. For us to engage in bullying, disparaging, denigrating discourse, even against the worst of our enemies, the people who are the greatest harmers, if you will, doesn't make things better. That's not what the Buddha would do. It's not what Jesus would do. It's not what Muhammad would do. And it's not, I think, what you would do. No. I mean, I'm not that funny, but I would be. At least in that way, I'm terrible at rose jokes. But I know what you mean. And then, OK, so let's talk about this a little bit. Because this is this moral outrage thing. This is the game in town right now. So the response is, OK, well, if you don't want us to call these people out, to alienate them, to ostracize them, shame them, humiliate them, make them, expose them as the demons they are, what do you suggest we do? What do you suggest? Because should we give them an audience? Do we let them? The greatest example I've heard is, like, all right, you go and have an open-minded conversation with a Nazi. And I'm going to keep punching them. And let's see what works. Because we don't need to do anything more than give these people the, in every single way that we can, a hard time. And if you want to be Zen and Buddhist and Gandhi-ish and all this stuff, go ahead and see what happens. See what happens. We tried that. It doesn't work. What is the answer? How do we deal with them? Well, I actually don't know how we deal with them. But I have a little more sense of how we deal with ourselves. And to engage in behavior's talk that is disparaging, bullying, denigrating them, where you're putting people down like crazy, is not going to help anybody. And it basically is a reflection on your own character. And so really, the point of practice, Duncan, is to have the capacity to see deeper than the personality. Tick-Not Han talks about it in terms of a wounded Buddha. So I look at Trump as a wounded Buddha. I practice when Dick Cheney was vice president. I found him a highly problematic individual. And I had a very aversive response to him. And yet he was a powerful foil to practice with. Every time aversion would come up, I would. And I actually write about it. You said aversion. Every time aversion would come up. Aversion. OK, yes it is. You're like, ugh. Yes. It would be like a mindfulness bell because it came up a lot. And I would think, I would go, that is, he's still a human being. Just like I experienced with people in the penitentiary. This is still a human being. This person was a baby once. This person is going to die. If I were asked to sit by his bed as he was dying, would I do it? Of course I would. It's like being able to see through to a. It's like John Paul Letterac, because this great peacemaker talks about this in terms of rehumanization. It's rehumanizing even those who from the perspective of our experience, our side of the equation, to see this is still a human being. And even though they are destroying the environment, even though they have caused vast harm, whole ethnicities, people like the Rohingya are being driven out of Myanmar. You know, I'm trying to really understand that crazy Nazi monk who is turning, you know, all those Buddhists into races. He's still a human being. And how do I not actually buy into his process of dehumanizing others? So I feel it's really important to, you know, hold your, you know, one self accountable and to see every human being as worthwhile, even if even though I don't have to love, like them all. I think I have to love them all, but I might not like them all. And I will work as I have for, you know, decades for justice, for social justice, now environmental justice, but not at the expense of, you know, allowing myself to degrade my character by disparaging others. Well, this is, to me, another, as I'm reading the book and realizing what your life is like and realizing it's just thing like I've like hung out with that person and I'm reading these stories of you and Nepal in these camps and realizing that you, you really, for lack of a better word, you really put your money where your mouth is. You're not messing around your, well, you know, many of us, like me, we have a podcast, we talk, we have fun. I have a wonderful life that I love so much. You're traveling around the world, actively trying to get blankets to people, actively trying to ease suffering in the world. And as I'm reading that, I became aware of a force field that exists between me and that this thing of like, I just don't, I love the stories, hearing about what you're doing. It's beautiful when I think, oh my God, this is brilliant human is going around the world giving people blankets. But that's not really me, you know, I do a podcast and you know what I mean? What is that? How do we overcome that? What is that weird, like, for, I think for many of us, not just me, the thing that you're doing seems like a dream or a fantasy or a kind of like, it seems like something on the other side of the mirror. When did you cross over into that person? You know, I think I've been that person for a long time. I mean, I think it's part because I was really sick as a kid. I talk about that in the book. And the person who took care of me when I was in this state of, you know, great sickness between the ages of four and six was a totally amazing person. She, you know, her, her, she came from the Bahamas. She was the most resilient person I ever met. She had a disposition that was just so joyful. And she gave me, she taught me about slavery because her forebears had been slaves, but she also taught me about dignity and joy. And so I, you know, I was kind of lucky in a certain way to be blind for two years because I had a chance, one, to realize I had an inner life. I was poorly socialized as a result of being isolated in my experience of illness. But also I recognized that, you know, I had, I had a relationship with this extraordinary human being, which when I became healthy again, I didn't understand why there was discrimination against somebody who was so extraordinary and it blew my life open. It totally blew my life open. So, you know, since I was a child, I have been involved in issues related to justice and compassion, but social justice is really important. Now it's, you know, I feel the same way about the environment. You know, the environment is in a way being slaved by corporations. Right. And so, you know, the liberation of the environment from corporate interests is, you know, of great, a great passion of mine. When you say social justice, you're doing social justice. You're in. Yeah, but, you know, you are too. We all have different roles, you know, without your voice in the world and you being a conduit for, you know, the kind of, I mean, when I'm sitting in, you know, the Rohingya refugee camp in Kathmandu or I'm up in the Himalayas in some remote village, nobody knows about it except the people who are right there. And, you know, I might come out and talk about it. I've written about it in the book, but, you know, the effect is very immediate and it feeds me, you know, it's like coming to this retreat. I'm fed in a different way, but it's all about love. Still, just a different kind of love when I'm in the Rohingya refugee camps in Kathmandu. I mean, you know, there I am sitting in this, you know, desolate, desperate situation with people who have been, you know, hyper disenfranchised. And where I am having the opportunity to bear witness to their generational dilemma, not just immediate dilemma, it's immediate, but also this has been going on for a long time, discrimination against the Muslim minority in Myanmar. Or if I'm up in the mountains of the Himalayas, I have a similar, there's kind of an intimacy about coming alongside listening to people in the Himalayas as we're in this, you know, delivering health care and becoming aware, my, you know, these people have nothing materially, but they have immense resilience. They also live in these micro societies, which are characterized by high civility, they have to, they won't survive without it. Right. So I'm just, I'm like this kind of incredibly curious person, but also, you know, compassion drives me. You know, I want to take the sum of my learning in the world, because the world has afforded me so much, offered me so much, been a source of, you know, some suffering, but nothing compared to the people that I work with. I've learned so much from those whom I work with and serve. I mean, it brings me deep joy. You know, it's a win-win situation. Sometimes I do a little bit of good, that's pretty nice, but also I'm deriving, you know, just this sense of wellbeing out of what I do in the intimate part of my work. But you must in some way recognize that you're an anomaly in the sense that if all of us were acting like that, then we would be living in some, and I'm sorry, I don't mean to toot your horn and forgive me. It's nice. Sometimes I fall into this, you know, comparison or whatever, it's ridiculous anyway, but you have, you're very insightful, you're brilliant. And so in some way you must recognize that you are, you're an anomaly. This is not a normal way to live. This is not a normal life. Not many people are Zen Roshis who are headed out to refugee camps to help people. You are talking about helping people whose ethnicities I can't pronounce. You know what I mean? And so this is an anomaly. And surely you find yourself teetering on these edge states. Oh, well, there's no question. I wrote this book in part. I, you know, I wanted to serve people because I've met so many people, listened to so many people who really, you know, doing this incredible work in the world, but they're also suffering. So, you know, and I also have fallen over the edge countless times. But you know what? I want to just get back to the anomaly question. There are a lot of positive anomalies out there. That's good to hear. You know, I'm really happy to report. Compat, you know, people talk about, and even I say it sometimes, I said it in a recent video and I wish I could change it now. But, you know, I talk about compassion deficit and there's a lot of compassion deficit in the world, compassion deficit. But actually there is so much goodness happening out in the world today. It's, you know, it's just the, the fraught part are tendency toward, you know, paying more attention to things that are negative like your friend. And instead of seeing, you know, hey, there's a whole range. There's an entire spectrum out there from goodness to not so good. And we're just paying attention to the not so good. In fact, we have tremendous amount to be hopeful about. But y'all are, you know, you anomalies, positive anomalies, you guys, ladies are not secretive, but you're camouflaged out there. You, you're, you're in, you know, why, why is that? Well, you know, I mean, you can't go around bragging about your accomplishments. I mean, that's, that's pretty stupid behavior. You know, it's like my friend, Matthew Ricard. He's another one. He is out there. He's doing so much good. He's a contemplative. He's a social activist. He's really doing, you know, a big spokesperson for the world of creatures and why we shouldn't eat anything that, you know, is alive, so to speak, except plants. And, you know, he started orphanages and schools. He goes into these remote areas. He's another one. And, you know, you don't, I mean, I talk about in the book things that, you know, moments in my life where I might have, you know, benefited others, but I'm more interested in other people who've done it and less in myself. I just, you know, I'm just, I feel fortunate to be driven in a certain way, just to have the energy and also the interest to put myself in fairly complicated situations and to see what arises. It's, it's, it's so beautiful. I really love it. I don't, and I, you know, I don't mean to keep hammering the point home of how cool you are, but the, um, to me, you said, oh, no, it's not good to talk, you know, to let this, okay, so I do understand what you mean. I've seen these, you know, every, every once in a while, someone will, it's very weird to me, somehow the news will pick up a story that someone has left a $500 tip. I don't know if you've ever seen that before. And it's very confusing to me. Cause I think who reported this, how did it get, get there? How many other big tips are not being reported? Is there like a, how does this make its way into the mainstream media that someone left a thousand dollar tip, which to me, I think it's wonderful. And I'm, I'm glad that that happens. But meanwhile you're up to your ankles and mud, putting blankets on people and that people don't even know exist. And the news is not reporting on that at all. They're saying, you know, an Applebee's waiter got a thousand dollar tip with a note like, great job. So to me, I wonder, is this that kind of garish bugling out of it, of some kind of crazy tip seems embarrassing, but sometimes I wonder if the ethic of anonymity when it comes to good works can be counterproductive in the sense that just from reading your book, there is something so very inspiring about it for us that the world needs to hear about this, that we need to hear about more than just people leaving tips. Don't you think that there's something to be said for being a little louder about your activities out there? Um, uh, I actually don't feel I need to be any louder. In fact, it's interesting the way publishing works today in a way authors become their own publicists. Yes. So, you know, I had to kind of, uh, you know, tweet about my book and put stuff on Facebook and it was like, oh boy, I didn't have to do this with my other books. But anyway, I want the book out there. It's not about money. In fact, I haven't taken any money for anything since 1979, which is very, um, I just decided to stop supporting the military industrial complex. So, you know, I, I've given it all away to the institutions that I've started and the causes that I care about. So it's very freeing. Uh, you haven't taken money since 1979. Right. Yeah. But I have a lot to support, but it's not me. My God. No, but never mind. So, you know, the point really, um, there are people out there in the landscape who are really extraordinary like Malala or, uh, Nelson Mandela or Jane Goodall. You know, people who have, um, become, if you will, his holiness, the Dalai Lama, uh, Tick Nott Han, global figures of goodness. Right. And they inspire all of us. I'm just, you know, the kind of corner drug store variety. You know, I, I, I just do the best I can. But, um, I don't feel there's any shortage of extraordinary stories. You know, like I, I tell the story in the, uh, altruism chapter about Wesley Autry, the guy who jumped off the subway platform in New York to save the, the young guy who was having a seizure. And, you know, he was trying to get, uh, Holo Peter off, you know, out of the train tracks as the subway is barreling down on both of them. And he realized he couldn't get the kid off. So he just held that kid down. He was having a seizure and the train passed overhead. He has his two kids were standing on the platform. And afterward, what did he say? So, you know, anybody would have done this. Well, there were a hundred more people on that platform. He's the one who jumped and did it. Right. And, you know, there are many stories like that. I, I share a lot in the book. You talk about the guy who defended the, on the train, the guy who got stabbed. That's right. And as he's died, he's, what did he say? I say, you tell everybody I love them. I mean, you know, this is just, people are remarkable. And, you know, these are ordinary people. I mean, Nelson Mandela, but, you know, Malala was just a schoolgirl. Yeah. And, you know, she was principled and she was inspired and she sent her voice and she was almost killed. And now she, you know, she won the Nobel Peace Prize for good reason because she's, you know, addressing a kind of suffering, which is gender violence, basically, you know, it's how important it is to educate young women. Right. And it will change the world. Women are going to change the world. They already are. Well, yeah. We want direction, us who aren't, we do know we want direction. And I know, I know personally I do. And I know that, like, you know, many people have gone tumbling on the wrong side of altruism and are just, they're done. They're just getting hammered and they're done. And all of us want, we want more direction. And I know it, not to sound victim, like, please help us help. Like, you know, I know it's something that we can really figure out, but it seems really quite convoluted and complex out there. There's charities, I guess, or you could look up volunteer organizations or I don't know how to, how, where did, you know, the best way to start. So I would start with your family. Start with your friends. You know, start up close. Because, you know, I often say for people doing research on compassion. Actually, it's not so interesting doing research on the altruist. It's more interesting doing research, talking to the wife of the altruist or the husband of the altruist or the kids. Wow. Yeah. I mean, you know, this is how do we walk our talk? How do we have a strong back that is, you know, our capacity to send our voice in the world, to uphold ourselves, to have the kind of equanimity that and confidence that allows us to stand in our principles and to share principles with others at the same time, open front, you know, soft front, to, to, to be really allow our subjectivity to expand, to include all beings and things, including the Trumps of this world. Start with our families and our friends. You got it. And let me go a little deeper into that. What does that mean? I, I, when, you know, I, I have, when you think of that, and I know that it's sometimes it's obvious, sometimes it's not so obvious. When, what is that, what is a real world example of that? Give them money, call them, tell them we love them. What is that? Exactly. Um, you know, when my father was dying, um, uh, my father really wanted me to move to Florida and I, you know, it's like, oh my God, I cannot move to Florida. And I, he said, okay, we have three choices. You move to Florida and live with me and take care of me. I'll marry your mother's best friend, Lucy, or, um, uh, you put me in an old age home. I said, well, listen, dad, he's very fast. I said, there are two options that are probably not viable. And one is the old age home. The other is that I'm going to move in with you. Uh, but Lucy's a great choice. Wow. And I actually ended up marrying my father to Lucy. Wow. So that was really great. But as my father was dying, um, I commuted from New Mexico to Florida every few weeks and sat with him and I sat with him as, uh, in his, you know, final weeks and it was like such a privilege. I'm so grateful I had that opportunity. And I think my father, you know, was grateful I was there. Um, I think it was mutual. I mean, he died, uh, there were some complications toward the end, but ultimately, you know, in the last, last phase, he, he slipped away, uh, peacefully. And I, you know, I can honestly say the benefit that I experienced in offering that kind of connection to my father, um, is inestimable. I mean, you know, it's just like, it's, you can't measure it. You know, you feel like, wow, I, you know, I'm so lucky. I, I'm really glad I did that. And you know, um, we aren't always perfect with our next of kin or our best friends. We're just human beings. Does he, you know, we have to know that too. Well, sometimes it feels like, you know, the, um, the anger, you know, towards some, some people have, you know, a lot of anger towards their parents and their family, sometimes justifiable anger. And so that idea of helping the family becomes a little complex because you think, well, you know, for example, I have friends whose brothers are opiate addicts, you know, and, and have been in and out of rehabs and, and, and are stolen. And you, you think, well, I mean, I would, I hear you, Roshi, Joan, I'd love to help my brother, but every time we've tried to help him in the past, he just steals from us or hurts us. Or what about that situation? Yeah. Well, that's a good example of pathological altruism. You know, it's like when, when you're, you know, engaged in trying to serve somebody where, um, you know, you're not really helping the situation at all. And you have to set clear boundaries and not invite harm. I mean, you know, it doesn't have, it's like, you know, if I leave the car unlocked in a neighborhood where there's, um, uh, economic depression, I'm just asking for trouble. Gotcha. So, you know, you don't want to nourish the wrong thing. Love it. Beautiful. Thank you. You are so inspiring to me. I'm, I'm so grateful for this little bit of time I got to spend with you. Um, I will have a, um, there will be links, uh, on my website for your book, but can you let people know if they're, if they're, I know you're a teacher and I know that you give talks and I know that you have the Upaia Center in Santa Fe. So please, if you could just direct people to you. Thank you. Um, wow, Duncan, this is, it's always so much fun talking with you. And you know, I really thank you for reading the book. It's a wild book and I, I hope it serves. It's called standing at the edge, finding freedom where fear and courage meet. And, um, you know, you can buy it in your local bookstore, Amazon, Barnes & Noble. I mean, you know, it's, I, somebody just sent me a photograph and you know, it was in an airport bookstore. I was really happy to hear that. I, this is, you know, reading that should be in the hands of, you know, all flyers, so to speak. Is there a Kindle version? There is a Kindle. There's, yeah, there's a Kindle. There's an Audible, there's a CD. Um, it's in hardback. It probably won't be in paperback for a while. It's so beautiful physically. They did such a great job in producing it. It's a juicy, I mean, it's gorgeous, uh, book physically. So, but it's also enthralling and the writing is so good. It's my favorite kind of book cause it just pulls you along and the most beautiful. It's really great writing. Thank you. On top of the message, which is amazing, but the writing is just so good. It was really, really good. Cool. And then I'm the habit of Upaia Zen Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which is probably, it's one of the most beautiful Zen centers, I think, most beautiful Zen temple, uh, I've ever been in, but you know, that's just my opinion. And, um, you know, Upaia is a very interesting place cause it brings together, it's like a micro university, but it brings together, uh, contemplative practice with social action. So, you know, our work includes work in the prison system with people who are homeless, dying people, people in Nepal, uh, who are in remote communities and refugees. So it's a very, uh, um, interesting environment. Beautiful. Friends go. Thank you. Okay. Thank you so much. And, and, um, yeah, let go. I know you out there. Listen, just do, buy the ticket. Cause I know many people when they hear you, they're like, I gotta, I gotta do that. Well, Roshi, Joan, thank you so much. I will, um, as much as I can try to implement these things that you're teaching us into my life. Great. I'm counting on you. Thank you. And, um, again, thank you for, uh, interviewing me. I, uh, if, you know, uh, we have another chance, I'd love to dive in again, at least within the next two years. Let's do it for sure. Okay. Maybe you, Upaia, I love you to come. Beautiful. Yeah. Yeah. Our new president, by the way. We just, um, uh, elected a new president of Upaia is 33 years old and a totally fantastic human being, smart as a whip and just doing all the right things. And my thing is, is, you know, you got to build these places for the future as well as the present and, you know, draw from the past. So, you know, I'm very into, you know, young people. Beautiful. We're going to get them out. Hopefully we'll come out there. Well, I don't count as young anymore, but I'd love to see the place. Howdy, Krishna. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you for listening, everyone. That was Roshi Joan Halifax. Don't forget to head over to Upaia and check out one of their cool programs. And definitely immediately order standing at the edge. It's a wonderful book. I love y'all and I'll see you next week. Hare Krishna. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JC Penney.

All right, let's do this. Greetings to you, sweet friends. It is I, D Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. We've got a very special episode for you today with a host of the 10 foil hat podcast, podcast about conspiracy theories, Sam Tripoli. I was actually at a party recently and somebody backed me in the corner and accused me of being a shill for the CIA. It was one of the weirdest things ever. He said, I think you know things you don't talk about on your podcast and you're getting money from George Soros. And I said to him, as he am, is it like normal questions? And he was like, if you think I'm going to take the time to reverse that to understand whatever it was that you just told me, you're out of your mind. I'm just going to assume that whatever it was that you just said is filled with satanic symbolism, illusions to goat headed beings. And then I'm like, wait a minute, why are you so angry at goats? Have you ever met a goat? They're actually really sweet. They're wonderful. I just saw a goat in a park near my house that someone had wrapped rainbow tape around its horns. And it was really fun. Like goats are just basically dogs with horns and weird eyes. And he's like, see, that's exactly what somebody in a satanic organization would say. You want me to like goats? I'm like, well, what have goats done? They make cheese. Do you or do you hate goat cheese? If you ever had goat cheese on your salad, it's delicious. He's like, goats. I don't want to talk about this because I know for some reason goats are evil and things going backwards are evil. And then I said, have you ever considered that that maybe the thing that's evil isn't outside of you but inside of you and you're projecting your own darkness onto the world and that the people you fear the most are actually people who have just identified the fact that there's a tendency in lazy people to demonize the world while ignoring their own internal difficulties. And whenever this happens, there's witch burnings and crucifixions. And so some smart people just decided they wanted to camouflage or at least create a couple of extra steps in between you and information that you could potentially use for evil things because you haven't worked out your own interior sadness and pain. That's all. He thanked me saying, you know, I never really thought of that stuff before. I never looked at it in that way. I shook his hand and planted a Galvax nano diode into his palm so that we could track him and make sure that he doesn't cause any trouble for any more podcasters. We've got a wonderful episode for you today. We're going to jump right into it, but first sends it.

Today's guest is a brilliantly funny comedian and he's also the host of a fantastic podcast called The Tinfoil Hat, which is an exploration of conspiracy theories. They're actually doing a show in San Francisco. If you're listening to this before June 1st or June 2nd, in other words, if you're listening to this right after I uploaded it this weekend, June 1st and June 2nd, The Tinfoil Hat podcast is going to be in Sacramento and San Francisco. They're going to be at Cobbs and they're going to be at the punchline in Sacramento. It's going to be a fun night of comedy and more than likely there's also going to be government agents in the room watching the performers to make sure that they aren't a threat to the state. That's going to be fun. Okay, everybody, open up your mouths and allow massive swarms of nanobots to go spraying into the sky, spinning down, deep into the beautiful ears of today's guest, the host of the Tinfoil Hat podcast, comedian, Sam Tripoli. This is my third podcast. I don't know how many times I've been on, but this is my third podcast in the third studio. Today? No, of yours. Yeah, I'm always moving around. We're moving and shaking. The bunker's always moving. Descendants of Cain. Yeah, dude. Have you ever heard that term before? No. So like that, you know about Cain and Abel? Yeah. And like Cain's the first murderer of all time? Yeah. Well, I mean, mythologically, Cain is jealous of Abel because Abel has... You saw the chicks? Basically, God favored Abel. Like Abel, they both made some offering to God, and God like somehow preferred Abel's offering. I'm butchering the story. That's fine. And then Cain was like, well, fuck this. And then like beat his head in with a rock. And then God appears and says to Cain, hey, where's Abel? And Cain says that famous line, am I my brother's keeper? How should I know? And God's being God is like, you fucking killed him, dumb ass. Like we don't have to do forensic files. I'm the creator of the universe. And then Cain got the mark of this. So it's really interesting because like Cain receives a mark and this is a mark that's supposed to make him an outcast for eternity. God doesn't kill him, doesn't imprison him. And so Cain goes east of Eden to the land of Nod. And his descendants were the musicians and the artists. And so a lot of... So we're from scumbags? Is that what they're saying? Well, yeah, we're descendants of the tribe of Cain. We have the mark of Cain on us as comedians. We're always moving around. We're like, you know, you're never in one place. You're always on... Oh, that's so interesting. For sure, dude. You're always moving around and you're always an outside, you know, like comedians and artists tend to be outsiders. If you think about it, like, you know, they always... For sure. Yeah. So it's like a... Sure. It's kind of like an identification of a type of personality. You think of yourself as an outsider? Oh, well, Hunter, I'd like... I've lived in LA for almost 20 years. I couldn't feel more outside of a town than I've... And I don't hate LA. I mean, you could come to your place. You know, it's so interesting. I love going to new areas of LA that I've never seen before. And it's just like the history and the... Like, your area is really amazing because there's like, no one house is anything like the other house. You like, you got this amazing house. You mean Silver Lake or this little patch? Where you are right now. Got you. You know, and like, it's next to the nice house, but then there's a shanty house that looks right next door. Yeah. And then there's like a three-layer apartment bill. It's like, it's so in and like, how you get here is so interesting. Yeah. Like, I love LA, but in terms of the business, couldn't be farther away. Couldn't be far... And I'm okay. I like... I just... I just like to do me, dude. You know, I like to do me... Back to the cane story, though. It's so interesting how like, violence is such a big part of a holy book. Do you know? Yeah. But let's... Sex is just the most taboo thing possible. You know, it's like... And Hollywood is very much like that, too. It's like, you can show as much violence as you want. Yes. You show some weird sex shit. Heads explode. Like, you know, sponsors. Like, we can't sponsor this. Yeah. You know, you're showing two people hooking up. That's wrong. But, but the scene before, this guy just went on a giant shooting spree. Yeah. You know, and it's just... It's very interesting that, you know, the morals are taught through violence. But yeah. Yeah. If like, we jumped into an alternate dimension, like, think how odd the conversation would go. Or it's like, man, don't you think it's weird? Like, all day long, we can show on TV. Fucking. Yeah. We can show anal, like, jizz shots. You saw the recent fucking America's Got Talent, where they swam through the jizz pond. And like, you know, but how come we can't show cutting people's heads off? How come we're not allowed to do that? That person would seem so creepy. You'd be like, wait, hold on, you're even connecting the two things at all? Why do you even think the two things are connected? Why do you want to show people getting their heads cut off? I don't even understand. No, I don't want to show that shit. It would make more sense to be like, you know, show people fucking. Jizz for days, dog. Welcome to jizz for days. Jizz for days. The life cycle. Behold, the beginning of the human life cycle. Right. Right. Yeah. But no, this is a, there is a, we're, I think it must have to do with like, we're more terrified of the beginning of things than the end of things for some reason. Like, the end of things, it's, it just, I don't know. It's somehow people are afraid of death. It's weird though. Here's what's very interesting. We, we show death on TV all the time, but it, but in actual real life, we hide death and we hide sex. Like if I'm fucking, I, I close my curtains. Yes. And I feel obscene if I haven't closed my curtains for a second, you know, like you're, I don't know if that's ever happened. We're having sex and you realize your windows are wide open. You catch a reflection of yourself in the, in the window. It's night time. And you know, like whoever was walking by, you just saw people fucking. Yeah. And it's, it's a feeling of like, oh no, we must shut the window. It comes off as rude unless you're into that. Right. Which there's people like, I think the whole thing about having sex in public weird places, which I've done before is the thrill of almost getting caught. It's like, can we do this without getting caught? Yeah. But, but the thought of like having sex and then forgetting close the window is frightening. You know, it's like rude to your neighbors and they get to see your hump technique. Rude to your neighbors, polite to your stalkers. Do you, do you, um, do you like, I have always been annoyed like in the times like, you know, like when you're dating somebody, you know, and you end up with one of that public sex people and they're like, let's fucking the bathroom. Yeah. Come on. Like, come on. I don't want to fucking the bathroom. It's like, that doesn't, that is of all my fetishes, man. That one is really low on the charts. What about you? But it is on your power. It's on your power rankings chart though. It doesn't make the chart. It doesn't make the top 10. It's like a very, very distant, distant one. Years ago when I was dating this, I was dating this girl and she was into that shit and like, we had to go on top of this fucking water tower. Like, and there was like a metal grate. It's like a metal grate. It's like, it's just a metal stairway, this fucking weird remote water tower. Like an area where people either go to fuck or bury bodies. And you know, like you want to like, this is when I was in like community power. I was in community cause, but you want to seem cool. So you want to be like, oh yeah, you better believe I want to fuck on top of this water tower. You're like trying to do special moves up there, but you're just getting that imprint of the grate on your skin and it doesn't, you're just embarrassed. It's so interesting. I literally got told all the time when I was young that women saw me as the weird sex guy, their weird sex guy. So I, they hooked up with me when they wanted to do weird shit, like cross stuff off their list, you know, and now that I'm an old man and I'm in a relationship, but even when you're in a relationship, you just like to engage with the other sex things of you. And I've become the serious relationship guy. Like, and that's as you get older, women see you more as the serious relationship guy. And the young guys has to get weird kind of guys, which is very interesting. I don't know. You know, I think there's like, that's, that can happen, but also there's like the element of like, you know, you're, you're like an older, you know, you're like, there's something like, I don't know, some, it seems like some people really like the get off on the idea of like, you have learned all these things. And now you can sort of dip, you know what I mean? Like, think of the, I don't know, if you ever got, you've ever tied, you've probably have tied many people up, right, Sam? You know what the BDSM thing has never gotten into me. I loved some of your bathroom reading stuff that's out there. That was pretty cool. What that? Oh, the bite, what the what? There's a magazine out there, something about slaves. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So that's like, you know, that's your thing. No, I wouldn't call it my thing, but I know how to do it. And, and it's a thing. It's like a thing you learn how to do. And you start off doing it. And you usually don't know how to do it at all. So you're not into it yet. You understand how to do it. It's not really your thing. Sounds like I'm dodging it. I would be, I'm not a shit. No, no, no. It's interesting that you have a, you have a skill in something you don't really care about much. No, I think I like it. It's a fun, I think it's one, I think sex is like, you know, obviously a form of communication, and there's all these different languages, and that's one of the languages. Yeah. And, and that, that's a, just like any other language you learn, you can learn a few different languages. But am I into like that language in particular? No, but it's definitely a wonderful skill to have because if some people really enjoy being, being dominated and so like they love it. And, and if you don't, what do you think that comes from? What do you think that's from? I've always wondered, because it seems like BDSM has always been this little secret. Yeah. That a lot of people are into, but not a lot of people talked about. And then like 50 shades of gray, which is like the McDonald's of fuck BDSM comes out and it seems to be more open and it just seems to be like way more popular than ever. Maybe I'm wrong. It's just maybe people are more talking about more honest with it. It's, what do you think that type of sex comes from? Like what is the attraction to that? I think it's a, it's a way for people to, so like everyone's been injected with various levels of sexual guilt, I think, you know, like they think their bodies are fucked up or they think they're, you know, they think they're dirty or they think they're, you know, there's something, you know, there's all these hang ups they have. Maybe they're nervous about this thing or that thing. And so the moment that someone has been dominated and when people think about this stuff, they're so confused about it. Like number one, most people think it involves pain. In other words, it's like sadism or masochism and it's in there BDSM, but it's like that, that, when I remember before I knew anything about it, I thought it's about hurting people. Why would you ever want to hurt someone? Why wouldn't you even want to be hurt? Right. Right. But that's really not what it's about. Okay. It's, you know, it's, it's sensual. It's about the spectrum of experience and for some people, it's incredibly liberating to no longer have to worry about being in control when they are having sex because that's for a lot of people, it's a real bummer. Some people are just, you know, they're nervous about making decisions during sex. Like they feel guilty or afraid or whatever. So when all of that has been removed from them and you've done it in the right way, it's really a form of hypnosis. That's amazing. Yeah. That then for them, it becomes this like liberating, incredible moment where they no longer have to feel guilty for having sex. I think that's one version of it. And there's other versions too. It's just like, there's something incredible about, it's like, you know, punching your time card at the end of the day. Like you, you're off the clock now. You don't have to do anything except, you know, submit. When you talk to these BDSM missers, and I know a lot of them, so much snake oil, Justine Cross, they're wonderful. I know Justin cross. She's very wonderful. I had her on. She came on the show to talk about basically like how they took down back page and all that stuff. And there was some shady stuff with back page, but it's put these, these girls who work in the sex industry in a bad place. Mistress Justine Cross, Los Angeles, look her up. God, she's wonderful. As a wonderful little, I don't know if she's still in Culver City, but it's got a nice little spot up there. There's a wonderful lady named soma snake oil. I don't know if she's still with her husband. I haven't seen pictures of them together, you know, but she hired me to do her husband's big here. Her husband is or was a fat Mike from no effects. Yeah. And I got hired to do his birthday party at a BDSM bar. Oh, wow. And I showed up and everybody was either cross stressors or leather daddies, right? Yeah. And I was bombing like I was bombing dude. And I got heckled by this guy that looked like a cross-dressing minotaur. So every time my jokes would bomb, he'd yell, I want to fuck you in the ass. That's what he'd yell. And it's, dude, God bless him because he saved my set because my ability to rip this guy. Yeah. I stopped doing jokes and we just, it just became a comedy duo. Sam and the minotaur and we just started ripping into each other and it was fun. It was fun. But you know, she's in that whole world and I had Brian Jarvis one time when I was doing the naughty show back in the day, do something at the comedies at the improv where I wanted to do it like, do you remember when Johnny Carson would have the guy who came out with the animals? Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the animal, he would like have the animals there and Johnny would ask all these questions. So I did that with, I had Jarvis play the gimp. I had her come on and explain her pet slave and talk about him like he was a wild animal for the crowd to watch. That is so funny. That is hilarious. It was really funny, dude. Yeah, man. That's, you know, BDSM has got to be one of the most misunderstood things, but you know, but you learn it. That's the point. It's a skill. You learn it. And I barely know anything about it. Like people like Justine Cross, these are people who are like, they're like, people have been to like, they're physical therapists. They're like, it's a, it's a true skill. It's not, and it is, and it's, it's functions on like so many different levels. It's like camping. Like you got to know how to do knots. And also it's like, there's a lot of safety involved. You've got it because like, you got to make sure you're able to get the person out of the knots if something goes weird. And also it's like so deeply embedded in consent, which is that it's like, it like that it is so based on like consensual, a consensual interaction. So there's this entire like, very, very intense. Like you have to be so attuned to what's happening with the person that you're with, because number one, they want to go into the state. But number two, the moment they're like, stop, you, it's like turning a TV off. Like there is nothing else except you're untying them because it's like, it's really serious. So there's the other, there's like this real ethic around it that I don't think people understand this. Yeah, there's got to be like, if they say stop, there has to be a complete under 100% understanding that it's going to stop. Well, you go immediately out of that character. Like you go out of that part of your set because everybody has inside of them a submissive part of themselves and a dominant part of themselves. Everyone does. And if you become a dominant person, like, you know, like some people aren't very dominant in real life. But you know, you hear a lot of times these dominant people become submissive. Well, sometimes submissive people can become very, it gives them a chance to experiment with like being supremely dominant. And that's a personality that is inside of everyone. And you see it come out of people sometimes. And if it comes out in the wrong place, it's incredibly cloying. And it's like really really like all these submissive people just start going like dictator crazy on people. Yeah, well, you know, how often have you seen that when you get like some, you know, some shithead, great. That's a great point, dude. And you give them any kind of power. You can even say that with Hollywood, the Me Too movement. We saw these guys who kind of like writer theater guys get this power. And then you find out they're just like turned into these monsters. Yeah, you know, and it's just like it's that's a very interesting point. Yeah, man. I thought about that. Yeah. And that's you that's that. So that part of a personality, that's a that's a great that's a very important part of anyone's personality. You need that like you need to be able to like suddenly become something really strong from that's a good that is a great golf club to have in your golf bag. That's a great brush to have in your paintbrush collection. But you need to know when to bring that out and who that is and why it comes out if it comes out like in the wrong time. That's usually like when you say, you know about a person by the way, they treat a waiter. Yeah. Right. And that's because what's happening is that you suddenly you'll see you'll be with someone who seems super nice and then someone who's their servant appears and they take on the role of some kind of like domineering piece of shit. Like, excuse me. Excuse me. The surface around here is terrible. It's like, go do that in the fucking dungeon, bitch. Not not an arrestor. Save it for the dungeon. Save it for the dungeon. This person didn't sign up for that. I feel if more people have more dungeons, we'd have less road rage, less people wouldn't have to go to couples therapy. They could get it out there. Yeah, because because like there's an affliction that people either feel too in control or not in control. People feel like they have too much power and then they get all stressed out because they feel like they've got just too much shit to worry about too many plates are spinning and they're freaking the fuck out and they just want to relax and put on a diaper and get fucking spanked for a little while. So they could just like chill out or people feel like they don't have any control at all. And so the moment there's an opportunity to have any kind of control, all the anger that's gone along with their complete sense of worthlessness or impotence or whatever comes spewing out on top of it. That's the other thing with BDSM is people think it's an angry, that it has anything to do with anger. Like, ah, shut the fuck down. It isn't that. Like at least my experience with it is it's love. Like because if you're with somebody who wants to be dominated, you're giving them all the attention. Like you're giving them like they're getting 100% pure unadulterated attention that is completely focused on this particular fetish for them. And even though it's coming across as you being like, don't move, sit down. Is BDSM is this a would you say this is a first world form of sex? I mean, what's the BDSM seen in like Nigeria? Like, do they have that? I think it's universal. I mean, it's certainly in Japan. Like if you look at like the it's there's yeah, binding and like all this stuff. I think it's a universal. It must be. I mean, you can see that in all forms of sexuality, someone is being more dominant. Of course. So it's already embedded in the way we have sex as it is. Like someone is the one who's like deciding, you know, what's going down. That's one. I mean, it's not always like that. If you get into like Tantra or you're merging with a person or you're becoming one identity, I don't know. It changes then. But certainly it's like, it's yeah, you ever add all this stuff and kind of like an MMA form of sex where you're doing a little BDSM, a little Tantra, whatever you think. So it feels like they're different. It feels like the two things are like separate or all together kind of separate. I mean, certainly like after you have like dominated someone or been dominated. Have you been dominated? Yeah. Yeah. How'd that feel? Oh, it's well, you know, there's been a it's happened to me a few times and only a couple of times that I really like it like the the because there's this thing called sub trans. Have you ever heard that before? No, it is. So that's like the hypnotic state someone being dominated goes into. So like they like it's an actual state of consciousness that they enter into. And you can't fake it. You can't number one, you can't fake dominating somebody. They can't fake being done. You could try, but it's not real. Like it's there's actual submission and domination or there's like the, you know, people who went to Hot Topic and bought a pair of bullshitting. There's no acting. It's either you're in or you're out. You're you are either, you know, if you're in some like if you're in any situation where there is a competition or where there is an interaction based on like, you know, hierarchy or control, you're either being dominated. I guess the way to put it is like it's a full surrender. It's full surrender. Right. And you don't fake that. Right. Like that's not right. And someone who likes to be dominated, if they get around someone who doesn't know how to do it, that person's going to do like all this weird, stupid, embarrassing shit, probably from reading 50 Shades of Grey. Yeah. And that the person who likes to be dominated isn't going to get like their itch scratch because the person that doesn't actually know how to do it. Like you actually, the thing about it is you actually have to do it. Yes. It's not like my dogs, like my dogs, they're either they sit or they don't. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's not like it's just that that's it. Yeah. It's the identical thing. It is so interesting. Just the human sexuality. It is so interesting. Everywhere else is like made to survive, made to survive. The species got to survive. We're so complex and just like all the different things that get into, you know, what you're into and you know, like, it's just so interesting because it's like, I think we're the one of the few species that may that has sex for enjoyment. I think there's like a set of monkeys out there that maybe does that. But for the most part, everything else is just like survive to survive all the species. Well, you know what? We don't know. And the thing is we don't fucking know what's going down. Like when you see like a seahorse. Yeah. You don't know if he's just having fun. Got a couple hours. Let me knock this out. We're like, he's mating. Yeah. Survive. Yeah. Yeah. That's what we like to think. We don't have any idea what pheromones are being released or like, you know, like how long he's been like hoping for this moment or like, you know, we don't know. But you know, sex is such an incredible, I think a lot of people don't realize that it's so it's an occult activity in the sense that it's a hidden activity. It's an activity that is not spoken of. And yet it's in front of everyone all the time. It's an activity that's right out in front of everybody right out in front of everybody. It's on billboards. It's on all over TV. Now social media. It's all the time. Yeah. I was just talking about the amount of dicks that like millennials have seen in their life compared to like even a guy, a male, a male millennial, the amount of dicks he's seen in his life versus what his grandfather or his great grandfather saw. It's not even close. I mean, they've had porn on their phone forever. I guess it's like, as they say, as it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. Like I'm sure at the beginning of the human, you know, humans moving from like proto hominid to hominid, everyone was just very comfortable seeing dicks swinging all over the place. Do you think it was until one dude showed up with a really big dick and everyone's like, okay, let's cover these up because no one could get any. Nobody wanted to hook up with you. You're like, it was good two weeks ago. Yeah. Then Thor showed up with this, the hammer of God. And now I'm looking at your popcorn shrimp you got over here. I mean, that's one of the beautiful humbling things about burning man is it's like you do see the spectrum of dicks and burning man. And it's just like, you don't have to be like you do like, you do have to deal with the fact that it's like, man, they're fucking like massive dick trunks swinging everywhere. Yeah, it's hilarious. Some dude, some chieftain, some chieftain with a small dick was like, all right, all right, we got to start wearing fucking loincloth. This is ridiculous. Put something on that fucking thing. God told me God told me to God's ashamed of you. God told me to that's so true, dude. Yeah, I like there's something in it that's so it's like I like it is a you know, we you and I in particular, we're so into we love thinking about conspiracy theories and you know, particularly like brainwashing conditioning state conditioning and like and for a lot of people, they don't realize they're conditioned and that they're brainwashing that they've been intentionally brainwashing conditions. So so so many people walk through the world and in their mind, every idea that they have is their own unique idea and everything that they do is just something they just decided to do. They think they're autonomous. They think they're completely in control of their lives and they have no idea that so much of what they think and so much of what they do and so much of their feelings about this thing or that thing have been intentionally embedded into their minds by the state, dark forces or light forces, parents, the state, you know, okay, okay, okay. So so for people who aren't really aware of their conditioning, one great place to start is just, well, okay, go. If you're, if you think you're not brainwashed, take your clothes off and go stand outside. How does that feel? Just thinking about doing it, you're already like, oh my fucking, I would never do that. Right. Well, why? I mean, are you evil? Is your body evil? Or when are babies evil? When babies are born? Is this an evil? Is this a, is this someone who is a, what's the exhibitionist or baby's exhibitionist? Right, right, right. Should we like figure out some kind of way to like put a cloak over a woman's pussy so they give birth into a bag so that we can keep the baby covered at all times? You know, so baby jumpsuit. Yeah, baby jumpsuit something. So that, so there, so it's that, that is a wonderful starting off point to understand just how absolutely controlled humanity is. I couldn't agree more. There is a, from the beginning, there is a pounding in of how we act and what and what the rules are and all that stuff. And we see from, you know, everybody, it's just like, whether you're Jewish, Armenian, Italian, whatever group, your, your, your grandparents, your parents always tell you the story of your people and the history of your people. And he gets passed on for generation to generation in that type of brainwashing as well. And then as we grow up, there's the brainwashing of interaction between people and, you know, in which these are dark forces come to these people over history. Time is have screwed these people and there's that and these people who maybe you're 20 years old. But 200 years ago, these people screwed your people. So that has to be rectified. And there has to be revenge on that because this happened many moons ago and we can, you know, and then it just keeps going back. And this is weird cycle of just like, you're right, brainwashing that goes on. Yeah. And it's, and it's a, it's a fascinating condition because you could almost consider all like, you could just think like, well, all those things that are inside of your mind that are making you feel guilty or ashamed about certain things you want to do. Those have been put into you by some experience or by a person or something like that. And you could almost like it just as a lens to look at it through just for fun. I'm not saying this is how it is. You could start thinking of those things as living entities. So you could almost say like, you have a parasitic thought pattern that's been implanted into your mind by a manipulative sorcerer consciously or subconsciously. Yes. But there's no way to scan for it. Like, I can go to the doctor and get a scan for parasites and the doctor can be like, yeah, man, you've got a fucking tapeworm. But that we, as of yet, we don't have a methodology for scanning a person and being like, Hey, man, you have got like inside of you, man, you don't even realize this, but you've got a fucking Marlboro light demon. You know what I mean? You have deep inside of you a Pfizer entity is living inside of you. I get that. You know what I mean? Like you have living within you a Gucci entity, like all the corporate brand names that you're like connected to or suddenly feel, oh man, you're fucking crawling with comedy store, dude. Like you've got like comedy store all over you, man. You got the cigarette demon in you. Yeah. That's what it is. That's what it is. That's what it is. It's a form of possession. I was just having this conversation with Sean Stone. It's like, but we don't call it demonic possession. We call it proclivities, abituations. It's core, you know, like we're, we're drawn to certain brands. Like what do you like? Are you an Apple? Are you an Apple guy? Yeah, I am. And I hate it. But then I can't the thought of getting off Apple scares me. Yeah. I go, maybe I'll go with those like those, uh, you know, HTC phones, man. And then it gets close, it gets close. And I'm like, no, I can't leave Apple. Yeah, I can't leave Apple. And then Apple sends out that operating system that just is like a suicide note for your phone where, and then your phone just commits honorable seppuku. And it's like the battery can't drain the operating system doesn't work. So you're like, Oh dude, my phone's not working. They're like, Oh, it sounds like you got to upgrade to a new phone. And it's like their evil plan goes through. And I'm like, I'm gonna remember this next time I have to renew. And then the day comes and boom, I'm back on Apple. That's it. Yeah. And now, so now what you could, what, and if we could jump into another dimension, the very closest and you would just say, Oh yeah, you've been hypnotized by a cobble of sorcerers using their magical implement job sorcery. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. You know, you're, you're one of the, you know, you're, you've been sucked into this cobble of sorcerers who has an exchange. It's an exchange. It's a, it's almost a symbiotic relationship. They would like to say it's purely symbiotic and not parasitic. But like you, you have, you know, basically a familiar, like you've gone to the Tower of Apple, they've given you a familiar, this like imp creature that answers all your questions and allows you connect with other people. And the imp from time to time goes in stairs in a crystal when it's getting the update. It comes back with like a slightly different skin tone. I've got a limp. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe a limb, maybe, you know, yeah, it's time to get a new amp, time to get a new amp from the Apple Tower. Yeah. So, so this is, this is just another example of how we have become completely conditioned and subjugated by corporations. A great example of this is political correctness, man, how there are people that have been trained, brainwashed, just to hear a word and the word itself is enough to go nuts. Right. And there's no context to it. Like before, like the political correctness, we know if now before it was, if you were dirty, people would flip out. If you said the word Jesus, just the word Jesus, there used to be this great comedy club called Riddles. It's still around, but the old location in Chicago with Orlin Park was Riddles. And you could literally say anything you want in this room. It was one of my favorite rooms to play. But the minute you mentioned Jesus, it just shut down. And no matter what you said, you could be like Jesus, the greatest thing out, people, boom, shut down, not in a comedy club. You don't talk about Jesus. Well, fast forward to 2018. Any word that comes up within a stand-up comedy context that they have deemed as negative gets a shutdown from the crowd, regardless of the context in which you're using it. And that's all comedy is, is context. What is the context of what I'm talking about in terms of whether you should get upset or not. But we've conditioned people to use political correctness over common sense. Well, this is why I think the term curse word is so funny. Yeah, because it really is magic, like a curse word. It's a word of cursing. And if you utter certain words of cursing, it like it really does change the energy of a room. That is so interesting. I've never thought about that. Cast a spell. So at that moment that you utter the forbidden word, and now there's, if you look at the history of forbidden words, it's really quite interesting. For example, in Israel, when the temple was still built, I read this in this book on Jesus by Reza Aslan. But when the temple was still built, you would, once a year, the high priest would go into like the inner sanctum of the temple and utter the name of God, some version of Jehovah Yahweh, some words, some unspeakable name. And the priest would go into this sanctum with a rope tied around his waist. Because the idea was, if you utter the name of God, you could actually be struck down. You could die. And so they wanted to have a rope so that they didn't have to go in and get your body because you're in a place that you're only supposed to go once a year. And then they would like, they could drag your body out after uttering the great name, whatever it may be. And so this is, if you look at the history of forbidden words, it's not a new phenomena. Like for us, we find it a little like jarring, I think, because the word has changed. Like now it's like one word and it's like the word has changed. Certainly there's infinite logical arguments for why that is a triggering word. And a lot of us, man, you know, just don't even fucking, just don't even like realize it. Like, you know, like, I was right, I was right in the back of a Uber talking to the drivers. He's just basically explaining like, you know, man, like there's like, and he's doing it in the perfect way. Just like, you know, there's like actual parts of America, like where black people, they just know they can't go. Like you just can't go like you can try, you can go, you can go there. But it's like, it's not going to be great for you. It's going to be really fucking weird. I feel really bad for those areas because they're missing out in such amazing shit. You're saying if you're racist, dude, like what are your forms of entertainment that you're willing to put up with? NASCAR, Fox News, country music, yeah, like dark metal. I mean, like you're missing out on so much amazing shit. Yeah. And so like the great misconception or like what basically what's happening, I think with that word in particular is it's like by uttering- We're talking the N word. Is that what you're talking about or anywhere in general? Yeah, I think that's like one of the great evil ones right now. Right now, yeah. But like, if you fucking say that word, you align, you know, even if it comes from like just either one, a sense of rebelliousness, like don't sit, don't, don't use your cell phone in this place. Fuck you, I'm using my phone. Even if it just comes from purely something that has nothing to do with any kind of sense of like- The F word is a religious word. Fuck. Yeah, it's a religious word. It was made by the Pope. You mean fuck? Fuck is a religious word. It's fornication under church knowledge. It was basically the nobody was having kids and the Pope was like, okay, we gotta start cranking more Catholics out. Let's go. Start fucking. Start, yeah. So that word started off good. That started off good and then it had a hard C on it, I think. Yeah. And people like, no, too hard of a C. We don't need to hear that, dude. You know? But then when you look at like the alternative words, like intercourse, it's such a like dry, like scientific word, like it's such a sad word. The word I don't understand why people and women have a word. It's the C word and I don't understand. I don't think they care anymore. Oh, dude, go in the middle of a show and drop that and see how the rest of it go. Yeah, it goes, dude. And it's just a word they've been trained not to like. I personally think the word they should never want to hear is wench because wench through time is like cunt set on fire. It's like a million cunts. It takes a million cunts to make one wench. I don't know if you've ever seen like it like the town wench. Everybody was fucking the town wench. The wench was fucking everybody else. This is ridiculous. I've never, wench sounds like sweet. Like it's a sweet thing to say to someone like coming in. Minch sounds like a fucking he's a real minch. Sounds like a bad word. It's not but but when she was like a bad word, like you were the town wench, you know, it's like not good. You know what's so funny to me that the reason like all this shit is like frustrating is because it feels like people are missing that a word is like the material around an either gunpowder or like rose petals. Yeah. It's like so, so, so like the energy behind the word is what hurts and you know, so if like someone's sitting in front of me and hates my guts and calls me brother. Hello, brother. Yeah. You know what I mean? And it's like they want to kill me. Right. That word brother compared to someone who loves me brother. It's like it's like and I can feel I'll feel the difference the energy. So the energy and that's so I think one of the problems though I do understand not wanting to align yourself with an entire legion of idiots out there who fucking hate people based on as Terrence McKenna put it their photon reflectivity of their fucking skin. Like the it feels like what sometimes can get lost is that we forget that it's this energy inside of us that gets wrapped around wrapped that is enclosed in our language and our semantic choices and that is why you get around somebody and they can order a coffee and it sounds like they just ordered a fucking nuclear strike and they could do it in the most calm way too. Like, you know, it's it's it's I think of it as like lately I've been thinking about the fucking John Wayne Gacy effect. Like, you know, like people were going and hanging out with John Wayne Gacy when he had bodies buried in his fucking just hanging out with him. Yeah, think about that. Like, you know, like imagine like right now we're doing this podcast. But every once in while you're catching a smell of just decay. Right. A thing that your whole body has been trained to be aware of. Yes. It means you might be in danger. Yes. So it's like a specific smell, the smell of death. I'll never forget that smell. You've smelled it. Yeah, like right when I moved to LA, LA the first like week back back when Hollywood Boulevard was even a shittier place than it's now. There was this storefront that was empty. And I remember walking by like, what is that smell? And I looked in and there was like this homeless guy looking in there too. And I was like, he's like, was I he's like, that's a dead body. And I was like, Oh, it fucking is. And then this other guy goes, shoot, get out of here. I go, that's a dead body in there, dude. And I don't even know why I didn't call the cops at that point. It was like so weird. I just like, I just moved I just moved on with my life. There was a dead body there. I guess you're thinking, what are they going to do? They're not going to resurrect the guy. It's like, what's left? Like, you smell it, dude, you know, describe it. All the worst garbage ever in one smell. It's just like it's so strong. It is rot. You smell rot. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's it's it's built into us to be like terrified of it because that's where disease is. That's where like dangerous. And so like, what happens, I think, is that people have made a pretty critical psychological error and thinking that all that shit that they haven't worked through inside of them, like they can hide, and they can hide it from people who are also hiding shit or people who are kind of distracted or whatever. But you really can't hide much from people who've done any kind of real training and perception. So you a lot of people, no matter what they say, it's very similar to like being at a wonderful dinner party where someone's like, here's a beautiful plate of strawberries. And here's some wine and here's some champagne. But underneath buried in the dirt is death. Yeah. And it's like, no matter before you so you have to deal with that that thing inside of you, that's like the idea is to like get in there and exhum all that shit and and give it a proper burial. And you know, it's interesting, dude, you there is that in stand up comedy too. You know, there are some guys who in comedy who are who work clean. Yeah, off stage, they're horrible human beings. And that's almost the same thing. Obviously not murder, but the ability to switch it on, switch it off, public face versus real face, all that stuff and how that is psychologically taxing on you, it eventually catches up with you because you're not able to do you for real. I find the people, you know, it's like, I never, I always say, not all clean comics are assholes, but most asshole comics were clean. Okay, and that's just something I've learned over life. I'm not applying that to you and how you see other comedians, but that's something I've learned that people who come in and we're treating people like shit at some point, they were always working clean and all this stuff. They made business decisions, in my opinion, the guys who are the nicest dudes that are the guys who are themselves on stage like David Tell, like what a wonderful guy that is. He couldn't be nicer, you know, and it's just a fucking savage on stage. Nick de Palo is like that. My mom went and saw Nick de Palo do stand up and met him after says he was a nice guy on stage, just a, you know, a cyclone of comedy, just a wrecker of rooms, you know, and it's just, it's interesting, you know, the more you are you, the more you're into the more you've experienced life and you, you kind of let shit go and you don't understand. It's the people that don't take time to expand their minds and get really upset, upset and stuff. Like if you instantly get mad at hearing a word you don't like and you don't take time to hear what it is, that says something about you, right? I mean, it says, being offended is usually, usually, it's a warning sign. Like if you're offended at language versus action, like if you're a couldn't agree more, then it probably probably means that you're like stressed out about some other shit. Like usually, like, you know, it's like kind of like you slam your finger in the door and then someone comes up to you and it's like, Hey, what's up? You know, like, fuck you. Yeah, because you're in pain. Yeah. And like people who are in pain, they get angry, easier. Right. That's it. Like that's what I've noticed is people usually if someone's quick to get angry, or if I'm quick to get angry, that means I'm hurting. Like it's not like people. So that's kind of gives me a little bit of compassion for those people. I do have compassion. I think you gotta have compassion. I think also we have to understand something like I always found it interesting how people love prank shows so much. They love prank shows. Yes. They love to see people get set up and then made to look stupid. And what they don't realize is for the most part, these people are getting set up are very nice people. They're they're actually in a moment where they're trusting the person we're talking to that this is a real moment. And this at this moment, this person is betraying their trust. Yeah. And they are setting them up and almost fucking with them. Those are to me, those are bad prank shows like the good prank shows are the ones that even at the worst, even the nicest prank show. And I'm not saying that these people are scum. I'm just saying this moment, these people are trusting that this is an authentic moment. Right. And they are trusting that oh, you're in trouble or whatever the prank is at this time. Yeah, they're they're stopping to help you to engage in this to help you get through whatever problem that you are presenting to them. Punked was very much on that. Here we have a situation, Celine Dion. We need help. Those are lame pranks. The good prank shows are like the the Borat pranks where you construct this character that sort of naturally invokes like triggers racists. You know, okay, I can understand that you go into you go in. Okay, my those pranks right if we're talking where you're going into meet with a politician and you're going to kind of lampoon him. Yeah, I can understand that or it brings out a person's puffed up like it brings out a person's puffed up side the kind of pranks you're talking about and I know what you're saying those suck. Those are not even those are I don't even know if those count as pranks like some of the pranks I've seen on punked where it's like dude is that's not a fucking prank. Like if you set like a garbage can on fire and someone goes to put out the garbage can and you're like, I'm set to fire. Like your car is getting towed or someone's being harassed and they go to help the person being harassed. I got you. Those are shit prank. Yeah, like when jackass put the baby on the roof they drive off and people say it's a real baby and it's funny to watch but at that moment you're like betraying this person's like truck and I'm not saying it's the biggest offense in the world. Yeah. I'm just saying that's what it is. But the reason I bring that up is because I think that gets done on a much bigger level to get back to conspiracies but a much bigger level by very dark forces who manipulate this whole group of people. Yeah. Because this whole group of people are very trusting. Yeah. My girlfriend who I love with all my heart. Okay. Can't stop watching mainstream news. Yeah. And she has love and intention in her heart. Yes. And as somebody who studied like the you know conspiracies and I thoroughly enjoy it, you know, I know what's going on in that boob too. But she trusts that. Right. But she doesn't understand that people paying those people have alternative motives in my opinion to muck everything up. Dude for sure. I mean we got to keep this shit away from like I've actually thought like there needs to be like a movement to get Fox News away from grandparents. Like we got to get this shit away from old people because when you think about the number of old people who are sitting alone in their homes in their apartments, I don't know like if you have a grandfather and an aging dad. Yeah. But sometimes you call these people like I remember going to visit Mitzi in the later years and inevitably she'd be sitting in front of Fox News at night trembling with Parkinson's. And anytime one of the fucking alerts came up, like you know, like these news play, they use the alert. Yeah. For nothing. Yeah. But like anything can happen. Anything. They'll just make up a thing that happened. Any fucking wolf blitzer can get an email. And it's like. And it's intense. The thing behind the alert is like this is not, this is news, news, news places use alerts in the way not all comedians, but some comedians use special. Like if it's a special, it should be special. Yeah. If it's a fucking alert, let me know that this is true. This has got to be a tsunami as an alert, you know, but so anyway, the point is we're triggering the adrenal glands of these fucking geriatrics. Yes. And they're festering in their own like stress chemicals and they're getting sick and they don't even realize they they think they're getting sick because it's old age. No, you're getting sick in the same way those little potato people are getting sick when they stared in the fucking dark crystal. Yeah. Remember that when you remember that where the eyes went white, they withered up. Yeah. It's like that. Yeah. And it's not even I don't know if it's like a state conspiracy or it's just that like a fucking team of very clever sorcerers figured out a way to hypnotize vulnerable and weak people into thinking that it's the fucking apocalypse. One dude 100 percent. It's like these very smart people have a lot of money know how to use propaganda on the masses. And it really is that man. It really is that. And the problem is like and I talked about this with other people like the thing about conspiracy theorists is everyone we're like the new cat lady, right? We're like the crazy people that scare the children. The real truth about them is that they just remember they they don't forget. They keep score. And I feel like in particular this town, Hollywood, which is like really have in my opinion, probably the roughest three years of its existence with the you know, the election of Trump and who I like. I'd be honest with I've been like the president since Jimmy Carter, you know, right? I just I don't care if it's an R and a D, dude. You know, when you take a look at it, you take out the emotion of it. You really what's going on. You know, there's some war criminal stuff going down. And maybe that's the nature of the seat itself, the position. But you know, it's like this town, I grew up on thinking this this town was for the rebels, the outsiders. You know, if you look at young MTV back in the day, they were the artists, the descendants of Kane, right? The guys who didn't play by the rules, did their own thing, questioned authority, you know, did all that stuff. And for some reason, it's changed a little bit. You know, and you know, with the Me Too stuff coming out, the blind following of Hillary Clinton and how nobody can come to grips with that, a woman could be evil. And this notion that, you know, to judge a group of people, to judge somebody in a negative way based upon the group they're on is frowned upon society as it should be, right? If I go, Oh, that's a black guy. He's obviously a crack dealer. That is offensive, right? That is completely wrong. But in my opinion, it is as equally wrong to look at someone in power as good based upon being a woman or being a black man or being a Latino or whatever, or being a president or anybody. You know, yes, it is really bad to do identity politics with people in power because these people just like Jack Ass with the baby on the car will manipulate you. They'll manipulate your emotions. And that has, that is completely what was done with Hillary Clinton. And Trump is an asshole too. This is not a Trump rally at all. I'm just saying like this town has done a real disservice to what it represents by blindly getting behind somebody and blindly hating somebody based on pre determined characteristics. Yeah, it seems like it's like been it's like a kind of perfect storm of the problem of social media sort of giving people these like rewards for saying pretty obvious non statements that like somehow seem brave. And then people get a bunch of likes for that. And then they start repeating these non statements. It gets addictive. They get addicted. And then they keep doing it. And then it's like you see like a funny person suddenly getting sucked into like a just essentially like a kind of seizure of need, because they don't really like they're there. Sometimes you get the feeling that that's pretty much the limit of their social activism is tweeting pretty things that you and I like have been aware of for a long time probably when it comes to like if you've ever taken a healthy dose of LSD and spent any amount of time contemplating an American president, then you know there's something incredibly fishy going on there. And you probably know a lot more than that too, because it helps pull up on it helps unveil a lot of the conditioning or the scales on your eyes get lifted for a second. And you realize something that you actually said earlier in the podcast, which is it's the sometimes the people who are on stage and seem so clean and sweet and family friendly. It's shocking to realize that the moment they get off stage, they're actually like really pissed off. They're angry. They're like sociopaths. They're crazy. And so when we look at like the networks, and we see this like parade of apparent health, like here's what healthy people are like, or even like here's what comedy looks like, or here's like look at the fucking host on the TV shows. This is like what a good successful man or woman looks like. And this is what it looks like when you're cool and clean. And so when people what are people are starting to realize, which is for us non shocking, but for as many people out there who've made the assumption that the thing they see on stage is the thing backstage, is that the entire collaboration that led up to some of these creations, whether it's the collaboration to create an American president or the collaboration to create a family friendly sitcom, when they realize the thing by it within within that collaborative effort, there are fucking sociopaths. Yeah, there are pedophiles who are like praying on children and they've put themselves in positions of power. Yeah, they could have access when they realize that the the coven behind the magic is not a coven of white witches who are like like full house or whatever whatever it is whatever the thing. I don't know like how those people are in full house. I think a few of them gotten trouble. But like the classic thing you hear is like child stars. What happens to them? What happens to a child star when they get older? Sam usually they usually become drug addicts and they crash and burn their life. We've seen a lot of that and you know, finish your point. I don't want to know that's that's it. Which is so you see what happens is the real tragedy when it comes to like the old way of doing TV, the network sitcom is you get these little children in there. Yeah, who get their childhood sort of like siphoned off of them so that their parents can make money. And the people quite often the people behind it. Wait, which show was it? Wasn't there like some weird show where the dude was like, had a foot fetish and it was always Nickelodeon. Right, what show is that all he basically it was the fat guy from ahead of the class. And he just released just he just got kicked out of Nickelodeon because it's all starting to come out. And I mean, it did kick him out. Oh, he's got I'll tell you off thing all that all the stuff about him because you know, it's alleged, right? It's alleged. And you know, we've seen like all the girls alleged. I didn't know I mean, like, dude, I mean, that's what you're supposed to say. So if he hears this, he can't come and sue you, right? Yeah, I've been put my money on. We didn't even name a name. There's just some dude at Nickelodeon and some fat guy Nickelodeon. Yeah, it's alleged. But I but the point is, like, you know, if you watch that show, it's called an open secret. If you've seen that shit. Oh, yeah, dude. And that is 100 all that shit is real. And I you know, I was talking about way back in the day and everyone called me a crazy person. It's 100% real, dude. If you look at like the little girl from Poltergeist, who just out of nowhere died. And then there's no story about it. Just gone, gone. You look at like Gary Coleman. What was that show? The facts of life? What was that? Was that the fact different strokes? I mean, the daughter on that her life was tragedy, dude, tragedy. And we've seen over and over these kids who were child stars, who became giant drug addicts. And later we find out because they were all getting molested. They were getting molested and passed around in these in these groups of things. And people don't think it could happen. 100% right. It does. But this is see this is like, okay, so like Carl Jung said this brilliant thing, which is that the leader of a country can but if there is a collective shadow, I don't know if we talked about this in your podcast, but if there's so the idea is like, everybody has a shadow side, everybody, no matter who you are, I have a lot of dark passengers, but here's where you're right. But in like, I think what Jung said is like you the the parts of yourself that you're aware are dark. That's not your shadow. Your shadow is something that you aren't even aware. It's like, it's like almost on it. It's like unlookable at it's so dark. And it's like, so everyone's got one, everyone's got one. Everyone has a shadow is another new shade is just part of being alive. You're going to have like an antithetical aspect of crazy crazy. So what Jung said is that I believe was young that the collective shadow of a society can manifest as their leader. So Adolf Hitler was the collective shadow of the repressed aspect of Germany at that time. And so when what happens is the thing that we're desperately trying to not acknowledge or hide, it ends up appearing in front of everyone and controlling them. So cool. So like the thing that you're talking about here with it's non different like with TV, with the church, with the Catholic church, with families, with actors, with with it's pretty much runs the gamut. And the problem is that there is a great deal of tension right now between the way people show themselves on stage, whether that stage is their desk, whether the stage is the the booth they work at at a movie theater, whether that stage is whatever in the in the person that they actually are. And that tension is incredibly painful and incredibly dangerous. And it fucking drives people nuts because it bifurcates, you know, the person into a bunch of different entities and it scrambles them up. Anyway, the point is, we're just seeing a reflection right now, I get that of a deeper problem, which is that people have been taught by corporations and by schools and by parents to pretend to be something and or that's a great point. And it is great. And I personally believe there's there's a darker part to this, what you're talking about. There's always that theory that confession in the Catholic church wasn't done to get it out, but more to use to blackmail people, you know, like now the church knows what you're guilty of and they'll they could give that information to somebody else, they'd come around and I stop you there for a second just to jump off that point. Yeah, this to me is the very the most hilarious fucking thing about the iPhone and all phones is that for some reason, you know, we're always like, Oh, our phones are being tapped by the government. Oh, our phones have been tapped by this and that. And for some reason, people don't think that like people at Google, they just assume like the people at Google aren't going into your emails. Yeah, they assume that the people at Apple aren't like turning your camera on. They assume that the people now you remember this shit was happening when I think it was the FBI wanted Apple to crack the to unlock someone's phone. San Bernardino quote unquote shooter. They said who was the quote quote shooter. Yeah. And remember how Apple was like, we're not going to fucking do that. That's a slippery slope. Right. And the attorney for Apple came out and said some veiled threat. Do you remember that? They the attorney from Apple came out and said something along the lines of like, what if we started accusing the CIA of assassinating Kennedy? Do you remember that? It was a veiled threat. And the moment they did that, they fucking stop fucking with Apple. Yeah, because what Apple was saying is like, Hey, dumbasses, we have your phones. The president is using an iPhone. We know everything. Fuck off. Yeah. Fuck off. That's a scary moment when a corporation becomes bigger than a government. They think about that because like, you know, I've always thought and live it if you got any libertarian listeners, I don't, I don't, I'm libertarian when it comes social. If you're waking setting adult, do what you want to do, you know, business wise. I mean, let's say you want to build a deck here on your new cool place. You got to get 1000 permits for that. I'm against that. That's unnecessary. And it's red tape and it's just a money grab. But it's like, if I go to work, I want to know that where I'm going, I'm not going to die. There's a chance I might not die because I'm unsafe workplaces. That to me is protections, which they smartly called what's the fucking regulations and everyone goes crazy and regulations, right? But I do believe there's a part of me that believes that the whole libertarian movement is a Psyop by very big corporations to get a movement to say less government, less government, because the only people can stop a giant corporation. And we see it happening all the time in Europe. They kept kick out Monsanto's. They just kicked out one country just kicked out George Soros. You see them, the only people could stop giant corporations are in fact the government. So the best way to make sure that doesn't happen is to get a giant movement going. I can offer you a counter argument to that. That's fine. I'm cool to check out this counter argument. It's pretty cool. You'll like it. It's like, so the counter argument to that is actually regulations are a way to link corporations. Maybe it's the same way we're saying the same thing. Actually, the idea is this. It's like, so all these fucking regulations, what it does is it produces a series of like, you know, hoops that somebody's got to jump through to get a lot to get a license to do this thing or that thing. Right. So you've got to do like a government inspector comes and looks at your fucking like bit whatever it is, the building, whatever it may be. And we're assuming the government inspector is like, authentically like not getting paid off. Most of the many of them are. Yeah. But the government inspector comes and looks at your building. Most people I know in town, they're just like, yeah, you got to bribe them. No question about it. You got to bribe them. Like they come, you give them some money and they like pass your fucking shit. Yeah. So that's just that's just the way it is. Like I've talked to a few different business owners, you know? I mean, Oh, literally, they're like just from like, oh, yeah, they're $100, $200. What's a bribe? I don't know. What is that? They usually it's like, I've never bribed anybody, dude, like I'll give you an example. Okay. This is this happened a long time ago at the comedy store. I remember the fucking guy was he was a rapper. They were trying to create at on they were trying to create in right around the comedy store, something called a business something district where all the businesses put money in to get their own private security. And like, it's like a weird thing that is somehow connected to the city. It's like a business control district or a business something district. And I think it fell apart. But for a little while, if you remember on Sunset Boulevard, there were dudes riding around on bikes and shit, I think it's called a business improvement district. Okay, right. So, Mitzi fucking hated that shit. She was like, what, fuck that's a fucking shake down because they wanted money. They wanted money to so each business puts in a certain amount of money for the bid, the business improvement district, right? You put in a certain amount of money. Now you've got a dude riding around on a bicycle, he's gonna like keep like fucking like drunks off the street or just give the appearance that this is a safer place than it actually is. Oh, by the way, most security is just an appearance. Well, yeah, that's all exactly. You ever been to 711? They got that guy's security guard. And you're like, this dude's getting paid $10. He's not gonna stop anything from anything. Well, this is the great illusion is we all think we're safe when we're really not like death rides on everybody's shoulder at any second, you're gonna die. And that's the great big secret that nobody wants to admit. But that being said, the business improvement district, we this dude like as Mitzi wants to fight this fucking thing, she doesn't want to do it. And I remember like this dude comes by, I think he was from the city, maybe from the business improvement, he comes by, I'm supposed to walk through the comedy store with him, we go behind the comedy store, standing in the alley outside the green room in the main room. And the guy looks at me, he's like, you know, man, we could have this fucking building torn down. It was not even like a, it was like not even a veiled threat. It was just like, Hey, dumbass, if you know if we wanted to, we could like really fuck your life up if you don't agree to this thing, which is really just a way we're going to suction, siphon some money away from the businesses. And that's not a, is that a bribe? I don't know. It's kind of a bribe. Isn't it saying, Hey, do you want to be cool with the city? Yeah, the problem is I can't remember if the guy worked for the city or not. But so that's not really a bribe in the sense that it's no, it's a business improvement district. But it's a weird way of being like, Hey, guys, there's going to be an extra little tax we've come up with. And if you don't pay it, we're going to make trouble for you. Right. And is that a bribe? Or is it like, no, we just want to improve. But you know, we'll make so another way to put it is like, that's a bribe. Right. So we have this way of like making bribes not seem like bribes anymore. So anyway, the whole point is when we, when we come to the concept of regulation, which is certainly insert some, we need that shit. If you look at places where there, there isn't regulation, that's when the fucking tent collapses. The concert Yeah, that's my whole point. But but where it gets weird, where the libertarians are like pointing out something that's certainly correct, more the anarchists and the libertarians, I think, even though the two are like one one leads to the other sometimes. But the idea is that actually what's happening is that, you know, we get when we look at like Soviet, the Soviet Union, and it's like the state is running everything, the state is running, yes, the fucking grocery stores, the state is running everything. And it's like a nightmare, right? Yeah. And in the West, we're like the state isn't doing that at all. The state's not running anything at all, except the state has come up with the way that you're supposed to train employees. The state has come up with the forms you're supposed to fill out to make a business happen. The state has come up right all these regulations and the people who are working in the corporate offices of many of these massive, massive conglomerates used to be working in the government. Yeah. Government workers go to the banks. Yeah. People who work for the bank see it up all the time. So there is now this foggy, weird, like, membrane through which government workers become private workers who work for massive corporations and met people who work in massive corporations, become government workers. And now we see that there's actually a deep connection between these two things. And I think libertarians and anarchists are pointing out, fuck that, man, we don't want state run goddamn businesses. We want there to be a separation. I completely agree with that. I completely agree with that 100%. But what I am talking about is this, like, when we get rid of regulations, the need ones, they're inevitably is a crash. And it's done on purpose because these giant, like Goldman Sachs, right? They literally, through law, they were allowed to create a profile, which they put all these bad real estate investments in. And they did it on purpose. Then they went to their investors and told them invest in this portfolio, knowing it was going to crash. And what they do, they went and they, they, they got insurance on that, meaning if it crashes, yeah, they get money. Yeah. And it crashed and they made so much money. That to me is a major problem. So I don't know where the fine line is between necessary and abusive. You know, when you say that the company, when the city comes to the county store and goes, either pay us this, like this improvement thing, or we're going to shut down your bid, that to me is abuse. The, the thought that a company can tell its investors knowingly to invest poorly in this and it crashes, causing such a giant crash that the U S government has to throw a trillion dollars in to buy out bailouts and that these corporations budget this buyout into their budgets. That to me is chaos. I don't, I, so I don't, I don't have an answer. Well, what you're doing there though is you, you're creating a separation between the corporation and the, and the state. Like, so the idea is like you're, that, that somehow the state has been victimized or manipulated by the corporation is though they weren't even, we weren't working in cahoots. But really when you look at it, what you start finding out is through, I mean, look at what's happening. Oh, I see what you're saying. Yeah. Okay. I get that. So you're right. So like here we have like, so here we really, what's happening is the state has teamed up with corporations to siphon money from people through taxes. So really it's the government and the corporations are the same thing, but they've come up with a clever ways that they could siphon money from the people. That's what it is. I get what you're saying. So there's no, like, if there's a separation between the two, then we could see that is kind of the narrative that gets thrown around is like, oh, no, the poor government, the poor United States government is being manipulated by the banks, is though the banks were separate from the fucking government. Please, please, please. Look at like, isn't that fascism when the government and corporations merge? Is that what considered fascism is? Corporateocracy, maybe? I don't know. I don't know what you call, I don't really know. I don't know the particular name for it. But to me, it seems like that was the big thing about Obama's Obamacare. It's the coalescing of power. Okay. So it's kind of like power will coalesce. Point Duncan Trussell. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Well, I have no problem. David Graber is the utopia of rules. It's a fantastic book that like breaks all this shit down. It talks about like the intentionality to like, basically, there's like this idea of credentials, so credentialization. So it's kind of like, there's all these bullshit credentials. So here's how it works. I want to get credentialed to practice psychology. So to get credentialed to practice psychology, I have to go to school very expensive. So to go to school for most people, that means I have to, what? I have to get in debt to the banks to go to school to get credentialed. Yeah. So essentially, it's abroad because the thing that the training that I'm getting, do we really need it? How much of it do we really need? Do we need four years of it? Could it be done in five months? Because do we need four years? But really, it's more than four years, more like eight years. So I've got to go get this credential for eight years. So eight years into debt. So really, at that point, what is happening is I'm saying to the banks, if you will give me the credential, so I can practice this thing or that thing, then I will tithe to you a percentage of my yearly income. Oh my God, that's so interesting. Yeah, yeah, yeah. What's the name of that book? It's called The Utopia of Rules by David Graber. It's really, really great. That's so interesting. It's really good. And so what you're seeing there, like, okay, so right now, everyone's like, you know, shitting bricks over Michael Cohen, Trump's lawyer, who was meeting with, like, AT&T, I believe, and other governments and saying, I will give you access to the president for $500,000 for a million dollars, whatever it is, right? Right. And everybody's like, what the fuck is this shit? Yeah, crazy, crazy, right? But really, what that is, is it's just Trump doing what presidents have always done, but doing it in a sloppy fucking way. Yes. That's the gift of Trump. The gift of Trump is like, he's showing us, wait, this is exactly what presidents have always done. They've just been a little more subtle with their ways of making that fucking money flow into the private accounts. They're just a little more, Trump is just like kind of like clumsy. So like, he's like, and I think, you know, when people talk about the deep state and people being upset with him, they're not upset with him because he seems to be like, has a short fuse. They're upset with him because he's giving away all their tricks. He's like a bad magician at the magic castle who's coming out and he's like, he's showing all this fucking shit that the other great misogynists, everyone's like, wait, that's a trick. I know how to do that now. That I think is why people are so upset with him. They're like, dude, we figured out a way to trick people into thinking you're God, you're God and you're fucking giving it all away. That's what I think is the problem with Trump. You know, that's great. Yeah. Yeah. That is so true. And as I've always said, like the difference in Obama and the difference between Trump is like, it's like you're, you're, you're significant others cheating on you. Do you want to know about it or don't you want to know about it? If you want to know about it, that's Trump. If you don't want to know about that's Obama. There you go. That's a great way to put it. It's just the secret is right out there on the tape. It's really not that much of a secret. It's like, but come on, friends, really, really, really, really, you think American politicians are not being paid off to make decisions. You think they're making decisions based on their constituency. Right. Come on. Really? You really think that some of them maybe, but all them, I don't know. It's like doping in baseball, isn't it? It's like if one of them starts getting paid off, all them kind of have to start getting paid off, or they don't have the money to run their fucking election campaigns. So it's like, to me, that's the, the, the, what, what we're seeing in the, and that's one of the great gifts of Trump is it's like, let's stop fucking pretending that the state is some kind of golden shining God. This is not, it's no, so it's it, North Korea, North Korea, everyone's like, my God, they really thought that Kim Jong-un is a God. Those savages, how could they think that? Can you imagine that an American president told a lie? It's no different. It's like, it's a fucking human. Or you like to get peed on, or you like to have weird sacks and grab somebody by the pussy. Can you imagine the thought of this town getting so upset about grabber by the pussy? I don't get it. I don't know. Is it that they, they were trying to show the powers that be that they're going to play ball by going absolutely nuts over grabber by the pussy? Well, Sam, that's offensive. Yeah, it is offensive, but we got to look at where the playing field in which this is, this is happening. I don't, I, like, when people get outraged by that and, and like, when you look at Clinton's, they've been on a fucking Lolita Express 22 times. Right. Well, but again, it's like that, the assumption here is that people, number one, the assumption is that what you're seeing on social media is all coming from actual humans and not, you know, bots, bots, which goes back to our manipulation. Yeah. So, so you do run into like astroturfing, they call it. So who knows? I mean, what I, what I would like is, you know, I think what we, is a pretty normal, nice thing to want is for our leader to be not perfect, but for our leader to be an example of what we can do as a country. Like we want our leader to be like, dude, look at us. That's us. That's not a reflection of our shadow. That's a reflection of all of us and some of it's stupid and some of it's annoying, but really, man, that's a cool motherfucker. Like I like that person for real. Maybe he's not telling the truth or she's not telling the truth all the time. That's a cool motherfucker. That's what he, like what you were saying, most of these people are being pranked. They're really nice. Yeah. And most Americans, they're amazing. Yeah. And really what they want is a president who's like their kids can look at and be like, that's a cool guy. They don't really care that much, but you want your kid to look at the president and be like, man, that's a, that's a wonderful human. Maybe not perfect, but he's pretty great. Right. And so when like Trump, all this shit comes out about this dude being this fucking like pig and being this fucking thing that many of the people who are upset about it, if they really scan back in their history, maybe they've done some shit they're not so proud of, but it's like, God damn it, man, you fucking please, please, if you're going to fucking, if you're going to con me, please don't let me know I'm being conned because then I can't sleep as well. Right. Right. Right. And this, this is what scares people, especially in the conspiracy world, man. They get very scared. They don't hate you. Like, because people get angry with me. They get angry. I mean, it's, it's gotten weird at the store a couple of times. People can say passive aggressive stuff to me very much that I have, I have to let it go. Yeah. Because if I, if I go back, then I'm the aggressor and I'm the asshole. So I just have to let it roll. And they're not assholes. I just know there's that deep down side they're scared they're getting lied to and they don't because they know me. They know me. They met with me. They've interacted a thousand times. You know, the next guy, you know, the next guy I fuck over is the first guy I fuck over. You know, I purposely operate like that. Yeah. That I try not, you know, they know me. They don't know these people, but they trust these people and they've been getting told the stuff by these people for a very long time and the thought and I come in with something different and they get scared that they are getting lied to. Well, you just have to, you're right. And you're triggering something that's like for a lot of people. The idea like what here's like, I don't know if you've ever been conned before. I've ever been conned. No, I've had moments where I'm like, I think I'm getting catfished. You know, when you had a conversation with someone on the internet, you're like, this is too good to be true. You know, I think I gotta, I gotta get out of this thing. So we've ever seen that terrifying movie. There's two versions of it. There's a remake of it. There's original. It's called funny games. You ever seen that? No, I have not. So this is like a really disturbing movie. And the movie starts off with these people at a vacation home. There's a knock at the door and these two dudes are at the door. They say they're from the house down the street. They need some eggs, right? Like, can we borrow some eggs? You know, we didn't, they're like kind of weird, but it's like, oh yeah, sure. And they, they bring them some eggs, right? And the, uh, the, the, the guys like drop the eggs. And they're like, oh my God, we're so sorry. I'm so sorry. Do you have any more? And they get the woman goes and gets some more eggs and brings it to them. And they drop the eggs again. What the fuck is happening? They mean to drop the fucking eggs? Oh, this is creeping me out. So then like what happens is like they kind of start acquiescing to what obviously is, is not right. And another, if you really want to see the perfect example of it, Sam, by the way, we're at 404. You got to be somewhere traffic, whatever you need, perfect example of it. I just need you to talk about one thing before we go. Sure. Magic schools. Oh yeah. Mysteries. We'll get to that. This actually kind of connects. Okay. So like if you want the perfect example of this, it's fucking Rosemary's baby. When was the last time you saw Rosemary's baby forever? Okay. You need to watch it again. Cause if you look at Rosemary's baby, spoiler alert, Rosemary becomes the mother of the Antichrist. Rosemary's the mother of the Antichrist and her and her husband move into a building where they are gradually manipulated by Satanic witches. She gets raped by the devil, um, and, and, and, and ends up giving birth to the Antichrist. Now, if you look at Rosemary in particular, who it's a really interesting type of protagonist and you realize like in many ways she committed like a really kind of atrocious sin, which is that she kept acquiescing instead of sticking up for herself. It's like people. She was people pleasing. She wanted to believe these people were okay when she knew they weren't. And she kept saying, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. And then she ends up rocking the fucking cradle of Satan. So I think the, the, the film in a lot of ways is a commentary on people pretending to be victims when in fact they are actually like, they've actually opened the door to vampires, to demons. They welcomed the vampires in. Yes. Right. So, so I think like that, that is, is so interesting. Yeah. And that's for a lot of people. They want to imagine that the state of things, the condition of things is, has been imposed upon them and that they haven't in a lot of different ways acquiesced to this. And so anyway, the point is wrote, it's easier to be hanging around people and playing the game of pretending they're not fucking using you than to confront them. Because if you confront them, now you've got to fight. Yeah. You know, now, now, now the gigs up, now you got to fight, you have to wake up, you have to fight, and it fucking sucks. And this is, this happens in families where there's abuse, which is this abuse has been going on and on and on and everyone fucking knows it, but they don't want to destroy the fucking family. And so they stay quiet. They would rather great example, Penn State, same thing. Exactly. They don't want to ruin the program. Michigan State, same thing. Exactly. Catholic church. Same thing. And so, so we have this like, so like, for example, with Obama, there's just some facts out there. And one of the facts is that Obama under his administration, they deported, now this might have changed. I don't know if Trump's caught up with him yet, but under Obama, they deported more people than all American presidents combined, all American presidents combined. You can look this up. This is not a radical far right, all right fact. This is true. It's correct. You can look it up. I remember like getting in online, this somebody came at me so hard and was attacking and attacking me. I'm like, Hey, look, I just want to show you this fact. This is a fact. And they like, they had to like gradually what she said, which is really close. Like, you know what? I'm just scared. And I'm like, I know, I know that's what it is. I don't remember exactly how the interaction went. It was something like that. But my point is that the difference between Obama and Trump is Obama made it seem like he was this kind of sophisticated sweetie. And I guarantee he is on certain levels, but also he had a lot of people deported. He ordered a lot of fucking violence to happen in the world. He was part of this thing in that thing where many people who were who had done nothing wrong were killed for for in the name of what? Yeah, you know, and so this this is true. Just know that the Nobel Peace Prize winning president is the first president in history of the United States to from day one to his last day was in war. He's the only president to ever be in war the every day of his but but you know, again, not not I mean, I'm not defending her. I know I get I've always called Obama what people get upset with is is I compare Obama or like, I like to draw the Manson like we everyone's upset with Charles Manson. But it's like, wait, he didn't really he didn't do anything. He just ordered people to kill people. But he was in jail forever. But that's what every American president does. They like because they're these I get that are these charismatic leaders that events people to murder for them. And then the people that they've convinced a murder for them are some of the great very sweet, wonderful people who just want to help. They actually use this terrible trick. It's a really terrible, terrible trick, which is like humans. We want to build shit together. We like to build stuff together. I got that we love it. We love and we love to serve each other like humans like to give things to each other. We love to help humans Americans, man, we fucking love to help. Yes, war is there's no better place for you to help your your your your friends. There's no better tribe to build shit with your tribe and and to save lives. And you can do it under the illusion these days that what you're doing is for some just cause. And the whole fucking things falling apart now is we look at Iraq. We look at like all these things that happen. And we think what was that for? Why did that happen? Yes, we took our best people and we put them into a situation of an absurd situation. And now they come back here with PTSD. They come back here and they kill themselves because they're dealing with this kind of cognitive dissonance that comes from a sense of like, man, I wanted to help. Right. I wanted to fucking help. I concur. I wanted to help. I came I came there because I wanted to fucking help. I joined the military. I wanted to fucking help. I saw the buildings on fire. I wanted to fucking help. I wanted to help. I didn't want that to happen. I love this country. I wanted to help. These are good people, you know, and they got sucked into a thing. Oh, it's so sad. It is sad. It's completely sad. And it's like people don't want to come to grips with a lot of that stuff. People don't like to talk about the 9-Elevens and all that stuff because it scares them. The notion that somebody who's on, you know, there's good evidence that Hitler was a Rothschild, you know, there's a lot of evidence to that. Well, I mean, you can, I mean, instead of saying there's good evidence, I think the way to go, I don't know if you're right or wrong, is to point to what is true. Bear aspirin. Just start fucking there. You know about Bear aspirin? Fuck boy, they're making cyclon B. You know what I mean? So if you start looking at the way that many corporations, because everyone's like, you know, the Nazis, what do you think those fucking Nazis, what happened to them? Where do you think they went? You think they all just vanished? They entered an expansion draft. They got drafted by England, Russia, and the United States. And the ones that didn't get drafted either went down to Argentina or they were thrown like they were thrown on trial. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, if you look at the number of Nazis that like ended up being like there were war criminals and got hung versus the number of Nazis that were when you look at Hitler giving that speech and like everyone's scattered out there, it looks like it's like they based the fucking Star Wars scenes in Star Wars off of that where it's like this like infinite display of these people. Like you, where do you think they, what do you think happened to them? These were skilled people. These were trained people. These were very deeply indoctrinated brainwashed people. Where do you think they went? You think they just vanished? You think they just disappeared? Well, it's come on. Where did they go? Where did they go? Where what happened to them? They evolved. Many of them, they figured out a way to like do what they were doing in a way that didn't seem so fucking overt. That shit's not going to work. That form of imperialism, that doesn't work anymore. That's over now. It's gone. Like it's not going to work. So we have to, you know, if the impulse is to conquer, we're going to have to convert that conquering impulse into a way that's palatable to the majority of people to subjugate. Well, we can't subjugate in the way that's advised by the prince these days. So my Machiavelli's book, The Prince, we have to figure out another way to subjugate. We have to figure out another way to do it, you know? And so to me, the comfort is this. It's what's happening is not different. It's just concealed enough. That's all. It's an evolution of imperialism. And in a lot of ways, there's something about that that's comforting in a lot of ways. It just depends on the way you want to look at it because here's the truth. We are living in a time where more people have access to electricity than ever before. We're living in a time where literacy rates are higher than they've ever been before. We're living in a time where infant mortality rates are lower than they've ever been before. We're living in a time of compared to other times in human history, of great prosperity. And we're living in a time where there's a lot of beauty that's happening. Of course. But because of that, the darkness, when it appears, it is freaks everybody out. Way more, way louder, way more intense, way more intense. And I think there's something beautiful in that because it means that things are getting better, truly things are getting better. The fact that now we're upset because one of our leaders said, grabbed by the fucking pussy, when you look back in the history of leaders, oh my God, they're lopping fucking heads off of there. They're just like, they're fucking like Vlad the Impaler. He's fucking putting people on goddamn spikes in front of his fucking castle. Yeah. So I think there's something beautiful that the immune system of society has become activated just by a kind of like creepy ass fucking, cunty, brutish, sexual, deviant president. I think there's something in it that's quite hopeful. It's just we don't want to act. And how do we act? And what is the way to like make things to like rip the veil off of things and make things better? I think the fact that Stormy Daniels just got the key to West Hollywood yesterday and isn't at the fucking bottom of a river has shown we've grown a little bit. That is it. And as long as we keep our eyes on that, yeah, instead of getting so terrified by realizing like, no, these are the machinations of power, power coalesces, power manipulates, power seduces, power subjugates, power like doesn't really care about like you or doesn't care about hurting power just wants to have more power. This is just the way it is. As long as we like look at it from that perspective of like this isn't some unnatural volcano of satanism. It's just what we're beginning to see is the revelation of how things actually are. And eventually it's going to get to the point where we have to act and we are acting many of us. And that brings us to the mystery schools, which is that Sam and I were talking about this. Yeah, you blew my mind. It was so funny because I had you on speakerphone laying in my bed with my girlfriend and you were you like, you don't know what mystery schools are. I go, no, what are mystery schools? You're like, you don't know what mystery schools are. I'm like, no, you're like, you're a conspiracy theorist. I was like laughing. When I got off the phone, my girlfriend's like, dude, you got to act like you know what mystery school your girlfriend's awesome. It's conspiracy theorists talking are so funny because one huge part of being a conspiracy theorist, if that's what you call us having a conversation is at one point someone's got to be like, what? Yeah, you don't know that. Let me tell you this. And that's why I do love my podcast now because I have learned so much in life and there is so much knowledge out there that the thing is it's like what I've said, you know, I did tape Fletcher's podcast a long time ago and I was always talking about how so many people just take the first exit off the road in their life. The first exit off is what they take and it leads to this job that never fulfills them when if they maybe would have gone two or three more exits down, they could have been somewhere very, very exciting. And so the knowledge that is out there, a lot of people just take the low hanging fruit knowledge and they don't crawl a couple branches up to some really interesting knowledge. Yeah. And that's what this my podcast, Tim Foil Hat has done for me, Tim Foil Hat with Sam Tripoli, is it's really opened my mind to a lot of interesting things that I would never have known unless, you know, we dug deep and went for it. Yeah. And a lot of people don't, you know, they don't want to go up the tree and they don't want to they like they like where they're at on the tree and that's totally okay. I mean, that's kind of like, I think one of the ethical sort of considerations, like if you if you like if you want to sort of construct an ethical power structure that isn't really based on subjugation, then or you'd want to like, in other words, like if you if you were kind of like recognize that in the world, there is just a never ending BDSM party happening that isn't based on consent. You know, sort of look out of the world, you look at the natural world, you look like when a when a fucking beetle eats an ant or whatever, when a beetle like sprays acid on an ant before eats it, it's not being like, Hey, do you mind if I spray acid on you and make you a part of me? Yeah. It just does it. It just takes it. You look at like, man, this great video popped up on Reddit of just like, these birds eating some corpse, which is just if you look at the natural word, I think the birds are eating a bird corpse. So like all these birds are sitting chowing down on some dead bird, basically like a scene from The Walking Dead, they're just like, we're eating bird, we're eating our friend, eating Jerry. And then like an eagle just comes walking up, doesn't even threaten them. And they're just like, All right, lunch is over. And the eagle just starts eating the dead bird. So you look at the natural world and you see that. Or another way to put it is there's rock slides, avalanches, there are things that happen just, just K, K, like, just absolute natural, just, you know, people get hit by lightning, people just people, you know, just accidents happen, you know, that you look at that, okay, well, Jesus Christ, there's like, when you look at that, like, that doesn't seem really fair. And then you look at plants, you know, like, kudzu will just wrap around another fucking tree and kill it. And you look at that and like, Oh, that doesn't really seem fair. And then you're kind of like, Oh, I guess, but with humans, all that, even though we do seem to be the end product of an evolutionary process with us, that stops. Yes, with us, we're not really like that. So but with us, it is like that. It's just the way we do it is more nuanced, the way we do it is more camouflaged and clever. And so if you wanted to create a way to sort of disengage from a lot of guilt for being a subjugator, then what you would want to do is produce an equal playing field, which is like, Hey, if you guys want to hang out down at that part of the tree, you're welcome to hang out down there. But if you're hanging out in that part of the tree, you're going to be working for, for us up here in upper parts of the tree in different ways. Yes. But we're up here. We're leaving the symbols and the signals and we're leaving it everywhere right in front of you. It's right there in front of you. It's right there. All you got to do is just don't take that exit. Or if you took the exit, go back on the highway and just do it. And if you do that, we're going to help you even. That's the other part of it is like, we will help you once you start like once you're like, All right, I'm going for it. So interesting. We're going to help. So anyway, here's the concept. I love that. The mystery schools to understand mystery schools start with regular schools. So if you look at like the school system, we've got high schools and college and junior high schools, right? So you go to high school and you do good enough. We do well enough in high school and you have a good GPA or you demonstrate this. You go private school real quick. No, I did not regular school. You get a good GPA or whatever you demonstrate that you're this thing or that thing. You work super hard. Maybe you're great at sports, whatever it is. Then suddenly, you no longer have to get in debt to the banks to go to another school. Actually, the other school will like recruit you school, right? Schools will like try to get you to go to their school, right? So now you go to university, the Ivy League schools as they're called. And it's like getting into them is really, really difficult. But once you get into those Ivy League schools, what fucking happens? You get in the Ivy League schools, you join the skull and bones, right? Become part of this fraternity or that fraternity. And then once you join those groups, then suddenly you begin to like, you have access to children of some very, very powerful people. But you're going to become the powerful people because you're meeting their children, you become friends with them. And then in that process of grooming you and teaching you and giving you information that isn't accessible to people who don't want to go into debt to the banks or can't get in there, you gain a kind of power. You start learning all this stuff. And then from learning that stuff, then you get into politics and then suddenly the next thing you know, you're the president, you're a senator, you're running things. And then everyone's shitting bricks because they're like, he was a member of the skull and bones. So really what you're seeing there is what some people say is a reflection of a completely different type of school system that exists outside of the scope of popular culture. Okay. So in the same way that there are universities like Harvard or Yale or whatever, there's also other universities within those universities. No, there's other universities that aren't even like universities. Yeah. And so this is the Freemasons. This is when I was interviewing Sean Stoney. He's talking about he's a Freemason and then within, but once you become a Freemason and you get through a certain number of degrees, you actually can get tapped or invited into other fucking schools all together that people don't even know about. Like if you look at the Freemasons or you look at like, you look at that, that's actually just a kind of like an inflow point. It's kind of like a tentacle. I think I've told you this before. I love it so much that Douglas Adams wrote that mice are actually the end of the tentacles of interdimensional creatures who come into this dimension to study scientists, right? Like scientists are always working with mice, but mice are like actually like studying the scientists. But anyway, that's a dumb joke. That's so funny. So in the same way, like the Masonic temples or the protrusion of the end of a tentacle that's connecting to a capillary system, a very powerful force that's designed to allow people who are interested in learning, climbing up the tree to have a chance. And then once you get in there and you demonstrate some kind of, you know, I don't know the way to put it, well, you didn't demonstrate a certain type of intention, then from that demonstration, you get invited into deeper and deeper and deeper parts of the temple, so to speak. So it's like, these are universities, mystery schools are like universities that aren't real universities. They're kind of just like, oh, I go to this Mason Lodge and I join the Masons and I slowly learn through that. These are universities that universities were based on. They're as real as it gets. It's just the universities tried to like become like mirrors of the thing that existed for much longer than the universities. So no, the mystery. Is there a Mason University? No, I think what Sean Stone was saying is like, by becoming a Freemason, you get inducted into a society where there are secrets and then you You learn these secrets. Yeah. And once you start learning those secrets, you're being tested and they're testing you to see like, well, do you have a big fucking mouth? And if you have a big fucking mouth, they're like, all right, well, we're going to let you stay at this level, even though you might think you're progressing. They're just like, we're going to keep you at this level because we you're going to disseminate the wrong types of information that people aren't ready for. Interesting. Yeah. But also that being said, if maybe they recognize that you have a good intent, then they're like, okay, okay, we're going to let you catch on to certain things and say it publicly. But really, you think you're the one saying the thing publicly. Actually, we're just ready to get this information out in the world because we think that people are ready to level up. We want to send an invitation out, which is like, Hey, listen, come, we're there. Don't worry. It's cool. You're not crazy. We've been around for a lot longer than the United States government. We're around a lot longer than this thing or that thing. And when you're ready, we're here for you. Don't worry. It's okay. You're just as safe as that bug. You're just as safe as that fucking bird. You're just as safe as any other thing in the natural world, which is to say you're not fucking safe at all. But that's okay because that's the way things go. And then the illusion of security. Yeah. And it's like, look, these people over here, they don't see shit. They don't see shit. They're walking around with their hands in their pocket or their fucking eyes on their phone or their eyes on the prize. They got their eyes on the prize. They want to make some money. They want to make some money. That's okay. Let them go make their money. You know, but if you realize like, wait a minute, I think that's a fucking, that's it. That's just a cat toy. All those green bills. That's just that fuzzy little pink thing bobbing around. Once you start realizing that, you know, like, wait a minute, I don't think I'm going to look at that anymore. I don't think I'm going to look at the alerts on Fox News anymore. I think I'm going to go start looking in different places. Yeah. That's where you meet them. I love that. I love meeting people in different places. I love hearing about it. That's a big thing in my podcast is I just don't judge people. Like some people listen, get really angry because I don't challenge people on stuff. But that's not really what I'm about. I'm more about, okay, I have you on. Let's assume what you're saying is real. Tell me about what you've learned. Yeah. And then either you, you like it and you keep it with you or you go, oh, that's crazy. You throw it out and you move on. You know what I'm saying? Damn right. And I enjoy that dude. Well, that's why you got such a great fucking podcast man. Nobody wants like, come on. Yeah, no, duh. You could like attack somebody because they said this thing like really you're going to like get into a fucking like political argument or like some kind of argument with somebody who like says they saw Bigfoot. It's like, let them tell you their fucking Bigfoot story. Like what is it? Like what happened? Who are you? And you never know because within that space that you create some real truth can come out. For sure. We had this 85 year old man who's been on Ancient Aliens talking about Anunnaki and I'm like, and then like the third you're like, dude, why do you I'm like, dude, that's not the show. The show isn't challenging you. There are shows that are like that. This is not that show. This is like I get conspiracy theorists who tend to be like street dogs beating down constantly because they like like a Kanye West, whatever you want to say about that guy. He literally said we should give Trump a chance. We need to stop with the diversity and he got pounding on and that happens on smaller levels all the time with people who see it a little different. So I like to take those people interview them and go, what are you saying? I'm not here to beat them down like they are everywhere. I want to hear what they have to say and let the listener glean what they want off it. I think that's a great I mean because I think it's a it's a the job of someone doing the kind of show that you're doing is not to suddenly function as the discriminatory ability in the listener's mind. It's their job to listen to me like I don't think that's real because you're letting someone say something doesn't necessarily mean you believe it. It's just like you're letting them sing their song. It's like let them sing their song and then if you don't believe it go you do the research you check it out. Was that real? Is Hitler a fucking Rothschild? I don't fucking know. I'll look it up though. See what the data is and like whether that even impacts my life or not probably not in the sense that like I'm pretty pretty convinced that like um in the same way that we're looking at like you know Kim Jong-un who's like seems to and I think he really does want to like not be a uh I think the kid wants isolated. I think that guy wants to party. I think Kim Jong-un wants to fucking go have some fun. He's stuck with all these old goddamn military cunts. Yeah. He's like trapped in some stupid predicament. He probably wants to date a couple hot black chicks. Dude he yeah he's like fucking he's and I'm not saying like yeah no you don't understand he's running the cabs killing the dad. Yeah sure sure he is. I know he is. He's fucking I'm sure and like the son of a bitch feels terrible or doesn't feel terrible but I guarantee that compared to his dad he's a few shades lighter in the sense of like being like kinder. A few shades more compassionate. Yeah. He has access to the internet. He goes on reddit. Yeah. He watches fucking you know what I mean. You know what I mean the guy and but the guy's surrounded by some crusties probably right. I totally agree. And if you look at his predicament and the predicament of the American people or the people who are in the government right now we want things to get better. They're surrounded by crusties too. Neocons, neoliberal. Right. And so it's like we're looking at a real kind of like interesting shit. So interesting. Yeah. And I think it's really quite beautiful. I think what's happening is like quite I think it's beautiful. And I think that there's a lot of forces at play here that have benevolent intentions and are just figuring out a way to like make things unfold without there being a global conflagration. I think it's interesting. Meanwhile someone's going to play this shit after like World War three breaks out. You idiots listen. You are totally wrong. Now is everything seem okay. That actually happened to me. I put out we recorded up so way to week to put it out and the information changed a little bit. So I had to put out a disclaimer before to just let people know it's like this guy was nice enough to come down due to show. So I won't put out his episode and I you know because I appreciate what his his time and effort. Yeah. And then it changed again. So it's just like okay then it kind of worked out. It's a process where you when no matter what you want to think about life you must admit it's a process. We're in a process. Everyone that you see is in process. When you see a person who's an asshole don't think that person's permanently an asshole think that person is in the part of the process where there's still a fucking asshole. And just know that most people they're growing. They're changing in a positive way. They're just in a process right now. And that's important to realize you're not looking at the some total of a being you're looking at a frame of their yes. I think and we do that a lot with it. Yeah. I totally agree. Tripoli you. I love chatting with our talks are coming back on the show. Can I I don't know when this is going to come out. I'm going to put it up on the Patreon right now and when do you need it out.
