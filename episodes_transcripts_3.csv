My organization, the Global Planetary Peace Team, is a group of like-minded individuals stationed in my massive compound in North Carolina. I'd like to invite you to join. All you have to do is give up everything. And I know what you're thinking. I don't want to give up everything. I want to hold on to this and that. My stocks, my bonds, my money, my house, my life, my integrity, all these things that you imagine would be so very important to yourself. I'm here to tell you they mean nothing. Whatever it is you're attached to, I will destroy. I will separate from you and I will free you at last from the bonds of your materialistic life. At that point, you're going to be my ditch digger supreme. We need 60 ditch diggers up at the compound. Somebody to dig trenches that we all take pisses and shits and I'll thank you, might be the person for the job. So if you're interested, head over to internationalglobalpeaceteam.edu and sign up.

With the growing coyote packs in America's neighborhoods and the unfortunate resulting violence and carnage coming from coyotes climbing through. Pet doors, eating dogs, cats, senior citizens, young people, and of course any living thing. In fact, coyotes are getting much more aggressive than they have been in the past. And it seems to be related to the impending singularity but no one's quite sure about that. Regardless, you don't have to be one of the Americans who are being taken advantage of, exploited by, or eaten by coyotes. I can teach you how to subdue, domesticate, and enslave S-D-E, the coyotes in your neighborhood using my 10 step S-D-E method. Not only will coyotes no longer attack you, your family, or your pets, you will actually be able to send the coyotes throughout your neighborhoods, throughout your cities to do your bidding, to get that revenge that you so crave. There's no need to be afraid of the summer. In fact, you can actually love the summer again. God knows how I do. How I love the summer. I get nostalgic in the summer. It's during the summer that my mind really takes me away. Takes me back to my high school days, a certain summer, the summer of 1993. Seems like forever ago, but only if you measure it in terms of years. I was living in a small town in North Carolina, Hendersonville, population 6,666, but it seemed like a million. During those days, we were all enjoying the fruits of the LSD boom in the 90s. We're all taking it for granted that we'd always have access to high-grade LSD 25, printed on Alex Gray's art. How are we to know that a drought would soon sweep across the land, leaving some of us without acid for years, even decades? The other day, as I was reading my New York Times, looking out over the swarm of robotic drones working in my vineyard, I wondered what might have happened had the LSD never gone away. I thought back to one of my friends, Keith Blinch, who actually got busted once the acid ran out. They found him in a local cemetery. He'd exhumed the grave. It pried open a coffin because he'd heard you could get high from the fumes held within. I'd almost forgotten about Keith, but the other day, as I was watching one of my servants exhum a grave in our family cemetery, his memory came crashing back in. I was so inspired by the memory that actually went to my studio and recorded this song, which has already been nominated for 17 Grammys. He was a coffin stepper, did it every night, creeping round the graveyards, trying to get high. Six feet of paradise, at any time. Open up the coffin thing, open up the coffin, take a sniff, and lose your mind. Coven stepper, he was a coffin stepper. Coven stepper, getting high. Coven stepper, it's all I need. Just one sniff, and I'll be free. Coven stepper, I need you to come home. This thing you'll find, this thing is for you. He was a coffin stepper. Coven stepper, he actually did time. Went to a prison for sniffing coffins. That was Coven Sniffer by Link Adder. And now a word from our sponsors. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by bluechew.com.

I'm great. I'm great. I'm doing really good. Anytime I get a chance to pick your brain, I hate the statement. I hate that term. I hate that word. I hate that word. I hate that word. I hate that word. I hate that word. I get a chance to pick your brain. I hate the statement. I hate that term. Pick your brain. I really do. It's like the grossest term. Have you ever got an email from somebody that's just like, hey, I just want to take you to lunch and just pick your brain about... Oh, I've gotten those many, many fucking times. About marketing. They always ask me about marketing. Like, I just want to pick your brain about your marketing knowledge. Oh, that'd be awesome. Because you're so brilliant. It's like, thank you. That sounds like a fun lunch. Hey, I just want to pick your brain about... Yeah, yeah. So I can give you, you know, thousands of dollars. I don't want my brain picked. I'm so flattered. I don't want my brain. It's like, you know, those dental birds that land in the hippopotamus mouth. Oh, yeah. And the crocodiles. Yeah, those are very friendly. What's the plural of hippopotamus? Hippopotamia. Yeah. Those things. They're picking fish out of the teeth of the hippopotamia. And it's like a sweet symbiosis. But when someone's going to pick your brain, it is the same sense of like, what are their ideas stuck in the teeth of my brain that your beak is going to yank out? Yeah. So I apologize. That's a little lab. It's not quite symbiosis. It's a parasitism. Yeah, it's a fucking parasitism. But that being said, I'm going to pick your brain, Jason. Here we are. Because I, all this time, all these great conversations we've had. I must be the worst interviewer that has ever existed because never once have I asked you about the process of teaching magic to your students. And which is like, would you consider that your main gig? It's, yeah. I mean, that I've kind of, you're not, well, we don't actually really do interviews. You know, we have, we have conversations. That's right. So, but yeah, I mean, yeah, I've kind of organized or created a unique situation for myself where I'm basically a professional academic, at least at this moment where I write books and then I teach, it's just that I teach something that, you know, you can't, they're not going to fund it in the UC system or something like that. Or maybe they would. It would be really lame. So I've created my own renegade, you know, academic operation here, which is great because it means, you know, I'm not beholden to some, you know, untenable academic structure, jockeying for tenure or something like that. Right. And of course, that's only one part of what I do. But, you know, I'm happy with it. And yeah, so I, what I've been doing this for a while now, four or five years, teaching pretty much full time. And I'm really excited about it for a lot of reasons. One is that I expected going in that people would be, you know, really flaky that it would be like people like showing up in black metal face paint or just super goth. And it was like, oh boy, like. You mean because they're, they're coming to you to learn magic. Right. And you, you, someone who has written many books on magic have been associated with many magical communities. You have a sense of like, yeah, I don't want you. You've stereotyped magical aspirants as being like gothy or something, which is I think a lot of people when they hear this shit, they're like, shut the fuck up. You what your magic? You do magic with the K. Can you, can you actually just answer those people? Let me, let me just play like judgmental square, you know, what do they call it? Default reality tunnel person who hears about magic. Okay. First normies. Normies. I'm going to do an intense eye roll and I'm going to go. Okay. So what do you do? Like spells or something like that? What do you do? Tinctures? What do you take? Like, I don't know. Do you take like fucking herbs from your garden and mix it together and do, do you say, say shit? Come on. Let's face it. You're selling crystal water to fools. It doesn't work. And if you're not doing that, then you've deluded yourself because there's no such thing as magic. There's just physics and logic. And a long time ago, we figured out that that magical shit was a primitive, I don't know, archaic fucking way of looking at a world that since then we've completely figured out down to the smallest atomic particle. So really, there's no such thing as magic. I don't believe that, by the way. I was just trying to embody like the, the world. Totally right. And this is interesting that, so that voice, it lives in all of our heads, but it's actually not real and objective reality. And this is what I learned. So this is what I expected the response to be. And it's not what I've discovered, which was very heartening for me, you know, like when I, when I started doing this, I was convinced, look, you know, like, okay, Jason, you know, it's time to grow up. You were into this stuff for a long time, like nobody wants it. Nobody's even interested in the counterculture. It's done the great counterculture revolution of the nineties, you know, the great like asset house, Burning Man, Siberia, you know, like the return of the sixties. It didn't happen. It's not going to happen. It's over. We live in the middle ages again, just deal with it and get a job. And this was basically my attitude. When I began teaching though, I realized that none of that is, this is what I realized. Not only are people incredibly sincere about being interested in this, but also people from all walks of life that you would never, never suspect it's not, there's, the stereotype is not real. And this was me creating a false stereotype. It was me stereotyping. And my students have been incredibly committed, sincere, genuine, rigorous. And I think that this is what I realized, okay, in the last, what, 200 years, or let's just say in Victorian England, there was this anti or the enlightenment, there was an anti spiritualist bias. And for good reason, because I think that we need, you know, I think that, you know, I, I think that we need rigorous and scientific thinking more than ever, please, you know, and at the same time, people know that they're missing the spiritual aspect of life. They don't get it from our, our schizophrenic, you know, technotronic culture right now. And they need it. It's the thing they need, you know, other than human connection, which people also don't experience much anymore. You know, they've gotten rid of organizations and social clubs. They need each other and they need a sense of spiritual connection. And since we've lived now in a time when, you know, religion has basically, religion has more or less gone, you know, it's like people, people have the internet, you know, they're not going to believe stories about Joseph Smith finding gold tablets or whatever or the Bible or things like this, it's just not relevant to people's lives. The moral lessons may be relevant, but in terms of like the literal, you know, a literal truth of religion, it's just, it's not a thing anymore. However, Wait, hold on. It is a thing. It's just diminishing. It's a dimini, it's not like a globally, it's an option. It's an option as opposed to what it was before, which is the controlling structure of reality. Yeah. That's not the case anymore. It hasn't been for a long time. However, just because people throw out, you know, the ideas of organized religion doesn't mean that they're deep yearning for spiritual connection, which is the deepest yearning that people have. It's way deeper than I would say even sex and reproduction is the sense for spiritual connection and meaning that's deeper than it's deeper than the need for survival. And we see this by the fact that, you know, there are so many people would rather, you know, you know, or they, they either are okay with dying because they feel spiritually well or the, you know, or they would rather die than give up their beliefs, you know, this happens all the time. And so what I offer with magic is, you know, basically the deal with magic is it's not a belief, it's not a dogma. It's a set of tools for you to forge your own spiritual connection, your own meaning. I'm not going to tell you what to believe. You know, like I change my beliefs all the time, just to, you know, see what that, you know, what different beliefs are like, but magic is not religion. And it's not science. It's certainly not scientific, although it is empirical and it is experimental. But it's, it's like a toolbox. So somebody comes to me to learn magic. It's not like I'm fucking up on a guru pedestal, like, oh, you must own and drink holy water and all this. It has nothing to do with that. It's basically, it's like, okay, here's a set of techniques that have been drawn from religions and cultures all over the world, whether it's meditation and yoga or ritual or any of these techniques, whether, you know, from Western magic, from NLP, from Buddhism, from shamanism. And my approach has always been the chaos magic approach of just take the tools and give people the tools, use the tools and see what happens. So for instance, yoga, if you meditate for an hour a day, weird shit is going to happen to you and you don't need somebody else to tell you, you know, no one else is going to be able to tell you what that's like. You experience it for yourself and then you draw your own conclusions. And so I think that that's a very honest method of teaching and, you know, it's just here's here. Okay. You want, you want, you want the gear. Here's the gear. Like, you know, plug it in, see what happens, you know, and, and then I teach it in a way that it's, it's safe for people to do that. You know, my feeling with it, with these, these kinds of classes in general is like, if I didn't know you, just being your friend, you enroll in a magic class, which is awesome. But if I didn't know you, I would like, I would have like a real, any class PS, not just you any class, even a P I want to take piano class, I want to take a piano lesson, that there's an automatic weird barrier between me sending the email to my friend who offered to teach me piano. I don't know what that is. It's like a block, like something about taking it to the level of actually engaging with a teacher is we, it's such a commitment. It's such a, it's so much easier for me to like go on Linda.com. It's so much easier for me to, you know, Google how to play Flight of the Bumblebee and then give up in two hours and something that it is to like actually make human contact. So what is that? Well, it's shyness, but it turns out to be, I mean, this is, this is what I say to people, you know, it's like, can you learn magic on your own? Yeah, I certainly did. You know, I had tons of mentors and teachers, you know, from all over, you know, many different traditions and all over the world, you know, from Genesis, or I went to Nepal to Genesis. Yeah. And I went to Nepal to learn shamanism in the Himalayas. I had a Tantric teacher, I have Sufi teachers, all these, you know, lots of teachers for along my entire 20s, I spent learning under many different traditions. But basically what I say to people is, you know, can you learn this? It's like, can you learn this on your own? Yeah. You know, can you learn it from books? Yeah. Can you learn it by trial and error? Yeah. It's going to take you 20 years. Yeah. I mean, it took me a long time, you know, it's going to take you 20 years. If somebody just, it just shows you how to do it and just says, here, do this, and that's the foundational practice, can you learn it in a week? Yeah. And I offer this, and I do, you know, I get people from zero to 60 within a week. I have a class called the Seven Day Magic Supercharger where I do that. It's like, okay, and it's a real problem with magic, by the way, because we used to have this phrase in the 90s, the armchair magician, who is just somebody who just sits there and reads, because you can read endless books and the occult publishers, you know, who I all, I'm friends with all of them and I love them, but they encourage that people should just keep reading, you know, it's their product and it is fascinating to read all this stuff. But people get lost, in a sense, in the same way that when people do a lot of psychedelics, they get lost in the glamour, and it's not the point, you know, it's like, when you really narrow down magical practice, it's not that complicated, and it's not that, I mean, we just did something now, you know, it's like, it's not once you really get it, it's Oh, it was amazing to that was really cool, Jason, just can I talk about it? So Jason has just introduced this non creepy neuro linguistic programming style. I guess you could, what would you call that, like a, a method, a pattern, some kind of patterning to like dial in a specific state of consciousness. And it was really, it was awesome. And it worked, and it was fast. It didn't. It's like the one, one of the methods of teaching that I have encountered, which I actually like is the kind of slow drip, slow, slow drip teaching of like, here's a practice, meditate. Those within that state of consciousness that begins to emerge. Here's some ideas that you can talk about. And within that, there seems to be some very, very slow progression, which I like, because sometimes when it's fast, you can, I mean, we've seen it, man, we've seen it. You can blow your fucking fuse. And I don't know if that, I mean, I think anyone who gets engaged in magic, that's a danger. What do you mean by that? Like be more specific about, well, I mean, we've seen it. With psychedelics, with psych, with anybody who takes the step outside of the main vein reality tunnel. And even if that step is one of, uh, taking up a new, a new hobby, an art form, whatever it is, even if that step is just a mild investigation of the tarot, or even if that step is pretending for a moment that you're in an illusory reality that the way you think things are is completely skewed and warped by your own cognitive intentionally injected into you biases that if you're not ready for that, if you don't, if you're pretending that you're less attached to having your reality spoon fed to you by the news and late night comedy hosts, then you can blow a fuse and you can spiral and spin out. And in that spiraling and spinning out, you can really cause a lot of problems in your family, your community. And I've seen it so many fucking times, not just with magic, with any religion, yeah, with ayahuasca, with DMT, with an open relationship obsession with any nonstandard path. You can spin the fuck out and then end up kind of damaged, you know, I don't mean to like knock magic in general. These are really valid questions, you know, and of course, these are I've certainly seen blowouts. And I've spent a what's the worst blowout you ever saw. Can you talk about it? Well, I've lost a lot of friends to hard drugs, yeah, you know, like lost, lost, either dead or might as well be dead, never heard from them again. And I think that's the main one. But I think that I've obviously put a lot of thought into this because I wouldn't be teaching if I had not completely, I don't want to say lockdown, but it completely organize what I'm doing in a way that makes it safe for people, right? And I don't teach things that would be not safe, specifically. And I put obviously put a lot of thought into this. And that by the way, this is one of the main reasons I teach because magic is now huge, particularly with young women, it's like this gigantic phenomenon as you know, I basically said in my first book, 2005, I said, this is going to happen. It's going to be in the next big youth culture. Wait, can you talk about that? What do you mean with young women? The witchcraft, witchcraft movement is huge. You go to Brooklyn and like every single woman there thinks she's a witch or is, you know, because a lot of people do sincerely practice. But is there an initiation to be? Is there like an official witch or their schools of witchcraft? Like there are schools. I don't think that people are that organized about it. But, you know, certainly there are things like that. But I think that. But oh, but my before I get lost, my point was, you know, one of the reasons that I teach is as harm reduction, right? Because in the same way that like dance safe, right? It's like because people are doing this and it's like, OK, like I have, you know, I've seen it. I've seen I've seen things people you wouldn't believe, you know, you know, I've seen some incredible transcendental, absolutely. I've had unearthly experiences, you know, like all this shit is real, right? Like I've seen things that defy. Any either logic or laws of physics in some cases, but on the other side. And I've also seen. You know, I've certainly seen blowouts and magic, like like many things sometimes seems to attract the best and the worst because it attracts people who are like way out crazy geniuses and then people who just have nowhere else to go and want to drape themselves in some dark and spooky glamour to feel special, which is which is useless. Same with psychedelics, man. I guess you consider psychedelics and magic the same thing. No, absolutely not. So actually in this dovetails into what I was going to say is like so. So in terms of people overhype the dangers with magic and a big part of that is because Hollywood and we've had this conditioning for, you know, hammer horror movies, Lovecraft, like, oh, like the dark arts, you know, it goes back and a pern of films keeps blasting out these shows that are like I loved Midsummer, but it's like a depiction of it's that guy, Ari, he's so talented, but the depictions of the witch. I don't know if he did the witch, but he did what's it called hereditary. I hated that movie, which one? Hereditary. I didn't like either one, but hereditary I particularly felt like was just malicious, you know, it both in terms of actually putting out, you know, an actual demon in that movie. And it just felt like hereditary was like, you mean like in the sense that they actually used it and not a payment on what like to like. Yeah, which is very irresponsible. Was the invocation right on for that demon? Did they do research? No, it's a it's a it's a Hollywood horror movie that has nothing to do with magic, but it but leaves people with this association that then becomes it's like in the same way that when you first start taking psychedelics in the back of your mind, you've got the cop from fifth grade dare class saying like, you're going to go crazy, you're going to jump off a roof and then you might have a bad trip. Yes, you have all that in your head, even though it's not real. It's the same thing with magic in these shitty movies. And it just drives me crazy. But I also felt like not to get off on a tangent, but that movie. It's like so many of these things are like that movie felt like it's like somebody stabs their arm with a pencil and they're like, oh, that hurt. You should try that. Like and then you stab your arm with a pencil and you start bleeding. You're like, oh, that really hurt. It's like, yeah, it's fucked up, huh? Like now we've had this experience together. Right. Anyways. So all all this stuff has been blown way out of proportion. And a big part of that is, you know, like cultural fear and cultural conditioning from Catholicism and other stuff. But let me real quick. Why isn't that big a tree? Why like when I watch the movies where witchcraft in particular, but also paganism gets depicted as a thing where people are going to end up taking your baby or killing you. I always think like these are like real religions. These are real traditions. Why is it OK that these people can be depicted like this? Like imagine if like the identical film were made, but instead of witchcraft, it was Judaism and the depictions were some kind of like hyper bigoted Nazi era propaganda about Jews, that movie would not only would it like never make it to the theater, obviously, but the creators of it would get like fucking deep platformed and vanished. They would be Nazis. Yet when people are showing witchcraft, I really get like, I don't get like buttered about it. But to me, it does seem weird that for some reason the left hand path, whatever you want to call it, traditions, it's completely open game. Yeah, magic is certainly not all left hand path. Most of almost all of what I teach is right hand path. But yeah, I think that, you know, I honestly think that it's cultural pushback because so much. I mean, look at how much traction we've made in the last 20, 30 years in terms of putting out ideas about psychedelics, enlightenment, magic or creating your own reality like that stuff, you know, in the 1990s, that was still hard to come by. And certainly in the 80s, you know, look how much traction has been made. So I think that it's a cultural pushback to kind of shit in the pool, basically. But why though? Why? What's the use that? I know we're kind of off track here, but I am. This is fascinating to me because of a population of people who, you know, like if you have a population of people who know a few things, for instance, that they can create their own experience without somebody else telling them what to do, that they do not need religious intermediaries that I mean, let's face it, if you learn yoga, you can generate more bliss than any product you can buy, any hard drug, any, whatever, water slide park will ever do for you. You just don't need any of that shit anymore. You're not going to buy any of it, let alone people who think that they have, that they're empowered and they have conscious agency and they have a say like that doesn't. Nobody wants that, you know? You know what, man? One of the things that I love many things about you, but the fact that you brought up a water slide park as a blissful example you know what it tells me about you? What? You like water slide parks. I do like water slide parks. Yeah, I do. I haven't been to one since I was a kid either, but they are awesome. I know what you mean. Like if when I'm talking about peak experiences, I go to water slide parks for sure as an example. OK, keep going. My apologies. So I think that having, yeah, totally right. It's like I think that you're saying these experiences are accessible minus buying a ticket minus like, you know, the the worst most disastrous thing for people like God forbid suddenly it became fashionable to repair your electronics and to stitch your clothes. Suddenly it became a fashion to be able to sew, fix your things, fix your shit. This is a this one could collapse the economy. If like the majority of people are like, no, I'm just going to like learn how to solder and how to like fix my equipment and how to code and do mine. And so we would it would decimate the economy. Like it would heal and balance the economy, which would decimate big parts of it because the economy is based on basically humanity over extending way out on a limb that it shouldn't be on. Yeah. But so the answers the original question. Are there dangers with I don't even want to just say magic. Because I actually ironically think that magic is probably the least dangerous spiritual path because it has so much emphasis both on individual discipline and intellectual rigor of analyzing and understanding one's experiences. And discipline and the other spiritual paths very much often lack that they assume that they can get it secondhand from someone else or you just take a drug and have an experience or something like that. Because my question sucks because I'm kind of like someone out of the know because I really am. I haven't taken a focus class in magic, but I'm basically doing the magical equivalent of some dumb, dumb who's like, I heard that if you take karate, you got to register your hands is deadly weapon. That's what I'm doing, basically. These are important questions because because, unfortunately, they're there are culture has left people with those questions. And that's not a mistake. I mean, the magic is empowering. It radically will shift your life. It will turn you into the best version of yourself. It will show you your purpose in life. It will allow you to be the person the universe brought you here to be. Right. And it is incredible. And it, you know, if I was to put one word on it, I mean, empowering on so many different levels and that's that's a little scary. It was always scary to certainly when the church controlled everything and it's it's scary now to our consumerist nihilist, you know, whatever this is, you know, skits, skits, accuracy that we live in now. Skits, accuracy, accuracy, you know, rule by confusion. Fuck. And and, you know, all the information is out there, but everyone's brain is scrambled. That is the best term. Did you make that up? Just now, holy shit. Skits, accuracy. That's what it is. Yeah, it's rule by the fragmented. It's fragments of fragments trying to rule for other fragments. Wow, cool. And magic that's called Karan's on the fragmented attention. And it's the exact metaphysical opposite of the magical state, which is singular one point in consciousness, which you will notice is the one thing that everyone lacks now. Yeah, for sure. Yeah, absolutely. People don't want that. Well, it's like an externalization of a of the obsession with people's thoughts. It's like the the phones externalized our thought obsession. And so now we like look into our phones instead of our thoughts. But it seems like a very similar kind of instinct. Like when I find myself up in my head, you know, whatever running through this thing or that, the programs, it's usually I'm evading the present moment. There's for me, probably not you, but for me, that's like a daydream state. You know, I get like rolled by getting caught in some cognitive vortex. And all of us. I mean, you pick up your phone and just oh, I'm going to look at my email. And then like 45 minutes later, it's like, whoa, what just happened? That I was on Instagram. I was on Reddit. Like, wait, I had no intention to do that. Yeah, that phenomena sucks. That's that sucks. And like, then also what's happening is within the phone situation, which is, by the way, magic. We're it's a sorcery of a type. Well, this this is this obsession with the phone is not just an obsession with like looking or like gathering data that it's also any time chaos emerges. The phones come out as some kind of like weird, I don't know, digital, technological pistol that people pull out of their harnesses and hold up in the direction of chaos. Yes, to separate themselves from their own experience. And like with a deluded concept that if I film the thing that's dangerous, it will reorganize into something that I can control. Now it's the spectacle, like the situations thing. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. But so anyway, yeah, which is why I never do that. But before I lose it, I mean, so that you mentioned you asked about dangers and we're starting to talk about the dangers of modern culture, which are far far outweigh anything you're going to get from any spiritual training. But isn't the modern modern culture magic, though? Isn't it like, aren't we essentially like it? Like when you're taught when I'm listening to you, I'm thinking to myself, here is a magician who is actually doing a thing that I've read about magicians doing and shamans to who is in a kind of battle or a war with other magicians. In this case, the other magicians are the ones who have created the tapestry that makes up mainstream reality, consumerism, materialism, and have cast a very powerful spell on our culture, hypnotizing them into a specific disempowered state of consciousness within which they could be manipulated, whereas what you're putting out there sounds to me like just another form of sorcery, which is in direct opposition to any power structure. Whatever it may be that is putting hypnotic devices or ideas into the world that make people feel like shit. Well, I'm not battling anyone. I'm just sitting here being my being my lovely self. Oh, please. And if people are interested, that's fine. But I'll put it this way. And I think I've said this on your show before, you know, a stage magician is somebody who produces illusions. A real magician is someone who takes illusions away, right? Like she for the destroyer and our culture is is magical. It's pure magic, pure sorcery. I mean, what holds this together anymore? People like people will say things like, oh, it's, you know, like Christianity. It's all Judeo-Christian ethics. Like, what are you talking about? When's the last time you saw a real Christian, right? You go out, it's like this whole damn thing is run by sorcery. What is sorcery? You know, like sorcery is in the technical definition actually is not magic because magic, capital M magic is about raising oneself vertically towards source, towards the divine and becoming your true self and seeing through the bullshit and reconnecting with reality, right? Now, sorcery is the production of illusion. And that's what runs our entire culture. Oh, the ads, Instagram influencers. Like everyone is a fucking sorcerer now. Every Instagram influencer like putting out this illusionary version of self. And then what do people do? It's like, oh, here's a video game. Here's a like, here's something to be distracted with. And our entire I also the other phrase I use, our whole culture, particularly online, is a filth kaleidoscope. We should make those. Yeah, but it's that's Maya, right? Like when has Maya or some sorrow ever been so so directly demonstrated? And now the next thing is that there, you know, the Internet of Thoughts is coming. Our thoughts are going to be networked to more importantly than that. The potential dangers of magic because you teach magic. And so, yeah, why don't we wrap up that? Because by the way, man, I don't mean to be the fucking let's start negative thing. But literally every, how do you say grimoire? Is that how you say it? Grimoire, yeah. Every grimoire I've ever encountered, every magical book starts with a warning passage in the front and I love them. I almost want to do a symbol, just a book of the warnings in front of magical books because they're so awesome and so scary. And every single one of them has within it the same essential structure, which is don't do this unless you're serious. Because if you're not, it's going to blow your fuse. That I think is over exaggerated. But there's two, two, okay. Are there dangers to magic? There are two primary dangers, not just to magic, but really to all spiritual spirituality and life in general. And then, and then a third caveat. So what are the dangers? The first one is drugs, right? I think it's that it's flat out. So here's an example. Right. People look at there's certain, let's say famous magicians. Crowley is a prime example. Jack Parsons, another one, you know, and they say like, oh, you know, these magicians, like, look, look how they ended up. They ended up with destitute lives and just alienating the people around them and look at Crowley, you know, like he died, you know, in semi-poverty. You know, people exaggerate that too. And he ripped all the people off around him. And, you know, he was cruel to his followers. And it's like, motherfucker, you know what causes that behavior? Heroin addiction and cocaine addiction, not magic. Right. Magic has nothing to do with that. Now, did, you know, did, you know, you know, Crowley certainly had enough ego to think that he could cure his addictions with magic, which is just silly. But, you know, certainly it can help, but, you know, it's more than that. So we need to be very, you know, one thing that I really take. Well, I'm sorry. Wouldn't you say it's more hubris? Like it's like the, the shore, the drug addiction was the was the flower growing on the hubris tree. It's like people think they're so powerful that they can like do a thing that historically just destroys lives like anybody who gets into heroin, anyone at this point, who gets into heroin as like basically either one, they're like, I don't care if I destroy my life or two. They're like, you know what? I could do it a few times. I'm the diff, I'm going to be different. I'm going to be the one who had him, who like, I'm going to be burrows. I'm going to wear suits. I'm going to write great fucking poetry. I'm going to live through an old age. There's a lot of people like that. And although, you know, in burrows defensive, you actually read his writing. Everything that he's saying is don't do this. You know, like he's, he's making it so clear, like how awful that lifestyle. And he was an addict his entire life. Because once you're an addict, you're an addict. Yeah. You know, you're not going to not be an addict. You might be able to become an addict to different things. You know, a lot of ex cocaine addicts become fanatical exercise, you know, addicts, things like that. Sure. Once your brain is wired that way, you know, and, and even if you've, even if you're clean, all it takes is one, is anyone who's, who's a recovering alcoholic knows, it's like, Oh, I can have one drink. No, you can't have one drink because one drink leads to the next. And then the whole cycle starts over again. So, you know, in Crowley's case, in particular, he even talks about a diary of a drug fiend. It's just like passage after passage is, Oh, the great magician can, you know, what is a vice for others? He can master it's like, no dude, like heroin's going to get you. So, but the reason I bring this up is not because of Crowley or dwelling on him, but because when people say, Oh, magic will lead to, or when people say anything, let's be specific, what, what did you observe that was actually bad? Okay. Specifically tell me that. Okay. So in Crowley's case, well, you know, and people will usually stop there because they don't actually know the details of the history. People will just say, Oh, Crowley, you know, like how he ended, look how he ended. It's like, well, how did he end? And then they won't even know that I've had this interaction with people. How did he end? Well, he, he spent his final years in a nursing home, a rest home in Hastings. He survived the, which is in England. He survived the, the name of the rest home, by the way, was Netherwood, which I love, but he survived the Blitz and he died in 1947 with students all around him. And, and contrary to belief, he's still, from what I understand, he still had, was taking care of all of the funds for the OTO underneath his bed and did not get into it for drug money at all. He took very, very good care of it and, and what do you have money under his bed? Yeah. But it was for OTO for the OTO, not for him. And he never went into it for heroin. So, you know, people, but people love to play up the, you know, oh, it's the same, the tabloid mentality, you know. So it's like, okay, well, what did you actually observe? Well, yes, did Crowley do some pretty shitty things? Yeah, I've documented them in my John D book that came out. But the question is like, well, what, why? Okay, we need to be very, very clinical about this. Like, why did he behave in certain destructive ways? Was it quote unquote magic? Well, if you look at those periods of his life, he hadn't really been doing that much ceremonial magic, but he was doing a fucking tremendous amount of heroin and cocaine and in his own crackhead universe. And same with Parsons, you know, Parsons obviously came to his life was very short and he died, he blew himself up with fulminative mercury. But if you look at the records, it's not like, oh, the devil came to claim him. It's like, I got you. It's like the dude was probably cooking meth and or at least was on drugs and his hands were sweaty. So he dropped a vial of chemicals that he shouldn't have been handling himself up. It's like, there's always an obvious explanation. So we can't hang that on magic. Well, you can't say like, well, you know, the reason Hunter S. Thompson shot himself, it was because of writing. Yeah, exactly. He writing, writing drives you crazy. Writing will completely lay your life low. If you write, you'll go nuts. It's like, yeah. Yeah. And being a having been a writer for my entire life, you'd be amazed. It's like people have this like, oh, like you're a writer. You must live like a crazy existence. Even Burroughs, by the way, Jen told me this, you know, like Burroughs, people had this idea about, you know, that he was traveling around the world, shooting up heroin, like having sex with rent boys, like all that crazy shit that's in his books. It's like Burroughs life was he sat in his house in Lawrence, Kansas, got up every morning, put on the same gray suit, had the same breakfast, which was, I believe, exactly 11 Ps and a steak cutlet or a pork cutlet. Crazy. And then he wrote all day long. That's what writers do. They write, but, you know, as a writer, people are like, oh, like, you must be a crazy, like, drug addict and stuff like this. Like, no, it's like writers write. That's what they do. And so, but on the other hand, then people will emulate all this bad behavior of writers, like, oh, they want to be Burroughs is a great example. So they'll start doing heroin and think it's going to make them a great writer. Easier to do heroin than to write. That's for sure. Very hard. So it's the same with magic. People, you know, they confuse these things. Okay. So there we go. So we have to, we've paired people's bad life decisions with whatever the particular focus of their existence was outside of the drug addiction. And in the case of Crowley, in the case of Parsons, in the case of so many others, magic was their focus. But to say that magic is the thing that got them hooked on heroin is idiocy. And a focus, both of those guys and most magicians are like, you know, they had a tremendous dozens and dozens and dozens of interests, you know, which is one part of their life. But what is that? I mean, let's like, I know what writing is. What's magic? Like, how would you define magic? I will give you my ultimate definition. But just to wrap that up, I would say that the two, what are the two, what are the dangers of the magic? One is drugs, if you take out the drugs, particularly hard drugs, almost all of what people observe as dangers of magic, just go away. Okay. They just go away. It's the drugs, right? So, so I don't like, I don't think people should combine drugs and magic. Okay. You know, I think people should be very like, you know, zen, munk about it. Are you saying what, you don't mean all drugs, particularly hard drugs. You know, in the case of like these real blowouts like Crowley, it's like in that case, that's obviously heroin and cocaine added to behavior. And either he was really into huffing either, which God knows what that does to you and Parsons also cocaine and amphetamines. So just take that out. And a lot of what you see as wreckage goes away. The second is taking it too seriously and taking it literally. But magic is in many ways, you know, it's a, it's a technique for exploring consciousness. So, you know, and as you know, as a Buddhist, it's like the everything is impermanent and temporary. So people have these visions or incredible, you know, whether it's on through psychedelics or meditation or magic, they'll have these incredible visions of some transcendent, beautiful thing. Yeah. And then they'll decide that that is real. That is religious truth. And they are special. Yeah, that's the thing they take away. I must be special. That's it. You know, and then, and then, then that's it, you know, because that's, you know, people need to be detached and realize that the mind is constantly in a state of flux, you know, like you may have had that experience one day, but you're going to have a different one tomorrow and you're definitely going to feel differently in 10 years. Everything is in a state of change. Gotcha. But people clamp down. It's like a clamped anus that clamps on, I had a vision, therefore I'm special. It's like, it's not going to work out for you too well, buddy. Anyway, so what is magic? Why isn't it going to work out too well? Um, because what is subjectively true for one person, and even subjective truth is a big thing, what is subjectively, here, okay, here's, here's how I'll phrase this science is the discipline of discovering objective reality, right? Meaning this table is solid. Why is it solid? It's like, and that stuff follows rules and can be agreed upon and experimented by, and, and, and is we all share, but material world. Um, religion is a set of dogmas and say, okay, just follow these rules and you will have a good life or go to heaven or it's received from a priesthood class. Art is the creation of subjective experience that you consume second hand. Right. So you create a subjective experience and then you give it to somebody and then they have a roughly approximative subjective experience. Okay. It is not objectively real or true in any sense, but may shed some interesting life on what it means to be alive. Magic is a set of tools for producing one's own subjective truth, right? No intermediary. So with religion, again, religion is subjective, although it pretends to be objective, religion tells you this is what reality is. Um, magic, and I, I purposefully put no overlap between magic and science. And I don't think that they're competitive because magic is about the sub, the subject of world, the, the world of dreams and visions and what you, how you feel on a day to day basis and what you think about yourself and what you want to do with your life and all this stuff. It's like, yeah, you can assemble a picture of that second hand from, you know, listening to, I don't know, lectures on YouTube or somebody telling you what to believe or, you know, art in a sense, but magic is like, it's like, okay, here's the, like, here's the fishing pole, go fishing for your own subjective meaning, you know, and determine your own truth in your own course through life. No, I'm not going to tell, you know, I, I, I, I refuse to tell anyone what to believe, but I do give them tools to figure that out for themselves, which people don't get, they don't get it in school and they don't get it from our culture certainly because that breaks the control structure. Do you, do you think that there's a, like, when we earlier, when I was like snarkly talking about people who were invested in default reality or whatever? Do you, is there, in the same way that there's like a stereotype of someone who practices magic, what, if you did have to kind of start off with like the base substrate of the classically conditioned Western mind, that, that psychological state, how would you describe that? Well, it's interesting. I was thinking about this earlier today. I think the first one is, and this goes back to my own experience of teaching people is it doesn't exist. It's a figment of your imagination. I used to have a name for this person. I called him Dr. Martin, Doc Martin's boots. And he's like the guy that you go into, you go into his office in like a fifties film clip and he's like, the supernatural, huh, that's, that has been disproven. And he puts his Doc Martens up on the, he puts his boots up on the table while smoking a pipe, you know, it's like, we're rational people and just like, you know, stomps on Richard Dawkins, right. And Doc Martens, there you go. That's a terrifying image. Richard Doc Martin. That's what he does on the weekend. Richard Dawkins, Martens. So, OK, so before, OK, let me, I just want to talk about like, I'm just saying like that from my standard normie mind, just like the mind of a person who like is limited, the limited mind, that thing that like, for me, that normie thing manifests in the sense of like, I'll never learn to play music. I could never like learn how to like play songs on the piano. I could never become someone who is good at the piano. There's no reason for me to think that. That's an unexplored concept, but damn, if that wasn't lodged in my brain for the longest time, you know, that's what I think is the quote normie mind is like all those pieces of the, of any individual psyche that's like, you know, maybe you watch like someone doing mountain climbing and you think, oh, I would never do that, but there's a piece of you that wants to do it, but you're like, oh, I would never do that. Why? What is that? That's, that's all right. Let me break this down, because I had some interesting thoughts about this earlier today, and then I'll give you my, my ultimate definition of magic. Um, so what is what you call it normie mind, right? We could call it, let's just put it this way. It's like the majority of people are herd instinct, meaning safety in numbers. Yeah. And, and they will always be that way. And it makes total sense, right? So the majority of people will believe whatever the majority believes, right? Just without questioning it, because in their mind, if they deviate from that, it's like leaving the herd and a wolf might get them. Yes. Right. And this has been like literally true for most, and it is to some extent, it's still true, right? For most of human history, it's like safety is in numbers. So there's a tremendous amount of incentive psychologically and physically for people to be essentially to go along with whatever the dominant idea is. Now, this is very dangerous because it turns out that, you know, dictators, for instance, have understood this. Yeah. And they've understood that, you know, if I just stand up and I'm the scariest, tallest, biggest person, the majority of people will just parrot what I say, because they feel that they'll keep me safe, that I'll keep them safe. Yeah. Rather, you know. Daddy. Yeah. And, and, you know, so the, you know, here's the thing about America in 2019. The normie mind, what is the normie mind? I mean, like the normie mind is basically the American middle class, right? It's I don't want to rock the boat. I just want a safe job. I just want my family to be safe. And I just want things to go okay. And, you know, that used to be more Christian. Now it's less Christian, but that used to involve a component of going to church on Sunday, keep them out of hell, which, which frankly, I wish, you know, that would be healthier for people to do than to go to be on the internet. But, but that's kind of the thing. It's just, and, and that has by and large been what's kept the middle class safe and strong in this country. Now the middle class is currently disintegrating. And here's the deal with America. The, what is the middle class? Like, what is the power of the middle class or the normie class? What is it? Uh, what, what does it rest on? You could say the economic success of America, but that's not actually the case. Right. So, you know, in our lifetimes, we've seen the American middle class go from like this 80s ideal of like, you know, everyone's rich, you know, like, and we're living in the suburbs. And the, you know, kid, like what you see when you watch ETI, I was going to say ET, but yeah, Poltergeist, exactly. It's like, and, and that was a beautiful time in a way. But so you could say like, well, what was that predicated on? Well, you know, like the market was up. Things were really good. It's actually not the case. Certainly it hasn't been for a long time because America is so in debt now. Like literally, you know, there was a phrase I heard recently that is, um, um, China lends America spends. Right. So America is now so in debt that were other governments, particularly China, to just call in Chomsky says this, if other governments were to just call in the IOUs and call in the debt, we would be bankrupt overnight. There'd be nothing left. The only thing that prevents them from doing that is American military superiority. Holy shit. Right. So the only reason they don't do that is because our military is the strongest, which is why we spend so much going into more debt to keep the military strong. So that means that what is, what is the normie mind based on? It's based on the atomic bomb, right? It's based on nuclear supremacy. Whoa. That's what creates the normie, the quote unquote, normie mind. Now, and this is not a, now that's neither here nor there, but now we're in a situation where America is losing primacy in the world. It's losing to an ascendant China. Um, it's hard to tell what's going on in Europe. It's hard to tell what's going on with Russia or potentially an emerging Eurasian block. Um, this is a scary situation because now being, and we see this now in the political, everyone's like, Oh, you know, everything is so extreme left and extreme right. Like, why can't people just be centrist? You know, why can't we all just be rational? Well, it turns out that right now the center is probably the most dangerous position to be in because it's a place where people have all these assumptions. Assumptions like everything will be fine. If I just go along to get along, the payments will have the bank payments will happen, like everything will be fine. As long as I don't rock the boat, everything will be fine. Yeah. But now we're entering into the world where that's no longer true. And, and, um, you know, you don't need to look very hard to see that. You know, it's, nobody can even expect, you know, the idea that you could get a job right out of college or that you could work at the same company your whole life. That doesn't exist anymore. The baby boomers, many of them were able to buy a house with a high school education and a trade job and they had unions. Yeah, it doesn't exist anymore. Right. So, um, the things that protect our, our country specifically in our culture widely from chaos, which broadly speaking were the middle, strong middle class, a healthy fifth of state, healthy journalism and some type of spiritual or some type of religious framework that held people into an ethical way of seeing the world and, and a group cohesion. All those things are gone. So the safeguards are all gone. That's a scary, dangerous and precarious position. And because of that, it's no wonder that, uh, the world is now filthy with wizards because in a, in a, in a chaotic situation like that, and, and most of them are pseudo wizards, you know, in a chaotic situation like that, um, people will look for anything. And, and that's not necessarily bad. When I lived in New York in the 2000s, I met a lot of people from Russia. Really, really smart people on par. I would say that Russians are far more intelligent than Americans by far. Really? Yeah. I mean, why? Cause cause you know how smart you have to be to survive that level of hardship. You know, there's no, there's no, uh, there's no padding. There's no like, they're like, they're the Fremen or something. They're like, you know, we're the, we're like the Harkonnens or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. They're the Fremen. They're like living in this like insane world from that they've become super tough, but there's an interesting thing I noticed cause the people, the Russians I met were obviously, you know, in, in a lot of them were in the yoga or meditation world or, um, spiritual, spirituality in general. And one thing that I noticed is in the Soviet Union, obviously much like China, um, religion was, uh, frowned upon if outright banned, right. And so when the, when the, when the Soviet Union fell, an interesting thing happened, which was the huge explosion of spirituality. So people could, for instance, go back to the Russian Orthodox church, which has now become largely part of the state apparatus in, you know, Russia has now become traditionalist Orthodox Christian instead of communist, which is interesting. Uh, but you know, all spiritual, you know, like the huge interest in, in Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism in India and yoga and like really serious interest. Like when I was in India, tons of Russians there, tons. And I think that what, what the deal there is, is when everything is uncertain, people look for stability any way they can get. And what, what magic and true esoteric spirituality do is they give you stability by giving you two things. One is understanding that no matter what happens, you can take it. You have, you are empowered to handle it. Um, I've been living in total chaos for 20 years and I thought no one was interested. Then the world fell into chaos and the next thing you knew, all these people were at my campfire while wanting some cooked beans. It's like, okay, kind of sit down, let's have a talk. But, um, the other is that by understanding or interacting with, let's say the laws or the structure of reality itself, you build your foundation and your stability on something which is far more transcendent than whatever the temper, temporary political situation is, which is always, uh, perilous. So I think that when, when empires crumble, people go to magic to, for safety, for understanding, for security, for empowerment. We saw it as the British empire fell. People went into spiritualism and theosophy when Russia fell, people went into the cultism and we're seeing it now in America, in America. Like all young people are interested in this now because they know they're missing this part of themselves. They're missing their soul and they feel totally vulnerable. I mean, I think that for the average millennial, the idea of buying a house would be far more outlandish and ludicrous than the idea that magic might be real. Wow, what are you talking about? You know, right. So, but do you think it's also, it's not just a reaction to a kind of chaotic world, but to me, not just in now and not just in the past, but if you study the history of a lot of empires, I mean, not the Roman empire, I guess, but like what you do find in the Soviet Union, in early American history, the witch burnings, the prohibition on psychedelics is a concerted effort by the state or by power structures to eliminate any kind of contact with fundamental goodness and all the various forms it takes. So that thing that magic, I think, introduces people to is the thing behind the chaos. It's not just like, you know, oh, yes, there's chaos. It's like, but look, here's another thing. There's something here that maybe you don't need to throw your imaginary anchor in this ridiculous harbor of stale symbols that has been constructed by people trying to sell you coffee to feel okay, that in fact, there is a way to navigate the entire ocean and the PS, the harbor wasn't real anyway. There isn't, there never was any kind of stability. There never was any kind of safety. There was just a hypnotic trance that you subscribed to or that you were born into. And that to me is the, to me, it's like, it seems that there's some kind of trance state that there is either not the resources anymore to keep people hypnotized in this specific popular culture trance state. Maybe it's technology giving people access to other forms of information. And yet also we're looking at the relaxing of laws that were keeping people completely disconnected from transcendent states. Now you can what, you could just like literally order powerful marijuana that will put you into a mystical state if you eat it. It might not be the happiest mystical state if you're not prepared for it, but not just that. I can go online and, you know, connect with you if I want to. And like, you know what I mean? All I'm saying is that it appears a shoddily constructed dam is now breaking apart. And in that water is being released, energy is being released, and those energy spikes can be plugged into- Yeah, so you better learn to surf because otherwise you're going to drown. Yeah. And I think that, and I'm completely serious about that. And I think that most people throughout the world don't have the luxury of ever having had that illusion of, oh, everything is fine. Americans are largely unique in that outside of some of the first world European countries. It's like, and even there, not so much. It's like Americans have had this cotton, gauzy delusion that everything is fine. Yeah. Because we don't get droned because there's enough to eat. There's always enough, you know? And so now we're having beginning. Well, I would say we're having a rude awakening, but I don't think that's actually the case. I think people are more narcotized than ever. We know that the world is dying, and yet we have infinite filth kaleidoscope. We have infinite, any electronic distraction you could possibly want is there. Any pornography, anything ever entertainment, ever recorded in world history. And if you want to make music, you want to listen to music, anything you want. A Hakim Bey said, I think in the 80s, or I think in the 90s, he had this very pointed comment where he said that the electronic world and the internet are a consolation, they're a consolation prize for the death of the environment, for the natural world. Okay. So here we are in a world where the very, like, I don't know what you call it, the very like, we live in a society. The philosophical, yeah, we lived, but the many of the philosophical foundations of this like ridiculous temple that people have been living in, assuming somehow they're going to be kept safe by the corporations that are in this like weirdly parasitic slash maybe symbiotic relationship with them, are starting to be eroding, falling apart. And many people are feeling just a general kind of malaise, a feeling of kind of profound, diffused confusion, and just a general sort of like, as you were saying, a sense of being a very tiny, drifting bit of kaleidoscopic filth and a schizocracy. And so, so within that, people are sort of suddenly scrambling to try to find something that isn't a shoddily constructed shit temple made of cups with corporate logos on them, some way that they can connect with something that isn't so easily knocked over by the winds of chaos that have been blowing around the planet since day one. So now what is the definition of magic? Definition of magic. So magic is about taking illusions away, right? So there's two, yes, schizocracy, right? So we live in, you know, like the classic Buddhist phrase maya, you know, or samsara, you know, or the black iron prison or mal kuth or all these different terms that different religions have for it. We live in an illusion, right? But let's be more specific about that because that's not very helpful, right? What do we live in? We live in the collective, the total collective of all of the minds of everyone on the planet, right? And now that's even more tangible than ever because of electronics, basically create, you know, in the nineties, people are like, oh, in the future, we'll all be buddhas and we'll all be telepathically connected. Well, here you go, right? Like it's happened now with technology, with our phones. We're instantaneously connected to everyone and that will only increase, you know, as they put these satellites up and bring the entire world online. So the environment that we live in is the mass mind of the entire planet, right? And the individual mind is enough to deal with, right? So it's like, so if you meditate, the more you meditate, the more you begin to realize that this is the illusory nature of all of this, and not just illusory, because I don't even like that. It sounds too mystical, just like the bullshit nature of everything, like people's bullshit, their games, their drama, it's all of it is, but just turn on the news and look at what did, what did, you know, what did Trump say now? You know, it's like, it's all bullshit. But what is it? Maybe bullshit is not helpful. You know, what do human beings do? Human beings are engaged with making meaning and communicating, creating meaning. Human beings are the time-binding animals. They create stories, right? So spiders weave webs, snails build shells, and human beings come up with bullshit stories to explain reality, right? Well, they're not all bullshit. They're all bullshit, right? Well, I mean, I mean, some of them are entertaining at least. Well, but they're still bullshit, right? Bullshit. They have aesthetic value, but that's it. Like Game of Thrones. Right, right. So, what I'm saying is we can't just, I don't, I have a negative connotation with bullshit. Like, I agree, we're spinning stories, spinning these incredible webs of symbols. Some of them are like, well, amazingly beautiful, though, you know, why are they bull, why is it bullshit? Well, it's not, it's arbitrary, right? It's just a way of, our entire life, we've believed arbitrary stories because we thought that they had enough explanatory power to keep us safe. When you're a kid, you believe your parents' stories because if you don't, you think you're going to die, right? And your parents, in theory, are there to create a story that keeps you safe, right? But then you grow up and you realize it was just a story, but hopefully you have the maturity at that point to realize why that was necessary, right? I mean, that's not a fundamental thing, though. Like, there's some parents who do this, they, I would assume there's a way of like, relaying some, I don't know, man, like, I know it, I think that a great deal of what we experience is not other people's bullshit story. It's our bullshit story, which isn't amalgam, I guess, of all of the bullshit stories in the crockpot of our mind blasted out onto this screen of phenomena. And that's it exactly, right? So what is magic? Magic is the assault on the Great Magician. Magic is the assault and the storming of the Tower of Mayan, the Great Magician, the he who produces the illusion. Oden. No, no, Oden's fine. Okay. But what is the great, who is the Great Magician, right? So if you meditate, let's say you go out to the desert and meditate for 10 days, which I recommend anyone do. You realize that the thing that controls you, who is the magician that creates your universe? Is it Rupert Murdoch now retired? Is it Donald Trump? Is it whoever controls, you know, the electronic apparatus? Like, who is it? Like, particularly beginning magicians, people who are just getting into spirituality, they get into conspiracy theories and looking for, Oh, who has actual control over this? Yeah, what they don't realize is what they're actually looking for. Who who creates this illusion? Could is it all these shadowy figures out there? Or might it just be that voice in your head that says it's you? The voice in your head that says, Oh, I feel good today. I don't feel bad today. All those people probably don't like you. You're not doing well enough. You really should be working harder. Why aren't you asleep? Why are you? Why? Why haven't you woken up yet? All of this stuff, the thing that tells you that cousin and the thing in your head that constantly narrates the story of who you are and what's going on, that you believe your entire life, the hypnotist in your head, the magician in your head that is narrating this reality to you. This time, the chocolate chip cookie, this time, is going to really make you feel good. You know, like every fucking chocolate chip cookie, you know, I'm going to eat it. It's going to be gone in a millisecond and all the whole experience is like less than a whip it, but you keep fucking doing it. And that chocolate chip cookie, the ones singing the song of the cookies, who is that? The chocolate chip wizard? The wizard of chocolate chips, the person who tells you fucking that. No, the fourth beer is the one that you need. Let's have one more drink. That'll be good. One more drink for sure. This will be the time that one extra drink really made you feel better. It's the prison warden inside, the captain side. So here's what magic, magic is the quest for reality. Now, reality is fine. Reality is perfect and unchanging and always has been and always will be. We live in a, people always ask me like, oh, show me some magic, bro. Show me some magic. It's like, they want to see a miracle or something like that. It's like, motherfucker, like what do you look at? Look, look at this. Like what is the universe? Like no one understands it. No one can explain it. What is the universe, but a rabbit pulled out of a hat and the greatest inexplicable miracle that we could ever hope for. And yet, and somehow, despite all odds, it seems to keep going and it seems to all work out in the end. We didn't have nuclear war in the 80s or the 70s. We easily could have. Everything worked out. And you know, we're constantly anxious that it's not going to. Reality is just fine. The problem is that nobody ever contacts reality or sees it because they're either hypnotized by projections of others' minds or ultimately at the end of the day, the thing in their head, the voice in their head that they think is them, the hypnotist inside, the false self, the ego, this is entirely the Buddhist point. The voice that says, oh, you know, oh, I'm so miserable, you know, oh, I'm 45 and my children are dead, you know, or something, you know, this was the whole point of Buddhism was just snap out of it. It's not you. The thing you think is you is not you. Yeah. Right. It's a perceptual trick created by the brain to explain its own sensory input. Okay. And we're hypnotizing to thinking that it exists. It's just, it's like a perceptual filter created by the brain. So you're saying magic is an assault on that filter? Yes. As is yoga and meditation. They're too separate. They're two different means to do the same thing, which is to get the mind to stop. People. Let me stop you there. My understanding of it, of the practice of meditation is not to make the mind stop. Though David, who I've been working with, has said there is a way to do that, like that is a path to do that. But it's more of a familiarity with the thing that I formerly called my identity. It's more of a sort of opening up a space within which the whatever you want to call this being, what did you call the magician? What did you call? Mayan. Whatever you want to call it. The ego is too glib. Sure. But you can watch. I like Mayan way better. It's where it's creating a space within which there is a fearless opening up to the many strange rituals this cognitive Mayan is doing within your life, which is, for me, the discursive thought patterns, the habitual identifications with specific types of people, the constant sorcery, throwing out constant webs of illusion and sorcery. Yeah. And just the very act of just watching that, the seeing the magic show, admitting it's a magic show, and just watching it causes the exact same thing to happen with this type of sorcery or magic that is when you go to watch a magic show, which is just if you just allow yourself out of the, you know, it's so fun to watch a magic show and pretend that the person is doing actual quantum breaking of the laws of physics. And it's one of my favorite YouTube genres is people on YouTube. There's a whole genre of YouTube videos where people are saying street magicians are actually minions of Satan using true magic to do their spells. And it just makes it that much more exciting. But anyway, what I'm saying is all you have to do when you're at the movie, the magic show, whatever the thing is, is like just touch the ground with your feet and be like, yeah, I don't know how they're doing it, but it's definitely not real magic. And then the illusion seems to be dispelled. Well, that's a very Buddhist. That's one approach. That's a, that's the Buddha, a Buddhist approach, right? And this turns out to be, and it was a, you know, an interesting insight of a Buddha, which is simply that, and I'll just talk from my own experience, it's simply that if you just take the observer position and sit back and watch and allow the thing to be what it is and watch it change while understanding that it is itself inherently impermanent and in a sensual meaning, it has no essential nature to use Buddhist language, then it kind of goes away on its own. It's kind of like you starve it of attention or starve it of reaction is a better way of putting that. So that's one approach. It's only, it's only one approach. It's the Buddhist approach. There's tons of approaches. That's right. I was trying to create like a, that's as I've been taught, but this thing you're saying is you're calling it an assault on this sort of like, I don't know what you call like a cognitive wisdom tooth or something. This like kind of like it's structure of identity that people have like become or being tortured by. You're saying this is like a methodology to attack this thing, to obliterate it, to annihilate. Yes. I'm being very Borosian. Storm the reality studio, but it's true. I mean, it's like, you know, there's two ways to- Storm the reality studio? Yeah, that was a Borosian Geisen phrase. So there's multiple methods here. It's like, you know, the meditation is the reduction of the mind to zero, whereas magic is the creation of the, the inverse opposite of the thing to reduce it to zero. Whoa, I'm going to need a, I need to find a calculator in my reality studio to mate. Well, it was very simple, right? It's like, so meditation, look at meditation, right? It's like meditation is one minus one equals zero, which is you take the mind and you reduce its input to nothingness and it's zero. Magic is one plus negative one equals zero. Right. So you create the equal and opposite illusion to blow the whole thing up. So anyways, we're getting into theory here, but so this is practically, what does this mean? People come to me to learn magic and I show them reality. And this is why I always, you know, there's so many people running around in our world right now who have realized that it's trendy to be into these things and they, it's always been this way and they deck themselves in the right jewelry and say the right things and read the right books and say, you know, talk about astrology or, you know, act like Stevie Nicks or like whatever it is, you know, and, or like, you know, like, you know, you know, like they're in a metal band or whatever, like Crowley. That's true though, but it's always been that way, particularly LA, you know, but it's like act like Stevie Nicks, you know, witchy, but I know exactly what you're talking about. And it's the same with the spiritual world where people think that if they wear white and beads and all that, then they'll be more spiritual. It's like, no, no, these are, these are just techniques. They're tools, you know, you're getting attached to it and building an identity around the tool. But people have all these weird ideas about magic. They'll think, you know, oh, you do the right primora and the astrology and the, this and that, and then you get power and, you know, and like it's like, and you're a special person and you have insights and now people are turning it into an identity category, which is insane. But, but that's no different than psychedelics. Well, exactly. It's inevitable in a way. Like suddenly psychedelic or taking psychedelics, at one point was like a form of navigation through the outer realms of our psyche or the subterranean depths or however you want to fucking put it. And then it went from that to becoming a fashion statement. And it's like, it's no longer a thing about, oh, no, I want to like get into my DNA to see if I could like somehow decode the epigenetic race memories in there to like, I'm going to fucking like use this as like a thing. It's a tail feather to make me special. I love to eat mushrooms. I do my ayahuasca rituals. I go down to the, I know a great frog venom dude, I'll connect you. This kind of thing, you know what I mean? It's an inevitability. So please. It is. And what it really is, is you haven't cured, you know, what, what are these things? They're, they're, they're tools, they're techniques, they're, they're strong medicine for strong problems. Right. And I hate using the phrase medicine because people use that for psychedelics and it's really fucking pretentious. But I'm not talking about psychedelics. I'm talking about what are these techniques? These techniques are for self healing. Let's put it broadly speaking, but at the deepest, most fundamental level. So what is that when people take on the glamour of it? It's, you haven't, you haven't cured your disease. Your disease has decided to wear the clothes of you, the, of the cure. The disease has now masked itself as the cure so that you allow it to perpetuate and it becomes even worse now. And that's what spiritual bypassing is. That's what people, there's nothing worse than people being in that tunnel of being spiritual materialism and being more and more spiritual for 20 years. Like, no, no, no, it's a tool. It has a point. Use the tool and then discard it. You don't need it after that point. Right. Like it's about fundamental change, but instead people take on the identity of the person who is in process. And we know people like this who are like, you know, they're always having one breakthrough after the next for 10 years and nothing ever changes. It's a cargo cult. It's like the, it's the difference between going to the hospital, you have appendicitis, the doctor takes out your fucking appendix, you recover for however long it takes to recover and you feel better versus putting on a fake hospital bracelet, a hospital outfit, a bandaid where the cut would have been, and then pretending that you just had an appendectomy. These are two completely different things. One of them you're going to get more fucking sick. And also you're going to get invested in the deception. That's a thing. That's the problem is it's not just that like it's easier to wear spiritual clothes. It's, I'll tell you this, it's fucking easy to buy modular synthesizers. It's easy. If you have money, you just go to perfect circuit and buy them, but learn to play the motherfuckers. Please, that's the hard part, which is why you can get really caught up in like buying musical gear and getting it all set up. But you realize I'm not making songs at all. So yes, I hear what you're saying. It's like, this is one of the tricks, but let's get to the core. I take one of your classes. What's the first couple of days going to be like? What does that mean? You say you show reality. Like what is that? Well, I teach everything. I mean, you can take classes on everything from ceremonial magic to astral travel. I teach all the wacky stuff too. I love that stuff. You said you show reality. What is that? Here's what I mean by that. So people have this idea. People have all these ideas about magic. There's no governing body. There's no peer review. So unfortunately, we've been in a situation where anybody can say anything about magic and people believe them because they don't know what it is. And it's been a forgotten cultural thing. Now it's becoming big and everyone can come out of the world work saying this, that and the other about magic and people like, oh, however, the damn thing is a precise science. Like it is a precise thing. If it's magic capital M, meaning the Western esoteric tradition, there is a set series of points that need to be gone through. And so, and people will come up and they'll have these ideas about, oh, astrology, you can get archetypes, mythology, this vision I had a dream. It's like, that's all the mind. That's the sorcery of the mind, right? What my approach to magic is, okay, like, we're not even going to talk about magic. Here's what we're going to do. You're going to sit down and learn to hold still without moving for an hour. And then you're going to learn to keep your breath steady down to, let's say, one or two minutes per breath for that hour. And then you're going to train your mind to hold single-pointed focus. And until you can do that, don't be talking to me about magic. Then we'll talk. And this is the critical point in that, that everyone from the Kabbalists to the Hindus will talk about, like you talk about, for instance, because this confuses people, you look at the meditative traditions, like Buddhism or Hinduism, and you hear them talking about non-dual states and the silence of the mind and just being enlightened and present in reality. And then you look at that and you're like, well, how does that jibe with all this other shit? Like, there's all this astrology and all this ritual stuff and people saying, you know, gods and spirits and dreams and channeled writings. It's like, how does that jibe? The answer is really simple. They're just different levels of reality. So you have basic material reality. Then the next layer up, we could broadly call the astral plane, which is the level of imagination and dreams and vibes and, you know, empathetic feelings and telepathy and the cities and all of that. That's something you see passing out the window from the freeway on your destination, right? But unfortunately, people, it's like the story and let me rephrase this and make this even simpler. As the mind begins to quiet through discipline, you go down strata. You go down the strata of discursive and logical thought, and that takes a long time to break through, a long time, take years, less if you have good techniques and guidance, right? And discipline is the most important. Nothing replaces that. Once you get down, once you file down the discursive mind and you get past normal waking consciousness, then you get into the lower strata. And the lower strata of the mind are what they produce things like dreaming the dream state, which by the way is always operative during the day, not when you're asleep. It's just that you're not perceiving it because you're focused on the discursive. Once the discursive goes away, the dream state emerges into the mind and that's when people start getting loopy, right? So you've got that. You've got the level of intuition of what appear to be often appear to be telepathic messages from other people. It's like, you know, this meditator's experienced this stuff. But it's just more bullshit. As same with visions, people start to experience visions and things like this, particularly if they have extended sensory deprivation through meditation. They'll experience visions of past lives, they'll experience visions of who they could be, they could experience, they experience deep, seemingly profoundly meaningful releases about traumas from life. It's still the mind doing shit, right? And this is very hard because it's like, as the mind becomes more and more threatened, it becomes more and more seductive and it's marketing. It becomes more and more like, well, what about this? It keeps sucking you in. And so what happens in the majority of cases of people who think they know about magic is they've gotten lost somewhere along the way and whole cultures, you know, it's like shamanic culture is essentially just never got past that point. There's not necessarily anything wrong with that. It's just that the total goal is to get past that into the silence of the mind at which point, then you begin to get into what are classically called enlightenment stages. And that's an even more dangerous territory because then you start to think that you know something. And there's lots of, you know, the Buddhists talk about genres and, you know, there's levels of Samadhi and Hinduism and things like this. But, you know, if you look at our culture, you know, in no time in history has it ever been easy to do this. And the majority of human history, this was reserved for priesthood class and initiates, right? The Ellicenian history, you know, it was reserved for an elite. Now that's not the case. Now all the information is out there, you know, and I've worked very hard to facilitate that process in the time that I've been alive, but it's been ongoing for a long time. But now, even though we have access to the information and the techniques, which is fairly unique in world history, as far as I know, we now not only have to deal with the backtrack of our minds, which is more than enough to deal with, but we are immersed in the sea of everyone's interconnected thoughts. And I would submit at the very least, whether one is interested in enlightenment or not, I would submit at the very least, the ones, and I feel like this is fairly incontrovertible, one success in life is directly tied to how well you can focus. And we live in quicksand right now where people are just, they're completely destroyed between the ears. They can't hold one single train of thought from one moment to the next, you know, let alone do something like maintain single-pointed focus. So the tools, we live in an interesting time where, yes, the world situation is very precarious, but even more than that, we live in a very, very unique time where all of the information and techniques are there and there's friendly people such as myself who are happy to walk you through them to save you time. That's never been the case ever. And yet, the back drag, the impedance to making spiritual progress has never been more severe. You know, we've never had phones that have push notifications. You know, we've never been expected to be on all the time answering emails every second, waking second of the day. We've never had, you know, infinite electronic virtual reality. You know, our world now is a virtual reality. Forget the actual virtual reality headset. The whole thing's a virtual reality. If you just go out onto the street and you look at all these corporate chain restaurants, corporate restaurants, restaurants are virtual realities. Our world is a virtualized thing. Yeah, we're living in a hypnotic maze that is selling smaller mazes that are equally hypnotic. It's like maze with a maze with a maze. And not only that, people love getting lost in the maze. I was just watching this video game review for some video game. I don't remember what it was called, but the guy was like saying like, you know, that feeling you get that feeling when you get lost in a video game, you know, that special feeling. I haven't had that in a while. But this game, it did it. And it's like, Oh, fuck, you mean hypnosis, you know, that feeling of being completely hypnotized by technology. I'm building a tolerance. And finally, a game has come along to keep me in that state of addiction and addicted state. And I love it. This is what the reviewer, he didn't say the addicted part. But yeah, so here we are wandering in a maze that it has within it. It's basically like, imagine a fucking technological maze that was wrapped up in time that within the maze were actually paid entrances to other fucking mazes that had inside of them access to even deeper mazes and deeper mazes. And then this is where we're at. Wandering through this insane, beautiful, hypnotic maze state. And it sucks. Who the fuck wants to have you ever gone in a hedge maze? I have. Have you gotten lost in one? No, it sucks. Like when it actually happens, when you get lost in the fucking maze that looks so cool on the shining or whatever, you're like, I went out of here. This is bullshit. Why did I even go into the stupid, boring ass green series of shit tunnels? I've got a pee. Where's the bathroom? Why did I do this? This sucks. This seems to have happened to most of us only in this case. We don't know we're in a maze. We think it's civilization. Right. And you're saying, well, there is, if you really wanted to no longer be wandering through this fucking dumb maze or confusing maze or heartbreaking maze or ultimately unsatisfying maze, there might be an exit. But how do we know you're not just running another maze? You don't. I would be intellectually dishonest to claim that I knew anything, but I will say this, that we have been assured throughout all human history by those who have done the work that meditation is the path towards awakening. And that has been shown to be incontrovertibly true in my life and with a lot of people that said it is questionable. Ken, what we're talking about is it is questionable at any time in history, how many people have ever actually done the work. And by done the work, I mean, like put in the time to actually make some type of attainment. And it's a long, you know, it's faster if you get someone to show you, but you know, it takes time. Nobody wants to do it. I mean, that's the, to me, that's what I love about it. Because they're addicted, right? It's like, this is, what is Buddhism? You know, like, for instance, it's like, you know, as you know, if you hang around Buddhist circles, you meet a lot of ex addicts, right? There's a lot of recovering addicts in Buddhism. Buddhism and magic is not Buddhism, although it certainly takes techniques from it. Buddhism is largely a process of breaking addiction, right? But it's breaking the ultimate addiction, which is just all sensory experience, right? It's the incarnation. And it is that very like sober, you know, humorless sober attitude, right? I don't think they're humorless. Well, not all of some are, you know, not all of them. But if they aren't, if they do have humor, it's usually gallows humor on the surface of like a vast, you know, gaping void of nothingness. But magic is, let me just put it this way, right? Magic is dehypnosis. And, but people have these ideas, again, inherited from pop culture and these weird 60s eddies about things. It's like, oh, you know, you just need to overcome your ego. First of all, the egos are very modern terms created by Freud. It's very unspecific as well. Also, and we know, you know, particularly from Buddhism, that taking such an aggressive attitude towards oneself is not very healthy. But it is certainly to dehypnotize yourself from illusion, but not to make yourself less. It's not this Christian idea of, you know, flagellating yourself or like, oh, I'm so worthless, you know, that people got from Christianity and it's now inherent in our culture, inherent at every level of our culture, because it's still a Christian culture, you know, Judeo-Christian culture, despite the fact that we've shifted all that to kind of like a modernism, consumerism and so on, but still the same impulse. What if it's, what if the dehypnosis is from the, you're dehypnotizing yourself from your own powerlessness, because like you were saying earlier, the story you tell yourself about, oh, I'm just one person, I'm just so small, I can't do anything. I always screw everything up, like that, that's not you. What if the dehypnosis is to dehypnotize yourself from the illusion of powerlessness, you know, and as Stuart Brand said, you know, it's like, I think it was Stuart Brand said that, you know, we are, we are as gods, we might as well start acting like it. Well, let me stop you there, because I want to, this is where I get stuck, I get, I've hit this place on psychedelics, I've hit the, it's when you don't take psychedelics usually, but you, you have this one last residual sliver of identity that's like clinging to the pre-merging state that can happen through psychedelics that is very temporary, but still can be quite profound if you're super compressed into your identity. It also reminds me of one of my favorite moments in dreams, which is, I have, I have them every once in a while where you're having a shitty dream, and then suddenly you remember, oh, this is a dream, I can wake up, and it's a really big relief if you're being chased by something, it's a great relief to have that in a dream, it's wonderful, it's freedom, you know, you're like, oh, I'm not going to get devoured by a wolf, I'm not actually in some kind of disastrous absurd situation, it's a dream, and then within that realization, there's power if you decide to stay in the dream, all kinds of all kinds of ridiculous things you can do once you like start lucid dreaming, it's a blast, but then there's the problem, which is that, well, also it's just a dream, you're just dreaming, it's really not much of anything at all. Now, that's okay in a dream because you're going to wake up into this dream, but in this dream, when you've hit that point of realizing like, shit, man, should I, I'm not saying this is even possible, but should I levitate, should I walk through a wall, should I translocate, should I develop some telepathic ability, should I start inducing specific changes in my world and community and life that are profoundly accelerating and are going to push me into some alternate dream where I'm more powerful, more successful, more whatever, that's going to be exciting for a second, but then I also have to face the truth, this is just a dream too, that means everyone I know, everything I love, all that I've encountered, and every single important thing, all the books I've read, it's just as empty and phantasmal and ultimately, I don't know, how would you say, opaque as a dream, meaning that the first rush, I think, which is something that comes from magic, is going to be immediately followed by another thing, which is like, yeah, you got to say goodbye to the whole shit kaleidoscope, and even though you think you've earned the shit kaleidoscope, or even though you think the shit kaleidoscope is your connection to your family, everything you've loved, it's just a shit kaleidoscope. Well, you say just, but this is the thing, right? By the way, I don't mean a shit kaleidoscope, I'm using your terms, I think it's a kaleidoscope kaleidoscope, but I don't know what the fragments are in there, they're beautiful though, if it's shit, so what? The dream is worth preserving, right? And this is a critical point. Now, why am I sitting here talking to you instead of doing what I should have done, which is just blipping out of existence somewhere in the Himalayas in 2010, when I had the damn chance to do so? Yeah, why? Here's the deal. People will get this idea of a spirituality, like it's an escape, or they're escaping from something, or they're waking up into something, and kind of what you're describing is that there's a certain feedback loop that happens, like when you take a camera and point it at the TV, right, that's plugged into, where it creates this feedback spiral, which is, oh, what about this, and then this, and then I'm waking up, and that's, again, it's discursive thought, it's the mind doing shit before quieting. Eventually, I'll just say that I've come to certain conclusions, because they don't know if they're the same ones that everyone should have. This is where I'm at now, in my thinking about it. Eventually, one is forced by the path in one by life, and by one's life, to simply be what one is, right? And there's no escape from that. It's like you just have to, because it's not just surrender to the mind, and it's certainly not trying to merge back into the universe, you know, as if such a thing could even be possible. It's accepting what you are and not trying to fidget away from it, right, which yoga powerfully demonstrates at the physical level, just be, just let it hurt, stop trying to make it not hurt, let it hurt, just let it do its thing, just be with it, just deal, and eventually that becomes or should become a kind of warrior mentality, which is, this is not the time, we were talking about this earlier, this is not the time for, you know, like, okay, I gotta lighten, peace out, see you guys, bye, you know, and maybe for some people, right? But for the first time, I think in, as far as I know, in human history, maybe it's been this way in other ways, for the first time ever, I mean, we really seriously face the prospect of losing this planet, right? And there's certain things going on, there's overpopulation, there's environmental degradation, there's the existential threat of artificial intelligence, particularly, there's the development of new weaponry, like nano weaponry and bio weaponry, that the ongoing existence of humanity and of nature and of the biosphere is greatly in question. You know, it would be good to say, well, things always work out, and I said that earlier, but we don't actually know that for sure. And despite all mythology and intuition to the contrary, or even mathematical thinking about it, for all we know, there's no other conscious life anywhere else in the universe. That seems highly unlikely that that's the case, but we don't know, right? So for all we know, like human life on earth is where it's at, right? It's like, it's what we've got. And yes, there's all these ideas about spirituality and gods and other planes, but largely, these are manifested by humans and would not exist without humans in theory. So, so is this the time to just check out? No, right? I think that this is the time to, there's a time to, there's a time to attempt to stand above time as it were. Well, it's the parable of the sower, man. Everybody thinks the parable of the sower is about, I've always thought of the parable of the sower as a kind of galactic message to whatever the person or beings or collective or whatever it was that pansper me it out into the universe and sent DNA and why this is again, another bullshit story. But what I'm saying is the parable of the sower, there was, you know, how do they, how does it go? This is through seeds on the ground. And some of the seeds didn't grow because the ground wasn't, it wasn't fertile. Now, I think if this is like the epigenet or the genetic material on the meteorites that collided with planets that just weren't life sustaining, then some of the seeds, they landed on the ground and maybe they grew for a second, but then they weren't like, they weren't, but they died or they didn't work. To me, I think, oh, that's the message from like the great, if there were some kind of like, I don't know, hyper dimensional civil series of civilizations out there, the message is not all planets work out. It doesn't always work. Like just because you're here, it doesn't mean it's, you stay here, meaning that if you can, if you can become, what is it, wheat and not shape as a planetary civilization, then that is when the veil lifts and you are welcomed into the great whatever it is. The aliens are like, okay, finally, you're cool. You can, we'll show ourselves. So to me, it's like, it's kind of like, look, if we've grown, we've, we're a seed, we're seeds that we've grown this incredible civilization, which is quite beautiful, but it's a parasitic relationship with the substrate that it's growing on. And that is not sustainable anymore than cancer works, you know, when the moment the DNA starts reproducing in a way that runs counter to the biological imperatives of whatever the particular organism is that the thing is infesting, well, then you're in a temporary situation. If you're trying to survive as cancer, so it ain't going to work. But if the mutation becomes something that actually is symbiotic and not parasitic, then at that point, you become not just some, that thing that can live, but potentially you become a positive mutation. You know what I'm saying? So in that way, I think the way I would phrase what you're saying is it's the dream is not a dream in the sense that we are all sharing the dream on this beautiful planet. Maybe the planet is having the dream, maybe we're the subconscious of the planet, I don't know, but the reality of it is there's a chance, I think for us as individuals to have a, the experience of not being chafed, so to speak, being wheat, but then also collectively there's a chance, I would imagine, for us to jump into a sustainable, harmonized, technological, space-faring civilization that has passed whatever the particular initiation is that we were all going through. Yeah. Sorry, that was a long rant. No, it's, it's, so are you saying magic is the is something that can help people not just help themselves, but the planet too? Yeah, absolutely. It's interesting to bring up space. I mean, like Timothy Leary actually said that, right? He said that magic, in a sense, was preparation for weightlessness. It was, it was, it was evolving yourself to the point of being able to be space-faring, right? Which I think is totally true. It sounds fantastic, but as one gets into these states, it makes total sense. Yeah. We, we are, we, we must evolve and evolution is not a given. In fact, humanity seems to be regressing so quickly despite, you know, it's like, we seem to be regressing emotionally at the same rate that our technology advances, which is quite frightening because then once you reach that crossover point where we're no longer able to maintain the technology, then it's all gone. So if I was to say anything, it would be, well, I would say a lot of things, but I think that the process of waking up, whether it's by magic or meditation or, or any, any other means, is seeing reality, understanding that it hurts and being okay with it hurting more. Yeah. Right. It's like, great. Yes, it hurts. And everything that we do is to distract ourselves from that fact. You know, and if one were to simply accept that it hurts, you know, it drops off so much nonsense. Sure does, man. That's, I remember when I started doing that, that's a really empowering thing. It's like, if you actually stop trying to like imagine you're not suffering or whatever the thing is you're doing to produce the padding, the fake fucking padding between you and the sensation you've been avoiding maybe for your whole life, then suddenly it's not just that you like, you know, it's a lot of energy to filter out the pain. I mean, that's a huge, that's a lot of rainbow wheels spinning to make that, to succeed at that, but you get a lot of cognitive energy back. But then also you realize, oh my God, I was like, I was essentially like trying to, I didn't, the thing I was trying, I was avoiding was my, it was power. I was like giving up all this power that comes from accepting and be not just accepting as though you, it's you and the pain. It's like you are the pain. This is the truth of suffering, duke. And it's beautiful in the same way like we find the, the, you know, an elemental anything and a thing that can't be split, you know, it's a very powerful, to me, it's quite powerful and wonderful to stop the game of trying to put lipstick on the fish or whatever you want to call it. It's like, no, this is, this is, this is you are suffering. You're in pain right now. It's okay. You don't have to be the Instagram version of yourself. You could still Instagram all that bullshit if you want, but you're allowed to like be in it as it is. I see that that might be some kind of beginning phase, right? Yeah, of maturity. I think when I was, let's see, how old was I in 2006? So I would have been 25. I had a vision. I talked about it on the first episode of your podcast. I had a vision of the universal suffering and hopelessness of existence, right? And in that, over the course of a year around that experience, I lost my job. I lost my girlfriend. I lost, I ended up living in Canada. And then I ended up on living in the suburbs on the outskirts of Vancouver, unable to get out of bed without antidepressants and unable to move, unable to feed myself, laying there in the darkness and there was one light in the room. I remember it was totally dark. There was one window that light was coming in from and that was Kether for me. That was the final stop on the tree of life. That was the Godhead because it was everything, nothing, everything else had gone. There was only that. And then the Canadian government threw me out of the country and I was, I had nothing. I lost all of my physical possessions. And so I had literally nothing. And I ended up in a hotel room in Bellevue, Washington, or Bellingham, Washington with a six pack and washing forest gump on TV because that's all I had left, like a one pair of clothes. And I remember I was in the bathroom and the faucet was going and I was just trying to understand what had happened to me and why all this had, and this was, I've been on the top of the world. I've been the boy, dashing boy wonder of magic. My first book out at 23, beloved by, and I went from the top of the world to the bottom within a year. And I remember staring in the mirror and feeling my breath and realizing that it was really the only thing I had left and being completely grateful for it. It's like, if that's all I have, that's okay. I'm grateful for every breath because the alternative is obliteration. And thank you for this. And that was the moment that things started turning around. And then everything came back, you know, fairly, fairly quickly. But you got to do, you got to hit that spot first. It seems, it seems some people seem to go through it. I think that but things change quickly from there where, you know, you change your opinion on these things. It's, it's all too easy. Any teenager can be nihilistic. And most of them are, it's like, oh, everything sucks. It's like, that's easy, right? But, you know, I went from total idealism to total disintegration. And I mean, total, I mean, there's a lot, there's a lot went on in that year. And, but it went from there to realizing that there was a moment in there where I said, if the gods will not help me, I will do it myself. Right? Yeah, it's like, if there are no gods, and they do not answer my prayers, then I will do it myself. Right. And, and, and this is the beginning of something, right? So, and then I went from that to realizing, if there is no, let us say that as adults, we come to realize that there is no Santa Claus, right? There's no Santa, that all of these are myths, that there's no, there's no there, there, there's no super magical super parent that is going to come make everything okay at the end of the day. It becomes easy to become disillusioned and say, it was all a lie. But then what I realized is, those are good ideals, they are good stories, and it is our, I would say, responsibility, or it is certainly a calling, certainly for me, to make them real. Like as if, you know, if we are the gods, then we must be beloved, we must act like it, we must be benevolent gods, we must work to create benevolence and hope, and better meaning. And this is maybe not for everyone, but certainly for people who are in a position of leadership. You know, it's like right now, like I'm looking around in the country, and it's amazing, I mean, Blanche, I don't want to talk about politics, but I mean, you look at some of the debates that are, like the Democratic debates, they're not discussing any of the real issues, other than Andrew Yang, whose mic they shut off. People have no idea what's coming, you know, structural unemployment, you know, what, what are people going to, like, people are going to be, let me, let me put it this way. In the next five to 10 years, you're going to be told certain things about yourself. You're going to be told that your work is not needed. You're going to be told you're not valuable. And you're going to be led to believe that what is real, quote, unquote, is this increasingly abstracted thing. You know, you look at the, the markets, the economy, right now, that used to be based on work. You did work, you got value for it. Then it became derivatives and financial abstraction and trading, and it becomes this more and more abstract thing. Until now, we have blockchain and cryptocurrency, which is like the ultimate abstraction taken away from physical labor. So you look at the market and all of these companies values are going up. So people get, you know, the market, the economy is going up and up and up, but that's not based on salaries are not going up. It's based on these companies, you know, selling off their stock and buying it back and laying people off and all of, all of these manipulations and sorcery, right, illusion. That's all that is illusion. And you're going to be told that your work is not needed, that you are not valuable because AIs or outsourcing can do what once you were convinced was the reason for your existence. What, what people will forget is that none of that is, all of that is meaningless. That the true value of the value, what creates real value and what is truly valuable is people, right? We have a whole country full of capable, intelligent, educated people who could do anything were they to have the group will, the political will to do so. And people are being convinced. Oh, no, it's like political polarization, you know, left versus right, everything's falling apart. Oh, you can't do anything because the world's dying. You can't do anything because Trump, there's AIs are going to take the jobs, you know, you can't, you have your powerless. It's sorcery. Again, it's illusion. You know what it reminds me of to interject silly real quick. I remember when the fucking government shutdown happened, people were showing pictures of trash in the national parks. And they were saying like, look what's happened. The trash is stacking up in the national parks. And it seemed like no one thought I can clean the trash up, right? I could get a truck. I could rent a truck for almost nothing and come and clean. And if I got enough people, we could all clean up the parks. Nobody, everybody was like, fuck, look what happens without the government, the trash piles up. That was amazing to look at that. I think, oh, right, of course, we're so fucking weirdly de-skilled to the point that we can't even pick trash up in a park that isn't our own trash. And so the other side of that is the collective realization like, oh yeah, we can clean up our own trash. We don't need the government to come and clean the trash up. It would be nice if they wanted to chip in, but if they want to fucking argue about goddamn AO fucking C and socialism or whatever it is that they're caught up in. If they want to get mad at super powerful women that are appearing in the politics or whatever it is, freaking them out, go ahead. Such a weird reality show right now, all of this. Yeah. But it's like, to me, it's sad because it's like a lot of these people that are becoming fodder for the attacks of the right wing people. I think they legitimately want to like help. And then they suddenly are like being like, you know, they can't get away from being packaged by their enemies in specific ways. And the whole thing ends up making, they become reactive. I don't know. I don't know. Well, again, politics against sorcery, delusion. Yeah. But it's that, to me, what's very exciting in my own life, because that's what I have to do is like, if I let my brain get caught up in politics or whatever the thing is, I embarrass myself because I'm almost wrong 100% of the time in my political predictions. But in my own life, when I pull it down to like realizing like, wait a second, I can fix my own shit. Oh, the pump isn't working, or this thing isn't working, or oh, the shelf, I need to, I don't need a handyman hang a goddamn shelf. I saw a commercial for one of the most, I don't know what the fuck it was, the product, maybe some app. But it's basically a lady sipping a glass of champagne in her house, while all these people come in, they're like making toast for, they're putting a TV in, they're painting the wall for, they're literally doing everything. Because apparently she can't do it. She can't do anything except drink champagne while the app brings in people to help her. So this to me is the reduced disempowered state of many, many people who have forgotten. Guess what? You can solder, you can hang a shelf, you can sew your pants, you can actually keep your house clean, you can get in shape, you can learn to play piano, you are not limited. You can build a space-faring civilization, you can fix the environmental issue, you can make a country that works, you can talk to your neighbors for God's sake. That's right, you don't, and you don't have to wait for a government action, you don't have to wait for legislation that produces a talk to your neighbor day or whatever, you can go talk to them now. This is the sorcery, the sort, I don't even think it's like the government has intentionally cast the spell, I think it's just easier to believe that if you sit around and fucking wait, someone's gonna fix the problem. That's that dark conversation we had where you asked me a really important question and he would ask themselves. The last time you called the cops, if you're unfortunate enough to call the cops, how long did it take for them to get to your fucking house? Right? They weren't there in five minutes, they were there in like hours. And yet, you know, as you may have, as I have been, you know, like been pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt while driving at 15 miles an hour on a back road somewhere in LA, you know, it's like, and had to go to traffic court. Because there ain't no money in mopping up your fucking blood from being attacked or whatever it is, it's like that. So the point is, is like, the illusion is like, you're not safe. First of all, someone wants to do a home invasion on your ass and you're not prepared in some way or another. The cops aren't showing up until long after your arms have been chopped up and your guts have been taped to the wall with that gorilla fucking tape or whatever. I don't know. I mean, it's the point is, is like, no one's coming to help you. To me, this is what you're talking about the Keith or the what did you call it? The Heather, no one's coming to fucking help you. So give that idea up. You're not going to get help except from yourself. In the moment you come to that conclusion, a fire will light under your ass, so to speak. Yeah, it's hard. It's sobering, you know, it's salt, alchemical salt, and it's painful. But it's only painful for a second. It's like painful in the way if you've been sitting in a chair eating eating chips all day, and you stand up for a second, your knee pops. Well, that can be painful for another reason, which is that if you admit that, then you also have to admit that therefore, nobody else caused your problem except for you. That's right. Now, this is a slippery one too, because people often use this again to spiritually bypass looking at things like structural abuse of power. And, you know, it's like, you know, try saying to somebody, you know, who's like dealing with abusive cops like, oh, you did this to yourself, you know, no, no, no, no. No, not that. Right. But ultimately, we don't have, we just don't have that many options, right? Like, it's like, you know, I hate to use Christian metaphors, but it's like, you know, it's like, either pick up your cross and bear it or don't. You know, it's like, I think it's either a Jewish or another prayer, maybe it was Nietzsche, I can't remember, said, you know, don't pray for the pain to go away, pray to be stronger to bear it. You know, and it's like, I think that's what the universe is intelligent, right? It's like the universe, whether one is deist or not, you know, I tend to feel the universe seems to be like some kind of like field intelligence, which has loci, which are in individuals and potentially disincarnate beings as well, like gods and spirits, but it's all one field. And psychedelics seem to suggest that, although it could just be showing you the extent of your own mind touching other things. But you know, I lost my train of thought. Well, no, I know that the universe is intelligent. We're no doubt, whatever you call it, we're a loci like that. No doubt, whatever you call it, we're points of consciousness in this like tapestry of sentience, the sentience manifests through us, we manifest technology, and we're very, very powerful. And it's a very exciting thing. And yes, we are to blame. To me, it's like, that sucks when you realize like, oh, motherfucker, it's like this entire time I've been chasing my own tail, and my tail's been wrecking my life because I haven't understood I even had a tail, and it's just leaving destruction all over the god damn place. It goes away either. But I love that. Because to me, that's an exciting moment. And I don't mean like in the grand systemic fucking like awful domination structures that exist in the totality of society. Take all those. It's absolutely true. If you depending on your as Terrence McKenna puts it, your photon reflectivity, you have a higher statistical probability of being shot by a police officer. And this is fucking true. And it fucking sucks. It's the worst of the worst. I, in fact, am not equipped to even talk about it. So I won't. But one thing I know for sure, when I'm sitting in the fucking hotel pissed off, because they didn't clean my room. I don't know if you've ever had that kind of embarrassing anger. Oh, yeah, yeah, where you're sitting in there like, what happened? They didn't clean my room yelling customer service somewhere. But you get literally the dumbest epiphany ever, which is, wait, why don't I clean it? Why don't I just clean it up? I can make the bed. It's not like I made that big a mess. I can make the fucking bed. I can throw out the trash. And I can make this room clean on my own. And I don't have to wait for someone else to come and do it for me. And after the initial embarrassment of realizing you number one had a consumer rage, which Jesus Christ, whenever I get it, it's like, I think I'd rather have one of the Apple store a couple weeks ago and then end of which escalated into a bad Yelp review, which I then guiltily took down the next day. The worst is the worst. But so what I'm saying is like, to me, it's like, yes, it's embarrassing to realize that the fucking whole time you're sitting there waiting for someone to come clean your room, you get it done in eight minutes. It's also the most exciting thing would you realize your entire life is like that. And the thing you've been waiting for someone to come and do, oh, you wanted to meet the guru or whatever, you wanted to find the this or you wanted to find the fucking that the thing that makes you a special person, you don't have long lasts. Yeah, you don't need any of it. You can do it now. I love that. And like, to me, they all boils down to something that usually quite pragmatic and simple. And my very brief encounters with magic have been like, have had within them encoded within them that sense of like, look, you can do it, you're going to have to do this. If you want to swim, like, you're going to have to get in the water, you're going to have to get in the water. Magic makes that point very, very clearly. And I think that magic in my experience has been a profoundly maturing path. Because for many reasons, I mean, first of all, it automatically poses the question. It automatically just by, you know, this is why that why I, you know, people said, I'll use something else besides magic. So people take it seriously. It's like, no, I like it's almost like a Zen cone, right? Because just by adopting that word, it puts you in the driver's seat, essentially, at least theoretically, where you're like, okay, well, well, what does that mean? Does that mean that everything I believe before is not necessarily true? Yes. But it poses the question, it forces one to answer the question. If this were real, and if I were to be able to do anything potentially, what would I do? And what is ethical to do, hopefully, right? And magic, he mentioned earlier, people can get their fingers burnt. Well, people can get their fingers burnt doing dumb shit. And that's true of anything in life. The good thing about magic is that people learn, hopefully, from those experiences. And I think there are, you know, like people, they're sometimes people do need to touch the stove to understand that it's there. I think that's right. I think that the universe is constantly, you know, not to anthropomorphize it, but the universe seems to be constantly forcing the maturation of souls and the evolution of souls. Magic is the accelerated path. It's like, I want it now. And also, here's the thing. And therefore, it can be very, very strenuous. If you're worried about getting your fingers burnt when you're sitting on fucking stove, you're an idiot, right? It's like, you got to get out of the stove. And I think that a lot of times many of us, you know, have this idea of like, oh, I don't want to do that certain thing or go on down that path because I've heard weird things about it. It might hurt me. It's like, actually, what it's, I think the first is you need to realize you're in a stove. Like the first thing is you're fucking cooking, baby. You're being boiled right now and you're pretending you're not. You are suffering. You are in the boiling water right now. And at this point, worrying about getting burnt is irrelevant because you got to get out of the pot. That's step one. First, realize there's a pot. You're boiling it. Second, get the fuck out. And then once you do that, you know, if you're surrounded by people who don't even realize they're getting charbroiled or whatever it is by Maya, then yeah, there's an instantaneous power that is right there. Because like if people are, you know, what do they say? A hungry man is an angry man? A burning man. You know, someone who's like being boiled alive is not thinking clearly. And in that state of cloudiness, they could be exploited in the most horrific ways, which I think we're seeing. It's happening. You underestimate people though, because people pretend to be less conscious than they actually are. That's right. You can't fool people. I think that look, here's the bottom line. It's like, if people are scared by magic, good. You know, it's like, if you, if you, if you, you're, you're scared, oh, something could go terribly wrong. Good. Don't start. You know, it's like, I certainly don't, I don't need to carry people. I don't need to be teaching people who don't want to do it. You know, I'm not an evangelist. I don't want to wake everyone up. I just, I'm just doing my thing. And if people are interested in there, they're interested. It's a path for the brave. And it's a path with no guarantees.

If you want easy answers, go become a Scientologist or something.

Hello my dear sweet friends, it is I, Duncan Tressel and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour Podcast. You know what I've been doing? I've been recording the intro for this podcast over and over and over again for the last several hours and the reason I keep re-recording it is because I just every single time no matter what my intention is, I find that I keep getting sucked into a rant about how awful Turkey is and see it's starting again. It's starting again. I want to, I've been listening to Michael Beckwith a lot who is this just an amazing articulator of a kind of universal principle that we exist in an abundant universe where everything is here for us to grow and to learn and everything that we need is here and that it is our resistance to that fact. It is our subconscious habitual resistance to the idea that we are being embraced or loved or held up by a universe that has as its core love that is creating all the turbulence in our lives and that we have to become conscious of what kind of words that we're putting out into the universe because the words that we're putting out into the universe are the universe which we are creating itself. Every time you say something awful, you are inadvertently affirming the idea that you exist in an unsafe, dangerous, sad, brutal, angry universe where at any second you can get destroyed by unforeseeable catastrophe and so you've got to be careful. That really gets to me when I listen to that stuff because I do think that there's some truth to it but simultaneously I recognize that I'm a comedian and that the way that I like to express myself is often by using words to illuminate certain foul, festering, dripping, dark holes that exist in the fabric of society and I'm not a feel-good comic. I want people to feel good, I really do. I'm not a comic maybe. I don't know what I am. I'm a person. I hate labeling anyone as anything. It's a waste of goddamn time but I want the world to be a beautiful place so I do affirm that we exist in an abundant universe. I think we really do. I think it's an abundant universe that eats all of us eventually. That's an inevitability no matter how positive you are in your outlook or how good you are in articulating that we are in this kind of juicy nexus of sense gratification that has as its focal point our physical body that is filled with so many nerves and neurochemicals that allow us to sort of float on this ocean of sound vibration and sensory input that if we just let go of fear we can experience in the present moment a kind of orgasmic bliss that again and again and again gets overshadowed by our own personal terror habituations but those moments where you're very still you can't experience that kind of expansive orgasmic non-being-ness that I think the Buddhists call nirvana. I know that's true but even if you sit in a state of pure nirvanic bliss from this point into however many years you're going to live the meat body that you're existing in collapses and so they're suffering which is a kind of inescapable aspect of being on this rollercoaster ride that we're currently incarnated into with the big meaty bar called our human body which is sticking us to time that's just an inevitability so I think you're allowed to like save the way you feel as long as the intention behind it is not an intention of causing suffering or pain to other people so all that being said turkey sucks I hate turkey it's so bad it's the worst tasting meat out there it's and I'm I'm not a vegetarian though I the older I get the more I think that I should be and obviously therefore I'm not a vegan but man I feel bad for those birds have you ever seen a wild turkey have you ever been out in the woods and been lucky enough to see one of these ridiculous alien things come wandering out of the shadows and start making it strange noise and peering at you with its multicolored rainbow head sure their brains are apparently the size of chickpeas and they say that they can drown by putting their heads up if it's raining because the water gets into their mouth and I guess they drown I think that's something a turkey farmer said but regardless maybe all living beings their ability to experience is not based on their neurology but is based on the fact that the universe is sentient and there's a kind of wave of intelligence flowing through everything and any organic living being is an antenna that this consciousness temporarily is transmitted through which means that every single thing in its own way has a right to existence and the illusion that animals are kind of meaty robots that don't really feel is something that came from some site psychotic people like to cart who like to apparently stick their fingers into the pulsing hearts of dogs that they'd eviscerated but the truth is oh god oh god I should stop eating meat the truth is you know all beings that have brains and a nervous system probably suffer you know when and therefore okay all that being said I'm not still not a vegetarian but turkeys turkeys are an exception because as far as I know there is not a day dedicated to eating any animal there's no fish day there's no national steak day there's no national chicken day there's no national I don't know what are the other meats there's no national eat a pig day but turkeys for whatever awful reason this is the time of I think it's because people recognize that no one's going to eat to eat them unless an entire centuries of brainwashing have to happen for people to make a turkey the focal point of their meal and it's just a a papery it's like a papery sponge for butter but more than that quite often what a turkey really is is a vehicle through which the turkey chef can extract a kind of pseudo gratitude from the people surrounding them as the turkey is unveiled you know when the turkey chef pulls the goddamn turkey out of the oven as though they're bringing the glowing head of the baby Jesus out of the dilated vagina of the virgin Mary and everyone's supposed to ooh and awe like a hibernation pod just opened up on an alien spaceship and some reptilian messiah is finally emerging under the planet earth that thing it's like no it's not good I don't I didn't want you to spend all day making the turkey mom dad uncle friend I wanted to hang out with you have a couple of beers maybe watch tv play video games talk go for a walk I didn't want to watch you in the kitchen with your with your veins in your neck pulsating as though you're trying to hold open a door in an ancient temple before the whole thing collapses as the children can run out and and I don't want you to feel like a firefighter as you're making the turkey I don't want you spend the day before as though you're some kind of firefighter in the midst of a horrible forest blaze I just wanted to enjoy thanksgiving with you so don't don't use the don't crucify yourself on a turkey for me please don't do that I don't want to have to stand at the foot of your turkey cross while you hang there weeping and bleeding muttering to yourself father forgive them they know not how delicious turkey really is and how hard I've worked to make this turkey it's a 12 pound bird don't crucify yourself on a turkey this thanksgiving don't allow yourself to get sucked in by a turkey martyr because they're out there man thanksgiving comes and the turkey martyrs just come climbing out of the woodwork and the next thing you know you're sitting around the table after eating this mildly flavorable shit meat it could have been steak it could have been anything and then the turkey martyr after everybody finishes is inevitably going to make you say what you feel thankful for and you know what you do when it comes your turn look them right in the eye and say I'm thankful for this turkey it was the best thing I ever tasted in my entire life and thank you just lie just lie about it don't be the liberal arts student who talks about how the whole goddamn holiday is actually American shopping day number one and is a holiday that originates from the people who actually lived on this continent before we got here giving nutrients to the invading army which eventually completely wiped them out don't be that guy don't be that guy don't be what I am right now yapping about how shitty turkey is don't do I can't stop it and I'm just going to put this up I don't mean to spread negativity in the universe but turkey sucks and and and and the people who use it to to inflict guilt on other people it's like a turkey's like a guilt ball that they just throw into your mouth uh and and the whole like I ate six plates of your turkey that's the other weird thing the gorging attitude of thanksgiving where people are just for whatever reason expected to just just fill their fat stomach there's distended stomachs on thanksgiving where you're just and you're supposed to get drunk it's just this weird mix of chewed up crap meat and booze and your stomach's all distended and then you get in a fight well this thanksgiving based on the teachings of michael beckwith and some other illuminated beings who exist on this earth based on what they say which is that if you articulate uh if you articulate positivity in the universe then it will come having just uh sprayed out the wrench level thanksgiving gloom I would like to say that this thanksgiving uh it is my hope that the the the life intelligence of the universe the source from which all things uh originated the god had the present moment state the crest of the wave of creation of which every single one of us is uh one tiny pixel the hand inside the puppet of society that great eternal consciousness the great spirit is the indians that were wiped out by the people who are celebrating their gift to them called the great spirit the life energy the beautiful truth the sweet ineffable ephemeral love field from which we all originate I I pray that that source comes flowing out of you in the presence of whatever thanksgiving not see you happen to be around even if you're around uh a a true thanksgiving tyrant who has the audacity to do a 17 minute prayer uh before the meal even if you end up around uh abusive drunk father mother sister uncle who tortured you for years and years it is my prayer that you recognize that this entire incarnation is a university through which you are being taught to be uh a loving being where you're being taught to transform whatever circumstance arises into its most beautiful perfect form you are a filtration device that transforms any circumstance into its platonic ideal that you are in fact the alchemical beaker turning lead into gold and it is my hope that this thanksgiving instead of succumbing to the lifetime of neurosis or oppression or whatever you happen to go through because you got shot out of a vagina into a group of people who are terrified because they come from generations of horror it is my hope that in this moment you are fully present open loving not phony holy not pretending to be a good person but actually attentively listening with the intention of transforming everything around you and do pure novelty that's the idea because we've got to believe that people can change and we've got to believe that we can change and we've got to believe that this thanksgiving instead of it being the usual rigamarole of having to get into a car and drive really far and being miserable and hoping to go home or whatever the thing is that you might be dreading that this thanksgiving it is my hope that that great spirit that illuminates all things inhabits your heart flows through your body and transforms your experience into the greatest thanksgiving that has ever happened to any human on planet earth it is my hope that you actually transform into a portal that the healing energy of the universe comes pouring through and that you end up saying exactly the right thing and doing the exact right thing to facilitate the experience of familial love or the love between brothers and the love between sisters that all families have the potential to manifest i'm not recording this shit again turkey still fucking sucks i hate it we've got a great podcast today i'm so excited about this one and a big thank you to derrick waters for facilitating this dr drew as it turns out as a fan of drunk history and was at a live drunk history show i had a chance to talk with him we ended up emailing and he agreed to do my podcast which is a really sweet thing to do because he's a very very busy human being so i went to his amazing office at the sea in in building in los angeles and we spent an hour talking about addiction and a great many other things he's a brilliant focused super sweet guy and i can't wait for you guys to hear this interview we're going to dive right into it but first some very quick business first of all a tremendous thank you to all of you have been buying shirts lately i don't know what's going on but you guys have been buying a ton of shirts thank you for every single person out there who's ordered a shirt or a sticker or a poster from the dunkin trustle dot com website go check it out man we've got everything in stock if you're somebody who's visited the shop before and everything was sold out go visit it again we have got everything is there including the mystical ron rigi t shirts which are guaranteed to to create a field of love energy around you that is so powerful that there is at least a three percent chance that it's going to make the turkey that you eat on this thanksgiving taste good and that's an very powerful just a three percent chance indicates that these shirts are incredibly powerful they are metaphysical if you look at the shirts by going to dunkin trustle dot com you will see that they are inscribed with the great many ancient symbols uh the the the hamza is there the enneagram is there uh these it's a ward it's a sigil it's designed not only to draw uh the positive synchronicities into your life but also to allow you to put out uh sweetness and love and hopefully it will attract to you the most beautiful being that you've ever witnessed maybe some kind of wild super sexual woodsmen or woods woman who will come to you in a dream and spend the entire night riding you like a banshee through the uh fields of orgasm sounds like a sting song that's what it's designed to do it's designed to make you feel like you are the lead actor in a sting music video that's how you'll feel when you wear these shirts go to dunkin trustle dot com and check them out there's also posters and even though i don't know when you're listening to this uh you might be far down the uh time space continuum uh from where i am right now and if so we might we we will eventually have mugs there probably within the next couple of weeks so that you can imbue whatever liquid you happen to be drinking with the super powerful dunkin trustle family hour logo which is the uh chaos flower which represents the uh idea that through chaos novelty and perfection and the amplification of evolution is occurring can occur and will occur so that's a fun thing to think about while you're drinking your coffee in the morning and you can get those mugs by going to dunkin trustle dot com we're also sponsored by amazon dot com now this brings me to something that i would have talked about in the beginning of the podcast if i hadn't gone into whatever that thing was that you just suffered through which is that uh sure you can listen to michael beckwith study buddhism take massive amounts of lsd go to peru and drink ayahuasca you can inject yourself with ibogaine or go or or fly into heaven and dance with the angels but if you really want to change your life get a bidet order a bidet you can go to amazon dot com they have bidets they're just google search bidet you install it yourself you're gonna have to deal with the fact that your friends come over and and see that you have a bidet installed into your toilet and you if you have gross friends with smelly assholes they're gonna be like you look at you who are you oh it's mr duke dandy with a bidet but as soon as they turn that dial and feel that cold refreshing water spray into their asshole they will change their tune guaranteed i installed a bidet about a week ago uh and nothing nothing has had such a powerful impact you don't realize you know we're so used to being in a culture where it makes sense to use thin strips of white paper do cleanse our assholes of fecal particulates that it just feels normal it just feels normal to rub Kleenex on your asshole when you're when you're wiping that's white with wiping wipe wipe up or wipe i don't know that you're supposed to wipe wipe away from your genitals that's something that you're taught as a kid but when i was in india a very long time ago when i was in college i was talking to this indian guy in a graveyard and i you know i'd heard this story about how in india they use their left they use their hand there's like water next to the toilet and and they they actually use water to wash their asshole with after they poop and i remember asking him about that and probably a mildly condescending way as though i was julius fucking Caesar riding into the land of the savages and uh in a really quick brilliant way he said what would you do if i put shit on your cheek right now would you feel okay just using paper to wipe that off and uh that was a great point that he made which is that if shit lands on any other part of your body your shit someone else's shit if you end up with shit on your shoulder if you end up with shit on your stomach if you ended up with shit on your feet if you ended up with shit on your knees if you ended up with shit in any other sector of your body you would not be okay if somebody just handed you a Kleenex you wouldn't be okay with that you wouldn't just take the Kleenex and just wipe the shit off and then and then throw it away and be like everything's fine now no you would go to the nearest sink and you would spend a lot of time with soap and water cleansing yourself of that stuff that's what you would do so but for whatever reason here in the west when we spray shit out of the out of the hole in our body we're okay just using a Kleenex to wipe it away everything's fine everything's fine it's not fine if you don't believe me get a bidet go to uh that go through our amazon portal located at junkintrustle.com google search bidets there's a great many there's a variety of them on amazon that you can you can pick really expensive ones like over there's bidets over a thousand dollars that carbonate the water spraying into your ass which i i'm telling you i'm thinking about getting one of those eventually but for now i've got a working man's bidet it was like 40 bucks it's easy to install if you've got the mildest bit of plumbing ability if i can install it you can install it anything that i can install anyone on planet earth can install because i have the construction skills of somebody who with no calluses on their hand just to there's no reason that i should be able to construct anything my brain doesn't work that way and i just resisted shop class so but this i was able to install the water pressure is a little too too much it feels like a aquatic hummingbird is kind of pecking at my asshole when the water spraying in there but still the feeling of cleanliness that you get from a bidet compared to the feeling that you have after you wipe like some disgusting western savage it's the difference between night and day order a bidet friends go through the portal located at dunkintrustle.com the amazon portal and get a bidet and just go through that portal no matter what even if you're completely satisfied with the fact that you've got a a a bacterially encrusted viral hole that you sit on all day long go through the portal at dunkintrustle.com the next time you're going to amazon.com forget get don't fall prey to this black friday bullshit don't get pulled into that materialistic cyclone of doom where you're surrounded by people who have no idea that they're being puppeteered by some megalomaniacal superpower that's managed to convince them that the day after thanksgiving is the day that you're supposed to spend surrounded by anxiety ridden people trying to save $15 on an overpriced baby doll go to go through the portal go to amazon that's where you should do all your christmas shopping spend the day after thanksgiving allowing your poor distended stomach to rest relaxing with a book making love to your your your wife or sister or pets but don't spend it lost in a malmase spend it going through the amazon portal buying a bidet preparing yourself for the feeling of superiority that it's going to grant you as you walk among an entire nation of people who have who have disgusting asses just

section of any of the podcasts they will give you they give us a very small percentage of whatever you buy and it doesn't cost you anything extra and it's a great way to support the podcast finally and then we're going to get on with this awesome interview i have been reading and listening to an incredible audiobook called zealot by reza aslan and if you're somebody who like me was raised in christianity or you're somebody who has a certain idea of what christianity is or what who jesus christ was this book will throw an iron sledgehammer of historic fact into your idea of who jesus was now i was telling my friend about the book and he's like there probably wasn't a jesus well this might be true i don't know but even if he's a mythological figure it's still important to understand what the political climate was like that he was existing within uh in that political climate uh was way different than what i realized i didn't a lot of the uh a lot of the i had no i had no idea what was going on then i'm kind of embarrassed because i sure have spent a lot of time on this podcast yapping about this peace-loving version of jesus like one of my favorite things that i like to talk about is how jesus was crucified between two thieves and actually i heard michael beckwith say that the thieves represent past and future and it's a symbol that represents the uh way that we're all kind of stuck on the time space continuum and it's a metaphysical symbol it's a sacred geometry thing but really thief uh the word thief uh in the greek translates it is more likely it means uh bandit or it means revolutionary and that jesus was a revolutionary he was crucified among revolutionaries because anytime anyone started talking about how the occupation of roam uh in palestine was a terrible thing or anytime anyone threatened that power structure the romans would crucify them the romans were vicious brutal people and the so far in the book i haven't finished listening to i have two hours left uh right now jesus is not such a peace-loving guy he's a kind of uh he's not into non-violence either he's a somebody who wanted to overthrow the power structure of the time so it's a controversial book some of you might not give two shits about it because you don't care about christianity because you avoided that religion all together but uh even if you avoided christianity it's cool to understand about one of the great world religions and it's really interesting to hear how the interpretation that so many people have of those stories is not so much based on history but is based on something that was hung on those stories way later on down the line which i think is pretty cool too and you know the more i listen to resa aslan talk about the story the more i recognize that the story is just a kind of uh mirror that reflects wherever your mind happens to be and that's what all great scriptures do so anyway if you go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership you can download a copy of this book for free and have your mind blown over the holidays also i've heard the new steven king book is incredible though i haven't listened

working in the trenches with people who are experiencing some really brutal things in their life and he's just a cool guy man i i really was sort of expecting when i went to talk with him just having

philosopher drdrew Dr. Drew welcome to the family our podcast thank you so much for taking time out of what must be the busiest schedule on earth it is my privilege yesterday was pretty bad but today's not so bad so uh that's first of all i gotta say this i didn't realize you're ripped no i i feel really bad i'm supposed to wear a shirt and they might do people know that you're ripped i don't know i don't think people know that you're ripped you are ripped you have massive biceps i was born with arms like i think i came out of the womb with you know you pump on you must know i do i love i it's my meditation absolutely i can't i listen to i go on itunes you every freaking day and download lectures and listen to at least two hours of lectures a day and so it's been weird as i've sort of done less clinical work i've gone deeper into kind of academic uh thinking and it's been weird so but you mean you're listening to these while you're working yeah yeah i run a little bit and i work out a bit and i just listen to these amazing lectures i mean you've been at itunes you i have not every every university on earth basically fundamentally puts their stuff in there and some of the greatest lectures of all time the greatest professors in the world they just throw their courses up and you listen to them that's incredible yeah i think that is is one of the most amazing aspects of being alive today is that we have access to every single bit of information that has ever existed at a click of a button and we can start transforming our lives with that stuff and and what's the other thing is it really shoves your face in how lazy you are not you i like it i like it it's always telling you you're you're you're insignificant you don't really know what's going on there's always more always more yeah um well this is um i'm real excited to talk with you because you are considered in the world probably one of the you're the most renowned expert on addiction in the world i mean i'm sure that there's like doctors and scientists who are in those circles more famous but everyone when they think about addiction or especially a celebrity or someone you're the one they go to that's what it's become yeah can you tell me the the scientific definition of addiction i i use a very uh blanketed definition that uh grew out of a consensus conference in the early 90s that was actually published in one of these journals i'm pointing at um and it's it's and a lot of addiction medicine people that really work in this field will use this addicts will use this because it fits and and and i i think fundamentally you have to understand addiction is a spectrum disorder from incipient to mild to severe to advanced to fatal okay so and and people believe that most people move forward on that spectrum but you can be along that spectrum and be an addict the dsm4 and the dsm5 kind of takes issue with this so i don't use those criteria here's my criteria a definition rather it's a biological disorder with a genetic basis the hallmark is progressive use in the face of consequence and by consequence it's got to affect important spheres of the life work or school finance health relationships or legal status and then denial that's to be some degree of denial right then i was always in there right uh and that's it and that and you could be you know a high school kid just uh chipping away at something but still have all the qualities there and i would say that's a drug addict now they may not need treatment yet they may be able to moderate it throughout their life they you know it may not be clinically significant but that's still addiction in my mind what a perfect shit storm that is what a terrible mix of things genetic some sort of deep yeah core genetic yeah malfunction well if you put it as malfunction see i think oh you're triggering me right away great uh i think it's not a malfunction uh you know i'm a biologist by training that was my original field and uh you know i came came to adulthood in an era when you know evolutionary biology and genetics was that was it that's always studied and so you always have to ask the question now wait a minute if this genetic mechanism and by the way it's not a single gene it's a grouping and a series of genes but this it's a basic genetic phenomena thank you yeah i'm feeling naked without a shirt i'm bringing a shirt dr jew's gotta hide his guns thank you he had to put a shirt you can't for some reason it's like people don't know i because i i don't i'm not comfortable that's one of the i it's i feel like i've exposed something here people don't know you're ripped all right so so you have to ask the question if if if this thing is a dysfunctional as you describe it a shit storm yeah why the hell is it still in the human genome yes it should have been it's been throughout history very stable and uh i was thinking about this years ago years and years ago and it was just in the days when these sorts of early 90s and these ideas were taking form and um i was watching the movie brave heart okay and in that movie they portrayed very clearly that 10 000 scotsmans go into battle these primitive peoples uh and 10 survive clearly the alcoholics clearly the alcoholics and i thought that's right i thought that's right my patients are amazing survivors wow and so i went back to my little laboratory i gave lectures to groups of drug addicts every couple times a week and i said you know if you guys if a bunch of huns came over the hill right now carrying spears what would you guys do and about 90 to 95 percent of them said oh i fucking picked something up i run right at him and i was like what it's so that's not that's not a normal human thing right and then i started thinking oh my god all my patients are extreme athletes race car drivers fighter pilots all these extreme activities yes they they love it they in fact and i've learned since you know in the middle of like like a shortstop in the middle of a play it's one of the only times an alcoholic loses their anxiety time slows down and they're they're euphoric in that moment and so they love the and evidently from an evolutionary perspective in a circumstance of repetitive military assaults they're more likely to survive in their heedlessness going forward in these battles wow and it kind of makes sense right yeah and if you take a population so i then i started thinking well now we're in the globe we really see this gene isolated populations that have a history of really genocidal military assaults so it's ireland scotland certain parts of africa you know in central europe yes there it is it emerges in these pipe not i'm not saying that they were drinking and using when they were in the face of this adversity i'm saying in the face of adversity they are more likely to survive and then reproduce and then during peaceful times then the alcoholism the addiction that is such a smart isn't that that is makes sense right that's brilliant so almost as a form of dealing with ptsd the anxiety that came from being in a tumultuous conflict they hide from it they like it but you and i go the other way and we'd get a spear in the back see yes they go towards it and they're just slightly more likely to survive well when you said yeah i immediately thought run away oh yeah that's why when they all said well i'm what do you got here let's go and like and then i said i followed up with this i go how would it felt like a bomb went off they're like i'm i'm going right in that i'm going right into where that bomb was like crazy what are you kidding me that's crazy well i'm more of a podhead than an alcoholic so i guess we run away and pod is a mixed group it's a mixed bag yeah it really is it's an interesting group what do you mean a mixed bag well because within it pots an interesting drug because not every alcoholic addict becomes a pod addict you know every every alcoholic addict if you give them heroin they're going to become a heroin right you know i mean pot has some sort of differing effect and and it has a and it has a very very predictable syndrome associated with it people think that the average pot addict is somebody that slowly escalates their pot use and pretty soon is sort of using it all the time yeah that's not a pot addict in my book that somebody uses a lot of pot right a pot addict is somebody who after priming the brain usually the third exposure because you again it's my little lab i'll ask hundreds of addicts these questions yes over years and years and i said you know what what do you think a pot first time you smoked it and they'll go and the people i knew pot was their primary drug and they they'll say well i had giggle like like this one and i go how about the first time you got high i go oh that was the third time well what did you think of it then oh i loved it right they all say the same thing i loved it i thought loved it that's not that's um i don't know if i love but that's really a different thing right and then i started thinking well that's that gene that's that that mechanism that some people really have an extraordinary experience with this drug and um and then every person says then from they from that day on they preoccupied or pursued it or used it from that day on it's a boom now right and uh and then within that group there are people that can stop and people that can't stop right you know i mean and the people that can kind of moderate it and stuff yeah and uh and eventually if you smoke too a lot every day it stops working yeah and that's what causes people to really escalate it and that's when they get themselves in trouble and that's when you start getting paranoid and freaked out paranoid and panic attacks and guess what you do you go to a doctor and say i can't sleep and then they give you pills and then you come to me as a pill addict wow so yeah so i this is um this is something that my listeners know that i am a psychedelic advocate i think psychedelics have done so much for me in my life i don't take them all the time i take them um you know on occasion of maybe a few times a year i will take this you and i are the perfect people to sit down and have this conversation because i'm fascinated by that too because there there clearly are benefits but the question is at what cost and for whom and we have no fucking idea well and so in the meantime for me like if my kids were to come to me and be dunking it would scare the shit out of me i don't blame you because i've seen horrible consequences i've seen terrible stuff can i tell you one i will tell you something that just happened to someone that i know because i thought oh i'll bring the most extreme version of the worst thing that can happen from irresponsible use of psychedelics this is somebody in los angeles yeah they had a quote shaman come to their house happens all the time he gave them ibegan all the time is this somebody trying to get off harrowing no no just somebody because the you know it's not only does it help you theoretically help you battle harrowing yeah and by the way it will it does for about six months everybody stops for six months and then everybody goes back yeah it's back what is the name of that that's called in scientific they call that recidivism recidivism yes that's it so yes and i've heard that and that makes sense to me but it creates at least a temporary six month window here except except every one of those people that went that i've treated now this is just me i actually i've talked to one guy that i didn't see this but of course i didn't know him pretreatment i had a lot of patients i treated went did this and i ended up treating them again because they they went back um they were different people they they they it must be a pretty big dose of the stuff because their personalities were totally different now i talked to a guy at a who was in a production company i was over at cbs and he came up to me i said you know i did the civil game and he seemed like it seemed like you always seem totally put together i thought okay well maybe some people but how do we find those people right how do we figure out who that is in the meantime i've got a whole stable of patients who aren't the same person anymore right and that's weird aren't the same person in a bad way aren't the same well you're you're passing judgment you're gonna say oh if they're more open to the world they're they're more peaceable you can say that that's a better person but it's a different person you're looking at it from a scientific i'm just saying i'm not i don't like the idea of that to me that's human engineering it's like we're gonna make you a better person like well well it's not it's i mean it gets deep i've had there's a great uh there's some someone i have on the podcast once in a while named aubrey marcus who takes ayahuasca and is like a very very put together focused person who goes deep into what is that thing that makes you a different person and yeah it's an inevitably invariably contact with some kind is it or is it just a change a brain change well from a scientific perspective it's gonna be a probably both right well i mean i think most scientists or people just there's no proof there's no higher and they're higher intelligence why what do you mean they're gonna no it's gonna say that you're having an experience and change your brain and change your experience yes the brain and brain and consciousness are one let me i'm gonna turn the air gonna show you hot yeah please thanks so um so this change whatever it is and they and we don't know what it is and it could be good or bad it's something we don't know what it is and i don't know and by the way i don't think everybody gets it some people don't change well some people they'll always say i think it things a little differently but some people you like look at them it's like hey you're not the same guy some people have terrible ayahuasca trips that's another aspect of it i think i think people have anxiety disorders like me would would doubt you have an anxiety disorder hell yeah oh god i d and anxiety i cannot wait to talk with you about that but this awful uh thing happened when i i haven't talked about i don't think i've talked about it on the podcast yet but because i'm always trumpeting the the benefits the benefits of psychedelics um i i want to measure that with this story just so people understand these are potent drugs sorry guys i had to delete this story because i spoke with the person it happened to and we have to remain confidential the gist of it is be careful when you're taking psychedelics so that being said i recognize these are dangerous so let me let me you said spiritual quest i it it feels um like cheating ah there it is this comes up all the time man and that idea that this is cheating it comes from the the notion and i think it comes from the industrial revolution that to have some kind of opened mind to earn you have to earn it well you you you you it feels and i know nothing about this i'm just bringing what i thought i thought a lot of people think that yeah it feels like jeez if i were a zen buddhist and i work for it for years and i got to satori it feels like i'm not just cheating but i'm creating an artificial experience now if we could prove that they are one and the same biologically who the hell cares right but i'm not sure they are because of because the zen buddhist although they're a different person don't have consequences the way let me let me tell you some of the consequences that worry me yes not not just the personality change but i would see people and this part is the is the pernicious part of this whole thing years later years later after particular lsd years later with just unbelievable mood disturbances like profound right uh so i you know whatever process is triggered might progress well you see that i absolutely and and i i know so many people who tell stories of their friend who just you know it triggered schizophrenia maybe i've seen that too that sort of thing uh but i think that this is not or this is a result of the prohibition on lsd and the fact too much or the right wrong stuff they're not doing it in the it's not prescribed this should be something that's prescribed it's done in a therapeutic setting or in a shamanic setting but in a private expert you're singing to the choir because i i believe that the clinicians should be able to use whatever that helps the patient you know the fact that we have good drugs and bad drugs i am so against that like what alcohol and tobacco are good drugs and pots of bad drug right what what is that is the craziest shit ever right that's crazy alcohol causes cancer in almost every tissue in your body if you know but it's the only drug from which the withdrawal is commonly fatal i mean and that's a good drug that's a good one and nicotine good drug it's good uh pot oh that stuff's bad evil and oxycontin what is that if you have cancer pain it's a good drug and if you don't it's a bad drug this the logic is all pathetic i we are exactly in the same on the same page with that but it the the problem with that which is a result of i don't know if you've heard that there's a great recording of nixon talking about marijuana oh yeah i've heard it oh it's incredible have you ever read the harrison narcotic act that's what the whole thing's based on it's ridiculous and it all really was a response to the opium wars and the history of china with you and oh my god it's racist and it's it's classist and it's insane that all of our drug laws are based on the harrison narcotic act you just look out of a wikipedia you'll be shocked it's it's wild and then you know i wrote down some of you know just because i thought you could help me understand this but now it we're exactly on the same page anyway but you know the lsd theoretically they did a meta study recently where they gathered data on the lsd test that we had before they made it a schedule one drug and they couldn't do studies with it anymore right there is where the rubber hits the road for me where you can't study it anymore it makes me insane now now i understand that it's risky stuff but we do lots of risky stuff in research you know and and there's ways to mitigate those risks if you just open open everybody just forget open your mind on lsd just open the research process don't have draconian stupid laws it's a tragedy and all of these studies you know they they they show that it can treat alcoholism the meta studies show that it seems to help alcoholism the founder of a you know was a lsd advocate i'm sure oh i didn't know he was an advocate i know he kind of was sort of circling in there he wanted to give it out before meetings because he recognized that it dissolved your he did not he did not yeah they but they they stopped where is that is that which i will find that history i've got a i tweeted it it's a great there's so many interesting pieces of the history of him and a and his wife too very interesting stuff i think i wrote a quote down from him where he said that uh i consider lsd to be of some value to some people and practically no damage to anyone well first part of that's certainly true right yeah last part maybe maybe of no damage to some if we could select those people well i think whatever we're worth the risk for some i'm sure the sample he was using was not was just based on a circle of friends who taken that wonderful fresh brand new lsd straight from sando's laboratories that was completely uncut and manufactured by a veritable saint as far as what it's done for popular culture what lsd has done for history it's created a kind of renaissance it really did it was one of the most we're talking about the 60s well yeah up in even still what what you're talking about about the satori state and earning the satori state so many different people who i respect and love like ramdas or jack cornfield the buddhist teacher actually i don't know if cornfield was influenced by psychedelics but a lot of spiritual teachers and great you know uh inventors uh steve jobs you know attributes lsd to he did say something like that didn't he yeah and uh theory now this is hearsay but it keeps coming up again and again that uh crick the one of the discovers of the heat dna helix was hanging out with huxley and uh they they say that the helix itself was sort of a revelation that happened during the psychedelic experience these stories come up again and again tesla dropped something before he saw the light no tesla i don't think was on anything except just the finger of god touched him i so prefer that i you and i you and i diverge on your enthusiasm it's it that's where i get anxious i get uh concerned you have un unbounded enthusiasm and i understand that i as you know i'm too much doctor to go oh fuck it but it's i've seen such i've seen not good stuff and and we could easily quickly start talking about ecstasy too because it's the same maybe maybe you don't have the same enthusiasm for it but it's the same logic going on there which is there are clearly some clinical uses for that yes that we're having trouble figuring out and have trouble studying properly yeah that that the study that just came out was uh in the journal of psychopharmacology i took notes for this sometimes here i'm with dr drew so i've got like notes here a journal of psychopharmacology 83 percent of vets treated with mdma no longer qualified for a ptsd diagnosis so that study had made the rounds people were impressed by that study but there's not been a lot of reproduction there's not been a lot of movement i don't really i imagine because there's all kinds of barriers to doing that research and and and think about it these guys that are in terms of selecting the right population these guys are crippled by ptsd they're high risk for suicide i don't care what the long-term effects are necessarily because you're right because you may be you may be you're you're in it's desperate times that's a population you're going to go hey let's try this right yeah they can't come into treatment i don't trust anybody they're oh my god have you dealt with vet people with ptsd oh it's horrible it's horrible they just can't get it out of their head huh they can't get out of their head they there's clearly you know again they're they've exceeded the upper limits of their brain's ability to regulate and they've shattered and that that shattering now is in a constant sort of cycle they can't sleep they can't eat and and they they are they have an attachment to the trauma and to the circumstance and people that they were with so literally they feel like they're not real they don't exist unless they go that's why they go back they have to go back into it and retraumatize themselves and it just gets worse yeah yeah that is the most fucked up thing i've ever heard and so we try to get them to do we try to get psychopharmacology involved it helps them but most importantly is to get them in a group with other guys that feel the same way so they can reattach in a healthier way to you know sort of grow and regulate out here it's can you imagine i can't i just i mean i they get violent they get you drugs they they get aggressive towards their spouses they and they don't mean to they can't they can't contain it i think i you know ruminate over mild fights i had with my friends a couple of years ago great i don't know what i would be doing if i if i'd been actually you know engaged in combat or combat situation it's like getting it's like when a flash bulb goes off and that light gets stuck in your eyes it's a great that's a great model that may in fact be some of the neurobiology that kind of thing oh i this you know the this brings me to what you were mentioning before about anxiety because i'm sure ptsd anxiety is one of the just it's just the paint that must color your day well anyway ptsd different than ptsd is different than it's different yeah yeah but you have an anxiety disorder and i think i have one too man i've been meditating and i've been watching myself and practicing mindfulness and i've noticed great 80 percent of the time i'm anxious over nothing well some of that is genetics we're just sort of set up that way and there's a lot of crossover on these anxiety syndromes with phobias and and obsessive compulsive disorder and we'll bleed into body dysmorphia disorder and eat disorder you're talking about my exercising that's kind of an exercise bulimia a little bit in there you know little body dysmorphia in there i've got a little bit of all kinds so i can i can really relate to people have problems with that i understand but for me the anxiety i'm having to kind of look away into my own head here to see if i can figure this out in a way that's understandable for me anxiety is sort of fundamentally a for me a sort of a developmental slash dysregulation thing i didn't get the right nourishment the right attunement as a child and so i had not only a good a solid connection to my body and my emotional states so if i had heavy emotions i would just experience anxiety that would be the predominant feeling rather than the more complete whole experience of emotion and i had some trauma and childhood and so in therapy for me the two things i needed was to form a very secure attachment which i didn't have being nourished regularly with you know somebody who because our brains change interpersonally you know with lst they change it as a single skull right but i'm a big advocate of and and with mindfulness i'm all for that too but i really think big changes happens between people like that's to me that's the magic of everything i think consciousness is an interpersonal experience i don't think a feral child would have consciousness the way you think about it i think it develops here i think this is what's between you and me is just yeah you know buber martin buber talked he's the only philosopher ever he talked a lot about that but i thought he was kind of on to something buber yeah martin buber uh the i thou he called it and then he had sort of an us there's definitely an us and sometimes i think that's how psychics do their thing that that you're gonna leave a remnant in my brain and a really intuitive person could then pick that up yeah if you're no longer here yeah but anyway so i diverged yeah i diverged but i need a lot of nourishment but the other thing is uh because my anxiety doesn't bother me anymore now it's just sort of my genetic predilection it's not a thing anymore but i panic in college i had depression and i had all of that everything um and the other thing i need was the ability to tolerate something that a guy named alan shore calls traumatic trauma associated dead spots so literally in treatment occasionally i would fall into these dead spots where i was like going to like a weird little fugue state i would just like i just remember all that would happen would i be talking i'd be feeling something i'd be and things would sort of shut down and uh and instantly i might my therapist would go i'm sorry it's time is up and i go like i didn't time would just like contract and explain it was weird it was weird time would just trauma associated dead spots yeah and so what i found was those are sort of dissociative holes that i learned to tolerate and fill and be able to because there was somebody there i could kind of tolerate going into it and they no longer were a source of panic or anxiety or dysregulation they just were sort of gone frankly wow that's um that is amazing i love that what you're talking about the idea of this that this sense of connection with another person and what the healing that happens when you're around somebody who's giving you it's it's the essence of life i think i humbly humbly humbly i completely agree this is the guru-disciple relationship this is why in every world religion they say you have to have a teacher you need a teacher because and even when they have a concept of a higher being it's their attachment to that you know it's a connection with that i don't have much of a life in that space i i i i experienced spirituality here right between people are you a buddhist no i'm a i don't know what the hell i am but but i i you don't remember i'm a scientist fundamentally i really am well you know i don't i'm a philosopher i think i could see that yeah yeah i could see that and you know buddhism and science seem to go hand in hand yeah the point where the dalai lama said that if science shows something in buddhism that's off then they will change that they'll just yeah they seem very pragmatic well then to be fair catholic system does that too it just takes them 200 years and a lot of yeah and a lot of incinerated witches and a lot of hand wringing yeah yeah but that and you seem to have not only if you've worked on yourself man yeah you did the work and you can see that because you radiate the exact same thing that anyone else i run into who's worked on themselves radiates a kind of confidence and what i consider an eerie focus because my brain is scattered everywhere but you're very focused too but you're when you're in here us together you're very focused i haven't done the work man i want i'm more i i'm trying but i haven't done what you've done and you can always tell when you can't fake it that's something really cool about it when someone's done a pull-up they've done a pull-up there's no way to fake it so it's super cool that's sort of and i value it and that's sort of why i i get with the but with the you know the pharmacological interventions right you know because this has been very important to me and it's not only has it well you would argue the same thing with with psychedelics that not only has it helped me with my symptoms it's opened me to all kinds of ideas and feelings and interpersonal experiences well it is what people what ramda says about psychedelics is they showed him a place yeah and these guys they weren't going nuts man he was hanging out with timothy leary and they were drinking lsd like you know the potency of the stuff their tolerance has developed so much that they were sipping out of little flasks of the stuff they said that you've said something there that a lot of people don't know there is a tolerance to lsd huge but i don't believe there's addiction to it i don't think you can get addicted to it it's a different biology it's a different biology but they said that it takes you to this place an expansive non-dual place but then you're right back in traffic screaming at people in a certain amount of time is non-dual me not so it's the idea that uh what we really are is not something separated we're all one consciousness or we literally if you were to zoom we're in the soup we're in the soup yeah we're part of the organic soup or whatever a description the way people have explained it scientifically i just saw a netflix documentary on this is that uh so neurologist a neurologist was talking about how every bit of input that comes into the brain gets filtered through the what is it the hypothalamus or the god jesus it was some i can't remember the name what does it do so it's apparently the sorting mechanism that is the thalamus it's the filtration mechanism that you know right now there's just the switching station it's the thing that autistic autistic people might not have they can't cut out the sign of cars driving when they're talking or they're always distracted so it's this thing that filters all that out yeah and the psychedelic stops that filtration so you the holistic that's it yeah so you merge into the whole dr drew i wanted to ask you a question this is a completely off topic from where we're going here but this is a question that my brother's wife who is a huge fan of yours i wanted to ask which is can you tell when a child is going to be a sociopath well you you if you can actually there are behaviors early that sort of and i really what you can tell is a psychopath sociopaths are a little harder um psychopaths hurt animals it's really easy and psychopaths are always hurting other kids and always in the office and are never responsible for anything always other people's fault you know what one of the issues again the important thing for the child is to be able to trust closeness with adults if they leave that frame they start relying on themselves and not trusting anybody and they they oftentimes particularly they've been traumatized will not the develop the capacity for empathy and that lack of empathy is the risk factor for all these narcissistic problems that's that's a shorthand for a very complicated thing but if your child is you know and again they're particularly there's criminal behaviors early you can intervene and maybe change the direction of all that but man you got to work hard and it's and some people would argue you can only change so much because there is a genetic biological component to severe sociopathy like psychopathy wow that is that is nuts to think so how much the guy named you see Irvine right here and name you should interview him name Fallon think of think of Jimmy Fallon I don't think he spells it that way maybe that got it and he he's doing research here's that he's doing research on psychopaths and functional MRIs and stuff and looking at the patterns that they all seem to have and he had a bunch of controls and he had a bunch of psychopaths you know documented psychopaths and he was looking through his controls one day and he goes oh Jesus a psychopath amongst the controls well he and his family went in and were and done been controls in quotes turns out he himself had a psychopathic brain he himself and he was like oh shit and he had to look at himself and it turns out he had this crazy course where he was hyper religious and he thinks he was sort of compensating for this proclivity and he says that in a relationship in his family everyone complains he's empty he's uncaring holy shit yeah right you gotta go interview this guy so he was like looking for himself right why he was doing the research yeah maybe that's what motivated the research yeah he didn't know that he didn't think he was a control he went into the scanner as a control that's incredible man this is the classic detective story or the detective finds out he's the murderer that's incredible man that's so why i'm scared by this talk about the genetic predispositions i'm scared of that stuff man it makes me feel out of control genes are not destiny genes of your friends genes are the endowment you start with it's what you do with them that counts because well yeah i that's beautiful but man it just seems like you can really excuse a lot of bullshit by saying i just have a genetic predisposition no see i disagree with that i i i i think that's a cop out thinking that way that i call that stinking thinking that's shitty thinking yeah it's like if you have what if you had a bad leg or something you fucking work harder you don't say hey i can't sorry you can't do that now there may be there may be limits but you do that you do better with what you've got always always always always do you would you consider this is a strange question but do you think that fame could be considered a kind of mental illness i've i've i've been asked that question before i've never had a good answer i would probably say no because i try to be really you know we overuse the term addiction and illness and things like that it's a syndrome for sure wow and it's associated with real consequences and it's uh you know it's in the kind of compulsive addictive narcissistic range and i think what you'd find is for people that um have consequences from fame you're probably going to find other actual illnesses in there for which fame is sort of a symptom or a syndrome associated with it wow yeah it seems like that it seems like a dangerous thing to happen to people and that's part of your job is people are always coming to you asking your opinion on the most recent celebrity who's spiraling out of control i know and i did not intend to in fact i didn't back when i ran a unit i ran a drug in for 20 plus years and and i didn't like treating celebrities they were you know they wanted to be treated special and you don't do that you don't treat them special and and they would fight treat you like shit i watch celebrity rehab i know exactly the yeah that's the kind of thing i dealt with and so it was it was somebody approached me about doing celebrity rehab and i was like that's an interesting idea but impossible no way right and i was literally uh we were pitching it and i thought it's not going to go anywhere and then vh1 expressed interest i was like oh no shit what do i do now and um bob forest he got the hat and the glasses yeah another guy you should talk to he he loved this i'd love to yeah um he sat down across from my office one day and he goes you know i'm so goddamn sick and tired of our patients meaning people we've treated that are celebrities being spoken of as though they're being they're on a publicity campaign or they're at a spa treatment when they get treatment treatment is hard work these people are sick they're dangerously ill we need to do a tv show we show that and i was like oh my god bobby well okay uh if you really if it's your instinct this is the good really we ought to do this i i can kind of forge on somebody to approach me we can actually forge on these like god we gotta do it we gotta do it i was like okay wow now our goal was to do that to show that this is hard work how the work goes these people that are you think are celebrities having a good time are dangerously ill yes life-threatening illnesses and i think we achieved that i think yeah i i i think i think you achieved it i think that there's the problem is that with those cameras floating around you're activating a kind of you're causing these flare these ego flare ups that's right well it's a couple things that one is we treated them we offered them treatment not all not all them took it we offered them treatment for long after the camera that's cool long after i always told vh1 they should take a bow on some of the investments they made like half million dollars of treatment you know for somebody that you know wanted it and they just quietly did it that was the right thing to do i did it for free with them i participated wow it was just the right thing to do we did it um but not all of them wanted it that's fine and and or some of them went back to their pain prescribing doctors and stuff and we knew that was oh my god i i get pain prescribing doctors you mean pill mills all the ones we lost were that died died because of that or they had a medical problem one or the other oh man now that is fucked up when you consider that all my patients when they die they die at the hands of my peers holy they don't dive heroin addiction anymore yeah that it now that is you don't know that no oh it's it's a mess well yeah it's scary you know i took i i my friend gave me xanax a few days ago i've taken it a few times and every time i take it i think this is the greatest feeling on planet earth man this is incredible careful oh i know i mean that's the next thing that follows it is like oh shit that's you can't keep taking xanax i only did it and it stops working and then you take more and then you're addicted i only did it a few times but i i could just and you know i have taken like and i do enjoy narcotics i have taken Vicodin uh and maybe the maybe the hallucinants are preventing the triggering of addiction for you you know what it is man i just feel too like too much of an asshole and if i have narcotics floating around and i find myself like you know i went to a doctor who prescribed uh what do you prescribe uh vivants some kind of like a stimulant and i was taking and i was like i want to write a book so i'm gonna get on speed and write a book so i took vivants wow and i the first day i'm like this is it i'm gonna write a book holy shit first i'm gonna play video games for nine hours straight and then the next day oh this is the day we start writing my friend no writing and then i read like day four i'm like you've been on speed for four days straight you've written nothing so i just dumped the pills into this into the magic you are an addict or you were a meth addict and now you're having this experience going this is the solution i have adult add that doctor's a fucking genius i'm i can't wait to go back and get my refill and then you're the best patient on earth and doctors go our patients are doing great they're so fantastic they're their their personalities have improved they they believe the patients and they oh my god they believe the distortion they don't understand addiction they just don't understand it and it makes me sad and that's that's do you get blowback from pharmaceutical companies no i think people think we that's not the evil empire they're participating it's us it's doctors they they're not being properly trained on addiction they think they don't they're not ill meaning they think they're helping when my heroin addict goes in and says doc i have back pain man i really oh i can't function i gotta do it i gotta do i was concert coming up i'm a lead guitarist but i i gotta get through can you give me i mean i have to have something i can't sleep either i mean i'm born on the road and they're like oh and then and even the patient will say look i'm a i'm a heroin addict i'm a year into sobriety uh and the doctor will say oh thank you for telling me so here i'm just gonna give you 30 viket in and 30 ambient don't don't worry debt in a week that patient's dead in a week what do those doctors do to deal with the guilt from poisoning from giving they just don't understand it they blame the patient do they hear about it did the doctors get a phone call if they do they blame the patient but did they get a phone call from the police saying hey you know you prescribe pills that were found in the bloodstream of a dead yeah they'll know what happened they were they it's finally changing right now california medical association put out an and sort of a circular that is to me was good for the first time in the past they've always went uh geez these opiates they've none shown to have no effect in the benefit long-term benefit for chronic pain patients so so so hey watch out how much you're prescribing it's like no benefit stop prescribing these people are lives are being ruined by this stuff shit yeah no one when they get when you get whenever i get prescribed if i get in you you know i remember when i um i had testicular cancer had one of my balls cut off and i remember my time grab prostate cancer so it's good times wow you had it i had my prostate taken about a year and a half ago wow good times good times man it is all good times radiation therapy oh boy so fun that's when you're reaching for the lsd yeah well i mean i remember the vikin and it was like uh just you know like grit your teeth get through the pain and then take the vikin in when you're not in pain to really enjoy it you are a drug addict well no i'm not i don't i would be you i would be absolutely i would be if i didn't have a toilet in my house that had a flusher on it i would be and i do and i do i i do know that i have to be very very careful about that because the things you mentioned up front you know that it's in my family and you know i do have to watch out but uh i don't i don't do it all the time i mean i only take vikin in like once every couple of days once every couple of days don't do it long no i know of course i i get you have if you have surgery you're going to take viking that's where it goes but you got to make sure after a week you stop yeah you're not going to want to the glow the some you'll be surprised the pain will get a lot worse at the end of the week when it comes time to all of a sudden the pain will start to kick up yeah you will not stop until you stop i don't know what it is but i got lucky enough to be able to like just stop doing it even though i do thoroughly enjoy the experience of being on a narcotic it might be it might be the hallucinogens i mean it might have been you know perhaps it's reduced the triggering yeah right i mean you you quoted line and verse of some data that suggested it can affect addiction and alcoholism i i buy that yeah i i think that could i think it's a combination of that and just not wanting to like turn into a yeah you know you know it will go where it'll go you know it clearly and and before you throw the switch on addiction you do have some control over your use it's once the switch is throwing you lose control that's terrifying that switch man that turns you into there's a real switch huh you there well we think of it that way yeah yeah so once it once the switch i i think i think it's an intracellular mechanism and a part of the brain called the nuclear incumbents it's ventral tegmental firing at an extra extra physiological rate from pharmacology that triggers a second messenger in the cells in the shell the nucleus incumbents that once that gene is sort of properly methylated or whatever it's doing that's it oh god it's like a singularity it's like a black hole once you step beyond and then and then what's yes and then what's fascinating is so now this part of your brain that is supposed to say do that again good for survival good do that again good for survival becomes do that again to use do that again use do that again use and so all the other mechanisms that sit on top of motivation like your thinking your feeling your interpersonal experiences all now serve a fucked up motivation not survival not love your family use you and it's not conscious it's not no it's not that you're not thinking use it's just a motivational color to all the other mechanisms in your brain you just described demonic possession it is a demonic possession so i never thought about it that way but it has that quality it's demonic possession it's it's what you do you're an exorcist you're a modern exorcist that's what you are i'm gonna hang that out now as my shingle you are think about it modern exercise it's true you are that because you you're using a modern language to describe a very ancient problem which is from time to time people who go down the wrong path get it in the old days you go into the wrong part of the forest and a demon jumps into you and tries to use your own body to kill yourself and the people around you yeah and i would say everybody let's stop talking about demons when it comes to the brain let's talk about the brain you know i mean we no longer talk about demons when it comes to our pancreas or our heart we used to do that there too yeah time to stop time to talk about the brain and the psychology of the i love that because that's such a cleansing that's such a that that throws well you know what i gotta say that i think there is some use in spiritual symbolism oh for sure as a way of sort of processing and getting your head around things but but to think of it too literally or i'm more worried about the public lexicon like let's let's let's talk about it more sophisticated yeah no kidding you don't want some of Williams had demons no fuck that he was a priest he's like right that man that man suffered from medical illness that poor man had a couple of medical illnesses and he he died from those illnesses and somebody blinked they should have been on it dr drew i'm not going to keep you much longer because i know you're the busiest man on blenders i got a good 10 more minutes oh you do beautiful great yeah let me check my things here and i think i'm good yeah yeah oh yeah fantastic yeah um the uh i love asking experts on the show too because a lot of people listening you know i've gotten emails from people who are addicted to pharmaceutical a lot of emails from people who are addicted to pills and have are desperate to to solve the problem they've they want to know if they should take ayahuasca because they hear me talk about it they want to know what advice can you give somebody listening out there who right now is let me just say um it's it's a within the remaining 10 minutes it's a big topic um please this you and i may differ on this so let me give my opinion don't do not look for shortcuts please don't it just doesn't go well it just doesn't uh it takes time if you're a paying at your opiate addict with pain you you have to get off the opiates do not get on a replacement therapy like methadone or shaboxone unless they're used solely for withdrawal like for a week only and then off and you're gonna have to be somewhere for about six months at least focusing on your recovery your brain has to change it changes slowly you have to work on right building the biology of a regulating of the brain that regulates which is a whole other podcast for us yes how we build regulatory systems yeah i hinted at it a little bit when i talked about my therapy but there's there's it's all worked out how that builds how we're building regulatory systems in your brain are you talking to this morphogenesis people are talking about no i'm not i'm talking about the ability to to feel okay in your skin you know people one of the main very common reasons people go to drugs and alcohols they were traumatized and they're dysregulated all the time they're in pain they're miserable they're anxious to pay when you've been traumatized or you've had inadequate attachment and childhood the feelings are too prolonged too intense and too negative and so you start looking for solutions to that and that's how people find drugs and if you're genetically wired it's game on you know now you do it and and if you're an opiate addict you are you're in a that is such a tall order it's so hard you have and it's life-threatening you've got to dedicate your life for a while you listen if you had cancer and by the way your prognosis way worse than yours with testicular cancer the opiate addicts prognosis of dying is very high now if i if i you know most cancers are curable or at least highly treatable yes my my prognosis is much better with prostate cancer than all my opiate addict patients you if i said you had cancer you'd have me airlift here fucking that's right right but because it's addiction no no no i can handle this or i can do it i can go back to work don't worry about it yeah it feels like it should be that way it isn't it's a serious illness oh that is a true demon i remember when i had testicular cancer i i told my doctor when i got the diagnosis i was about to go on tour and i'm like uh why don't i just go on tour and i'll come back and he's like what are you talking about you have cancer you're not going on tour man you have cancer you can't put this off we have to get that out of your body right now yeah oh and the evil of these drugs the the opiates is that they really will make you think like you're gonna be all right remember all the thinking is serving the broken broken motivation the patient isn't aware of the motivation is broken they're just aware of their thinking which is all serving the as you call the demon the demon and that's you must feel great man it must be feel good to wake up in the morning and know that you managed to pull some people out of that quicksand it is that's when people ask me why i do it that's the when you see the miracles of recovery it's it's thrilling i mean you can't imagine people who are dying become better than they ever knew they could be they become amazing they become they flourish they i call that full recovery which you don't see that often these days because a lot of people are put on meds and blah blah blah and okay you know that's life saving we're talking about saving someone's life and that may be priority one but i'm interested in this field to return people to flourishing that that's the part of it i like doing you're awesome dr drew thank

And now with us is, holy God in heaven, who is this person? I don't know how I get to talk to people like this. His name, Yoshin David Raiden. He is a teacher at Ithaca Zen Center and he blew my mind during this conversation. If you aren't familiar with Zen, then this is the introduction you deserve. He is a beautiful, brilliant human. And I really hope you will check out his new book. It's called A Temporary Affair. Talks on Awakening and Zen. This is a collection of Dharma talks that he gave at the Ithaca Zen Center as he was undergoing kidney failure. Fortunately for all of us, he got a new kidney. One of his students gave it to him. And so now we have him in this particular swath of the multiverse. If you like him, definitely order his book. That's A Temporary Affair, Talks on Awakening and Zen. And also, if you're interested, he gives weekly talks at the Ithaca Zen Center. You can go to IthacaZenCenter.org to find him and find the schedule. Now everybody, here we go. Let's dive in to nothingness and everythingness. Welcome to the DTFH, Yoshin David Raiden. Yoshin, welcome to the DTFH. It's a real pleasure to meet you. Pleasure to be here. Thank you. Wow, you have been through a lot. How are you feeling? How are the kidneys treating you? Yeah, I feel really well. Everything's worked out. And the ideal wasn't really all that much. Do you ever wonder to yourself, if somehow your life and if your karma, whatever you want to call it, hadn't led you to Zen, what do you think the experience of having kidney failure would have been like compared to what it was like from a lifetime of study? Having happened the way it did, I'm not permitted to reflect on those things. Cool. That's awesome. I will if you want. Oh, I would love it. Yes, I would love it. I would have had to wait to stumble into something else that told me that it is indeed impermanent, the physical stay here. It just depends when you meet it. It's inevitable to meet it because it's inevitable to die. So at some point you're going to get something that says, yeah, that's true. And then you have to decide whether you're going to just ignore it or try to understand it and integrate it. Had you in your life prior to this encountered that reality? Did you make it this far kind of incredible that you made it this far without some physical something popping up that rang the bell? So when you say kidney failure wasn't the first introduction for me, there were many events way before. I had 50 years of since the first time, you know, something pointed me in that direction. Yeah, I just, I really, no matter how much I meditate, I still really don't want to die. And anytime I brush up against that, and even though it's in all of the everything, remember, you're going to die. You're definitely going to die. I mean, depending on what scripture it's some of an entire poem could be, you're going to die. You know, you're going to die, right? What are you doing? You're going to die. You will definitely die. Something about brushing up against that. I mean, it's obviously it's really more poetic and coming from an enlightened mind. But wow, anytime I really brush up against that via some contemplation, a doctor visit. It is the still the worst thing I can I can think of it is still. Oh, is it like that for you? Either a circumstance will happen that forces the issue. In other words, suppose you get into a car crash, and you don't know if you're going to survive it. Right. So then what you'd rather experience or not experience is moot. Yeah. It's right there in front of you. Right. Or if you meet somebody who you trust more than you trust your own mind, that would be a spiritual teacher when you are willing to accept somebody's intelligence as a replacement for your own. Wow. Okay, that sounds a little worse than death. The second part. Well, let's describe it differently then. You fall in love with a teacher. You fall in love with someone who's trying finally going to has the capacity to have it all make sense. Yeah. And it's it's it's really an evolutionary thing. It's not controlled by your will. I love reading Buddhist scriptures stories. I'm taken by the forward in all of these that I've been looking at. Shanti Deva way of the Bodhisattva. Many of them I can't remember the these are Vajrayana Tibetan Zen, we, whoa. But I'm taken by the general. In the beginning, the author will say, you know, I have a clumsy mind. I'm, I'm not enlightened. And then they're considered to be the examples a watermark, what someone you would want to replace your mind with. Have you ever met anyone who just said I'm, I'm enlightened. I'm actually in light. I'm enlightened. You didn't have that beginning thing of like, Oh, no, I'm not even close. To, to be an eye, okay, to be an individual makes enlightenment impossible. Never be such a thing. It never has been. It never has ever been an enlightened individual. Enlightenment even the Buddha. Worst of all, even worse. We got to die. I'm just, I'm just playing, you know, it's even the Buddha would say you shouldn't mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon. So even if somebody's enlightened, he may not be of any use. Enlightened means enlightened, we can use, you know, tentatively use enlightened as someone who's passed through the fear of death. Someone who has died and come back or near death, come back and seen that there is an essence within us. Beyond the death of the individuality. And that person gives a testimony, so to speak. Yeah, that person will teach the gospel or the sutras, which is an attempt to describe what the transcendence of death looks like. But words can't catch it at all. So, you know, it's, it's not good to try to figure it out because the thinking mind cannot approach. It has to be the dissolution of the mind that is identifying itself as a body. And then that mind will suddenly realize I am the mind. I am, I actually am the same. I am the eternally existing one. But the, the individuality was just a mistaken functioning of the mind that I existed as an individual was took place only because the mind thought that the body was itself. And therefore that mind that's thinking the body is the, is the identity can never attain enlightenment because that very mind has to grow quiet or dissolve. Bad news for the mind. They can also be you. That's right. This episode is sponsored by Bluetooth. Listen. I love Bluetooth. I'm a 48 year old cancer survivor. You just live through a pandemic and ask two children.

What you're saying I have read and which is essentially the you that wants to get enlightened will not be the you that gets enlightened. So it's a paradoxical desire. Not quite right. Oh good. The you that asks the question is the you that will become enlightened. But it will stop and will have stopped wearing a garment that was identifying its, it was identifying as itself and it will see itself face to face. It will know, here I am. I am the truth. I am the way. None cometh to enlightenment. It will know that. Instead of knowing itself with the garment, I am the body. I am David. The same mind. So is this an issue of circumference? Is this an issue of just the circumference of identity naturally gets wrapped up in the body. And within that all the suffering happens because you have to defend the body, feed the body, make the body look pretty and do all the things and it's all the suffering. So if you if that circumference either is eliminated or even expanded, then then you would expect whatever it was you thought you were to change with that expansion. But that depth, the depth into which the ignorance has settled in the mind makes it very difficult, very difficult. Ever since ever since you appeared in this world from the very first moment you appeared in this world, you were told that you had a name and a body. That's the first thing you ever learned. So the mind is building a structure based on an assumption that it takes to be a reality and not a misinformation. It's a lot of coding, a lot of programming, a lot of coding. And therefore, since it is so deep in the mind, the loss of that thought is the fear of death. It's the same thing. As soon as you receive the name and identity, you're also implanted with the fear of death, the natural. That's why it's so deep. That's why, you know, very difficult. Is it, I mean, this is, I'm sorry if this seems like a softball question, but is it kind of hopeless? I mean, this thing you're talking about, isn't it just in this, that thing you're talking about, doesn't it go beyond just somebody gave you a name and told you what a good boy and a bad boy is and you went into the world and all that stuff. Isn't it somehow much deeper than even that? Like we're talking, you know, when you see those depressing videos of landfills where they're just like, you know, compressing garbage on top of garbage on top of garbage. Is it more like that? Yeah, probably worse. I mean, you know, for those of us who were raised in the West, there isn't, especially going back to my childhood in the 40s, 50s, there wasn't even a fragrance of these teachings out there. Nothing. There was nothing. For me, when I went to parochial schools, we think it would have some smattering of spirituality, but it had none. And it wasn't until my psyche was threatened during drugs usage that the need to see into the nature of the mind became the primary activity of my life, but if I don't know what I knew in that moment, then I'm going to waste my life on futile activities. So that kind of experience happened to me in the early 20s, and then, you know, things followed after that. I played Hansel and Gretel, pick up the breadcrumbs. I kind of liked that. I mean, you really found some great crumbs. You... I had good teachers. But you're a renowned teacher of what I consider to be of all the forms of Buddhism, the most frustrating and confusing, and most of them are frustrating and confusing to some degree. But Zen, wow, it's just so simple. Yes. Yes? I suppose you met a beautiful woman. I'm assuming that's the gender you prefer to be intimate with. Yeah, I'm married, I can't... Oh, okay, so suppose you meet a beautiful woman and she looks back at you with some inviting glance or open glance. And you approach her just looking at you. Effortless activity. You wouldn't have to read a book. What do I do next? You wouldn't have to read a book. Gee, where's this? What did Plato say about it? You just, hi. Yeah. That's how it is when you see it. You could have read a thousand books on Vajrayana, Minayana, Mayana, Zen. It will have nothing to do with anything. Yeah, like those are all just sort of romance, but I mean, you know, you can read a thousand romance books, but until you have experienced what is the core of them. Let me share with you an old friend of mine, younger, you know, he was a kind of peripheral student of mine. He's probably now up the 30s, 40. So he was driving down the highway, and there was a huge pile up. He was in a five-car collision. Part of it was a trip, an 18-wheeler and things. And he was right smack in the middle of the five cars when his car was crushed. And when he opened his eyes, his bones were sticking out through his skin, and he had lost all of his flesh on one side of the body. And they told him that they wouldn't be able to get him out for an hour. So he was in huge, huge pain. And then, because we spoke together after. He had remembered a teaching that said when you have physical pain, move towards it, not away from it. Okay, so that's what came to him. And he might have heard it as a sentence once longer. But he moved towards the pain of his body being in this unbearable pain. Yeah, so he moved towards it. And he said as soon as he moved towards it, he was catapulted out of the body and was sitting on the roof of the car looking at his body in that position. And then the pain came back so bad that he was doing so he had to go back into breathing himself into me. And then again catapulted out. He was making that circle for an hour. And he wrote to me, he can't believe how fortunate he was to have that experience. He said, before that happened, no one could have given me a billion dollars to go through that experience. And now that I went through it, even if somebody offered me a billion dollars for that experience not to happen, I wouldn't take it. Because now I saw the whole thing clearly. Now I saw the nature of reality. I saw where I go to after death. I saw the death of the body was not the death of the self. I saw it all. And he was just crying in joy. But a billion dollars he would have paid not to have to go through that. Because the pain was so intense. That was just a few weeks ago, a few months ago. How's he doing now? Is he better? He's feeling out in Santa Cruz, surfing. He put him back together. He put him back together in four months he was walking around. What about effortlessness? Effortlessness. Why is that, at least from the outside, why does that seem frustrating to some people, this effortlessness that you're talking about? Why does that upset people? People are addicted to solving problems through thinking. And then when you have a practice that's designed to dissolve, to relax the thinking activity, let's just say it. Thinking, thinking you can't believe it, it doesn't know how to do it. I can't do it. It's very frustrating. People cannot meditate. People are that which makes meditation impossible. You mean not that people can't meditate, but the being a person makes meditation impossible. Correct. And so when, as a person, you sit down on the cushion, you're doing something impossible. Correct. Impossible for what you take yourself to be. It's the calming, the calming of the mental conversation. And you can't calm it through activity. You can make certain gestures, you know, count the breathing, breathe out through your left nostril, pull your belly in, push it out. But none of that will awaken you. Awakening is actually the simplest thing that you can do. It's not a complicated thinking activity. Thinking is what people rely on and the nature of thinking is suffering. It is not that thinking can cause suffering. Thinking is suffering. So you're using a vehicle that is suffering to try to find the way out of suffering. And that can't be done. Is happiness a flavor of suffering? That's my one. Happiness is only, happiness is, no, suffering is a form of happiness. Only if you're very happy when you suffer. I mean, the two, the... That's great. I'm curious about the... If there is a connection between the awakened mind and the thinking mind. It's sort of like, even if it's, you know, in reverse, like the idea that if I see a thing and then I turn it into, I think of it's opposite. Or if, and maybe this is impossible because you're saying you're not going to think your way out of this. But I'm, or you shall know the father by the son. So can from the, even the most sort of annoying, intrusive, meaningless thought, is there some possibility of extrapolating from that the awakened mind? Yeah, I suppose. It's not, it's not something that, that you lack and then you suddenly discover you have. It's something that you are from the beginning. How do you realize what you are, what you originally were, sometimes called the original phase? How do you realize your original phase? There is no way to just, it's not hard. Look, when you're sitting on the cushion, okay, imagine you're sitting on a meditation foot and you're breathing. Okay, and you're, you're aware of the breathing. That which is aware of the breathing is the awakened mind. It's not complicated. When you are walking, when you are aware that you're walking, that awareness is the Buddha mind. It is the original nature of mind. The mind falls into the, I am walking being the body. Not, I am the awareness of the walking body. It's starting to make a separation between the body and the witness of the body, which is not a spatial separation, I would say. No, no, really no separation. What makes a separation is thinking. Right. But then the mind, you know, body and mind then have to be recognized based on this new information. In other words, the mind, the thinking of the one who's pursuing the wisdom inside. Okay, the one who's pursuing it is, wait a second. I have been calling myself a body, but now that I've been practicing, and I realize that I am that which experiences the breathing. And the breathing is an object I am experiencing. Clear as daylight, the same way you see a tree, you see the breathing. The mind is starting to recalibrate. Now, so wait a second, how does this all work? My nature is the awareness. So what's the body doing now? What happens to the body before it was myself? Now, wait a second, it's an object that I'm looking at. So recalibrating that is, you know, that's what fills up sutures. Recalibrating, not the, okay, that makes a lot of sense. When you caught a glimpse of this in a stable way, did you kind of feel like not talking about it or did you feel shy? Did you feel shy about it or a sense of like, I don't want to say anything. I don't want to jinx it or something. Yeah, that's why people talk about how important silence is. Because it's only in the silence that you awaken and become aware of the awareness. The awareness becomes aware of it. The parking is going on, or even some degree of thinking is going on. Then your awareness gets lost in the object it is experiencing. So in order for it to see clearly, then it needs to be some level of silence. So theoretically, there are countless people out there who have had this simple yet somehow unattainable or rare encounter and have just chosen to not talk about it for their whole lives, maybe. Just never say a thing. Until they got a good offer from YouTube. Until they started it. No, I mean, even if you have the vision, even if you have it, it gets covered over. So you have to learn, even after you have the experience, you need to learn how do I function in this world now knowing this. How do I function? That's also part of the journey. I'm interested in this. If anyone who's on the, whatever you want to call it, anyone who gets caught by this stuff, there is a great deal of writing about, I'm so happy it's there, about your practice. Here's a form and here's how you might sit. Here's where you rest your attention. But the, after the glimpse or whatever you might call it, I really can't bring to mind specific instructions of like, now this is, this is how you calibrate as you said. That would be a mistake. That would be a mistake. Because once you start conceptualizing and conceptualizing the experience, then it's not the experience. So as long as you're there, you cannot have the experience in its forms. That's why our teachers had retreat times. There were times when you have a retreat, where you set up a situation where silence and there's no need for thinking. The fundamental nature of a retreat environment is there's no need for thinking so that you can arrest the mind. But really when you live out everyday life, it's better to just be simple, be gentle, be kind, be forgiving. You never want to hurt your mind because you realize your mind is God incarnated. That is how God incarnates through the human mind or through the mind. And so you should treat the mind as divine. You would never treat something that you love and honor in a way beyond anything humanly imaginable. There's no way you would want to let anger into that environment. There's no way you would like to have aggression come into that environment. There's no way that you would do anything that would pollute the psychological state. I mean, what did teachers say, love thy neighbor as thyself, be a peacemaker, be the children of God, the meek shall inherit the earth. This is telling me how to function before and after. Before you can't even do that. I can love everybody better than him. Right. No. So before and after those things apply. Those would be the guides to have them there. Not remembering the experience and trying to reproduce it because you can't reproduce it out of the past. You need the essence of the present moment. So there's no climbing in. There's some backstair. I'm going to find one. There's my way to the other group. Backstair, please. Thank you, Squarespace for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

I think you'll be quite thrilled. But let's let's talk a little bit more about this landfill situation. Is the landfill God? I mean, is the you know that. Yes. Please elaborate. Okay. When you have a dream at night. Okay. Are you the dream or are you not the dream? The entirety of the dream or not? No, not both. I would say, I mean, in the sense that that's the answer. Yes and no. The mind essence never incarnates. But when God manifests, it manifests as the oneness of all appearances. In other words, the dream doesn't have separate souls and there's only one source of existence of the characters in the dream. That source is the dreaming mind. And when you see that the seat in the waking state, the existence doesn't sit inside the body. Okay, so now I'm going to say something that you might want me to explain. What's actually sitting inside the body is the entire universe. Yes, I would love for you to explain that. Okay. When you see, when you hear a bird. Okay. Where do you, what do you actually hear? Sound waves. You're actually hearing the vibrations of the sense organ of the body, correct? Correct. What you are hearing is the vibration of the eardrum that gets transmitted through a very complex structure. And then the bird sound appears. What created the bird sound? Human body appeared as the bird sound. That is, yeah. When you see a tree, yeah, what are you seeing? What you're actually seeing is your retina. The body creates the tree. The body and the tree are not separate. The only reason that you think that the tree is over there and you are in here is because thinking has inserted a self inside the body and claims that it is doing the seeing, but it's not doing the seeing. You don't see the tree. You know, when you say things like that, do you know these days what you're supposed to say before it? Spoiler alert. Spoiler alert. Spoiler alert. People know you're about to wrecking ball their entire, their entire reality. It's a love note. I know. Don't be afraid of the dissolution. Start to develop a fondness for fear. Start to develop a fondness for corpses. Start to develop a fondness. Turn your mind around. Fear is the invitation to the transcendment. It's the ego's last stand. The last ditch effort of the mind that's calling itself the body. It's sent you from exposing its non-existence. And so start whenever you find fear in your life. Whenever, you know. Whenever you find fear, stop and honor it. And be there with it. You not want it to go away. The wanting of fear not to be present like what empowers the fear, the experience, that makes it more and more dominant and impossible to deal with. So any, any time that comes into your mind, you know, a fearful moment, breathe. Try to resolve it in thinking or in emotion. Try to resolve, try to use awareness, be aware of its existence and aware of the breathing and that you're going to stand empty and non-reactive behind with the breathing and experiencing the nature of the experience in fear itself. That's how we start to approach it, prepare. It's one of the practices. It's why in the old days people, part of the practices would be to go meditate in cemeteries and things like that. But you don't have to do that. Anytime fear appears. Don't regard it as something you want not to happen. What is the difference between fear and bliss? Is there a difference? Is fear just some, like if we're, you know, if we're some kind of synthesizer of possible experiences, fear just a key. As you're saying, just running through the same circuit board. In other words, if you start, as you were instructing, being with the fear, not running away from the encounter with it and then spending time with it, is there some possibility that you would get to realize it wasn't even, that's not fear. That's bliss or joy or some other thing altogether. Well, you're married. Yes. Fear and bliss are the same. But let's talk about a little bit differently. The joy is the moment the mind realizes that it can handle it. Never thought it could handle it. It always was panicked and run away as you've decided, okay, have me fear. You can take over my mind. I am not leaving or turning you away. The mind will be there in this intensity of fear. And then it will gradually, the intensity will start to fade. And it will become more wordy than energy. And then the mind will realize, I have nothing to fear but fear itself. I don't need to fear fear. It's one of the famous practices of the path, making trends with fear. Making trends with all negative emotions. When you make friends with fear, is it still fear? As one might say, oh, you're gay. You know, it's what it is. I can't tell you. Fear is the name that the mind puts on an energy. But fear is never fear. Fear is always intensity. It is an imbearable intensity. So we call it fear because we put names on everything. We put a word love on something. Is that word love of anything to do with the actual experience of being loved? No, it's not. Fear is better to describe as intensity. And usually fear can be described as the desire not to have this experience under any circumstances. Or definition. Never. Yes. And then you suddenly realize that that's not true. You are capable of having that experience. But in order to do that, you have to be very, very open and still, you know. I'm really intrusive for that practice to be totally accomplished. You have to, if you want to get your spiritual student of the month award. I do. I would love one. And then it's even in the face of loss of life. Like my friend, you know, who would want to go through an experience like that. But then having the hell that he had a nature that was untouched by what was going on was worth more than a billion dollars of gold. It's like, how much money would you pay to never have the fear of death? Right. How much? A lot. A lot. One of the lengthier times I had was the kidney failure situation. So there were times when it got a little bit... more acute than it was supposed to because my daughter was going to donate a kidney. And so the doctors didn't want to put me on dialysis because the transplant was so close. So they were walking on a fine line because if your kidney fails beyond a certain point, then you have to have dialysis when you're dead. And they were pushing that line. I think when the surgery was finally happening, I had something like 100%, like 7%, 8% of the kidney function, like 6%, something. And then my daughter developed a urinary tract infection on the day that he was supposed to have the transplant. And that completely disqualified. And she had an incompatible protein. So another friend in the Zen Center said, here, let me do this. I would love to donate kidney. So it takes about... they put her on very fast track, like to try to... a lot of tests that a donor has to go through to make sure that it's okay. And so it's fast-tracked, but by the time even the fast-tracked before it got clear, I had crossed the line. We had to have dialysis. So they had to put in a temporary port to do dialysis. And sometimes it reached really challenging moments, you know, tricks to the emergency room because of the kidney failure, blood pressure, heart condition. So there was all this stuff going on that had a potential for fear in it. But I never experienced fear. And it was so surprising to me. I was laughing because I was laughing because I thought, how powerful the Dharma teachings are, how incredible the wisdom is. You can go into the emergency room and the people, very, very, very well. And you're just completely unbothered. That to me was a very powerful affirmation of the Dharma teaching and the Dharma wisdom. Yes. That was okay. That was that. And then the kidney transplant worked well. And so now my health is pretty good. And that was three years, three and a half years. Three and a half years ago. So these, I never wrote a book, you know, this book, the book of talks that Rick was recording. And I was just giving talks to the community. I have one. I've never written anything like that. I wanted to ask you about your talks. I was curious only because I think maybe this is just stuff you hear. I don't know. But how much do you prepare for your talks when you go to give a talk? Do you have a set plan or are you purely spontaneously sort of emanating from that place? I feel like my whole life is a preparation to give a talk. I usually don't, I never talk from a text. It's like, okay, today we're going to study the Diamond Sutra. No, it's too dry for me. It's not alive. It's like, I don't know. Darling, I want to kiss you. Let's put on masks on. Let's do it. That's beautiful. I'd rather have COVID and kiss you with a mask. Quick, let's go get tested. Let's strike while the iron is hot. I have swabs. Are we allowed to be this silly or is this going to ruin all of us? This is the best. Yeah. What are we talking about? I just am so happy. Oh, we like to prepare for talks. Yeah, preparing for talks. Essentially, when I give talks, and these talks especially, because these talks were given in the proximity of fifth stage kidney failure. Yes. End stage renal failure. At that time, I thought, well, I can just share with the community, this is what it's like to have end stage renal failure, in light of the wisdom of self not being defined by the body as its identity. So I would just talk about that from different angles, mostly, or different things like that. I think in the book, and the book Rick recorded all these talks, wrote the preface. When he was saying now, he was surprised, I never seem to show up with notes. Yes. But I don't need to have notes to talk with you. And talking to my students is like talking to you. Wow. Well, suppose I said to you, you know, I don't know what, but suppose you had a question, and I said, well, let me look it up. That would be ridiculous. Yeah, I didn't think of that. You're right. That would be really... I'm asking that not just because of how, you know, from the outside it's impressive to be able to do that, but I'm also curious regarding sort of the... Dharma is frequency. In other words, as you said, so someone gains realization, and then when they're talking, it's the Dharma. It's just this coming out of them. You know, you see those beautiful sand mandalas that the Tibetans do, and they throw them in the river. And sometimes I look at that, and I'm thinking, I don't know if they memorize that. I feel like they're just doing it, that it's just coming out of them. Is that BS? Is that not real? Or is this a memorized thing? But also when someone like you begins speaking, as you said, there's no notes. And yet, you know, it's okay. You're checking off all of these answering questions. It's sort of helping you align bits of a puzzle that have been scattered all over your table. So I guess I'm... Is it that you're sort of like a radio now? In other words, like you're tuning in this thing that is this omnipresent sort of reality, truth. And then when you start talking, it just, that's what comes out. Not to say it would always be truth that comes out of your mouth. It wouldn't surprise me, but I guess, is it... Where is it? Are we talking about some cosmic radio signal? What is this thing? I suppose you walk into the Louvre? Yeah. Is that where Mona Lisa lives? That's the Louvre. You go into the Louvre, and you're looking at Mona Lisa, okay? Then someone says to you, you need to describe the Mona Lisa for me. Then you say, well, don't look and use a book. You describe the Mona Lisa because you see it. Yeah. So once you've seen it, you're just describing what you saw. Not describing... It's not like you're reading a text and you took notes on what you saw. Not coming from the notes of what you saw. It comes from the actual seeing. Yeah. Well, if I go in, I say... I don't know. I never know what I'm going to talk about, but usually I see people sitting in front of me. It depends on... It just depends on the situation. Most people are helped more... Most 95% people are helped more by a teaching that says, never respond aggressively when something hurts you. 95% of people will get more benefit from a teaching like that than they will from the self-nature that resides outside the human body and mind. They're not inside. They're teaching. So there's a whole collection of teachings. How to prevent the mind from what it considers justified negativity. In other words, if somebody does something outrageous to you and aggressive response appears to be natural, if I don't respond this way, I'm being hypocritical and sincere, and all that sort of mind will be making arguments to produce negativity. 100%. And to go against that, to realize that the quality of my life is going to be what I do at this moment, if I respond with anger. That's my making my life angry. It's a hard work experience. So therefore... I just... Thank you. So therefore, I should cultivate an awareness of my emotional state, that my mind becomes painful. I should realize that it's my responsibility. The quality of my mind should not be in the hands of external people or circumstances. The quality of my mind. I am protecting my mind from going into negative experiences and the most powerful protection that which enhances your ability to do that and is the willingness to lose. This is problematic for me. And you have described, if you mapped it out, here's my fear. Especially these days, there's lots of talk. Boundary. Healthy boundary setting in a relationship. Boundary setting with kids. Boundary setting with everything. Boundaries, boundaries, boundaries. And the encroachment upon these boundaries that you have set. Generally, healthy boundaries. Expectations that seem normal. Like, is it wrong that I want my wife and children to fully prostrate to me when I walk through the door? Come on, this is what I deserve. I want a bow, bells, incense. I can't get them to do that. They generally inform me. There is one way, there is one way that you can get them to bow to you in gratitude. As for divorce. Ouch! A roast from a sin master! A roast from a master! Ouch! That's too... Laughing so hard, it's got me crying over here. I hope you, I hope you have a good editor. You think I'm going to edit that out? That's going on a highlight, real friend. But I'm sorry for my lame joke, which was followed by a well-deserved roast. But, you know what I mean? The healthy boundary setting. And within that, if an argument emerges in most relationships, whether it's between countries or friends or husband and wife or brother or sister, usually there's some sense you've encroached upon this boundary and it's unacceptable. And I need to speak up for myself. And you need to apologize or there should be some recognition of a misstep here. And that if one or the other decides to say, all right, fine. You can, what you did was fine. To lose that over time this behavior will result in a kind of oppression, the possibility of being so backed into a corner that you, there's no escape and you're just sort of not who you were anymore. You're some kind of, you know, a henchman or something, a non-autonomous henchman who's just like, not fully being themselves. So how do we, in those situations, I mean, how do you, you know, with, not to like over dramatize it, but we certainly with Hitler, I mean, thank goodness we weren't like, you know what, we're going to lose this one. You know, so how to, can you simultaneously lose and win or how do you maintain boundaries while allowing yourself to be wrong? Well, there is room for common sense in the human world. And if, if you have to take action based on compassion, that you have to take action to avert a greater evil, you know, that you can do that suppose somebody's coming with a knife to kill somebody, capable of hitting that person with a car and you're driving, for example, that would be a compassionate act. Hitler thing is so far downstream. It's so hypothetical for us to talk about it, but people like to play the Hitler card. So let's scratch it from the record. It's a hacky interview question. Scratch it from the record. Let's bring it down to earth. You, this didn't happen to me, but let's say you wake up, you make breakfast for the kids, but you weren't paying attention to the clock and you didn't make breakfast in time. And let's say that your wife is like not happy because you weren't paying attention to the clock. You wanted to make biscuits for the kids and you felt like saying, look, I was trying to make biscuits for the kids. Are you mad at me? Don't you see I was trying to make biscuits for the kids? Wrong. That's not what you say. What do you say? You say, I'm sorry I'm such a schmuck. I can't even keep track of time. I did the best I could and I'm really sorry. I'm sorry I let you down, kids. Missed the school bus and I got to come late into class. Everybody's going to make fun of you. I'm sorry. Think what the energy of the situation is. When you say it was my fault, it was real. I just didn't pay attention. I'm sorry, that's all I can tell you. And that'll create a certain environment and you say, I did the work. Think of the environment that leads you. It's learning how to take care of the quality of the emotional situation rather than taking care of the circumstances. When your focus is only on the circumstances, then you want your performance to be acknowledged. But if you're focusing on what's going to make a harmonious environment to live in, then you take the blame. Then everybody feels better. Everybody knows you're sorry, you take your power. I wrote, there was a time, probably about seven, eight years ago, I had some really skillful, a long story. You can delete out what you wanted this story with. I had a friend, a brilliant blues guitarist. He was at this kind of health retreat that we sometimes had. A brilliant blues guitarist. He didn't want to play rock or blues anymore. He only wanted to play flamenco. He was a brilliant blues guitarist. He had a big heavy metal band in the 80s. Then he went into Zen and he thought flamenco is more spiritual. Something like that. Anyway, so I said to him, if I wrote you a blues song, would you write the music for it? And he said, you didn't need to write a blues song. Can you just sing a play the blues? I said, no, I feel like writing a song. So I wrote a song that night, a long song. And it goes something like, the lyrics go something like, I got the runaway blues and you're tracking me down. I got the runaway blues and I know I've been found. I'm down on my knees, you can take me now. I will cut off my head if you just tell me how. And you smile, maybe shed a tear and say, that's what I've been waiting to hear. And you pick me up and put me down. It goes on to a point of how could I ever thought how happy I would be lying in a guy. It's a long song. It's not a CV. It's amazing. I started writing for a while. Yes, I listened to some of your poems. You all about losing. Well, practice how to lose. That was one of the songs on that CD. Practice how to lose. Practice how to lose. Doesn't matter what you want or what you'd rather choose. That was the chorus. Practice how to lose. Then others, they're all about that as a way of life. The meek shall inherit the earth. You'll see that when you refuse to get into a struggle in any situation, if you don't want to go along with the situation, you can just remain silent. If you have sufficient, if the situation is just right for a certain willful act, you can do it. But basically, you can show the environment by your opening. Everybody else is struggling for a piece of the winning action. Right. You no longer are because you've already won. Won by the fortune of who you are. You don't win in the ego realm. There's no winning in the ego realm. Ego is a temporary, impermanent identity. An identity where you gain your victory and everybody applauds you and then the answer won't bother you. This has been my favorite podcast, I think, ever. Thank you. You have truly just been so generous with your time. Thank you for this. Folks around you, and I think if someone hears this, can they come see you give Dharma talks? I give Dharma talks every Sunday still. And then we have retreats now. These health and physical and spiritual, they're called body, mind, restoration retreats. Your stories help your body and mind. And I give a talk each night. These are done live or via Zoom? I know you're at IthakazinCenter.org. Only live. Wow. Only live. And then, oh no. Sunday morning is Zoom. So on Sunday morning, they can see you on Zoom. Are these also, is there meditation involved with the talks? Are you doing any online meditation with folks? Most of the people who come to the Zoom lecture are sitting there with a coffee and a Danish. That's awesome. It's my impression. When I look into their eyes, I see nothing. But the people come, you know, and they get what they get. And sometimes you repeat something a hundred times, and maybe one time something happens in life that affirms what you've been told. The Dharma protects you from the seductiveness of aggression. And you feel food. I think there's a scripture somewhere that says the happiest moment in the life of a yogi is when he lets go of an aggressive response where before he knows he will have the happiest moment of life. I get it. I get why that would be. The spiritual world has different causes for happiness than the material world. The material world happens with its pleasure and money, and the spiritual pleasure is a tranquil mind. And really, though I don't mean this in the wrong way, but it's the glory of God. The ultimate glory of God is that God, the pure consciousness, the human mind, that it can bestow life on a human being. And that human really doesn't exist, but can think that he exists. And that's if he exists. He doesn't exist. Greatest glory of God. Create existent, non-existent future. Apparently existent. All human beings are born from that function that the divine performs. It sends the Holy Spirit, so to speak, into the human mind. And the Blessed Virgin receives the Holy Spirit and starts to exist. All that's a metaphor for how it all takes place. Wow. Thank you. Yeah, that's a happy moment. When you realize that even these holy, screwed up scriptures have secret meanings in them. Yes. Yes, it is. I know. It's exciting. It's also exciting to have someone like you to confirm certain intuitions with. You know, it's nice to bounce ideas around with someone like you. In fact, sometimes I feel like my podcast is some kind of trap for people like you, but somehow I get lucky enough to talk, to get in an hour, over an hour to process things with you. I can't believe I get to do this. Thank you. No, thank you. For me to be with someone who's interested in the Dharma, one of my happiest times. Well, after this, you are going to, many people are going to reach out to you because this is a mind-blowing conversation. You know, two very close friends of mine have moved on interviews with. They both wrote endorsements of the book that was published. Trudy Goodman and Jack Coimby. Yeah, I believe it. I mean, I can see how you all are friends. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, yeah, when any time I get a chance to talk with him, I just feel really lucky. Yeah, I got to stop being such a jerk, man. I'm so aggressive. I got to stop. Oh, he's trying to win. Like even when I think I'm not trying to win, I'm trying to win. It's under the shirt. It's like very deep. It's, it's not, I mean, like I get what you're saying. Like I can, I can sort of stuff it down. Yeah. But I know it's still present. It's still visible. It's like when you don't take a shower and you have BO and you try to put, you know, deodorant over your smell. Did you take deodorant? I was soaking. Yeah. But you know, it's like, because they're bubbles coming out of your arm. Foam. Foam. Yeah. Foam. That's, you know, but that is what I mean. I do think that like, or, you know, when you have a cavity, you can brush your teeth. You can floss, but if you've got a rotten tooth, it's people can smell it. And this aggression you're talking about an emanation of the landfill or something, even if I'm like, all right, I'm going to lose this time. I feel like somewhere in there is an air of it, a sense of, of it. They don't buy little though. Once just seeing the path is joyous. Maybe it can't walk it. I know I can't walk it yet. I know what the path is now. Right. I can, I know how to work with my mind to keep it. If I get into any time, you should, you know what, you can look at it this way. Any time you experience stress or painful mental state, you did it. And you can undo it. It's not the circumstances or the other people. I have the capacity to calm my mind. And you can do it by going for a run or jumping in a pond or whatever, you know, don't be attached to sitting in medication as the path to get rid of it. It's just a clogging, it's a clogging of energy that needs to be unclogged. Going for a run is really, or whatever. Anyway, please take good care of yourself. It's been a pleasure speaking with you. I pray that we get to do this again sometime. I would love to have another conversation with you any, any time you're, anytime. And I will, uh, uh, oh, where can people find your book? Amazon.org? Oh, Amazon. Okay. I will have all this. Target. It's a target. That's awesome. I will have all the links, uh, to, uh, to, I'm sorry.

If you're listening to this, and it is the week of December 2nd, then I am at a meditation retreat in Hawaii. So I don't have a lot of time to do any kind of intro. I do want to say I hope you all are doing great and that you haven't succumbed to this new nipple scorpion plague that's been scorching so many of us here in LA. These dumpster scorpions have been skittering out and getting into the pipes and climbing up through the pipes and clamping onto so many people's nipples at night that it's making it really difficult for a lot of us to get a good night's sleep. Because apparently the sting of these things is 16 trillion times worse than being shot in the stomach by a gun, and I just don't want to feel it. But they're out there, so if you want to protect your nipples, I recommend wearing steel bras or even velvety bras, just any kind of soft bra, which is what I've started wearing at night. I don't want to get preachy here, but I would hate to hear about anybody else's nipples being mangled by these horrific crustaceans. We have got an incredible podcast for you today. I am headed this afternoon to my friend, Cole Marta's Ketamine Clinic, which is in Larchmont Village in Los Angeles. It also is a place where MAPS has been doing the MDMA studies to find out if MDMA is a viable treatment for PTSD. So to me, this is a sacred place where some incredible healing work is being done, and I really can't wait to have a conversation with one of the people who is making it happen. That's Cole Marta, and we're gonna listen to this conversation right after this. Publish a manifesto online, or just pictures of your own behind. You can do it on Squarespace.

Now, without further ado, returning to the DuncanTrussell family, our podcast is one of the most brilliant doctors I have ever met in my life. He is at the forefront of psychedelic medicine and the hard work he's been engaged in is going to change the world. Also, if you're someone who lives in LA and you're struggling with depression, I could not recommend someone more if you're interested in trying ketamine therapy. And all the links you need to find, Cole will be located at DuncanTrussell.com. So without further ado, my dear friend, Dr. Cole Marta. Dr. Marta. Yes. It's so good to see you, man. It's good to see you too. And to see you here. Yes. And what is the name of this clinic? It is the California Center for Psychedelic Therapy. Okay. And it is, as far as I know, the first of its kind. First of its kind, certainly in LA. And, yeah, we specialize in psychedelic therapy at our clinic. What makes it different from other ketamine clinics or why is it the first of its kind? So it's not the first ketamine clinic, but I've been working with ketamine since 2015. And what I think is different about our approach here is that all of the members of our team also do psychedelic research for other research projects, like the MAPS MDMA Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD study. Right. And so they're experienced in working with psychedelic experiences. So we do ketamine assisted psychotherapy. We don't just administer ketamine, for example, many of the clinics, they just are administered ketamine. And then the ketamine induces a psychedelic or otherwise powerful experience. And they're left kind of just to digest that at home. Right. So our rooms are designed to be a comfortable set and setting. And we have trained therapists to work with the psychedelic experience and integrating that experience after the treatment. I got you. And this is a, this really diverges from what some ketamine clinics are doing. Right. I mean, I know that I've gotten calls from friends who have gone to ketamine therapy, and they've just had the experience. Right. And they're confused. And the doctor has said something along the lines of, yeah, just make sure you get an Uber. Right. Don't drive. Right. So this is a real like ego shattering experience. Right. So is ketamine therapy, is it just follow-up or do you prep people beforehand with some sessions? So we do an intake session with most people, and then we'll do a series of treatments, typically in the beginning, because that's what the data recommends, actually, is a series of treatments. And we'll do 90 minute sessions, 90 minutes to two hours is the amount of time we recommend people stay here. Wow. It turned out when this intranasal ketamine hit the market for S ketamine, they were really pushing hard their sort of, their safety standards and safety recommendations based on what they had. And luckily, our clinic was sort of pretty much entirely in line with what they had recommended. They recommend people not drive. They recommend people be under direct medical supervision for 90 minutes. They recommend people have two hour appointments. So we really had to like adjust very little. And the ketamine experience is, you know, 45 minutes at the most. So we have time in that 90 minutes to two hours to have our, you know, all of the people who work with patients here are licensed or training psychotherapists. So they're working with mental health professionals. And they have that 45 additional minutes to stay here and integrate those experiences. This brings me to something I've been wanting to talk with you about. And it's come up in other podcasts and in just conversations in general, the ketamine experience, especially when I'm just naming the therapies that I know of that are happening legally right now. It's ketamine and MDMA with your study. But the ketamine experience is at least for me and other people I've chatted with. And also if you read John Lilly's writings and his very detailed map of the ketamine universe, it is so powerful and so psychedelic and so otherworldly that people experience visionary states, profoundly alien encounters, very odd things. So I'm curious how as a scientist, and not just you, but the scientific community in general, is graphing these hyperdimensional states and addressing it in a way that when you communicate with someone who just went through it, you can connect to whatever the mystical side of things in a non-dry scientific way. Yeah, I think it's important that therapists, at least the way that we work with these states is not that we need to get this experience right, that we are using the right words or that people are correctly reflecting the experience that they had to us. In fact, we encourage them not to worry about that because it can be distracting. What we've found clinically and what a lot of the data has shown from psilocybin research working with psychedelic or with mystical states is that it's just important that people have these experiences. So our approach scientifically is more applying our psychedelic therapy and just general psychotherapy tools for creating a comfortable environment for that experience to unfold. There's no way to predict really exactly what experience people are going to have. People can have vastly different experiences at the same dose and two days apart. But the important thing is to know that it could be incredibly important to them. And to allow them to express that, to help them put words to things if that's what they're trying to do. And generally just treat it with respect. Okay, I see. Yeah, so you don't have to, obviously you're not going to be going scientific materialist with somebody who just said they turned into a flock of birds or something like that. Right, right. But there are the mystical states questionnaire that breaks down sort of known categories of the mystical experience. Yes. And I think that was originally developed in theology, but I wouldn't want to be quoted on that. But the mystical states experiences questionnaire, there are some predictable qualities of these valuable experiences. Ineffability is one of them. So another reason that we don't give people the impression that it's important that they, you know, are able to communicate correctly. Yeah. A lot of times there aren't good words or the experience that they have. Yeah. And an effective ketamine could be that they could have some word finding difficulties. So we really, we invite them to speak after 45 minutes, but we explain that to them before that they may not be in any condition to do that, that it may not feel compelled to do that. They certainly don't have to. Well, this is to me, and, you know, I absolutely love that finally we can legally study these states of consciousness. Right. It's beautiful. But, and I love that you have this wonderful meeting that is happening between the scientific and the mystical and the scientific is attempting to translate the experience of the mystical into data that could be analyzed, which I think is incredible. But to me, there is something so particularly funny. Yeah. Almost Monty Python level funny. Sure. When you hear mystical experience questionnaire. Right. Right. Well, this is the cool thing. Yeah. Like this is, this is the kind of conversation I'd like to have, especially with Duncan Trussell, is like, you know, how else do we validate it though? How do we, how do we show that it's not just the dose of psilocybin that someone gets, or just the dose of ketamine that someone gets, because two people might get the same ketamine experience, but one of them is highly anxious and terrified and never done a psychedelic before, has read weird things on the internet, is generally a sort of nervous person, especially about new experiences, which everyone is. And then that person gets an experience, and the whole time they're resisting the experience, for example. Then another person gets the same dose, and they are an experienced meditator. They're used to going into weird mental spaces. They understand the idea of sort of surrendering and letting go. And they have a total ego disillusion and, you know, oceanic boundlessness, you know, cease to exist experience. At grand unifying, you know, unified with the one consciousness kind of thing. How do we, it's important that we show the value in my opinion. It's incredibly important that we show that it was that experience that may have been the difference between the person, the two people who got the same exact dosing, right? That that experience can be valuable. So, you know, it's not necessarily because we're trying to define the experience for its own sake. It's so that we can have a common language about what it is that might be the actual key factor in these medicines. For example, in the psilocybin study for smoking cessation, they showed just that. They showed that changes in the mystical state's questionnaire were correlated to success in smoking cessation, not dose of psilocybin. Right. And this matches, doesn't, this matches that what AA says, this is the higher power idea. That's what's going to help you with addiction. Possibly, yeah. And, but with ketamine, I'm really interested in it because I have had some pretty good luck as far as being, you know, someone who's suffered from depression more than a few times and they've gotten on medication for depression. Yeah. And it's something that when you've been depressed and you're not depressed, you do some, I sometimes feel that thing of like, man, you have to watch out. You know, it's like the, you don't want it to come back. Right. And that's terrifying. It's terrifying. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That, but I, my experience with it was so profound and it really did. I'm not going to say I'm cured of depression. Like I get down and low sometimes and I feel abnormally low sometimes, but since that, you know, experience and a few after, it's just not the same anymore. It doesn't hit me as hard anymore. It just hasn't happened yet. I'm not saying it won't happen again. Right. And so, so to me, I'm really curious about what happened. I'm curious about, is there, is it the mystical state, the ego dissolution, the reminder that the identity that you think you have is not necessarily the entirety of your identity and the subsequent relief that comes from that understanding, or is it that there is some physiological change that has happened in my brain and then my brain is producing some, you know, I don't know, mental neurotransmitter. Yes. Right. Yeah. And which, so I guess my question is which came first. Yeah. The physiological change of the mystical experience. That's the $50,000 question or whatever. Yeah. It's, but we do know that in all of the data that's validated ketamine for treatment-resistant depression, they did not value this experience necessarily, or they didn't, maybe the researchers did, but that's all, that's a whole nother layer of study than just demonstrating that the medicine has an effect on depression. And all of the studies that were done, that I reviewed, there was no integration, there was an attempt to actually get rid of those unwanted side effects, as they were sort of termed in the papers largely that I saw. And so the ketamine would be administered fairly slowly over a longer period of time. And so that data was extremely promising. That data has led to all of these clinics feeling justified in offering ketamine for treatment-resistant depression. And that is, I would argue, the biological, like fairly purely a biological benefit that's demonstrated there. I think clinically we see even better outcomes when we do account for those. Also, it's just polite not to have somebody have that experience and then demean that experience or belittle it or dismiss it. To just overlook it. Side effect. Right. We know that what people are describing is very similar to the mystical experiences. And we feel clinically that we see people have basically an additional opportunity for healing that could come from those experiences too. Those experiences go very deep, very quickly. And certainly there's profound insights that have been gained from examining those experiences rather than dismissing them or moving on. It's a really, really, really amazing time in the sense that the more accurate you, y'all, the scientists, the researchers become, the more granular the data is because of technology. You know, they're always going deeper and deeper into the ability to scan the brain or to sort of decode what's going on up there to the point where they apparently can take mental images now and at least figure out what people are seeing based on... Based on firing. Yeah, yeah, translate that. This popped up on the internet, but I've heard about it before, but certainly we're not far away from that, especially with AI and quantum computers potentially being able to interpolate whatever energy can be detected in the brain and translate that in a way that we can visually see what's going on, meaning that suddenly what has been the subjective realm and has been completely dependent on the experience or being able to articulate what they've experienced, and that's a hugely limiting factor in the sense that not everybody could suddenly turn into like WB8s or something like that or Terence McKenna. For a lot of people, it's just like, holy fuck. What the fuck happened to me? It was like... But to me, also, the additional benefit to show a person what they saw, to take the interpreted data from brain scans or whatever is around the corner and then show that to people or to study it to look at it as some kind of combo Rorschach or scan of the cell for who knows what. Suddenly, though, we'll begin to have technological maps of the psychedelic landscape. We're up until this point. We've only had linguistic, artistic maps of it, and so that, to me, is wild. That's some crazy shit. That sounds pretty far out there. Far out, but I mean, how far out are we really? No, I mean, just conceptually, that just sounds amazing. And then how do you... That's a chicken or the egg thing, too. Are these images being generated by the conscious self and then interpreted based on conditions in the brain? Yeah. Or are these images being sort of triggered by some sort of external stimulus? Yeah. Most likely a combination of the two? Yeah, right. Yeah, that is very exciting. I think not only for people in the mystical universe, where we've always thought, like, dear god, if I could just get what I've seen into the world in a way that doesn't sound like I want to get my bong painted with a mural or something like that, then it could really, you know, at the very least point to a sort of, I don't know, expression. Or I like what you said about, well, is there some, in the same way, like certain things can see ultraviolet light? Right. Are we picking up some kind of who knows what and our brain in these psychedelic states is allowing us to interpret it visually? Or, you know, is it just a subconscious reservoir that's being accessed by these things either way? Right. To suddenly have the potential for these maps of human consciousness that are accurate and have been, it's just, I don't know, I'm really excited about it. Because what happens if we find out that it is external stimulus? What happens if we do discover, oh yeah, this dark universe, or there's these energy fields that we don't, it's an extra sensory perception. Yeah. Yeah. Would it be? I don't know. I don't know what it would be. Yeah. Would it be that? I mean, I think it would require more study, like always more study, always more study. We're so lucky to have you, man, because you guys are, to me, like the new psychedelic scientist that's out there, the ones I've encountered at like the maps, conferences and stuff. It is so refreshing, because we, by we, I mean, I don't know what you, the seekers, psychedelic seekers, we, you know, get us together, and it's a matter of time before we're talking about time travel, multi-version navigation, communication with aliens, who built the pyramids, which is fun. Yeah. And I love it, and it's certainly one of my favorite, and I know you love it too. But what I love about you guys, because I think you sort of wear both hats really well, in a friendship way, the alien hat can go on you fast, and it's a delight, but always even within that, there is a scientific precision that comes out, which is where you're a willingness to be like, we don't know, or it could actually more likely be this. So that's what I love about this new psychedelic scientist is it is producing a wonderful counterbalance to the woo. And, you know, that marriage between... Which is, yeah, which I hope, you know, I think that that's important that we have that, and I would love to, you know, start exploring the discussion, very, very important discussion about how our, you know, this very sexy topic, this very exciting and stimulating topic, how do we, like, hold that enthusiasm and excitement when the science moves so slow, you know? Like, to do, it's important that we do this, you know, proper scientific investigation, so that we, in my opinion, it's very important that we don't move to some sort of free market system. That's how snake oil, you know, kind of, you know, then it becomes the best sales pitch that determines our sort of most powerful medicines rather than, you know, some actual examination of, you know, I do believe deeply in the scientific method, but it takes a long time, and there are all kinds of ethical considerations when designing studies with human subjects, and so the science moves very, very slow, much slower than the internet's, you know, thirst for information about it and people's thirst for information about it, and how do we responsibly maintain this balance between, like, you know, the need for new information all the time and the actual quality information coming so slowly, like, how do we keep the charlatans from coming in and pretending to know the answers? How do we keep the woo-woo out of, or how do we protect that scientific? How do we protect the, you know, the very important value that we place on doing this properly like this? Right. You know, how do we not succumb to the desire to just, like, you know, listen to the person who seems like they know what they're talking about? Let's cut to a commercial.

And we're back. Charismatics. Charismatics, yes. Yeah, Charismatics. Now, this brings me to a criticism I've heard. I don't agree with it. I love what you all are doing and what you just said I agree with. Yeah. And my old, boring ass, I love where I'm at now, but I do want to bring this up because I've heard the criticism a few times, which is what actually what we're looking at here is they want to license what is a human right that the prescribing of psilocybin, the prescribing of MDMA is actually giving, it's going to create a priest class, so to speak, a psychedelic priest class where it's not really a priest, it's a licensed therapist. And if you're not one of these, then you really don't have the, people should be wary of you. And the critique is, no, this is a thousand year old tradition, technology. It's already does the work itself. If you're an open loving person, you could administer psychedelic therapy. They don't need to go anywhere. And so this is the critique I've heard. How would you address that? So a very, very important distinction, I think, is between the other ways people use psychedelics and using psychedelics as medicine, you know, like that's what I'm interested in researching. I'm always interested to hear what happens in the other ways people use psychedelics. But I don't think that it makes a priest class, I would argue that it doesn't make a priest class to make using psychedelic medicines as four mental health conditions for diagnosed psychiatric conditions. I think if you want to, even if you take that model, the priest class there implies some like professionalism in the education, dedication, some form of oath, some form of accountability. And so I don't think it makes it a priest class thing any more than medicine would already be relegated to doc people. I think the system is in place for a reason. We don't let just anyone practice medicine for a reason. And so when it comes to using these things as medicines, I think it should still be in the hands of medical professionals. When I say medicines, I mean, you know, for a Western medical condition that's been diagnosed in a Western medical tradition, and we're looking for Western medical solutions, and we're applying the Western method of the scientific process and scientific inquiry too. I think that's like, and that paradigm, I'm excited to see it in that paradigm, and I think a lot of people feel like they've been waiting for that for it to be validated. And yet at the same time, it's been used in these other ways for hundreds or thousands of years, many of them, the plant medicines in particular. You know, MDMA isn't that old. MDMA is a complete Western medical product. Right. MDA, you know, isolated psilocybin and psilocin. LSD. LSD, like, you know, when it comes to mushrooms and peyote and other mescaline-containing plants and ayahuasca, there similarly are wisdom traditions in those fields for working with them in those ways. Right. And I would say there are also avenues for those pursuits. You know, there are ways to validate these medicines. If you're taking them as a psychospiritual sacrament, I think there are ways for that to happen. You know, the Native American church can use mescaline-containing cacti, you know, Santo Daimei church and the UDV church in the United States can use ayahuasca as a sacrament. And so that's, I think that that's a way to think about it and to also separate that entire pursuit and that desire for, you know, I think that's where that battleground is in general. Right. Expanding these things, expanding the understanding of spiritualism, expanding the ideas of, you know, religion to have that be broader and to have sanctions safe places for that kind of work to be done. But for someone who has trauma, like, even within mental health, like, not everyone is very good at dealing with trauma. Like, they should be. They should at least be comfortable working with people with PTSD, but it's its own specialty within a subspecialty already. Right. And there are unique situations that come up that, you know, there's a reason that we have these significant training programs for working with this population. Yeah. There are things that come up that require expertise. Right. Well, that, yeah, that to me is where I really grit my teeth when I realized someone has decided to take up the mantle of, you know, doing this kind of work in a scientific way. Right. If someone's a shaman, they're a shaman. I don't know too much about it, you know, or what, what that is. But when you realize someone is like not doing like, oh, I'm going to give you like a psychedelic trip in the old school way in the sixties, I'll be your babysitter, whatever you want to call it. But they're actually adding to that the implication that they're going to be capable of treating some mental disorder, some mental illness. That to me is where fuck. If they're making those claims that I would have significant issue with. Like if they're saying, you know, at my retreat in Malibu, you know, we're treating PTSD because we're working with MDMA. Yeah. Uh, that's terrifying to me. Like how do we, for me, if, if I, so, um, in our study, if someone gets hurt, I'm responsible, right? Like if someone is, if I'm responsible for the participants in the study, and I'm responsible for human subjects, I'm responsible for making sure that no one feels coerced to be taking place there, that we haven't made promises that are not true, that we're not saying this is going to cure your PTSD. Right. Like we have to be very specific about our language and the informed consent process. And I feel like anybody who, even if their heart is true, if they're figuring out if this is going to be helpful for these patient populations. Right. Um, it's like experimenting. It's like human experimentation. And, and people aren't giving the informed consent. They're not, they don't know that you don't really know if this is going to help them. Right. Right. So, so to say that these are, you know, if those same people are just saying, we're, you know, these medicines are going to do all of the heavy lifting. There's nothing special about me, first of all. Yeah. Um, these medicines are going to do all the heavy lifting, but we're going to keep a safe, you know, environment here. That's a completely different thing than using our scientific painstaking process to validate an untested system. So this brings us to, or like reckless or not even necessarily reckless use, but just like, you know, mixing MDMA with other things or, you know, taking whatever dose the, the, the sitter's comfortable giving, you know, like those are all variables that we would study meticulously in the way that we do it and why it moves so slow. Unfortunately. Well, look at like the stories of Manson up there in Spawn Ranch, giving people acid, you know, I just saw once upon a time in Hollywood, I've been tripping out on Manson for the last two days. But I remember reading some of the stuff that he would do, which is he would give, you know, everyone would be tripping. Yeah. And he would sit across from you. Right. And I can't remember if he would imitate your expression or if he would tell you to imitate his expression, but he would just mimic you until he became you. And in that, you know, you would have this like, just intentional merging experience with a psychotic hyper, hyper charismatic human. Right. And then within that is all this room for, well, I mean, we saw what happened with that. Right. So to me, I think. Narcissist, psychopath. Just, or just, you know, basic, you know, someone trying to get laid. Someone just trying to fuck you, whatever it may be, get your money, whatever it may be. Right. It's like, to me, the, what, what this problem gets mirrored in spiritual communities, which is psychedelics open people up. So do certain spiritual practices. 100%. And so, and so how do you like, how do you maintain and enforce a certain level of quality within it? Like if I just go crazy and start giving everyone three times the dose that we said we were going to give them in the study and we have people, you know, unable to sleep and triggering their depression and some horrible outcome, like that's on, like there's a whole, you know, there's a whole bureaucratic process in place. My license is at stake. My, my sponsor is certainly, I would have to answer to why they let some wacko, like, you know, someone with really poor judgment skills be, be in charge of a human trial, you know, like where we don't have that for that community right now, other than sort of gossip, right? Like there isn't a formal process for reporting, you know, cults of personality that are, you know, purporting themselves to be, you know, gurus basically. Charlie Manson claimed to be a guru. And in the, you know, and that wasn't an odd thing to hear at that point in history, you know, the late sixties in the United States, especially on the West Coast, Los Angeles, San Francisco, to have a guru is like, you know, having a Tesla, you know, well, everybody's got a guru there, you know, the, the, the word gets misunderstood because in India, it's actually a tradition. It's a spiritual tradition and it's not romanticized in the same way it is here. It's a part of Bhakti yoga, Vaishnava Bhakti yoga. It's been going on for thousands of years. And so that's what that version of guru is different from the thing that happens. And I've heard different, different people in the spiritual and the Buddhist universe look at someone becoming a guru in the same way as like someone like getting athletes foot, like it's like, like, oh no, like their ego got them. They weren't able to stay in a decentralized disillusioned in the sense, like not, not disillusion, but like non, like the best way I've heard it described is the real thing. When you run into it, it's empty. There's an emptiness there. It's a reflective emptiness that is very inspiring to be around, but it's there's not a lot of stuff going on. It's, there's just not much there anymore. Something happened and it's rare to run into it. Right. But man. And you've experienced it. That. Oh yeah. I mean, well, you can, if you really want to experience it, you really, you get around a dying person when they're starting to melt down. Yeah. And you'll, you can experience it there. They've given up. It's not like a person on the brink of death is going to be trying to fuck you, take your money, complete non attachment. They're just not, what are they going to do? Non attachment. Yeah. Non attachment to the ego. A person who's got a few weeks to live is not going to try to get in your bank account. Right. You know, it's probably. They're not going to have ulterior motives. Unless they didn't have health insurance or something. I don't know. But yeah. In general. Somebody who's accepted. Yeah. It's that. And, but this. What about someone who's a guru? Well, my experience with it, you know, has been around people like Ramdas. Yeah. Who doesn't claim, even like claim it in the way that, in the heavy use of the term, you know, but when you're around someone who's. Really done the work. It's just a loving field. And if it's just very sweet and there's not there, there's just not much there. That's. That you could. Yeah. So that seems like a possible model. You know, I was thinking also like the way that martial arts are like, you know, that that school of psychedelic work, you know, they have their own legal battle. They have their own legal battles ahead of them and everything. However, like, you know, and it happened with, and it's with psychotherapy too. If you're, if you're a strict analyst, then you can trace your lineage right back to Freud. Wow. You know, it's like, because we're still only, you know, 150 years removed from him. Yeah. So, you know, it's like Freud and Freud or young. And it's like, you know, this pyramid of teachers. Yes. And, and it's, and it's a, and it's a field and a profession that seems best learned through an apprenticeship kind of. Yes. Format. Because each individual student has their own ego to be grappling with. Right. Yes. Which comes up in psychotherapy, especially psychoanalytic therapy and psychodynamics, psychotherapy. So, you can't make some, you know, prescribed training program for dealing with ego. That's like the pursuit of the entire field, you know, on and to infinity. Right. And the practice of, of, that's the practice. The practice is, you know, exploring these things about not only yourself, but with your part, with your patients. Yes. And so, you know, I think perhaps that's a way, I don't know how that's enforced though, then when there's, I'm just, you know, It has to be consumer. I'm thinking of like bad behavior for whatever reason I'm stuck on that. Well, I think that, Because I think it's out there. It's definitely out there. And I think right now, unfortunately, it's probably going to be the responsibility of the seeker or whatever you want to call it, the client, the person who's going under the pressure of these people to have discernment and to be able to, you know, it's, I think it's going to be a lot easier to educate people on what to look out for. Yeah. And if these things start happening, it's, you know, it's a red flag and have a place where they can go talk to people. Right. That is, that is non-denominational. That's just as based on a kind of understanding of, oh, you know, that, no, you can reality check here. And that's fucked up. Right. And then it is to implement across the board and all the weird subcultures and groups, a kind of standard that people can attach to, though, I do think just across the board. Yeah. Transparency. If you're, you know, whoever you're with. If that's like an element, you know, when it's illegal, that's an element that can be elusive. Transparency? Transparency. Well, how so? It's underground work and people, you know, there's a, there's a certain level of just, you know, discretion necessary to do the work. Oh yeah. Oh God. Oh my God. You're right. You can't really reveal much. I guess what I mean is more like, I think any guru and there have been sex gurus out there. Sure. That starts off just saying like, yeah, I love sex. I'm probably going to try to have sex with you. Uh huh. I like to have sex. Yeah. I like to have sex cult. That's what this is. Yeah. That's what you're signing up for. That's informed consent. That's, yeah. You're not going to, you know, later down the line, you can't be like, they try to. That's the idea of informed consent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of selling a boundless love energy fields and then later comes the sex part. Right. That. That. Yeah. So that, and I think that's actually a real healthy question. Sure. If you find yourself around someone claiming to be a guru and certainly claiming to be your guru, can you not just say, Hey, down the line, are you going to try to fuck me? Right. Like, is that on the menu here? Right. Like after the lessons? Is that a possibility? And what about taking my dough? Are you going to take my stuff? Are you going to want to take my money? Right. And then also, are you going to, if you're not going to try to fuck me, are you going to try to fuck my wife? Right. You know, whatever it may be, like what's your, is there a scheme? What are the boundaries? Yeah. And I think I do. I think like if we really want to like deal with this problem that's, I think we're seeing, not just in goddamn spiritual and psychedelic communities and psychological communities, but literally in all communities, which is where there's skewed power dynamics. You get these things that pop up. Right. And so I think like it's going to be, it's more that empower the, I don't want to call them consumers because I hate that word. Empower the seeker. Sure. With a series of questions that are okay to ask. And here's, and here's the conundrum is people who are desperate. You know, we have a line, you know, there are a lot of people who are hoping to get into our study and we have a limited number of positions. And those are the people that we just know about because they've reached out to us specifically. Right. Yeah. So how do we, how do we prevent vulnerable people because that doesn't that remove the ability to really make an informed decision when you're desperate? Oh yeah. Can you really make, I mean, it amplifies the power dynamic at the very least. Yeah. When the seeker believes you have the solution to their suffering. Yeah. It's not just going to hold a safe place for you to have an internal experience and then be, you know, compassionate and decent enough human beings not to, you know, tell you that your experience was somehow invalid or something. Right. You know, like, you know, how do we, with the pace of science and the excitement about psychedelics. I think these are important distinctions to be making. Yeah. That there is a lot of research going on for people who are vulnerable and who people who have, you know, medical conditions that they think psychedelics might be useful for. They can go to clinicaltrials.gov and you can, there's a search engine and you can search any compound, you can search any condition to find any studies, any, it's part of the, you know, built in sort of safety measures of doing clinical research with human subjects as they have to be registered on this public website, clinicaltrials.gov, so that people can't, you know, secretly be doing human subject research or. Right. Or burying results or anything like that. Burying results. Right. Why would they do that? Because they didn't get the results that they were hoping for. Oh, fuck. Is that a big problem? Has that been happening? Have people been burying results in this? They're less likely to publish results if the results aren't what they were hoping for. But I think, you know, as far as in the like drug development world, it just means that that drug is a dead end and they're not going to spend any more money researching it. Right. It's very uncommon for, you know, for a study that didn't yield any meaningful results to be published. First of all, not a lot of periodicals are going to find it interesting enough to publish in their paper. Right. Who cares? Yeah. So, but there is clinicaltrials.gov where you can track what studies have been done for different conditions in the, at least recently. I can't wrap my head around it though, Cole, as an old school conspiracy theorist who came up during the war on drugs as you did. Yeah. A lover of psychedelics since I was in high school. Right. I developed a pretty healthy distrust for the US government and for governments in general that were opposed or may criminalizing psychedelics because anyone who's experienced a psychedelic and then has also had to deal with the fact that they're taking a thing with a what five mandatory minimum presence and it's, you know, it's not, it doesn't take too, too many like, it doesn't take too many moments to suddenly realize like, oh, the problem isn't the psychedelic, the problem is whatever entity is criminalizing this psychedelic. Right. Why in the name of the God, in the name of the God, the only God, why in the name of the only God? The one true only God. The one true God. The light the way. Why in the name of the one true God, would they, why would they make this substance illegal? Now that they've loosened restrictions on studying these things. Right. I think a lot of us are scratching our heads like, what the fuck happened? Right. Why did they let the genie out of the bottle? Yeah. Why are you all suddenly being allowed to work with these substances? So, you know, there are lots of theories about how it came to be this relationship that we have to psychedelics in our current country and like the Western, you know, what I would say, it's predominantly a Western relationship culturally to psychedelics and the US leads the way is one thing, like that's how it's became a worldwide phenomenon, is that at least for the last 50 to 75 years, the US has sort of led on regulation and policy on things, especially the war on drugs. There were my, what I, what I can gather is they were first made illegal because the whole investigation into these things came from a position of criminal, of national defense. Right. Like there was this actual case of these Korean or Korean War POWs, I believe, that came back and had converted, you know, they had like that America was the bad, they were, these were American soldiers. Right. That Korea was superior, you know, had loving feelings about Korea and distasteful views of the US, they can sort of had some sort of conversion there. Yeah. And there was suspicion that they were using drugs. And so the investigation into the psychedelics came from this fear that there was an arms race. This is kind of from my, you know, fun reading on the topic, I'm not a historian. Okay. Okay. You know, just fun things I read at night. And so the psychedelic, a lot of the psychedelic research that was getting funded by defense contractors, unknowingly to the researchers themselves a lot of the time, in the psychedelics were the kinds of researchers who were asking questions like, can you change someone's mind with these things? This is MKUltra you're talking about here. Yes. Yes. That came to be known as MKUltra. Yeah. And so it's, if you ask, can this be used as a weapon, I would argue you could say yes about just about anything. Right. And so the fact that that was sort of the way that these, this investigation was underway, this wasn't a genuine scientific investigation of, it was, can these things be used against us? Should we be, you know, considering these things as weapons ourselves? Yeah. Cold war, you know, stakes are high. And also this is the phenomena that happens in sports. If one person starts doping and you want to stay competitive, you got to start doping. We got to at least know what we're dealing with at the very least. And so the question, if the question keeps being, can this be used as a weapon? What can't be used as a weapon? What technology couldn't be weaponized? Sure. So of course they found the answer to be yes, yes. If we wanted to torture people under these conditions, we could, we could make people say things. We could, you know, get people to talk about things that they didn't expect to talk about. So yes, they can be used as weapons. Should they be used as weapons? Whether or not used as weapons, is there some other benefit to them? Those questions were not as historically important at the time. And so I feel like that kind of questioning led to the kind of way that we've looked at them ever since, you know, even when MDMA was being studied in the 80s. Because it had blown up in the party scene in the late 70s and early 80s. You know, there was, there was plenty of funding to see what brain damage it causes. Not a lot to see if it's useful for marriage counseling, which is what it was primarily being used for clinically, marriage therapy, trauma, you know. So I think, I think the Cold War is over. That maybe that's why these avenues are less draconianly guarded. There was always this sort of backdoor, like there was always this route to getting the research done, but you had to get, you had to do all of this bureaucratic process, right? And the politics at the beginning of the drug war and then reinforced in the 80s was that just drugs are just bad. Drugs are just indiscriminately dangerous and harmful, right? They're different from all the other drugs that we use in some way, and that there's no useful way, there's no use for the effects that these things are having. Yeah. And look what it does to people. I mean, their hair grows long, they fucking grow beards, they stick up wearing clothes, they move up in the mountains, yeah, they start like, what else do they do? They make grilled cheese sandwiches and they join the Mansons all the time. Yeah. And then they join the Mansons even potentially. And then the next thing you know, we've got, they were taking mescaline and Belladonna, which is a deliriant, you know, like. So yeah, it's been looked at as like a pox on the flesh of civilization itself, a potential maddening effect that could ripple through all society and eventually cause some kind of dystopian hell realm of just beautiful music and amazing people dancing all the time. And then what are we going to do? And when we, and, and that's sort of like, that's the beginning of validating something as pure evil is when you're not, when you're not allowed to even look at it or acknowledge it. Right. Right. When you, when you, when you just try to eliminate it, like, yeah, when you, it's like the difference between the power of positive thinking and like cognitive behavioral therapy, which is like cognitive restructuring, where, where you're, you're analyzing your filter that you put on information and cognitive behavioral therapy. You're like, you know, I heard, you know, you hear a piece of news and it goes through this filter and you apply these sort of deep core negative beliefs. A lot of times people with depression and anxiety will have deep core beliefs that things, everything gets filtered through. I'm unlovable, everything, nothing is going to ever work for me. Yes. And so it's examining these filters. Yeah. Whereas, and acknowledging that you, you're distorting information. The information might not necessarily be good, but it's not likely as bad as after it goes through your distortion process, right? And so the, the cognitive part of CBT is all about identifying your patterns of automatic negative thinking. What are your underlying belief systems that you filter everything through, right? That the world is super dangerous and trying to destroy me at all times, you know, catastrophic thinking, um, all or nothing thinking, mind reading, like, oh, they don't actually want me to come over. I'm not going to go over and watch the movie at their house. They're just saying it to be nice. That mind reading thing, when I was listening to this audio book on CBT and it said the mind reading thing, which is it might be, in fact, it's probably very likely that you can't read other people's minds. It really might be that when you think a person's thinking something good or bad, you're wrong. Right. You literally don't know. Right. At least you don't know. Yeah. That's the best you can hope for. Yeah. Is that you don't know what that really is. That was such a relief to me to realize like, oh, holy fuck. Right. You mean when I think someone's mad at me, they just might not be mad at me. Right. When I think someone hates me, I don't know. They could just have indigestion. Who knows? Exactly. Who knows? Right. Exactly. It's so great that you think that of them more likely than not. Yeah. You know? That's such a relief. It's such a relief to be sort of scientifically removed from the responsibility of being some kind of telepathic messiah that is having an experience of universal hate from all sentient beings. Right. It's just a relief. It's nice to know that that might not be the conditions of your universe. That's good. Yes. But so that is like an exercise in confronting your own deeply held beliefs and cognitive distortions and, you know, there's something in there that's an attempt towards growth and, you know, better self-knowledge, whereas, which is what all like honest inquiry and curiosity, you know, is ultimately like about in this context. So power of positive thinking is like pretending things aren't happening, that just are, right? Like a lot of people have been helped by it. But there is definitely a danger, especially with narcissists, to like, you don't want your airline pilot to just assume that the wings have been appropriately de-iced, right? Like just think positive, just, you know, charge ahead or whatever. And so, and, you know, I was just kind of reading about this recently and it was exploring that concept, like the big difference being that when you just shut things out, you are ignoring things and you're also validating true evil. Like we can't even look at this, like, you know, like, I'm the best, I'm the greatest, I'm going to bounce back from this bankruptcy and everything's going to be just fine rather than, you know, like that could set you up for the next bankruptcy or other kinds of fallout from, you know, fiscal irresponsibility, as opposed to, you know, the harder thing, which is I'm not the worst person in the world, you know, the CBT thing would be like, I'm not a horrible person, I'm not the worst person in the world, this happens to people, let's take a look, you know, money isn't some unfacable demon thing that, like, I just have to pretend is always going great. So my, just only because I've like really been into Neville Goddard right now, which is one of the, I guess you could say, like, Godfathers of the secret and Godfathers of what has been translated into what's called positive thinking or whatever. And so when people, they get really good, if you heard what he said versus the positive thinking concept, they're apples and oranges. Because what he's saying is the, generally, if you're trying to do positive thinking, but your feeling state is one of anxiety, one of fear, one of like paranoia, then the thinking is more of an affirmation of what you don't have. So the positive thinking usually has within it some want your, your, the phenomenal world is showing you some version of life, and then you want things to be different. And so you're mentally seeing a place you're going to live or a certain number in your bank account, and then you're all, but during that time, you're feeling like anxiety and security and heartbreak and, you know, denial because you're, you're pretending you're not feeling that even though you are. And so that's doing nothing. That's literally nothing is nothing is happening, except you're stuttering your mentally. But what he does say, which is nuts and what, what does keep appearing throughout, which I think is where psychedelic therapy, where cognitive behavior therapy, where any good spiritual path where they all seem to meet is the idea of like, if we can get into the code that is taking fundamental experience and interpreting it in a paranoid way and just get you to the fundamental experience, right? You might find the fundamental experience. Yes. Yeah. What is that called? Valence, like a positive or negative spin. Say it again. What a valence. Valence. Yeah. Like to take away its positive or negative, like to detach from a value judgment on it. That. Like to just objectively, you know, in the bankruptcy example, objectively, uh, fiscal irresponsibility led to bankruptcy. Yes. Not, uh, you know, that makes me a bad person. That makes me a terrible, you know, like adding all of that stuff that like comes with it. Like this occurred, I can make steps to prevent this from occurring again, or I can get myself out of this situation, um, you know, rather than having to ignore, uh, having to ignore or, or deny, deny and to feel guilty that you're actually experiencing truth. Right. The, the, what I love about it is the, it's, it's implying that truth is always good. That truth is good. It's a good thing. Truth is, and I know that might, you could say that's a valence, but you could just say truth is, but you know, the best examples I've been given are like color is good. There's just, just for lack of a better word. We love color. It's great. If you look at most colors, you, there's no such thing as a malfunctioning color. Right. Someone might have painted your wall the wrong color because you wanted it some, but if that color is not malfunctioning, it just is a color and it's great. So that's before the story you attached to the color or whatever. Right. Right. So this discovery or realignment or rediscovery, I guess you could say of that state can produce a very empowered, grounded sense of, okay, here's where I actually am. Right. I am, and this is knowing the terrain or knowing the landscape and even if the landscape is rough, like think of like the roughest place in nature, you know, wherever it may be, some Icelandic fucking dark place with fucking geysers and steam and like rocks. It's rugged, but it's beautiful. It's beautiful. Right. And if you're in a situation of that rugged, that's rugged like that, but you're pretending that you're going hiking on a spring day and Malibu and that's what you're going to wear. Right. You're in trouble, man. Right. But if you were equipped with the right equipment, then suddenly you're having the best day of your life because you're hiking through the beautiful. And so anyway, this is what, this is the example that gets given is what will naturally occur if you allow yourself to be as you are, where you are before the story is a joy, an excitement, an enthusiasm that a lot of people seem to have lost because isn't that thing you're talking about the overlay, doesn't it kind of produce a kind of boring reality, which is it gives us the sense that we know what's coming next. Right. It's fucking boring. Well, maybe that's its purpose because we're afraid of the unknown. Right. This is going to go poorly to like, you know, this is, this is going to be, you know, a cynical viewpoint that I know what's happening next. Yeah. I can predict what this is going to do. So I think there's like a natural drive to want to be able to predict things, but we're certainly filtering the possibility out of things going different. You know, it's, it's almost like a power suggestion kind of thing at that point that you're doing on yourself when you are, you're almost taking away the possibility that it won't go poorly when you are putting the expectation on it and, and you're projecting all of your behaviors onto it that you would have something that would go poorly. Okay. Yeah. Right. That's, and that is, you know what, to me, that's the, that is where my understanding of the positive thinking stuff, that's what I think they're saying is achieve the state of as you are in us and there will be a natural remission of the anxiety that comes from living in denial because you're, some part of you is aware of the fact. So if you can strip it of all of that valence and filter, then yeah, you're, you're, you're essentially living in the present moment, right? Yeah. And that's a good place. Right. And, and devoid of anxiety and depression because, you know, anxious thoughts are about how things are going to be changing in some unpredictable way. How this is going to go. You know, like, like this very moment, you know, if we can drop into this moment where we're just looking at each other, everything's going great. Great. But as soon as I think, what time is it like, does Duncan have to go? What time is Duncan going to have to go home? That's where the anxiety comes. Oh, thanks. The anxiety is that this isn't going to be okay at some time in the near future. And what can I do to stop that from happening, you know, and it ruins right now, which is great. Great. That's right. That's right. And it's great. But we, and again, the difference between positive thinking would be you tell yourself, it's great. You're shitting bricks. Right. That's positive thinking. Whereas this other thing is like, no, you actually, the greatness is there. It's just being, it's being drowned out by the overlays that you're putting on top of things. So the, but one, one experience I had with the ketamine therapy was, uh, because I'd been plagued by fear of death and, uh, I had this realization that wasn't just a mental realization, but I realized, oh, my fear of death is my love of life. It's just my, I love life so much. I don't want it to, I'm, and that's like the ultimate, you know, you know, I don't have anything to, to, to back this up from a scientific standpoint, but like that's kind of at the heart of a, of a lot of anxiety, at least a lot of anxiety is ultimately death, the fear of death, like, and, and things coming to an end and how we can protect things from bad from happening because then something, some miniature death will happen when something bad happens, right? Right. Something like death, you know, something will end, something will come to an end that's going so great right now that we want to hold onto it so much, that attachment. Yeah. And so, uh, so it gets, you know, where anxiety gets debilitating is when that ruins your ability to enjoy when things are going fine, which is most of the time. Most of the time. All the, and that's one of my favorite Ramdas things is he says dying is completely safe. And you know, and, and no one messes it up. You can't mess it up and you're going to die safely. And also when I've applied mindfulness just doing my anxiety states themselves, I've noticed that the anxiety has a quality of ecstasy in it. It seems to be a, it seems to be some kind of bliss, some kind of joy that's misplaced. It's like out of alignment or something. It's an excitement to be alive, but it's an unpleasant experience because it's so hypercharged or something. But if, if, if you look at it, it's like, this is why I love the new cult of people taking cold showers, you know, like taking, taking ice baths and cold showers. Because when you take a cold shower, your attention is focused on that, but also when you really, you know, if, if you, I've realized that the pain of a cold shower is at least 50, if not 60% not wanting it to be cold. It's my mental reaction to it, which is like, this fucking sucks. Holy, how can we change this? How can I change this is fucking, but you remove that and just feel the cold water. It's really nice. It's invigorating. It's harmless. I mean, not at least over a short period. It's, it's, uh, powerful. It's crisp. It's just nice. It's intense. It's not like getting electrocuted. It's like something wonderful. And then before you know it, the cold starts feeling good and you don't even want to turn it up in the same way you did initially. So to me, it's that analysis of the seemingly unwanted state. The aversion to it, you realize is the, what seems to be exhausting you versus the state itself. So I don't know, man. I don't know where I'm going with this, but, um, I, I'm, I'm really curious about, I'm sorry, I diverted and I ran. No, no, we both, we both went, I'm trying to actually remember, uh, uh, if we got to the end of the discussion about, you know, how did, how did things change in the government? Yeah. Like I think I went on this tangent about the, the, uh, the not looking at things and the positive thinking versus CBT, which was great. So let's jump back. How did it go? I do want to, yeah, I think it's, it comes up so much. And, um, and it is a curious thing. You know, I think, uh, in my experience in working in government bureaucracies, I did my training in a VA, um, you know, there's lots of, I'm really interested in, uh, in, uh, epiphenomenon and emergent phenomenon. Things that happen that are just the, are the natural results of the, of the setup and a group of people, you know? So like, um, uh, how, you know, one example is like, you know, how did every civilization end up with a pretty similar city structure? Oh, right. Okay. Right. Like because, uh, they needed to have markets and then it's, if you're going to sell fruit and somebody else is going to sell wheels for your wagon, like why not have them be like roughly in the same area? And then wagons need to get there. So it needs to be a road. Right. So like roads, main roads, where the main businesses are housing wants to be there. You need to have roads to get to those businesses from the housing. You need a decent amount of room between the houses for privacy. And so like that kind of thing, um, uh, I think, um, you know, in bureaucracies, there's a lot of reward mechanisms for, um, implementing a new policy. Okay. And, but there's not much reward for getting rid of an old policy that sucks now. Right. So you get these like, you know, you get these, uh, almost insurmountable red tape obstacles to do anything, um, much less like to undo something that was a mistake. Right. You need a lot. Basically you need like a lot of excitement and energy and belief in your thing. If you want to change these huge bureaucracies, you need to have a lot of momentum to tolerate it and people believe in their idea, but they don't have that same energy and enthusiasm to withstand the like process to undo someone else's bad idea. And so bad ideas just like pile up and they get, people get jobs around the bad ideas. I mean, that's, there's an economic promoted for coming up with the idea that seemed great last week is now in the way of the new good idea this week. But industries form around the bad idea, you know, like suddenly you have a bad idea, now there's an industry around it and medical record systems in this example, like the medical record system doesn't have a place to now, you know, run a search for all people 55 and over for, you know, right? The cardiac thing. So then those sort of like, so those things kind of accumulate. And so I think that's, yeah, to bring it back to the discussion. It's like, there was a questionable idea about starting this war on drugs, right? And, and the amount of momentum needed to have made these rules was very little to create the system to create, you know, Nixon started it and, and Reagan reinforced it. And to try to undo those kinds of policies and rules takes an incredible amount of energy and momentum. And it's taken, it took 15 years for, you know, Rick Doblin to come along and form maps and other similar organizations to have the tolerance to go through that whole process to see where, see what kinds of policies they can do, what kinds of, what kinds of bureaucratic opportunities are there to continue to do this kind of research, for example, to find those things within those systems, to find the sort of, to pioneer the path to how we reopen this kind of research. And I think that is, that's more like the reason for the slowdown. I don't think it was, I think the, the, the starting of the war on drugs and the reinforcement of the war on drugs had a million reasons it was politically beneficial to those guys that did that. Sure. But I don't think it says as active of an ongoing fight, I think the Cold War generation is passing, like the people who are in charge during the Cold War, the new people are not as passionate about that fight anymore, the new people who are in charge of these departments are, get there because their solution oriented and, you know, and, and the data seems to be on the side of, at least in the research that we're doing, the data seems to be on the side of that these things might be powerful medicines. Jesus Christ, Cole, what are you trying to do? Make us all feel good. Yes. Trying to give us hope. Now we're doing, you're trying to make us feel optimistic. That's right. Maybe the entire system itself is not filled with hissing reptilian fucking war mongers that inside there, there's people who actually authentically respect scientific data, we're going to change things and implement things to make life on the planet, not quite so horrific for people and that that might actually be something that isn't just in the United States, but in a lot of communities across the planet right now. Is that what you're trying to tell us? That's what I'm trying to say. I'm trying to say, you know, like in the same kind of approaching things with openness and curiosity, I've found that the government agencies that I'm interacting with, it's a much scarier when, when my language wasn't as precise, when it was just they, when it was just the government, right? But now that I'm having to, you know, in one way or another interact with these different departments within the government, it's like my language is getting more precise. It's like, well, the FDA, they're sort of their, their agenda and what they do is this function, right? And the DEA, their agenda and what they do is this function. Yeah. And they don't always, you know, are not always communicating on, you know, like there isn't a concerted effort among all departments of anything in particular, but the FDA's job is to have a pathway for finding new medical treatments, making sure that those medical treatments are safe and effective and making sure that the manufacturing of those treatments is done in a safe and, you know, non contaminated way. Right. The DEA's job is to enforce the laws. It's a drug enforcement agency. So it's jobs to enforce the drug laws as they stand. The, the FDA has to deal with drug companies who are trying to manufacture drugs of all kinds. Sure. They also have to deal with, you know, the research that there's some psychedelic funding now, there's some money for funding psychedelic studies that are going to go through the FDA process. And so far, I've not found some Nixon character in there who's, you know, not willing. I haven't heard of any sort of draconian like, well, we don't care what the policy says. It's not, it's not for you. It's not for you guys because of what you're trying to study. Right. It's, it's the same rules seem to apply. Well, you know, the depressing thing is when people like Biden come out and talk about how marijuana is a gateway drug and just shit all over the research. That's, that's just miseducation. Right. But that's someone running for president. You know, you still see these old dinosaurs. I mean, the good news is, uh, I like, I think even Trump has somehow said something good about, uh, MDMA therapy or ketamine therapy or something like that. And, you know, uh, people on both sides are completely admitting that, oh yeah, this seems to actually. Politically, you know, medicine is not, uh, a single, it's not a partisan issue. That's right. That's the good news. Yeah. But the, so I think this is why, you know, this larger conversation, I'm saying that's like super important, you know, the science is moving very, very slow. The excitement about the science is moving very, very fast. The excitement about, you know, some new psychedelic movement is, is, you know, upon us or right around the corner, it seems, as I would say, um, and yet politicians don't always listen to us, me putting myself in the science community. Right. Historically, they, they listen to voters. Right. And that's not always based on what the data says. That's what happened in 71 from what I understand was they did a genuine, uh, investigation and report on the dangers of drugs and alcohol and, you know, recommendations to how to classify things. And they just, when it wasn't what was the political motivation, they ignored that data and just made a system in place that was based on politics. And if we aren't careful with that other community, if that other community isn't careful in self-policing or even developing some sort of. Princess, you know, guru tradition or martial arts teacher or psychotherapy, you know, lineage or some, if there isn't some tradition in place, we are at risk of not making it a scientific decision anymore. Listen, I don't want to make it a cultural decision. That's what I think happened in the sixties. Well, my wife and I are taking a cultural, I know what you mean. And my wife and I are taking up this mantle and we have decided to be the leaders of the psychedelic community and, uh, we're going to make love to you. We're going to make love to your wife. Excellent. We are going to, what about my money? We will make love to your money. And then through this process, I think we're, we're going to like discover a way to make sure that the, we'll come up with a, some methodology to license people. We're going to do training programs. We're probably going to start like a series of centers and a few, anyone comes against us, we will sue your ass. So that's our, that's our plan. What do you think, Cole? Pretty good. I think, I think, uh, I think that's the, the kind of thing that I would expect to emerge inside of a place where this is, is legal and taken seriously. Right. I think genuinely that's what happens. That's what we have in all of, you know, um, you know, we have the conferences, for example, we have these societies. We have the American Psychiatric Association. It has its big conference. Um, it has, it's a review board, an ethics committee. Um, people don't always follow the rules. And when they don't follow the rules, there is a way of enforcing the rules. Sure. Um, and I think that's the, I think that would be important thing to do. I mean, and I think that's what I mean. That's actually an example of emergent phenomenon. When you have these problems, you have a growing interest in this thing with these powerful things and a certain part of the community is saying, Hey, hey, hey, we need to be careful. A certain part of the community is, Hey, hey, we need to like get this to as many people as possible. And then, you know, a natural emergent phenomenon is that somebody comes up with the idea and that idea sticks because it makes sense to everyone. Yeah. That we should have some sort of board. We should have some list of questions that you ask somebody if they are, you know, purporting to be a medicine person, then, you know, what are 10 things you should know and to ask your person and who puts that list of 10 things together? This trusted part of people in that, you know, like those kinds of things. Um, I consider emergent phenomenon. And I, and I think that like, there are like the, the invitation to the various communities that exist out there to link up and come up with some like real simple, you know, publication for people to look at. I think that's a good invitation, you know, like, what would it look like? What are the things where we can look at, and we can look at these models of things that have come before us and the same emergent when they were, when these emergent, you know, entities were facing these same questions. What did they have an ethics board? Uh, how did they disseminate information? I have a conference of some kind. Like, I think, I think, uh, you know, especially with decriminalization, um, that kind of stuff is going to be a natural important thing. And there are these awesome, awesome, awesome communities, you know, the aware project in Los Angeles that, and the psychedelic community, the broader psychedelic community is by its nature, um, thoughtful people. And so, you know, I hope that that's, you know, something that we can promote, uh, in this podcast to those communities that, you know, that they take, they undertake that, um, that responsibility with integrity and, and, uh, and honesty. I think burning man's an example of like, uh, uh, uh, I think they have come up with some pretty sophisticated methods for not just for dealing with psychedelic, you know, all the various things that come up when people are using psychedelics together, but just also like, you know, pretty healthy ways of allowing people to simultaneously be autonomous, free thinkers, but also like an overarching code that that seems to fit really well with then radical self-reliance, that stuff, you know, and, and, and I think that these things are going to emerge. And the more we hold ourselves accountable and hold each other accountable and hopefully a forgiving way, which is to me, one of the cool aspects of burning man is the, you know, they really are good at not involving the cops. If someone's freaking out in a responsible way, but somebody has to be, right? Like, yeah, they can't just not have the cops. Yeah. Right. Sure. Soon as you get to three or more people, arguments are going to happen. Disagreements and peaceful resolution of those disagreements becomes, how do we manage that now as a community? If we don't like the old way, you know, what is the intention? What can we do? And what I'm, what I'm seeing, you know, in this path where I went from, you know, thinking that we were, you know, what, what I'm perpetually pleasantly surprised by in, in trying to do this research is that people before us and the solutions they came up with were those emergent thing. Like, right, they're not there because someone's trying to control necessarily. They're there because as a community, we were like, Hey, we need to make sure our food's like not covered in shit. Right. We need to make sure that the, when we buy medicine at the store, it's got in it, what it says it's got in it on the bottle. And then people aren't saying it's going to do something that it isn't. And like, this is a reaction to us asking for those things a lot of the time. That's emergent phenomenon. I got you. You know, the, uh, Burning Man, if you have a camp of a hundred or more, you have to get like a food certification now. Like a lot of these bureaucracies spring naturally out of trying to govern. Right. Well, this is the, yeah, I think eliminating the superstitious idea that all bureaucracies are innately evil is a good first step. And I think that there's a good reason many of us have that sense because we've seen the failing of archaic, you know, money, uh, motivated, uh, anti-truth bureaucracies that popped up all over the fucking place. And I know personally, the frustration of that is so great that eventually just out of lazy thinking, you demonize the entire structure itself. Instead of seeing the structure is malleable and potentially can, can be shifted back into harmony with, with, with, with like, uh, being mo, being human motivated or peace motivated or, or life motivated instead of money motivated. But I, now listen, I, there's, do you have about 10 more minutes, Cole? I've got, yeah. Okay. So this question is, because it might take a little while for you to answer it. Sure. And, um, and I think it fits into the discussion of producing some kind of like structure within which the psychedelic experience, which is very often doesn't seem structured at all can happen. Um, and, and this goes back to something I've talked about before, but I remember going to the DEA website and reading the, how you could like follow the flow of LSD through the United States by the Grateful Dead touring schedule. It's that's how it was all being distributed. That's how it's getting around the country. And then also though, what was really funny to me is the acknowledgement that the problem with LSD dealers are trying to bust LSD dealers is that somewhere the actual capitalist drug dealing thing begins to break down because the LSD dealer is taking LSD and eventually the LSD dealer decides that they don't want to sell it anymore. They just want to give it away to help, to help because they're realizing it's like a very healing medicine and they don't care about money in the same way. I'm sure there's LSD dealers out there like, motherfucker, that hasn't happened yet. Yeah, I'm sure somebody's getting rich. Okay, not you, but, uh, that's okay. But no, yeah, I hear what you're saying. So, you know, people who are, uh, what's her name was worked with as a radiation curie, that's her name, you know, yeah. She, you know, you, now if you want to go look at her papers, you've got to wear actual radioactive, like you have to protect yourself because they didn't know back then how killing her, yeah. And so I think one of the byproducts of LSD and some of the disassociatives is that they kind of innately begin to melt down the regulations, the rules, the structures themselves. They have this, at least in my experience, the tendency of causing such a radical, uh, shift in perception from it's just me to almost what you would call fifth dimensional thinking, a feeling of being outside of time, a feeling of no longer being a mortal being, acknowledging your mortality, but you know, the best way to put it would be, uh, and I'm sorry, guys. I keep saying this over and over just because I'm so blown away by this Buddha statement, which is, uh, uh, acknowledge the wave, but stay with the ocean. And so in this case, suddenly it's now we're the ocean, the little bureaucratic stuff and the laws and the rules and all of it starts seeming pretty ridiculous, hilarious in fact. And I mean, not just like whatever are comical and not just whatever rules we come up with for, I just remember planning a psychedelic journey with my friends and as soon as we, with every step of the way planned, and as soon as you start tripping, you're like, remember when we're going to do all this bullshit, you're laughing, we're going to try to control the experience. So my question here is, what about that? What about the sort of, I don't want to call it radiation poisoning because that implies a negative outcome, but what about the sort of reality that these substances have the tendency to break down power structures to, to shift any attempt to control them or to hierarchize or to produce a counsel, a credential that this or that, what about the fact that you yourself, just by being around the experience and I don't, I don't know, like what the rules are about clinicians, you know, taking their own medicine. But what about that, the shift that inevitably will happen in the ability to be an administrator, to the ability to have these sort of built in baked in regulations, what happens when you all just start melting away like all of us? What about that? Is there anything in place to handle that? Well, I think, you know, one of the, you know, one of the, I think it makes, so being, first of all, being around these medicines, there is like a spirit of it in the room, you know, like when, when we're doing the research, with MDMA, because MDMA is not available clinically yet. But when we're doing our research with MDMA for PTSD, there's a, all of the sort of qualities of MDMA are in the room. I don't know if that's like mirroring the patient. You mean like a contact tie? Kind of like a contact tie, but there's not like any physical thing. But there's a feeling of, you can't help but be, what reflects someone's vulnerability. Right? Like unless you're a predator and you're going to pounce on that vulnerability. When someone is, when someone is staring at you and their heart is wide open, you can't help but in some way meet them halfway there at least, right? And so you're working from a very authentic, open, compassionate place. And that makes you feel good. And so I think similarly with the, you know, working with the ketamine, there's a sense of these mystical states being sacred to them at least, if not, you know, in itself. And so I think we could use more of that spirit in medicine again. Like I think if anything, it, it, it would make it harder for me to be separated from my original intentions of becoming a psychiatrist, for example, or from becoming a doctor. You know, it's like the, the jadedness of just being in something for a long time that can happen, you know, from practicing anything, even if you love it for, you know, decades, for example, or for however long that process can take. Like, and, and movement to all other motives that are not related to the original purpose of the project. I think it's harder to, to go there when you're dealing with people's, when you're dealing with, you know, sacred things, you know, I think we, you know, we, you know, I think we, so, so, so even though you have to still be the administrator, like I still have to run a business, right? Yeah. I still have to pay employees. I still have to provide, get the medicine. I still have to, you know, I still have to take care of myself and my employees and have a business that's going to be functional, but we don't need to, you know, triple the cost just because people will pay it. Right. For example, like we can be confident that we have a price that makes sense for us that is, you know, based in those values and, and I think, yeah, I think if anything, it, it can be, it's almost like if you're dealing with sacred things like that. It's like with Buddhism, you know, how does, you don't see a lot of people getting rich off of it, you know, if we, if we establish it as, as sacred, which I think being a doctor and a healer should be, and I think the more we get disconnected from that, the easier it is for it to become just like any other business. Yeah. Um, so the, this is what you're saying. But we take an oath, you know, like what's more sacred than that. But also though, what's the, oh, you take an oath, there is, uh, and the community takes that oath very seriously and upholding that, not just for themselves, but making sure other people are upholding it. I know they're so deadly serious about that. But what's fascinating to me is what you're saying is, yeah, it's not so much being around psychedelics that is transformative. It's being around the healing that you're witnessing. That's what is going to warp you. That's what's going to change economic models that could be profit based and the economic models that are just based on how do we get this medicine as many people as we can and still stay afloat and, and, and LA, which is a hyper expensive city. And that's pretty cool, man. That's pretty cool. Like, you know, as opposed to other sort of businesses, you know, it seems like you people in this war, in this community, the psychedelic medicine communities, psychedelic healing community are really going to run into a hilarious problem, which is a kind of transformative, an unavoidable transformation is going to happen. If you, it's like if you're running a resurrection clinic, how many people can you bring back to life before you start completely reevaluating your understanding of the world itself? And I don't know anything more like resurrecting a person than very than healing their depression and not just healing it over the course of a few months, but watching you, you've seen people go into remission almost immediately, haven't you? I mean, that's what the papers are saying, right? Yeah. Yeah. That's, I mean, that's, that is, as someone who's suffered from this shit. To like, it's not just that, oh, here's some Paxil or whatever. And in a month, maybe you'll have some, something might change. If not, we're talking about what, what is the general 24 hours, like 50% of people have a significant improvement within 24 hours. Another, another one third to one half of the people who don't will have a response by the third or fourth treatment, which we get to the fourth treatment in two weeks on our protocol. So, and yeah, it's usually not like nothing's getting better, nothing's getting better, nothing's getting better. And then the fourth one, things get better. It's like, it's just based on the data, it's like a statistically significant improvement means a change in like the severity of the depression is absolutely, you know, is statistically almost certainly due to this medicine or significantly improved. You know, over half after the first treatment and another one third or half of the people who didn't respond to the first treatment respond that much by the fourth treatment. This is like the psychiatric equivalent of limb regeneration. Like we're talking something as profoundly strange as the Star Trek. Remember that crazy thing in Star Trek where you run into the eels, your wound? Yeah, we're talking something like that. I mean, we're talking like this is like penicillin, right? We're something at that level of, of it's insane. There are lots of, yeah, there are lots of things about it that can be have the opportunity to be complete game changers. The, the rapidity, the fact that it works on a completely different neurotransmitter system than the ones that we've been tinkering with for 50 years now and, you know, probably squeezed all the juice we're going to get out of that. You know, it opens up a whole new avenue of scientific inquiry too. You know, it's, it's the GABA receptors. Yeah, yeah. The GABA receptors are at least involved. And, uh, and we have a chance to potentially, uh, refine methods for working with these, um, dissociated states or psychedelic states or mystical states. Can I ask you this? Is it annoying when a guy wearing a Sam Ash hat and an unkempt beard says GABA receptors to you and I'm just realizing, I wouldn't know a GABA receptor. If it fit me in the face, no, you're a doctor. You know that I've just like, I just like saying GABA receptors. Like I'm a psychiatrist. Like I'm Dr. Trussell, but I have read that this, what's fascinating about this is it's, it's working. I thought it was completely working on the GABA receptors, what Ambien works on, which is what Benzos PCP works on, which is, uh, Benzos work on it. Nitrous oxide. What? All the, all my, well, not all my favorite. Well, pretty close. I love the GABA receptors. What are they doing up there? What's their job? Yeah. They're primarily, um, you know, GABA inhibition. Um, well, I don't want to, I don't want to get to, uh, into the weeds of neuro pharmacology that I'm not totally a master of, but, uh, GABA and, uh, glutamate are the two big, um, re neurotransmitters that, uh, that these class of drugs are working on, um, glutamate being excitatory and GABA being inhibitory. Okay. Um, we know that if people take, um, you know, benzodiazepines like Valium or Xanax on the same day of academy and treatment, it can completely block the potential benefits of it, whether they have a psychedelic experience or not. So we know the psychedelic experience isn't entirely responsible for, you know, the benefits. And we know, well, we haven't been able to demonstrate because we just haven't done the study, but you know, our impression working clinically is that we're, we're able to help people who are much more complicated cases than would normally be, you know, uh, allowed into a depression study, um, and at a higher rate, you know, we get higher, uh, we have a higher rate of, uh, response, um, in, in clinically by taking into account this additional potential for healing. Um, yeah. Cool. This has been a joy chatting with you. And I got a million more questions for you, but we're out of time. I got to get back home. You have allowed me to be in this beautiful space and I, maybe you should tell people about this spot. Cause I think some people might be interested in the opening. We just opened, uh, this month, um, November, uh, mid-November, uh, and going into the new year, we, um, one of the, one of the things I had to take into account when, um, when trying to maintain integrity and growing this business is if I, there has to be, uh, a potential for growth in order to provide more of the treatment, right? And so one way that, um, that I'd been trying to grow is instead of me personally being there as the MD to administer the drug and provide the psychotherapy because I have the, you know, um, experience and training and working with psychedelic experiences. Now we have our own whole clinic. We provide, uh, ketamine for treatment, resistance, depression, treatment, resistance, PTSD, um, and it's me and three therapists so that we can see three times as many people. We have four offices and the potential for more offices and potential for more growth and potential to set up these training programs and growing this, this is part of that emergent phenomenon too. Like how do we create a, how do we make this more broadly available and, and we really believe in the way that we're administering it, you know, the having the psychotherapists there to integrate the experiential component, um, and not having it just be like, uh, a treatment that you go get and then go home, you know, like, um, so yeah, we really believe in the model. And, um, part of that has been part of that growth is opening the California center for psychedelic therapy. We've got a website, uh, psychedelictherapyca.com, uh, and we are currently clinically, uh, working with just ketamine, um, uh, we do, we also host the research for MDMA, um, but it's just research and it's just for PTSD. People can, uh, find out more at, uh, MDMAptsd.org that's being funded by maps, they want to contribute money. They can donate to maps.org. Um, and also y'all, if you use offer code, Keta Jesus, you will get a hundred percent off your treatment here. Isn't that right, Cole? I don't think so. We will not be able to take care of the clinic and that deal. Um, and, uh, and one thing I just wanted to say for the sake of our, our, um, our staff here, uh, we do not offer psilocybin treatment here. Um, there's a lot of interest in it and it's very promising. We hope to do the psilocybin research that's been proposed, uh, to get involved in that more, uh, and when it becomes clinically available, we hope to have it here. But, um, but yeah, unfortunately it's not something that, uh, we are researching or offering clinically here at this time, though we're keeping a very close eye on it. I'm so thankful that I live in a universe where that sentence is being said seriously. If I back in the nineties, if I knew that there was going to be this possibility that a doctor would be saying, you know, right now we're not offering mushroom therapy, but it is possible that soon we will be in the near future.

God help the beast in me. That's a cover of Nicola's famous song, The Beast in Me. Being covered by Grindel Peterson, praise the sweet angels in heaven. I finally got my vaccine. I went down to a church that I'd heard had extra doses and was able to get the jab, and it was mystical. The experience was mystical. Even if you're the most cynical, hardened, annoyed, sarcastic, pandemic denier, and you're looking down your nose at all of us who are waiting to get this jab, you have to admit that the possibility that this way of existing in the world is going to end, that we're going to be able to rub shoulders with strangers at amusement parks and clubs and bars and restaurants and the glory holes of the world, because what's worse than having to wear a mask and a glory hole? Is it okay to pull it down? The idea that that's all going to end is just a joyful dream, and a lot of us were afraid because we don't want to get our hopes up, because our hopes have been dashed so many times over and over again during this insane, turbulent, crazy year plus a few months. But I think the sun is beginning to rise. I think we're going to get to the other side of this, and it's coinciding with the seasons. You know, I'm a sap. Let's face it. I have every Les Miserables song memorized. I play it for my kid when we're driving in the car, and he likes it. I'm a sap, and therefore I love when spring starts happening, especially now that I've experienced a winter. You know, if you're living in LA, you're going to get a wet, sloppy kind of winter, but you're not going to get the kind of winter you get up in the mountains of North Carolina. You're not going to get a legitimate winter. It's probably why you don't live on the East Coast is because your poor, frail, little quivering West Coast body can't handle the pain of winter. But God, I understand because my body certainly doesn't like it. I don't like it when it hurts when the wind blows. But part of the glory of spring is that it just slowly starts melting away. All of it. Suddenly, it's getting warmer. It's not raining as much anymore. Flowers are starting to show up in the ground, and it doesn't matter. If you're the most despicable, totally cynical, angry bundle of defense mechanisms bundled inside of defense mechanisms, some little part of you is going to get affected by the spring because even though the grand total walking callous that you have intentionally become because your sweet, sensitive baby heart decided it was better to be completely numb than to experience contact with reality, that little hummingbird heart that's still in you. It talks to the spring, and the spring says, don't worry, I know you think you're going to be existing inside a cynical, jaded, sarcastic, angry human callous for the rest of your existence on this planet, but it's not going to be that way. You're going to get to grow out of all that thick, hardened, angry, cynical meat. And eventually, that being that has completely lost track of its heart is going to feel you again. Don't worry. And that's what I love about the spring because it's like, this is what this is the idea. It doesn't last. Whatever the thing is, whatever the particular, at least I can only speak from experience. There might be someone listening to this right now who's hanging upside down in a Bavarian dungeon, getting hot wax dripped on their taint. Maybe they paid for the experience initially, but then when they asked to be released, they realized that they weren't getting out of the Bavarian castle. So I don't know. Like, but your captors are letting you listen to this podcast as I can only assume an extra form of torture. So for you, I don't know if you're going to get out of there, but my own personal experience is that no matter how seemingly crystallized the horror of some particular phase of my life seems to be, no matter how much it seems like this shit is never going to end. And sometimes that experience could be like can happen over the course of a few years or a few seconds, depending on what's happening. It always gets better. It always gets better and sometimes it gets better in ways that I didn't expect. Sometimes it gets better than I hoped. It's not as better as I would have liked, but it always gets better. And that's what I like about the very beginning of Spring. You know, I passed somebody and I, I don't know. I was like happy, too happy probably, or well, and you know, I passed someone, I said Springs here and they smiled and said the whispers of Spring, which is a really poetic thing to say to someone you don't know on the street. But that's Asheville. Asheville is pretty cool. Point is, that's what I like, the whispers of Spring, because you know, soon it's going to be full bore Spring, nature's going to be showing off, green, super green everywhere and the flowers exploding out everything and it's like we get it, it's Spring, relax. But the, it's that very beginning of Spring that I really love that because like the part of you don't even want, even though you know, this is how the seasons work. Part of you doesn't, can't believe that if finally this win, it's over, the winner's going to end soon. I'm not going to have to bundle my kids up to take them on bike rides, so it's going to be hot and green and all the dead trees are going to be alive, even though they weren't really dead, they just were naked really. I mean, it's not a dead tree, it's a naked tree, the leaves are the clothes. And I like trees wearing clothes, naked trees are creepy to quote Voltaire, the point is I think that's what we're seeing right now with this pandemic. And I could be wrong, and maybe someone's going to play this for me in a few months and be like, oh, were you ever wrong? Now we're all, now we have boils all over our body from a mutated straight of the thing and not only that, but the earthquake that you didn't know was coming happened and the earth opened up and out of the earth, the sulfuric transformational health fumes rose into the sky and turned the birds into bullets that shot all of the children. So you were wrong, you sap. So fine, go ahead and send it to me. But that's what I think is happening with this pandemic, I think we can all kind of feel it. And I'm a fool enough to say it out loud. I don't care, so what, I'm wrong. I was also wrong about the meteor that I thought was going to impact at the beginning of this fucking pandemic. I thought the whole thing was a scam, they just wanted us to go indoors because they knew a meteor was going to impact the planet. And I wish I could have filmed my wife the many times she let me tell her that I think this is what it is in the many times in various ways. She said, what are you talking about? That is not what's happening. As it turns out, she was right. A meteor didn't impact. I was wrong. So I could be wrong about this, but I think we're at the end of this thing. I think maybe even by the summer, this thing's going to start melting away. And that is really exciting. A little dreadful too, by the way, because right now I've got the ultimate excuse to not go out. It's like, are you fucking crazy? There's a pandemic. You think I'm going to go out? I can't do stand up right now. I care. I care too much to do stand up. You know, it's a perfect excuse, but soon we're not going to have it anymore. And so we're going to have to come to terms with it, and we're all going to be like for a little bit. We're all going to have to be really sweet to each other. I tweeted some snarky thing the other day and deleted it, just because I realized, like, no, don't do that right now. We're going to have to be really extra kind to each other coming up here. We're going to have to like join in with the spring a little bit, because I mean, I don't all of us, especially the callous baby hearts out there, man, we're rattled. Folks are freaked and excited, but freaked out. So we got to be, we got to be extra sweet, mimic the spring, you know, like in those moments where you're about to like, you know, symbolically give someone the linguistic back hand because you feel like they're whatever wrong and you're right, you know, turn that, turn that back hand, whatever it was you were going to do, whether it was some passive aggressive, shitty symbolic back turning or legitimate assault verbally or hopefully not physically turn that into just turn into flowers. This is the best time to do it because the earth does it right. It turns all the dead shit into flowers and it does it right at the perfect time in the spring and all those flowers appear and all the leaves appear and you have to be no matter what it's like, no matter what, it's going to get you, it's going to sink past all your defense mechanisms and it's going to remind you of the reason that I like being an existing sentient being in this particular material universe and the swath of the multiverse that we find ourselves, which is that it, the flowers always end up growing somehow or another. They're always there. No matter how grim you assign personality to the winner, you know, no matter how grim, no matter how dedicated to being cold, naked and deadly, the winter personified may be whether it likes it or not, flowers start growing out of it. Whether it likes it or not, it's just as the way it goes. Is that a permanent situation? No. And probably the winter is it looks on and shock is the spindly dead skeletal branches of its infinite trees begin to grow leaves again. Maybe it knows like, yeah, go ahead, do your fucking spring rant podcasting sap, but give it some time and I'm going to get these fucking leaves off of me and freeze up again. It's true. You can't, you know, accept you have to, you have to accept both realities. We need one for the other. That's the whole unfortunate point. You know, somebody tweeted some weird thing at me about this, the midnight gospel on Netflix saying, how can you say gospel, which means good news and midnight, which means darkness. It's like saying happy evil, some terrible misinterpretation of what I think we were attempting in the name of that show, what I thought it could mean, you know, which is like a more of like a, you know, the two things can exist together, not that midnight's bad. I mean, if it was eternally daytime, we would all go crazy within a week, hate it. So I get it. There's a place, obviously for shitty, cold, creepy, lonely pandemics, I guess they happen. So there must be some place for them, but if you're going to have a pandemic, unless it's the end of the world, you're going to also get an after the pandemic. That's the, that's what you get for getting to the other side of a pandemic and after the pandemic, a time where like we are going to be hanging out with each other and we're not going to take it for granted for at least a few weeks, a time where we're going to be gathering together and be like, holy shit, we get to be together and not worry that one of us is going to kill the other one. I think that's right around the corner and I'm very excited about it. And that's my spring sappy rant. Got a great show for you today, Fred's, Danielli Bollelli is here with us. We're going to jump right into it. But first, this, a big thank you to Chromadex, TrueNiogen for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Let's face it, aging isn't fun. We develop wrinkles, our backache and our stamina decreases. We can't turn back the clock, but we can take a daily supplement that supports healthy aging, TrueNiogen. TrueNiogen elevates our NAD levels, an essential co-enzyme required for cellular energy and repair, which declines by as much as 50% as we get older. As we age, our bodies have a harder time coping with the cellular damage resulting from life stressors like lack of exercise or poor diets. TrueNiogen is the only NAD boosting supplement I trust as it's backed by 11 clinical studies and Nobel Prize winning scientists. Make age just a number with TrueNiogen.

And I would love to invite you to head over to Patreon.com forward slash DTFH and join your true family. I want to help you not get savaged by the animals of spring. This is not a threat. My attorneys have told me exactly how to say this, so it isn't a threat. I am not saying that if you don't sign up and subscribe to Patreon.com forward slash DTFH, there's a 95% chance that a small to mid-sized animal will attack you. It's not going to kill you and I'm not saying anything like it would kill you, but it's going to leave potentially some gaping, painful wounds. You'll probably have to get some shots because the animal could have been infected with some. I'm not saying the animal was infected with some special bio weapon that my team of scientists has developed. Not saying anything. In fact, I'm not, I don't even know what I'm saying. Is that what you want me to say? To reiterate, I am not saying that I've done anything to the animal kingdom or to any creature. I'm not saying that I do or do not have a biologist working for me to develop bio weapons that create aggressive animals at all. And I'm not saying that if you subscribe to my Patreon, there will be a less of a risk of you being attacked this spring by a creature.

He's an author, he's a philosopher, he's a martial artist, he teaches history. He's like an Italian Bruce Lee Indiana Jones Socrates. He's written a lot of great books and he's got some wonderful podcasts. I've been on the drunken Taoist, but he also has history on fire. And if this is your first time meeting, Danielli, I'm sure after you listen to this, you're going to want to subscribe to his podcast where he gives brilliant renditions of various exciting oftentimes violent periods in human history. I feel lucky to call him my friend. So now everybody, please welcome to the DTFH, Danielli Bolelli. Danielli Bolelli, welcome back to the DTFH. Holy shit, man. Look where you're at. Beautiful. Oh, hi. Not a bad gig. Not a bad gig at all. It's one of the escape zones, isn't it? It's like one of the LA escape zones. Yeah, it feels awesome because the problem with small places, you know, most small places can be beautiful settings. They are amazing, but you're usually surrounded by four toothless red necks who are doing horrible things to each other's siblings. But that's not the case in Hawaii. Hawaii is small, so it has all the advantages of the small place, but it's also has a pretty vibrant cultural life. It's close enough to LA that if you need to go in, you can. I dig it. It's a perfect medium. Um, well, I'm glad that you got out of LA. I read this hilarious article yesterday about how the, what do they call them? They don't call them influencers anymore, but just basically like Jake Paul, like all of those people have now started leaving LA, which is that's great. I mean, that's the, that's crazy to think that even those people that have started bailing on the city. Well, I mean, right now it just, who knows what is going to be in a year or two, but right now we're doing pandemic time where so many things are closed down, where all the advantages of living in the cities are really not there. And all the things you have earned at these advantages, it kind of makes sense that, you know, unless you absolutely have to be in LA because you do have a job that require your physical presence, most stuff is not like that at this moment. So why be in a place where you're, you know, two years from now, maybe since, you know, when things are open, everything, who knows, maybe it's a whole different story. But right now it doesn't make sense. For me, it doesn't make sense for good. Like I don't want to go back to living in a city, but, um, but I understand for most people, I don't different story. You, but like, as you, as you start like unwrapping why live in a city, you know, but in looking at it, uh, and then you just play around with the math of that. Like, okay, what happens if we remove all the people who are in a city because of work, how many people are left in this city? Can the city sustain itself? No, it's because of work. That's it. It really boils down to work. Yeah. That's, that's the idea is like you go to a city because there's people in the city and because there's people in the city, there's work in the city to, for all the various things, variety of things that need to be there for a city to function. So we need engineers. We need maintenance people. We need politicians. We need teachers, but then you can't work. Now all the, then the city starts sort of unraveling and then, then the people who are in the city that are left, it's, they're in this strange predicament because the, the life of the city isn't there anymore. Like that magical spark is gone. And, and so yeah, that's a really curious, is there, as a historian, can you think of other times in history where there was like people fleeing the cities and, and what happened after a city depopulates? Like what, what does happen? Yeah, totally. I mean, if you look at like some, even if you look at like Rome, you know, was the center of the ancient world in the Mediterranean for a long time, Rome, at some point did not recover its population at its site for Santuris and Santuris. Afterwards, Rome, after a while, for, and not for a while, like for a few years for Santuris was like some backwater place. It was surreal because you would have all these monumental architecture, all these fantastic things falling in, falling in ruins, essentially, because nobody knew how to take care of it anymore. Even the technology, the knowledge of how to do certain things, you know, this phenomenal aqueduct, the water system is great, except no one knows how to fix it anymore. So it's kind of as that planet of the apes field where you're there and you see this remnants of this amazing thing that just gone and decayed and turning into something else. That's like the heavy one. That's like the long term stuff. Most, most of the time was short term stuff, you know, it's like, there's a plague and so everybody flees to the countryside and they are away from the city. And then three years later, they are back and they rebuild and six years later, it looks like nobody ever left kind of thing. Yeah, but those, every, the difference between those times and this time is that those people didn't have technology. They didn't have the ability to do what we're doing right now. And so they had to go back to the city because that's where the work was. To me, that's the part that's, if you look at like the Silicon Valley, uh, the shift out of San Francisco, if you look at all the big companies that are letting their employees work remotely, would you say that we might like witness a reconfiguration of, uh, of the kind of city-centered city life versus agrarian life that there could be a kind of a weird homogenization of those two former polarities? Sure. And I think that's the, that's the hope that one can have out of this fairly obnoxious scenario that has been, that we have been wrapped up in the past year or some, that it leads to a transformation where there's a lot more freedom for people to work remotely and not be stuck having to be glued to this one place, uh, where they don't really want to live there, but they have to, because that's where the job is. And so they have to pay crazy overpriced, inflated values to live in an overcrowded place. Um, the double-edged sword there is this, is that the one, one of the big diseases of modern life is loneliness, you know, people are already not enough part of a community, not enough part of anything. And so physical work, and I don't mean physical work as in using your hands, but I mean physical work as in a work that require your physical presence is one of the very few ways that people have had to actually interact with other human beings in this kind of society. So the question becomes, if you remove that component, will these free up people to have more time and energy to actually build meaningful relationship outside of work, because they live in a smaller community, they become invested in a smaller community, maybe they create a little village with their friends where they all live close to one another. That's the idea, that would be the best of both worlds. You get the old tribal style of close-knit community with the novelty of communication where you can interact with the whole world. The downside is if people instead are like locking their little cabin in a bomber style in the middle of nowhere, they don't talk to anybody. They don't see anybody other than online. And then that's a nightmare. Yeah. Right. Yeah. That, that is scary. That possibility, because in that possibility, what's really odd about that is that, you know, looking at like the, like, you know, dystopian, like Wally style projections of some futuristic society where you are in the bubble, things just get delivered to you, you don't have to leave. The, it creates a really strange thing that can happen to someone, which is that you're, the people that you're communicating with could be replaced by deep fakes possessed by an AI and you would never even know it. Pretty much, right? You're in the matrix at that point. Yeah. You're in, like you could, you could fool, you could put someone in a house. It's like some technological, like Plato's cave, except it's not like shadows on the wall. It's fucking AI infused deep fakes of the people that were their friends. Yeah. They don't even know they're not even talking to them. And you could do the same thing to their phone. So when they're calling, the number is just going to a deep fake and that could happen to every single one of these bubble dwellers. And they would never know there's a possibility that they would never know. That is one of the creepy out, like weird things that could, that could happen. You know, you could be, you could theoretically a country that it become hyper insulated and it reduced where the, each person is, as you're saying, it become like some kind of techno reclusive worker. Theoretically, if you had to, some kind of amazing technological weapon, you could attack the country by just making people, like by sending in like AI clones to people's zoom meetings and confusing the fuck out of everybody. Suddenly you're like, imagine if like you, so you and I are talking on zoom and suddenly I'm like, fuck you, fuck you. Well, you piece of fucking shit. I'm flying there to kick your fucking ass. You'd be like, Duncan, what's, are you okay? You know what I mean? I mean, while the same thing's happening to me from you or some other version of it, that is one of the creepy things. But I don't think that, I mean, do you really think that version of reality is possible to atrophied, like hibernating techno human completely lonely? It's kind of weird because on one end, no, because you figure and you hope that people are smart enough to see the potential in it. On the other end, I mean, I don't know if it ever happened to you. Like sometime does it ever happen where maybe you have people around you or cool, nice people and, you know, they are trying to interact with you. And you're like, yeah, yeah, that's great. But let me go back to reply to Joe Blu on Twitter about what's going on. And suddenly you're like treating that interaction as more real than the people who are physically right in front of you. And you're like, what the fuck am I doing? Why? Yes. Yeah, that's it. You have identified a real fucking problem, some shadowy. You don't know what that you've been talking to. Yeah. Comes into your mind a few hours later, you're thinking about Zornag nine, eight, one, seven, sixes critique of something you said. Yes. Yes. Instead of like your kids. Yes. And that's when like, oh, something is wrong in this picture. Yeah. Yeah. That's like a fungus. That's like a form of futuristic technological athlete's foot. You know, like some, some techno mold is like crept into you. And now you're like thinking of, of that shit. You know, I, I try, I can't, I can't get her to not do that. I try to get my wife to not look at, I'm like, don't look at the comments. Right. Right. You know, because it, like you have to learn that over time. Yeah. You'll get infected. Yeah. So that's one of the problems is that suddenly you're prioritizing relationships with beings that you don't even know are human. Yep. Could be a lab monkey that has learned how to telepathically communicate with Twitter. Right. Could be an AI bot. Could be something you don't even know what the fuck it is. Could be a, could be like a group of humans floating in some gel. All interacting is one super being via Twitter. You know, you just, that's the thing. You don't know what you're talking to on that motherfucker or whatever your particular social media thing is. Thank you. Squarespace for sponsoring yet again, an episode of the DTFH.

Thank you, Squarespace. Yeah, so yeah, that is one of the possibilities, but then I think of this superstition and hype. I think of PR campaigns or in other words, like the brand of the city and its necessity to keep itself alive, not just via some industry, but by some sentimentality connected to the city. You know what I mean? You run into the person who's like, I'm an Angelino, oh God, just a, oh, riding down sunset Boulevard on a Friday when the sun is setting and you are going to the house of blues, I got out of the pinks. You get that kind of thing that shows up, which is a weird allegiance with what is nothing more than a kind of convergence of workers. So I think that part of the negative appraisals of what I am hoping is a kind of new way of living. It's more related to the branding of cities and this kind of existential threat. If all of a sudden we're all like, I can be a fucking Angelino and live in North Carolina. No, and I think that's actually can work out great for everybody. Because if you take away, doesn't have to be the mass access, I mean it is a mass access, but it's not like a night and day thing. If you take away 20% of a population from a city, man, does that place become a lot more livable? There's less traffic, you got to play. So people who are actually are in the cities, aren't going to enjoy their city a lot more. And people who are not in the city are going to enjoy it a lot more because they get to create their own close knit community in a small place. So potentially it can be awesome for everybody, theoretically speaking. Of course it depends on how you play those cards. From that point of view, you're looking at cities do what's it called viral shedding, which is like, you know what I mean? Because at some point they have depopulated, and because of that depopulation, it's like, holy shit, this is amazing. I love it here. It starts slowly filling up, filling up. It's like a cyst that starts filling with more and more people. It gets more and more expensive, and then because it's so crowded, suddenly it becomes like a nexus for disease, or some other destabilizing contagion, and then all of these assholes like me are like, I'm out of here. That's like probably what a sneeze comes from. It's just a certain number of dissatisfied, bitchy, cold viruses being like, ah, this dude, he's driving here, he sucks, everything's always sucked out of these lungs. He used to be nice, but he's not anymore, and they're not to blow them all out of your nose. They go and infect somebody else. I know, I'm in a new place, it's great. You know, that's probably what it is. Cities are just pustules that fill with people until they begin to fuck up, then they spray those people all over the country, suddenly people in Texas are like, God, damn it. LA, shit, it's fucking, didn't know the shit. Right. That's the reality, right? You can only add so many people to a small place, or not even small, but take any size. If you add a certain number of people past the point, it becomes overcrowded, conditions of life begin to go down the drain. Think about a place like LA, or think about any city. What happens to that infrastructure when you double the population? When you triple it? When you quadruple it? Yeah. Because to shit, inevitably, quality of life takes a nosedive. So there is that process of like, grow, grow, grow, okay, you hit a limit, now it's not that good anymore, and shrink a little. Okay, now it's back to decent size. Now, before you could have, because the city was the place, there was no other option if you wanted certain jobs. Now, maybe, maybe, because just until the other day, there was this superstition that you have to be physical in the office, and everybody, the boss needs to look at you kind of thing. Right. Now, that's hopefully changing. So that could give some serious opportunities to redesign in what life entails, and work, and community, and everything else. Right. Well, we haven't really, I'm sure that we haven't had a chance, they're really sort of sift through all the data. So we don't know for sure, regarding like productivity, because how are you really going to measure that? You need a few years to see what effect it has, but I think the early reports coming in is that people are either weirdly more productive, or the same level of productive. I mean, you know, from the perspective, I'm sure of someone who's been spending, God knows how much on commercial real estate to house their workers, it's the best thing ever for the workers to work remotely. But it's not fair, because you're kind of saddled now, you're like telling your workers, you need to pay for your office. But you know, your office is probably a corner of your bedroom or something. So you're there anyway. Great. You know, if the trade office, I don't have to drive an hour and a half each time or something in life. I'll pay for my office 10 times, I'll have my office by the swimming pool, I'll do, you know, whatever. But there should be an, don't you think there should be an acknowledgement, like we're still fighting over whether or not we should pay people minimum wage. This is never going to fucking happen. But it feels like there should be an acknowledgement. There should be an acknowledgement of like, okay, because we no longer have an office, we're not paying, you know, depending on how large the company was, we're not paying 10, we just saved, you know, 10, 50, 100, I don't know, millions of dollars a year. So I feel like that money, a little bit of that should be put, given back to the workers. Yeah, you know, if the person in charge is a decent human being, that could be an option. But of course, you know, you're relying on the goodwill and good attitude of the person in charge, which is always a sketchy game, since usually the name of the game when you run a company is maximize profit at all costs. But again, some people are cool. Some people are, they realize that they can make a lot of money and be cool to their workers at the same time. That is not an either or, and that's the, again, that's the ideal scenario, right? You make life better for everybody. And on top of it, it's good for you. Win-win, you know, that's to me, it's the... Win-win. Yeah, it's the ultimate strategies. Like to me, I'm very interested in strategies that don't rely on me fucking over you in order to get my own, but in working out something that works for me, and guess what, also works for you. That to me is the ultimate win-win, because when it's not like that, then you are planting the seeds of conflict, you're planting the seeds of people coming to shoot you at your house, you're planting the seeds of you on a war, but really you're just taking a break and taking the next war because the defeated side is pissed off and want revenge. It never works. You know, it just doesn't work well. So you need to, it's important to figure out ways that everybody can be happy enough with that they are like, you know, that works for me, cool. Get your own, I'm glad for you, because I'm also getting something. So we're good. I want to thank Purple for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. Throw some betting on a bunch of different mattresses and sure, they all look alike. The same goes for pillows, but peel away the layers and look at what's inside and you'll see they aren't all created equal. And that's what makes every purple pillow and mattress unlike anything you've ever slept on. And I'm sorry if mattress and pillow charlatans have invaded the media and given you the impression that they have some special kind of pillow, which has made you feel cynical regarding the possibility that there are actually futuristic pillows out there. But I'm telling you, the purple pillow and mattress is the real thing. It's amazing. I was legitimately excited because we pulled all our shit out of storage and I found my purple pillow.

So you're always on the cool side of the pillow. Okay. That's what I have to read. I just have to say, I have scoliosis. Massuses have described my back as a pretzel. I have a twisted back. It's twisted and it's like an old vine and a graveyard. So when I find a thing that I could sleep on where I wake up and my back doesn't hurt, I remember it.

It's important to figure out ways that everybody can be happy enough with that they are like, you know, that works for me. Cool. Get your own. I'm glad for you because I'm also getting something. So we're good. Right. Yeah, that's sort of the dreamy. That's like the dreamy. That's the dreamy idea. You know, some people, a lot of us, we're just not happy. You know, it's like the general confusion is that if I achieve this particular level of comfort or security, I'm going to have some happiness, but what if that's not the case? Oh man. Yeah. You're hitting the door that I've been going through a lot lately because I'm about to release an episode on Bruce Lee. I went into a very deep dive on Bruce Lee's life and one thing I never picked up on when I was reading on Bruce Lee earlier, when I researched Bruce Lee in the past, I never picked up his relationship with success and in this last time, it really hit me big because the thing with him is that he achieves things that are unreal, right? Like the success that Bruce Lee has in the span of a couple of years is the equivalent of winning the lottery five times in a row. The odds are next to impossible and he pulls it off, you know, he's a Chinese dude with a heavy accent who managed to become the biggest actor in the world in that moment. World one. It's unreal. And then you see his interviews, you see what he says and there's the sense that, you know, he was looking for success because that was going to deliver all his dreams, was going to increase his opportunity to choose the life he wants and instead it actually shrinks his range of choice because suddenly for one, he doesn't know whether the money train is going to end anytime soon or not. So he has to keep the food, the food on the gas pedal the whole time. He can no longer go anywhere. He feels every interaction he has, he doesn't know if somebody's really been a friend or they want something from him and on top of it, he just drives himself nuts, he's working all day long because he feels like the opportunities are here now. I don't know if they will be here tomorrow. I need to take them. And in the process of doing that, he just lacks his body and his physical state, which then made it a lot easier to have an allergic reaction to medication that they demand. But it's a crazy tale. Wow. You know, you see a guy who's a god. I mean, the stuff he pulls off is so amazing that you have to just bow down the genius of it all. And yet he's less happy than he ever was. And it was weird for me when I was researching because I started researching it about a couple of years ago when for me, I was, you know, I never had much money or things, but a couple of years ago, things were turning for me in a good way where I was like, oh, shit, I'm actually doing better than I ever have. This is interesting. And I remember my lady Savannah one day was looking at me and she's like, that's not what success looks like to me. And I'm like, what do you mean? And I'm like, waking up and like three seconds after I open my eyes, I'm checking emails and replying, I'm working till 1am. I'm like, how should I have been really successful here? And I'm just like, no, motherfucker, yeah, your bank account is in healthier shape than it has been. But no, your quality of life has gone down and not up. Unless you make some serious adjustments, it's so easy to just get that dopamine heat from life. I made more money. Okay, I feel a little better. And it's just like, yeah, dangerous, dangerous game. Wow. Yeah, like you were told what success is via media and it's it looks good. I mean, especially like on TV, it looks amazing because you don't see these people in between the movies they're acting in or the tiny little frame of time that you're that they're captured in some interview and interview. They're like these beautiful, witty people, but then you don't see the in between. Yeah. And most importantly, you don't feel their consciousness because if you could, maybe you would realize like, oh, Jesus, God, these people who do have more access, these people who are like, you know, living in multiple beautiful fucking homes and never will ever worry about not being able to pay a bill are just as freaked out when they wake up in the morning as I am. But I thought the reason I was freaked out was because I didn't have that stuff. Yeah. Oh, God. What the fuck? This is awful because then you start getting the sense that you've had a pretty, a pretty massive trick played on you. It's a trick like somebody tricked me into believing this shit. And it's not like that. I mean, it's cereal box philosophy that you stuff says it going to make you happy. You hear that like on those Yoda dolls where you pull the string or whatever. It's not like we're talking about some kind of high level shit here. And yet there's a reason that floats in the air around your ambition. Is it just like, because to me, it's like the, you know, like the dopamine hits for making money. Oh, how sweet they are. But they can't match the dopamine hits when you just ran two more miles and you thought you were going to run on a day when it's like cold and raining. You know what I mean? Nothing can match. Nothing can match that. Like that's the real, that's the real juice, you know, it's like, and that's, I love that because I don't care how fucking rich you are. You can't, nobody can run for you. Nobody can do pushups for you, you know, no one can like write a book for you and no one can learn piano for you and no one can like learn a new language for you. You have to do that. It doesn't matter how much money you have. It's an equal playing field and not in the level of like achieving like some kind of, you know, in transforming yourself, refining yourself. You know what I mean? Like money isn't going to do anything. Abundance in that way isn't going to do anything. Yeah, it's a weird thing because clearly money makes dealing with a bunch of problems that deal, people deal with every day a hundred times easier. Fuck yes. You know, if you can just say, don't worry about that, the car is broken, fine, taken care of, no problem. Yeah. So that does take away a hell of a lot of real stress. So that part is real and that's why it's not that people are stupid, it's like there's a very good reason why people feel many if I only had more money life would be easier. Yeah, it would be easier, but no, it would be easier. It would not be by any stretch of the imagination, suddenly everything clicks. No, that's a whole separate thing. It's like you just have, you start a game with better cards. That's all there is. It doesn't mean you won the game. It's just you start the game with better cards. That's great. But then in no way shape or form ensures the fact that, you know, it, it give you great chances that you're going to have good cards at the end, but it doesn't ensure that happiness factor, which is the one that ultimately winning the game is all about. And that's where, you know, where we mistake the, the process that we think is going to deliver it for the actual experience and the actual experience. Unfortunately, you know, unless you, unless you know how to, unless you have it at every step of the way in one form or another, you're not going to get there. You know, you're not going to have that moment where you get there and you're like, oh, now I get to have the experience is like, no, that's not how it works. No. No. That's so infuriating, but you, but it's also exciting, isn't it? It's like, to me, that's like as I spin through, you know, as you, if you, like, if you're, if you're like an old school conspiracy person as I am, you grew up taking acid, you know, looking at dollar bills, thinking about like all the things that like, well, if they've made this like massively illegal and it just makes me feel amazing and seems to improve my quality of life, then what other shit if they completely fucked up? Yeah. And so it's, it creates this like, this sort of at first, your whole world can like fall apart as you're looking out at it and thinking like, my God, how much of what I do is even my own freedom and how much of it has been implanted in me by people who just like have we've all gone into some hypnotic resonant field that seems to be centered on consuming or more importantly, an addiction to new stuff. You know, we want new shirts, new clothes, new car, new house, new this, new that, novelty addiction specifically. But then over time, I want to like refine and refine the conspiracy theories, bringing them all together into one sort of profound, you know, they want like the, the, what's in physics, they want the unified field theory. I want the unified conspiracy theory of theories, right. And to me, it centers around this very conversation we're having, which is you can control your states of consciousness to induce identical levels of joy and bliss that you would have if you did achieve all the, if you did like accrue all the globlets of matter or whatever, you don't need any of that. If you are in control of your nervous system enough, theoretically, you could induce those states minus procuring them, minus the transaction, minus the hoarding of the one style of energy to get the other style of energy. And you know what I mean? You could do it minus any of that. And that, that, if we all started figuring out how to do that, would completely put a bullet right in the fucking dark oozing heart of society as we know it. Yeah. Because no one's going to do it. Now everyone's going to be like, I don't really, I'm not going to go for that. You know, I don't need, no, I really don't need a job that pays me that much because in my reasonably priced whatever, I feel like I'm in heaven just because I've gained control of my consciousness enough. Totally man. Like one of the key, one of the Cardinal Dawes concepts is the idea of knowing when to stop. And they say that if you don't know when to stop, that's when all sort of calamities will follow. Because there is a sweet spot where you know where you hit everything you can get from that and pushing forward is not going to deliver more of the good stuff. It's not going to make life any easier. It's just going to make you addicted to running on this wheel like a hamster kind of thing. And so the idea of knowing, and again, knowing when to stop, meaning you have to get there, is not necessarily, again, if you are homeless on the street, we can talk about how, you know, you can find a happiness in this moment. It's like, yeah, fucking easy for you to say you're not dealing with my mechanic guy, Joe, who's next to me stealing my sleeping bag as soon as I turn around. So I get it, you know, there is a place where- I can't afford insulin, motherfucker. Exactly, exactly. 100%. So we're not saying this thing like, everybody, just find your bliss now while in the middle of the Rwandan genocide, or while you have no money to eat, you know, no, those are real problems. Got it. But once you get to a certain point where you have food on the table, you have a reasonably assured roof over your head, you have, you know, the basics of life to keep you going, then a lot of that is where it becomes a game of diminishing return, you know, working like a dog to make more money. How much more of your life is it going to deliver in terms of potentials for happiness? Not a whole lot, if anything, it can actually get to a point where it's counterproductive. So in knowing where it's like, no, I'm good, this is good, this is what I need. I don't need to work 10 times as hard to make more. This is the good spot. Yeah. I just bought a fucking house, man. So I'm the biggest hypocrite on the fucking earth right now. I bought into the thing by a fucking house. I didn't want to rent anymore. I want to know what it's like to buy a house. That's the problem with consumerism is because it's like, I can theoretically imagine what it's like to own a yacht, but I can never really know what it's like to own a yacht until I own a yacht. Yeah. And you know what I mean? So this is the terrible like carat they dangle in front of the greedy little rabbit in our hearts is it's like, oh yeah, fuck your philosophical shit. I want to know what it's like to have this or that or that. And then when you get the thing, it's always the identical result, which is not much. Didn't really seem to ripple the waters much at all. There is this cool, I mean, it's cool like in a video game or something, but it's like, it's not like, you know, there wasn't the, you know, after the grand initiation of being vetted by a zillion different people to buy a fucking house, which is the, you know, Western initiation ritual of adulthood or of like, you know, it's clearly an initial, it's clearly an occult initiation ceremony. Yeah. The signing ritual, you got to go into a room and like do a completely pointless like signing of like a trillion sheets of paper in front of a like special person, the notary, who's been authorized by some other thing to like be there to watch the signings. And it's the whole thing is like, to me, it seems even more ridiculous than some of the like initiate initiation rituals I've seen in documentaries, you know, where people are like, you know, putting praying manises on their nipples or like, you know what I mean? Like, it's like, that makes more sense than like, all right, yeah, okay, I'll sign this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this and this. And now the signing is done. And then you get this key and then now this like shell that another thing used to live in, you go and inhabit and the difference is this is my shell versus I'm leasing a shell from someone else who's a shell collector who leases shells to these weird fucking, you know, creatures that we are that like to like curl up in shells and pretend that this is our home. You know, I think the level you're talking about though, despite the fact that I'm done with the whole praying mantis on the people's metaphor, it's just any day I bow to such divine creation. But, but, you know, if you're talking about one house, you're talking about where you live, you're talking, that's very real. Okay, so I get it. You know, you want to have your place where you have a say so where you don't have it. Sorry, where you don't have a hustle landlord who's yelling at you, telling you what you can do, checking out the rent, all of that. The problem is not that the problem is when it's like, okay, I got a house. Now what? Now I need the bigger car. Okay, now I got it. Now I want the boats. No, now I want two boats. Now I want three houses. Now I was because that's the beach house. It's like when you have something that is like, no, you got the good stuff, you have a house, you have food, you have the, oh, there's a medical issue you need to take care of, you can, at that point, you're good. If you make more money because you happen to do stuff you love and actually pays off, great, that's a win. But, you know, to still think with the mentality that got you there, you know, it's a weird contradiction because in order to be great at something or even not to be great, but just to plain and simple make money. But let's take it even in the better sense, even if you want to be great at something, you need to be kind of obsessive because you need to be disciplined, you need to push yourself, you want to fuck off for the day and relax, and instead you're going to be driven and you're going to make it happen, you know, the whole rhetoric of the grind will get you to be able to achieve the results. But then it becomes also a drug because it's like, well, okay, you got the results. And why are you still grinding? Why are you still there beating yourself up about, I need to go harder. I need to keep pushing. I'm like, why? He was a means to an end. It's not a, and so that's where it becomes a problem. And that's why, in fact, it's not that it's good or bad. It is like the whole grind, the porn that people seem to deliver forever in terms of motivational speaking is good to some degree, the hustle, but then past that point is actually poison. And so knowing how much to use, where it helps you, you know, having a little obsessiveness that helps you be driven and makes stuff happen. But also knowing that it's like, I did it. Now I can turn it down by 80% and play with my kids more. And that's the good life. Unfortunately, those are two opposite sides of the brain, you know, the stuff that make you obsessive and driven clashes with the side that actually teaches to relax and enjoy the moment. And those are almost two different sets of personalities that most people cannot bring together. Yeah, like one is the like war general and the other is the like monk or the, you know, poorest person. And there, yeah. Yeah. And I think, you know, I just think it's the difficult, like, I think it's difficult for people just to admit, like, look, you need to understand that you're having a hard time being alone with yourself. Like, you know, like that, like, you got to look at that because you can't, you're, you're, anytime you find yourself alone, you're getting on your phone and trying to do more shit or your, you know what I mean? That's, that seems to be the condition. That's the, that's the, that's the unified conspiracy is it's like, look, you can't be alone with, by your, you're having a really hard time not doing anything. And if enough of us just stopped doing 2% of what we do, I think you'd see a profound change in society itself. God, imagine if everyone just stopped working 10%. If they, if they took, if they worked 10% less, there would be a dramatic shift. But then to me, the conspiracy part of it is exactly what you're talking about, the grind porn. It's like there, there is an invisible, you know, like there's an invisible person beating the drum. Yes. That is creating the rhythm that society is rowing at, you know, and if you don't walk out, you know, you'll think you're the one who's deciding to row at that rhythm. And until suddenly you realize like, wait a minute, what, why am I doing this? Why am I fucking doing this shit? Yep. Yep. What am I doing? And usually by the time you like that happens, you've had like a heart attack. You know what I mean? You've been diagnosed and you're like, oh, shit. 100% man. And that's the hard thing. It's figuring is really being honest with oneself and figure out what do I need to be happy? What do I need? The, what are the things that truly I need to work hard to make it happen? And at what point will I know when to stop and be and enjoy life more and relax? Like one thing I loved about growing up in Italy was the fact that didn't even matter how poor you were, almost anyone was not on the street by August time would take off pretty much everything was closed in August. There was hardly any work and people would just go to the sea. You know, if you had money, you go to the fancy place by the sea. If you don't have money, you go to some crappy, whatever, cheaper place. But at the end of the day, everybody just spent a month laying down on the beach, sitting there, going swimming, sunbathing, reading books, doing whatever. Beautiful. And that's how you spend the whole month. And that does phenomenal things to your psyche, because for a month, you're not grinding, you're not pushing forward, you're not going with this, I need to hustle. You're just kicking back. And it's not a week or two where really there's not even time to adjust to that. Like usually in a week or two, people almost get depressed because they don't know what to do with themselves. No, you have a month, a month start becoming a serious stretch of time. You do have that moment where you go like, whoa, I don't know what to do when I'm not working all the time. But then you're like, you know what, sitting here on the beach, sunbathing, going for a swim and reading a book feels pretty damn good. And you have a chance to really reevaluate your life, to think like, huh, this is me not doing anything. This is me not just being an extension of my job title. This is me how I want to spend my time. Oh, and now I actually want to do this other thing. I want to go visit that place or hang out with my friend and give you a chance to reconnect with what it means to be human, which I think as a society is monstrously important. It's the equivalent of taking a meditation break during the day at a social level to have like the one month off where you just go do nothing or go do something. But it's something you choose to do, you know? I think that's one of the reasons why people in America, when they go to somewhere in Europe or India and they realize that like, and they see an older civilization and they look at the way that life is conducted in some of these. I remember in Sri Lanka looking, oh, it's the sun is setting. We're on the train and it's just people are just out. But they're not doing anything. They're watching the sun. I remember once seeing people watching like just, you know, boy husbands and wives and boyfriends and girlfriends with these beautiful blankets laid out that they put out to it. And this isn't like any special day. It's just any day. That's how it is. And they've got blankets out and the sun is setting. And I remember what, like there's a video game called Katamari Damacy, which shows this funny, flowery, beautiful world. But it was that beautiful in the sense that a goat, I was watching a goat as the train goes by going up the hill, getting on his back, sliding down the hill and going back up. Even the goats were fucking off. Yeah, of course. You know, like they had tuned into this chilled out vibe that was possible. You know, yeah, I love it. I, you know, I think it's a very inspiring thing that you're saying. And it seems to be one of the great paradoxes of technology is like, how is it that with all this accelerated ability to conduct business, we still are working the same, if not more? Yes. Yes. Absolutely. And that's where the addiction kicks in, because that's all you know how to do. You don't know what it means to sit in the garden and relax. I get scared. Yeah, you feel that your self-worth is tied to this. You know, you don't get self-worth from sitting in the garden. I get self-worth because I'll do this hard work and people will pay me for it. You have it. Nobody else showed you any different, you know, that kind of stuff. I mean, to me, really, when I was doing this, I wasn't even realizing it. And like when Savannah was looking at me and going like, this does not look like success. She said like, what, five words or something? And I was like, whoa, that's 100% right. He's like, what am I doing? What the hell is this? You know. And so it's the way you see it is a very Taoist game, right? It is these opposite things that you both need because you do need that ability to be disciplined, get stuff done, work hard. That's an important part of life. But you also need the good stuff is also that allows that other side, the stuff that enjoy the moment, the stuff that can relax, that plays with kids, that is more carefree. That gives, they need, they need to find that healthy balance. And that's kind of like what you were referring to earlier. Now, actually the way you said it made me think of something I wrote in my very first book. I used the image that was almost identical to what you said. You are talking about this war general and the monk. I use the hippie samurai. To me, the hippie samurai is exactly that. You know, you need that samurai side that's disciplined, that makes it happen, that say that he's going to do something and he does and all of that. And at the same time, this happy EP drop acid, look at the sky and enjoy the texture of the tree in front of you. That's what makes life worth it. Because otherwise you're just an asshole who's effective. Who cares? He's like, yeah, you're disciplined and effective. Good job. Hitler was disciplined and effective too. That doesn't mean he's a good thing, you know, in itself. It's only, what does discipline and effectiveness mean? The two, does it create something beautiful? Otherwise, you know. It's a good question to ask yourself from time to time is, how much am I like Hitler? And don't do that. Yes. Don't be like Hitler. Yes, yes. Like, don't invade. Are you about to invade France? I think Poland and France are safe from me for now. Not, I don't make no promises about tomorrow, but for today, they're both safe. Yeah, man. I think like what you're talking about is such a, I need the reminder, you know, now that I've just gone through like what essentially could only be described as some kind of capitalist seizure, you know, like a weird convulsive middle age episode of acquiring matter. Right. And now looking at like, I got kids who I'm not hanging out with as much as I'd like to. Yeah. Because I'm working to try to pay for the house. It's there's something in that it's dreadful and I don't want to be that person. I never wanted to be that person. It's so hard because, you know, you, you watch every single movie about that topic, 10,000 times, kind of what you were saying. It's almost the Yoda cookie cutter kind of wisdom and still hits you. You know, it's like, how many times have you learned a lesson, 10,000? And it's still easy to fall into it. So it's a, oh man, it's a complicated game. And yet it's the only game that is right. Yeah. That's what it's all about. Yeah. And I think that's the problem why people sometimes are, whether you look at politics or religion or anything, people, they discover something that works for them at one time. And then they want it to be the answer to all of life. And so they become addicted to these ideologies. Like it's all about hustling and being tough. It's all about being a free market capitalist. No, it's all about being a socialist. It's all about, and they, you know, they discover one tool that work one time and they want to apply to all situations in life. When in reality it's like a hammer is great to drive nails into the wall. It's not great when I want to use it as a spoon to eat soup. You know, it's like you need the balance of the game is that there's a shit lot of tools out there and you need to figure out what's the appropriate one at what time. And that requires you to be really aware, really be thinking on your feet, really be in touch with who you are and the conditions around you. And so it's no wonder that people love dogmas because dogmas are reassuring. It's like you discover one good thing and now you apply it to everything. Even though you're applying to shit where it doesn't work at all. It's like, can't you see that that problem can be solved in another way? That's way more effective. It's like, no, it's my flag. It's my identity. It's my ideology. It's my whatever. That is like, ah, fuck. To me, that's one of the big new viruses. You've just become a skipping record. Yeah, completely. It's a virus. It is. Yeah, I know what you're talking about and it robs you of novelty. It's like, if you're using the same tool or some way of interacting with the world over and over and over again, then it means that you've fallen prey to the idea that everything's the same, right? Each moment is just like the moment before meaning, yeah, you can use the same methodology. It's you lose track of the terrifying reality, which is that every single moment, the universe blips out of existence and blips. It's a new fucking universe. It might look the same to you, but at the quantum level, this shit is like constantly parts of it are not there for flickering flashes of impossibly tiny increments of time. And then they're back. So it's like, this is not the same place that it was a millisecond ago. So why are you using the identical habitual methodology for the variety of phenomena that are appearing in front of you at any given moment? Yeah, and I think it's just reassuring. It's like, it feels safe because it's like, I figured it out once. Do I really have to figure it out again and again and again? And it's like, yes, because it's not the same as the ones you figured out the last time. Good job last time. That worked. But now it's a whole different context. And so you're trying to apply the same answer to this new context doesn't work. That's how I'm distressed. Yeah, you're good. Go ahead, please. I'm distressed full of political slogans. I'm distressed full of identity, ultimately. I think that identity is a trap because it forces you to be this one thing where life requires you to be more than one thing. And so the more we insist on embracing the and other people do it too. I mean, think how life works. You know, if you are an actor and you do a really good job at playing a part, now you're going to get typecast and they are always going to call you where it's like, oh, he's the tragic character. Let's play him or he's the funny guy or perhaps jokes. Or, you know, I mean, even in anything, right? People will want to, they want to have that recognizable label that is like, I want the discipline guy. I'm going to listen to Jocko Willink every time. And maybe Jocko Willink that day wants to braid flowers in his hair, but he's like, no, I'm the discipline guy. That's what people expect from me. So I have to deliver that every single day. And he's like, we trap each other in the game. You know, we trap ourselves because identity is a seductive bitch. And we trap each other by forcing this idea on one another with expectations and everything else. And it's a dead show. Yeah, that's what Ramdas says. Sometimes we're like, sometimes you'll be like, hey, why aren't you wearing that fucking mask? You always wear. I want the mask you used to wear back on. I don't know this mask you're wearing. It's a totally different mask. I don't like that mask. Yep. But on the other mask, that's the mask I'm comfortable with. Exactly. Yeah, that's why, you know, I do think that there's this, what you're saying reminds me of this concept. I remember hearing this teacher, Roshi Joan Halifax talk about regarding Zen and insecurity. And the, you know, the way Zen koans have this sort of, they're supposed to make you feel insecure. They're supposed to like that they're pointing to the human situation is insecure. It's naturally an insecure situation. Like you don't know when you're going to die. You don't know really what's coming down the line next. And so you try to battle that insecurity with ignorance by ignoring that reality to produce a false sense of stability. And that's the projection of the identity into the world. It's like, this is a complex variety of behavior patterns that I have perfected that limit chaos in my life. That's what you think. That's exactly, I think you nailed why people are addicted to identity. Because there's this feeling that it's familiar, it's reassuring. It limits the chaotic energy that's around you. And you can fall back on it, all of that. And to some degree, it's true, but it also become a prison. You know, it also becomes this, oh, it's safe. So let me lock all the doors and stay behind the bars. And it's like, yes, it's safe to some degree. But no, it's not safe because you just put yourself in this box that ultimately life is happening around you. Things are changing and you're desperately holding on to this thing. And I mean, if you think about like, especially these days, when you hear people, you can say the sun is outside and somebody will say, I hate your politics. That's a horrible thing you said out there. You unfold, no cancel. I hate you, right? And the thing is like, why are people so hard core on some of this stuff? Because again, it's about their identities, about their sense of self in the world, about what they believe to be holy and true. When the reality is that nothing is as simple as they play it in their heads in terms of, I mean, think about like the big government, more socialistic model versus the free market capitalism. There's not a single system in the world that has 100% free market capitalism or a 100% state controlled ultra communist thing. Everything is a mix of the two. So the argument is not between two systems. The argument is, where do we draw the line? Do we do 66, 34? Do we do 52, 48? That's an argument that's so much easier to have because it's like, okay, we don't disagree about some cosmic significance of life. We're disagreeing on where exactly we tune in the dial. That's a lot. That's about strategy. We can figure out the strategy. We can try. Oh, you know what? You're right. We went a little too far away. Let's tweak it a little down now. That's a discussion that would be easy to have. You don't have to get mad about it. But instead, it's an identity thing. It's like the evil socialists are out to God, does or no, it's those bastard capitalist gods. It's like, oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, and we're not nimble enough to just, that's the problem. Government is not nimble. We have the ability to be so much more nimble than we are. I mean, just look, the amount of time it took to get relief checks to people and the amount of time, it's just not nimble. So it's not represented. Democracy has to be a representation of the will of the people, not just by voting, but literally a representation of where we're at as a people. And it's like the systems they're using to process what the people want are old, musty, hackable, fucked up, corrupt systems. So the whole thing's all gummed up. And it's like, so we can't even get to the point of like, how much do we want? 40, 60? What do we want? 30, 20? Or how about tomorrow we try 80% free market capitalism? Then the next day, let's see what happens. 100% communism. How do we like that? Okay, let's shift it a little bit. It doesn't work like that. And so this is produced this awful, you're with us or you're against us. And that's horrible, because it's like implying that there's some totalitarian mentality that a person is just one way of being, one way of thinking of things instead of this constant fucking slot machine spinning of ideas and possible experiments. It's just, we're not advanced enough yet to encapsulate, our government isn't advanced enough yet to encapsulate how advanced we've become. So it's almost as though we have to take on the personality of like Neanderthals to communicate with our government. We have to, but we're all communicating with each other with it, with I think some nuance and especially with a technology that's unprecedented. But the way, but we're having to talk to our government and ones and zeros and like, you know what I'm saying? It's like, we're like having to be like, me wonders, this is me, you, I need this one. It's like, we're way past that, but that's all they hear is these grunts. And, you know, so it's a grunt where we have this grunt language happening with the thing that's supposed to be representing how wildly advanced we've become, at least from my perspective. No, and I think you're a hundred percent right on the structural issue that like, yeah, the way society is set up, the way our political system is set up, it's like horrendously ineffective. And there's that problem. And then I think there's the other one of it, which is starts, I mean, even before we get to that level, which is a whole other kind of worms, even at a more basic level, it's inside people said, you know, people do this to themselves before it's even about how do I actually get these ideas to be implemented into practice is like, people marry into this ideological prison and they are so committed to. And so that, that's even before the practicality aspect, that's like a virus of the mind. Then if you were suddenly more enlightened and more willing, now there's the problem of, okay, now how do we actually do it? Because it's still, you know, we got the theoretical part solved, but how do you make it happen in real change in real life through governments, through governments through, that's a whole other kind of worms. But we're not even at the level of addressing that kind of war. Because before that, there's even the level of just individual inside people's brain. People are addicted to identity, to ideology, to dogma, to all that stuff. And that's kind of a problem. Well, kind of a problem. We'll figure it out though, I think. I mean, it's just the, I mean, I think we've, the nervous system has formed. We've got the framework, I think, for the dispersal of the next Daoist iteration, or the next Buddhist teaching, or the next Christianity, or the next whatever. Like we have this, it's like all of the systems are go. And right now they're just being filled with confusion, because we're all a little naturally, especially the last couple of years, confused. So we're just seeing this confused static. But that, that what exciting thing is, the thing is set to, to like, for, for something to come along, or a group of people, or God knows what, to like. I know what it is. What? Duncan Trussells, my trainer, savior of the world. He has awakened. He has arrived. Don't much, don't much frame me. Hell no. Hell no. I'll tell you this man. Hell no. I don't care if like a thousand robed beings appeared in front of me in the forest and said, you're going to convey some hell no. I'm not falling for that shit. You know, that's a big, like any of that, any of the avatars that come to earth, you got to be a little suspicious, because they were the ones who were like, I'll do it. When you know there was like, whatever the Christ energy was that descended here, you know, there was like thousands of other beings. They're like, no, you know, I can't that. I can't do that Jesus thing. I'm busy that you take one for the team. In fact, by the way, that I didn't say me. I said, you do it. Duncan clearly is the guy to go for. Sadly, even if they're even if they're even if like, though I do know you're joking, obviously, even if there were some possible, like I would never do. I like that. Fuck that. It's all about decentralization. Now, like I would, I'll tell you this. If I could be like a hair follicle on the head of a Messiah, I might take that job or just like an eyelash or something, you know, a belly button. That's probably asking too much. I wouldn't mind being like some, some, some D a bit of DNA in the thing itself, but God fuck being the whole thing. We got to get past this centralization problem. It's the problem. It's like once we get, once we communally integrate to form a Voltron style Messiah, that's where you, that's where I would be interested. And I think that's where it's tricky because ultimately the way also human beings are wired is that we are, I mean, it's the equivalent of like, think of like some brilliant meditate or trying to teach a bunch of monkeys to meditate. You know, you have to take this monkey who's like taking flee of his thing. The other one who's going fuck up with the other and you're like doing all this work and suddenly you get them all and you're getting all calm and it's like we're getting there. And one just flicks the thing on the other side and the other one goes like fuck you and I have to kill you. Now all the monkeys are screaming and going at it and you're like, fuck not this again. And it's like, it's because we respond to fear and outrage so much faster than we respond to kind of like some of the things that help us make life better so that it takes nothing. It takes any idiot with a megaphone can go like outrage, fear, look at that. And everybody's going to lose their mind on this. Whereas the work of creating something beautiful is so much more delicate and so much more subtle and stuff that is like, you know, it's the old adage, right? It's so much easier to destroy than to create. And I think that supplies at the psychological level where it's so much easier to get hungry and yell at somebody on Facebook or either than just really sit down and create something beautiful. I just deleted an angry tweet. I mean, I tried not to send it and I looked at it, but don't send that. That's just more shitty energy in the world. Why are you going to do that? And then I'm like, I'm going to do it. Do it. Fire the fucking missile in vain, France. Yes. We've got it, you know, because it's like it's just easier to do that than to like you don't see any megaphone people going around being like, patience. We should all be more patient. Yeah, I should really put like, based on your insight, we should all put like little little picture next to the computer so that as you're about to hit that tweet, you're like, that's the Hitler energy. That's the Hitler tweets. Don't do it. Of course, that may be slightly embarrassing when people can visit you when you have like little little pictures next to your computer. Maybe slightly misunderstood. You try to explain. No, it's because I don't want to tweet. Hey, thank you, Danielli. As always, a joy to talk with you folks. Don't tweet like Hitler. Yes. I'm sorry if I've tweeted angry shit. Don't tweet like Hitler. Thank you so much. I really appreciate your time, man. A perfect place to end. Tell people about your podcast though, before we go. Yes. So I host a couple of podcasts. There's Drunken Towers. That's a chatty, philosophical, somewhat kind of podcast. It's free everywhere. And then there's History on Fire. There's a bunch of free episodes of History on Fire. There's about 50 of them. So there's a long way in the archives to go. And then the newer ones are behind the paywall, but it's like three maximums or something. But even if you don't get to that, there's a long list of free episodes to go through beforehand. So that's the gig. Thank you, sir. Check them out, folks. You already know them though. God bless you. And hopefully I'll see you in person eventually. But I think it's going to be a little while. But thank you very much. Howdy, Krista. Thanks for being on the show. A big thank you to Danielli Volelli for appearing yet again on the DTFH.

Things around here feeling pretty weird. The truth is, I'd like to retire in a place with more seasons than fire. Time to say goodbye to the city of angels. A place that made my dreams come true. But I imagine there are people in Pompeii who moved away. And there is some stage. I love Pompeii. Time to say goodbye to the city of angels. I'll think of you all across the lake of ice. Maybe one day I'll climb back down. But for now, I'm headed to paradise. That's right, loves. You heard it here first. Headed out of the big city. I'm one of the many who are pouring out of Los Angeles. My apologies to my dear country friends. But we're coming! Woo! And we're voting blue. So get ready, the DTFH is going on the road with my gypsy family. We're traveling. We're diving into the abyss, heading into the unknown. By that I mean we're taking a flight out of Los Angeles. You know, every once in a while it's good to take a look at where you're at. And ask yourself, why am I here? Sometimes there's good reason to be here to place. You're just out of place because you're out of place. Maybe you've built up in your mind that it will be really complex to move or you just don't want to go through the trouble of it all. But that's not a reason to stay in a place just because it's annoying to leave, especially if you're getting the vibe that maybe it's time to go. There's great reasons to stay in a place. Family for example, you're being held hostage, you can't leave. But sometimes it's like, it's just exciting. It's exhilarating, especially these days, like if there really is, and I hate to use a too often used term regarding the pandemic, if there's a silver lining to this thing. Isn't it that it's showing us that many, many, many jobs don't have to be localized in any given place? And doesn't it kind of seem like there's something in that that's almost revolutionary? It's so much of the economy is based on people being tethered to an office building. So much of the economy is based on people having this antiquated idea of how work is done. When a lot of jobs just require people's minds, Google is not opening up till next summer. Talent agencies in LA, not opening up right now. So many places that really didn't need to be there in person or functioning right now. Just as well, or maybe a little, like it's a little more, things are a little confused, but still it's working. Of course, that's the whole point. We have all this technology, but instead of adapting, because humans don't seem to be good at quick adaptation when it comes to tradition. We became superstitious regarding offices. We started to think you've got to be in an office, even though what we were doing was with our minds. We don't need file cabinets anymore. It's in our computers. It's in the fucking cloud. It's going to be really weird if, when this pandemic ends, people just like go back to their jobs. Like if people aren't like, wait a minute, we don't need to be here anymore. I don't need to do that commute anymore. I don't need to drive two hours into a place because I couldn't afford to live close to the place because so many people didn't want to drive two hours to their place. That's going to be weird if the bosses are like, no, you got to come back here. We're going back to the old ways. I hope that doesn't happen. Regardless, I'm taking advantage of the freedom of my business here, my podcast. I could do this from anywhere and I'm taking flight and we'll see what happens. DTFH is going on the road. We have got a fantastic podcast for you, friends. We're going to jump right into it, but first, this. Throw some bedding on a bunch of different mattresses and sure, they all look alike. The same goes for pillows, but peel away the layers and look at what's inside and you'll see they aren't all created equal and your family will be like, what the fuck are you doing to our mattress? Why do you peel it away? And you'll say, because I have to know why my purple mattress or pillow is so incredible. And they'll say to you, you didn't need to rip it open. It's the purple grid that sets the purple mattress apart from every other mattress. It's a patented comfort technology that instantly adapts to your body's natural shape and sleep style with over 1800 open air channels designed to neutralize body heat. Purple provides a cooling effect. Other mattresses can't replicate and you'll say, how do you know all this? Did you memorize what a purple mattress is made of? And they'll be like, why wouldn't I? There's not much to do right now. I'm memorizing mattress facts and this cutting edge technology doesn't stop with a mattress. Every purple pillow is engineered with a grid for total head and neck support and absolute airflow. So you're always on the cool side of the pillow and you'll say, but what about poetry? You could have memorized Xanadu by Samuel Taylor Coleridge or some, some Yates or T.S. Let's say, whoa, really? Have you ever memorized that? Does that affect your life? No, but a purple mattress does. And then your baby who has never said a word because she's only six months old will say, purple's proprietary technology has been innovating comfort for over 15 years. And then you'll wake up on your purple mattress and realize you just had a crazy dream. And then you'll look up and you'll realize your family is there. You didn't have a dream. You just passed out because you couldn't deal with the fact that your baby was talking. And the first thing they said was mattress facts, friends, I have a purple pillow and it really is incredible. I like you. I'm always skeptical when I hear about some space age, whatever. When I saw the purple mattress commercials, I was skeptical, but it really is incredible. It reminds me of like levitating. It's like, it doesn't make sense. I don't understand how it works and to be honest, I just read that and I still don't really understand. I don't really care. I don't know how my computer works either. It just works. And the purple pillow that I have is incredible. You can try every purple product risk-free with free shipping and returns.

But I think getting to be friends with Marcus Henderson and Brandon Sanders has got to be the best thing. They just reached out to me on Instagram. We started talking and we decided that we were going to create like a weekly pandemic philosophy gathering where we just essentially, you know, add some drinks and talked about philosophy, talked about race issues. I learned so much from being friends with them. And I realized, why haven't we done a DTFH podcast? I guess that's more of a question than a realization. But anyway, that's what this is. I want y'all to meet two of my newest friends. Both of them are brilliant actors. They're also brilliant minds and super sweet people. Everybody, please welcome to the Dunkitrustle Family Hour podcast, Marcus Henderson and Brandon Sanders, also known as the Pandemic Philosophy Thoughts Club. Thank you so much for being on my podcast. I really appreciate it, man. It is the highest honor. Thank you, man. Brandon, thank you so much, man, for being on the show. I really appreciate it, man. I've been, this is, this is going to be real. Why do I smell burning here? This is going to be great. I mean, it's going to be no different than what we always do. But thank you for letting me put it under the DTFH moniker temp, you know, for this, this one, you know? And when you start your podcast, if you want to, we could do the same. You know, there's no reason we can't do rints and repeat. You know, appreciate that, man. Yeah. And if you need, if you need any kind of, not the, not that like podcasting is that complex a thing, but if you need any help figuring out how to do it, man, please. Oh, man, use his tech support because thank you so much. Yeah, yeah, man, this is starting to become, I mean, like, it's, it's interesting, like what yes morphs into, you know, when you, when you say no to something, it just dies. It's dead. Yeah, it happens. You said no, that's it. Yeah. When you say yes to something, fuck dude, like when we talk about infinity, you know, one of the best things about Friday is that it feels like it's my day of release or some sort of like therapy in which I am allowed to listen to people that I really want to listen to, share my opinions with people that I really respect and, and, and care for their feedback. It's, it's something that just really, it does something. It sets up my whole weekend and I definitely felt the difference. And when we didn't do it, yeah, to when we actually do. Yeah, yeah, in that, I am very grateful to the two of you for saying yes. Oh, man, to just the possibility in that's, that's dope. Well, do likewise, likewise. This is like, yeah, this is like, I was, uh, you know, we're, today recording the intro for you all and saying that this is, uh, of all the things that've come out of the Midnight Gospel. This is my favorite thing. Hmm. Wow. Man, dude. I'm still, I'm still talking about the show as if I just discovered it last week, you know, like, you know, like we'll be talking and then all of a sudden they're like talking about everything they're watching and I'm watching some of those shows too. But then I'm like, but what about Midnight Gospel? Right. Right. I got a list of people that I haven't talked to about it yet that is still, you know, we still got to have these like deep two in the morning talks about this show, you know, and not just this man to think like it, this emerged simul, this, there was this synchronicity to happen here, which is like, we started to become friends while this country went through this intense, intense moment of coming to terms with racism in the country. And so it was, you know, it's been like really, really enlightening to listen to your perspectives on what's going down here. Like it's, it's, it's been something that I think has improved me as a person. And also you all have both been really compassionate with me and also really open to me being completely honest. Like I have not felt for a second, like I got a sense for myself or, you know what I mean, that has been such a like, for me, that's been huge in like helping me really get a, get an angle on what's, what's going on here, you know, which, which before we met, I, I would, you know, I think a lot of it, I was just like, what the fuck is happening? And I still am like that, you know, but at least I feel a little more educated on the situation. So thanks for that. Yeah, man. Sure. No, let me ask you this. Where, where did the idea of the midnight gospel come from in terms of like what? I mean, I know, I know, thankfully I've been reading through the Frank book. Oh yeah. Freaking amazing dude. Like it's so much inspiration alone in it. Yeah. But like what? How, how does that, how does a conversation start? Of the creation of midnight gospel? Well, yeah, that, so that happened because Pendleton Ward had an idea about like a way to frame podcasts to put, to make them into a, you know, entertaining show, which was to, what happens if you take the dialogue of Indiana Jones and replace it with podcast dialogue? So you've got this adventure happening, but people having like the conversation that we've been having every Friday and that's comedic. You know, it's, it's ridiculous that, but then also here we are having these, this conversation, this ongoing dialogue and think about it, man. Like we're having this dialogue during what I don't want to call it. It's not, it is an apocalypse in the sense that it's a lifting of the veil. Like everybody's starting to see what's happening in a way that many people either were pretending, that's not what was going on in this country or were generally ignoring, I think, because it's convenient because if you can ignore it, if you can ignore it, or if you can rationalize it, you know, like for example, uh, the, that, you know, of course they leaked the body cam footage of George Floyd, right? And all these people all of a sudden are expressing that because he didn't, he didn't obey the cops because he was freaked the fuck out. He deserved to die. Like he deserved to be publicly executed is what they're saying. You know, like, look, don't you see the body cam footage? Don't you get it? And it's like, yeah, so what? I don't care what he fucking did. Like I don't care if he like incinerated a Bible or like whatever the fuck he did. Not that that's that bad actually, but you know what I'm saying? My point is like, how does a person who is not like obeying the police deserve to be publicly executed, suffocated and there's no, you can't, but they want to make the math work. And I, you know, you know, and I can understand just from a human desire for shit to be easy, you know what I mean? Like that thing where you're laying in bed and you're pretty sure like the other day I was laying in bed and it sounded like maybe a window broke in the house. You know what I mean? And you got like a few seconds. Like, you know what it's probably like, uh, I don't know, uh, not a window breaking. And you kind of try to trick yourself into anything than having to deal with like confronting some weirdo in your house. Yeah, anything. That's a human. That's natural, you know? And so people are desperate for that, you know? So, so yeah, man, it's like during all this insanity, we've been having philosophical conversations, you know, and it hasn't all been about race. It hasn't been all about George Floyd. Hasn't been all about what black lives matter has, but a lot of it has, but it hasn't all been that it's been fun, just conversation and stuff. So I think that was the other thing is something poignant about, you know, like, man, if like right now, if, if like, let's say a particle accelerator fucked up and created a mini black hole and we knew it, the earth was gradually being sucked into a black hole and we knew it's going to reach LA in like 30, 45 minutes, six hours, whatever. I mean, we'd be with our wives, probably in our families, but if, you know, if we didn't have that, I think we'd probably be still kind of like, well, it's nice knowing you. Like, look at the Titanic. They played violins. You know what I mean? Is the fucking thing is going down. Cause what are you going to do? Screen, right? So to me, that was the, that's what, that was the other thing that came out of it was the kind of poignant thing of like, yeah, when people are dying, it's not like they just sit there saying, I'm dying. I'm dying. They're going to talk about sports. Right. But, but, but part of that is, uh, is healing, you know, and I think that's part of the remedy to the thing that we're experiencing in the world right now is all of this chaos. Cause, uh, symbolically it's a representation of, uh, of, uh, our human consciousness or our community, how we interact with each other, but more so how we interact with ourselves and we seem to be at war, you know, with ourselves. So, you know, we get to see, we've been seeing lately how that trauma is being acted out, like all of their decision making and all of their, uh, their points of views come from these lower ways of thinking, like making excuses for, for, you know, some outlandish things. It's just like that person who just refuses to see the truth that, that, that narcissists, um, but a person who, who's like that usually is because they're so fucked up on the inside, man, they don't know how to love. And so what we're doing right now is being a reflection of what that looks like when what you think is imbalanced or misunderstood between others. Um, if you come together and talk or share thoughts or laugh together or just see each other's point of view, maybe you'll feel a whole lot better. Yeah. Maybe you won't, maybe you won't feel threatened to pull your gun out so fast because you'll see there's nothing to be afraid of. Right. So yeah, I was just having this talk, uh, with the buddy of mine about, we were talking about the, this sort of, uh, standard that is held as a, uh, as a, as a culture as, you know, the black culture has a, uh, a standard of like, we need to be on one page, one accord. And if there is a disagreement, then therefore it's just the general sweeping statement that, no, that's our problem. We can't get along. We can't agree on nothing. And then it caused even more dissension. But the idea of getting on the same page doesn't necessarily mean that you have to share the same ideas. It's just that you have to know where the other person is coming from. Right. It's not, it's not about this. We gotta all move in the same direction. It's just that if you're going to move that way, I need to understand why. So that when I move this way, we can, we can meet where we need to meet. Right. Well, we won't bump heads and we won't have to bump heads in, in this way. Because a lot of it, a lot of it, in my opinion, has come from wanting something from somebody else. And it's two people fighting for the crumbs. It's two groups fighting for crumbs. So it's never really the, it's never the meat. And I know, you know, meat is murder. So don't hurt me on that. Well, fruit has meat. Yeah. I guess that's murder too. That's beautiful, man. I, to me, that, what you're saying makes me think of, uh, something this, uh, he's like, he sings like Kirtan. He's, his name is Krishnadas. And one of the things he said, I heard him say was, you can trust people to be who they are. And you know what I mean? You might be able to trust them to do what they say they're going to do, but you can trust them to be themselves as they are. And part of who they are might be that they're deceptive. But, you know, when you like realize that about people, you, you, you, you start understanding like, okay, what, this is something I like to do with people, uh, who are like, annoying me is like, try to not react at whatever they're doing that is annoying me and just think, what do they want? Like, what's the thing behind the thing? Like, you know, cause people will manipulate. And so, you know, they won't, they're afraid to tell you what they want. A lot of times what they want is for you to like them, but they feel so vulnerable with that they'll try to trick you or manipulate you or like put on a show. And there's some act like something they're not when underneath it all, it's like, they just really think you're cool and they want you to like them, but they feel vulnerable, you know, but once you realize that you see through their like magic act and then somewhere in there, you find some compassion and it's kind of sweet, you know, cause you realize like, oh, you're just doing this like, you don't have to do them that magic act to get me to like love you. You know, I, I love you, I love you. But like, I love you when you're not doing like card tricks or whatever. Do you know what I'm saying? So like, no, like to me, somewhere in that is there, you, we can find a place to connect cause like, man, I'm sorry. I'm going to go on a little rant here. I'm sorry. I found, I've found this new thing on YouTube, a YouTube methodology where I go to, I look up a weird, like I come up with a weird video, I have an idea, conspiracy theory, whatever. And then I find videos, people have made. And then I look at their subs, what they are subscribed to. And I click on that. And then I look at the stuff those people are subscribed to. And I click on that and you go down this rabbit hole, right? And then suddenly you end up, I found this play today. It landed on a YouTube page. I think it was like a grandmother cause she's like showing a video of her unpacking a bike and then there's this sweet wedding, right? This beautiful wedding video. And like, you know, videos of the beach and you, you know, you, and like it's some kind of religious prayer that she had transcribed and put to music. Very sweet. Then you get to the like newest videos. They're fucking QAnon shit, right? With like pictures of Trump and a thick Russian voice saying, he is brought to you by God. It's like, oh my God. Holy shit. In another one about, you know, talking about goddess worship being something that whores and Satanists do. And it's like, you realize like, okay, that's one thread of this person's consciousness. But also there's all these other threads. There's a person who's like having trouble assembling a bike. There's a person who loves where she lives and loves her kids. And yet somewhere running through that is somebody who thinks boobs are from the devil, you know what I mean? But that's not all they are. And that's what I'm saying. It's like, you can just find, if I think, maybe you tell me all, is this naive? If we can find that part and connect to that and kind of like maybe not focus on telling this person like, what are you going to burn a fucking witch? You old crazy motherfucker. Do you know what I mean? Like if you focus on that, then is it, is there hope? Is that the way we have to do it? Well, so that, that what you're saying sounds great coming from someone who is open and aware and available to do that, but to the person who is still closed off with that wall or who is still, you know, asleep consciously. What happens when when they just not ready to do that yet? You know, I think that's part of what we're dealing with. How do you deal with someone who's who's not ready to face themselves yet? Is it more of pushing them towards seeing it? Is it more protecting yourself? Or is it more continuing to love yourself, love yourself and love them while you protect yourself from whatever their sickness is at the same time? You know what I mean? Right. Because, because I hear what you're saying. I think that's, you know, that's part of the answer. But man, have you ever dealt with somebody who just doesn't? They just don't want to see it. You know what I mean? Like you can say the most nicest thing, the nicest way. But like, like Trump, for example, it doesn't matter what he does wrong. He is not going to, not one time in four years. As he said, you know what? I was wrong at that time, guys, my bad. It's always, it's always something, you know. So what is that? What does that transparency come from? You think? Man, I don't know. I mean, like, I know what you mean. Cause I'm like, yeah, this is somebody's YouTube page. I'm weirdly like being a voyeur. What am I doing? I'm looking at someone's like crazy witch burning grandmothers, like lowly populated YouTube page. I'm the weirdo here, I guess. But like, you know, but, but still, you're right. I'm not hanging out with this person. I'm not walking down the street with him. You know, I don't, I don't know, but it's just like you get this feeling of like, look, you didn't mean to get brainwashed. You got brainwashed. You didn't mean to. You, you, someone got into your fucking head. You know, you talk to these people, man, they parrot Trump. You know what I'm saying? Like you talk to these people, it's like, I don't give a fuck what your pop. I really don't care if you're a Republican. I don't care if you're a Democrat, Libertarian, and I would like it. If you're an anarchist, I think that's cool. But you know what I'm saying? Like whatever you are politically, it's like, you know, that's where you're at. But it's weird when you're talking to somebody and they start saying like, no collusion, no collusion, Russian hoax. And you're like, wait, what are you? You're just parrot. If you do, are you saying Trump tweets? You know what I mean? Like, I didn't, I've never did that with any president. I liked, you know what I mean? I never like, right. That's where it gets a little weird. Okay. Okay. You got condit, you, you, I'm afraid may have been. A victim of like a really powerful, well-funded PSYops campaign. But that's so many different ones though, man. And isn't what's, isn't that what some of these mythology stories talk about with this, with this demiurge to like create these ideas to keep you in this, this matrix for you to like perpetuate some type of system or idea. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Friends, that's Brent. Look, I'm, you know, my audience hasn't met y'all yet. This is somebody you within like a few minutes of us meeting pulled out a beautiful Baphomet statue. I'm sorry. I didn't introduce y'all. That's the problem. Like you don't understand. You're dealing with me. Both of you, I've like in various times throughout our wonderful dialogue, I thought, okay, this is the Illuminati. They're clearly in some kind of secret, some kind of something. Cause you, that's intense, man. Can you talk a little more about that? The demiurge concept and this, this, this idea of people maybe accidentally or semi-accidentally becoming servants of some kind of like, like true darkness. Yeah. So, um, let's, let's, let's take a, let's, let's take a trip real quick then. So the demiurge is basically, um, and on a surface tip that, that creator God, so, but not in the sense of the divine source that we're talking about that, you know, is holding up this existence. So whatever we are, you know, at the moment, um, but that, but that creator God that wants to create this cycle, it's that cycle of time or is that, um, that repetition of life and death to where you're put into this system to, to basically be, um, food, that, that this bigger energy source is feeding off of and you continuously giving it your energy because you're giving it your emotions because you care, you know what I mean? So it's almost in the sense like that, uh, and in a sense where human connections, if, if, if I have some type of unresolved trauma or if I have some type of aspiration, you know, that desire to want to do something and keep this human existence going, even though, uh, it's been told that this human existence is the ego. So why do we want to keep the illusion going? You know what I mean? So the Demiurge will be basically the father of the illusion and the children are the, uh, are the ones that's creating that world to fund it, run it, you know, keep it going because they think that they're, uh, getting somewhere, but they're just feeding this Demiurge that wants to, uh, that wants to exist, I guess. Children of the illusion. That was a good little phrase. And you got to understand when streams of consciousness like that happen, that's not just Brandon speaking. That's like, uh, that's what Brandon is connected to. Uh, that's, and that's, I think that's also what the Demiurge does. It, it, it speaks through, uh, unit, you know. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. The Demiurge is, uh, uh, ego and, uh, guardians of the galaxy. The second one. Wait, okay. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Right. Remember, he has a son who has this, the energy of his mother who, uh, or his father who is this God, but then, but he wanted to live and he wanted to learn more. He wanted to keep doing things. So he just kept creating, but every time that he would create, he would kill all of his kids because all he, he just wanted to use them for energy to find that thing because he's searching for, um, for that peace or that love. And he thought he was going to find it in his wife, but, uh, in this story, uh, he didn't find it. So that's why he killed it. And that's part of that, that mythological story that we're still dealing with now where, you know, um, a lot of the ancient stories talk about, uh, eons and ages. And we live in this, this, this ram of duality. So there's masculine and then there's feminine. And we have, uh, we, we live, you know, everything is vibration and sound and waves, so waves go up and down. So we go up in consciousness and we go down in consciousness. We go up in masculine energy. We go down in masculine energy, the same with feminine as well. And you can see that with civilization. So you see over like a thousand year period, you see where women are ruling the world. You see the temple of had, had, had Chep suit, uh, in Egypt. You see, uh, temples of all these goddesses, uh, Tiamat, um, places in India, uh, where, uh, Kali, the goddess taught Kali, Tara. Yeah. And they're powerful. They're not like little servant women, you know what I mean? They're called, they are chaos beings. Meaning they're like, they have the power to destroy everything. What did you call them chaos? What? Chaos beings. Wow. Cool. Yeah. That's what, that's what we are. Uh, that's what I like to think. So, so then you see later on in time, um, as consciousness starts to change, you see a shifts change and now you see men coming to power. So like over the past 2000 years, this masculine energy has been running this planet, but it hasn't been running it in a healthy union with that feminine. It's been dominant. You know what I mean? Right. And if you're hyperactive or underactive, you're in balance. You know what I mean? So since, since that masculine energy has been suppressing that feminine, uh, what it does when we talk about that alchemy and that magic, right? It's, it's, you know, when you put coal on the ground for a long time and keep putting pressure on it, you're creating a diamond. So we're, even though that suppression happened at the same time was creating this new manifestation that's coming. And that's what we're starting to see now with consciousness starting to shift in this, this mother energy or this feminine energy or this feminine aspect to starting to rise. And we see that with, you know, women's skin, women getting more rights. We see that with, uh, more people doing therapy because that feminine is the internal self, right? So more people are going in within and having more of a union within and more people are starting to like harmonize with each other. So, uh, that, that's that story of that, you know, masculine, that, uh, feminine. But, but doesn't it, what do you, what do you, what do you think about this though? I didn't mean to cut you off. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Taylor, go ahead. Go ahead. You were, um, okay. But Brandon Marcus, isn't there going to be blowback? You can't power. I don't remember. I said, I heard some politician. I think it's you. I can't remember her name. Damn it. Nancy Pelosi, I think said something on the lines of nobody gives power away. It has to be taken. And it was scary to hear say that was so hardcore too. You didn't expect it to come. I'm pretty sure it's Nancy Pelosi, but it's like some kind of like samurai shit. It was really like, it was like, fuck, I think you're right. But I don't want you to be right. What do y'all think about that? Marcus, what do you think about that? I mean, it's not like the male dominator culture as McKinnon says it calls it. It's not like, you're just going to be like, oh, okay. Oh, you want to do the goddess thing? Oh, okay. You want to do more therapy? Oh, okay. No problem. Let's do therapy. You know what? I'm going to just, I'm going to deactivate all my dick shaped nuclear missiles because y'all want to do more therapy because consciousness is coming back. That's not going to happen, right? Yeah, because I don't think the therapy is what is going to change the thing. You know, I think that there is a sort of natural, I guess, evolution of things that are happening, you know, there has got to be an ebb and flow in life. There's got to be these moments or centuries where there is a good and a bad whatever that balance is, it's got to be in balance in order to get to balance. Like imbalance wouldn't, balance wouldn't exist without imbalance. You know, so it's just this duality that I think, except I think what the therapy does is it helps you maintain in a state of imbalance so that you can feel balanced. Oh, wow. That's cool. Hmm. Yeah. I don't think it's I don't think I don't think it's necessarily a thing where it's like it's supposed to change anything out there. It's inner work that you do. It's the inner work that you have to do in order to make the ultimate change. You know, so if I do inner work, then I'm raising my kids differently. I'm raising my son differently so that that, you know, that, you know, macho behavior isn't the same as it was when I was a kid, his age. Oh, OK. I'm following you now. You're so like you're saying like, well, are you saying like we don't have to worry so much about resting power away from lunatic dudes who are running shit? If we the work starts inside, like, yeah, yeah, yeah. And so, like, like right now, if you have a kid in kindergarten, your kid, if you're raising him to be the person to not be the guy with the missiles, you rest assured he's in school right now with the kid that's going to be the guy who has the missiles. Oh, yeah. How they interact with one another is is where it all starts. Whoa. If you if you are raising the kid to be the the guy who's going to like have the missiles to do the thing. Yeah, he won't even give it a chance. He won't even give other out. That's a no to everything. You remember we talking earlier about saying yes. Yes. Yes, has possibilities. Yes, has has an infinite amount of quality. No, has one result. Wow, that's bad. So, so, so for me, it's not about like, I think, yeah, yeah, you can take. It's all about force. That's what you want with a no. You want to fight. You want somebody to change your mind. You want to talk to the limit. But yes, you're like, take me there. Where are we going? What's happening here? I can make my own decisions and live in it. You know, yeah, but but that's what that's that's that's what we're teaching our kids, though. Right, because yeah, go ahead, because that's the thing, like, you don't. Because the question is going to come up. What is this power that you're talking about? You have because you're a whole infrastructure is based on me paying attention to it because it's all about product. It's all about marketing. It's all about advertising. So whatever you selling, once I learn that you not for me, I ain't buying no more. So you don't have to when you're like, let's say in a relationship, right? The argument is when you try to fight to get your point across or try to take right in that situation with force and you don't have to. Because the more that they get agitated, the less and the less that you stay calm, the more and the less energy you give into the negativity that they're giving you and you channel that into something else, then you're changing the whole narrative because there's nothing to fight against anymore. So we're so now you're breaking down the illusion. So because it because what you will find out is actually. If we're talking about power, you actually have to take it from me. Because that's what that's who you have the most affection for. You know what I mean? And the biggest currency on the planet is attention. But if you're building that market, but somebody is owning the market and you're just again, that force fee energy, you're not making the money off your own. Probably just like chickens don't get no deposit or no bank account info from Chick-fil-A. You know what I mean? Right. Cows don't get any type of reparations from McDonald's. Yes, you're making all this money off of your energy and somebody else is building something off of the moment you find out that, oh, wait, you can't even have this unless you had me. So unless you're able to have me in the way that I want to be, then you're out of pocket. And then once a person realizes that, oh man, you could be gone. They start to change there. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like, oh, wait, let me start to actually listen to what you're saying because a narcissist would try to make you feel bad for standing on your own ground. You know what I mean? And then convince and then they'll somehow convince you that you did something wrong and that you need to stay around. Right. You know, even though they were the ones that were feeling the insecurity. So once you allow that person to have to sit with their own stuff and they see that, oh, man, you have no attachment to it, then I'm in the hope it forces you to deal with it. But, you know, I think that is something about that, that the word value comes up. The self value, having to know your own worth. Isn't that such a crazy fucking thing to have to negotiate your worth in a contract? Yeah, in a way where you're like, this is how much I'm worth. There's an app. I'm not going to say the name of that, but there's an app where a celebrity sign up and they they give you a shout out. If you, you know, if you pay a certain amount of money. Cameo. There you. Okay. Why you didn't want to name it because you're afraid of the like. I didn't know. I don't, I don't know about. I didn't know if, you know, there's promotion things with podcasts and stuff. Oh, hell no. You can talk about. Look, let's talk about. Listen, cameo is got no offense. Oh, listen, I don't want to be judgmental because people need money. I get exactly, exactly, exactly. Don't want to be judgmental about it. Don't want to like, you know, but it's an interesting concept to think about. How much am I worth to people? I mean, some people don't go that deep in the terms of like, how much am I? But sometimes it's just like, all right, I'll do this for you for like 20 bucks, whatever. But then there are some people who are like, it's going to cost you $750 to get a shout out from me. And you go, what? What? Yeah, I know what you mean. Like it's it that whole, like that whole thing that this is like, you know, this is capitalism, right? And to me, like, you know, and I, and I, we're, we're in capitalism. I'm not saying I'm not, this is what capitalism has been good to me. I'm not like, you know what I mean? I'm not, but if you really like take capitalism and, and bring it into the family, it will help you understand how fucked up it is. And it's like, cause like I was, you know, like imagine if, you know, you're, you're, your kids, your, your mother-in-law comes to visit. And when she leaves after hanging out with a baby, spoiling the baby, tickling the baby, feeding the baby, loving the baby, the way grandmothers can. She's like, all right, you guys going to Venmo me for this? You know, I charge $600 a day for my services. You know what I mean? You're like, what the fuck? Or like, you know what I mean? Like friends, if friends, like if you were like, had a friendship tax, you're like, okay, you know, I've been like, we did six phone calls this month. So that's 600 bucks, but I'm going to give you a discount. Cause he used my discount code. You'd be like, what the fuck? But then, you know, but in all, like anything like that is like the most insane fucked up thing, but are everything else in our society, it's considered totally normal. It's totally normal to sit down with a therapist and be like, here's, thank you for listening to me. Here's however much spending on the therapist, 200, 300 bucks. Totally normal to be like, to come into a hospital and have somebody sew you up and then be like, all right, I guess that's worth $50,000. Here you go. You know what I mean? Like all that. We just accept it because we were born into it. And that seems to go into your demiurge idea, man. That's like, you know what I mean? That's just, it's like, I mean, cause think of it. Okay. Prostitution, right? No, no, no. Evil, evil, evil. Don't pay someone to have sex with you. Evil, right? It's evil to pay someone to fuck you, but it's not evil to pay someone to give you a massage. It's, you know what I mean? It's evil to pay someone to give you a blow job. It's not evil to pay someone to reach their fucking hand in your goddamn like abdomen, like my doctor did and pull out my testicle and snip that cancerous fucking thing off and drop it in a toilet. That's not evil. In fact, that's like, actually, you're like, people want to marry doctors. You know what I mean? But like, you know what I'm saying? So it's like, yeah, man, it's weird. It's weird that it's very weird to like have to be put in a position to be like, well, I'm worth this much per hour to talk to you. Did you accidentally get to agree? You don't mean, again, this is the system we're in. We're born into it. What? I'm not fucking Karl Marx. I don't even understand communism. It seems a little too complex. I've tried to read it before I get instantly confused, then bored, then scared, then feel bad and then stop reading it. But like, to me, there does seem to be a degrading quality to like, you know what I mean? Like, like to paying somebody to like, you know, to pay somebody to do a thing, especially a thing that has love inside of it. You know what I mean? It just feels. I feel like it should go off of that. You know, I feel like it should go off of, well, we're not there yet. But what if we got to a state of consciousness where everything was based off of your energy? So the, the more productive or positive or, uh, lucrative energy, you're giving somebody to help them with whatever it is they're doing, whether that be to save their life from a depression of a day or to help them with a new idea to make an invention, uh, it should then be on them as an accountability, like, you know, okay, Brandon just sold the seeding to me. And I felt, man, I felt so much empathy. I felt like, you know, and it's all measured on like a little scale. And based on that scale, then you're able to go, okay, based on everything I just received on my scale, this is what I'm going to give back to you. Whether that be usually, I guess it would be, you know, money, but maybe it could be something else. But what if we came to, and not like, uh, a community, I guess, to where we could, you know, do that versus just trying to like add it up when you, because then it feels like it's not genuine. It's almost like bringing love into that marriage thing. Like, damn, part of this doesn't feel like genuine love at all because it's just, it's business stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right. The marriage contract, right? And it's like a, I'll give you an example, like, you know, acting, right? I'm an actor. I love acting. I look like it's an art form that has caught the attention of my expression. And that's what I use it for. Right. So I, that's what I do. And I went through years and years of training to, to, to get to where I am right now, uh, and I still got high aspirations from here. So anybody who's like, Hey, I want to be an actor. Can you give me some pointers? Never in my life could I think, well, what can I get from this? It just doesn't compute to me. Even like I did, um, last summer, you know, uh, there's a group out in LA, uh, called actors play LA where, you know, it's a sort of a minority based, uh, uh, group to, uh, that caters to a minority, uh, base, you know, like they, they have a, it's like a theater group that plays games, teaches improv, like, you know, just kind of trains. It's a training ground. That's what I say, a training ground for minorities in LA that can go and feel safe and do all this stuff. Uh, I heard about it and immediately it was so attracted to him. And I asked the, uh, the creator, I was like, oh man, can I like do something like teach us something like that? Like a, a class to do a workshop and she was like, absolutely. You know, I was like, yeah, great. And then it got to a point where we had to talk about like, well, how much are, do you charge? Like what's your old cost? And I can never answer that. I can never go like, well, this is how much it costs. I know how much it costs me to get my education and do things I do, but those types of things are just like, it's just a talent that I think you can give to somebody. If I have the ability to give you expression through an art form that I found such a love for, I don't want to charge you for that. You finding your own voice is my benefit. Yeah. That's, that's one thing in the, in the church that, uh, that's a system that that's, that operates, um, where like, if the preacher is really giving a good message while he's preaching, he's not asking people to give him money, but people will just walk up and they'll drop $5 at the altar or drop a hundred or whatever they feel in their heart, based off of what they just felt off of what was just given. And so that's, that goes along with what you're saying. Mark is like, yeah. And I, and that's what I was saying. Like, don't not, it feels like he said, it feels awkward when you have to like say, this is worth this much because you don't know how much it's worth to, to, to them. You know, um, so just giving out of your heart, that's, that's an exchange right there, but then on that person, okay, you just received something. Are you going to acknowledge what you just received? And if so, what are you going to give back? Because that's what life is. It's an exchange. It's, it's give and take to live. You have to breathe in and breathe out. Right. So there's always a give and go. You know what I mean? So yeah, absolutely. I think at the very least, if you're going to, which I do care, I have a Patreon, I'm going to put an advertisement, probably somewhere in the midst of this socialist conversation, just to really put some sulfur on this fucking thing. Hey, let's cut to commercial. Yeah. Is there something interfering with your happiness or preventing you from achieving your goals? You know, a long time ago, I was so depressed, I thought about pissing my bed because I couldn't get out of bed.

But what I'm saying is, I think one thing, I do think it's possible to do capitalism. And I think it is possible to have aspirations for a time where we figure out a way, I think what you were talking about, Brandon, is to figure out a way to be like a little more nuanced in our approximation of how energy moves among us. You know, that's all. We've got a really brutish, it's like language too. But like, you know, one piece for you, two pieces for you, three piece for you. It's not very nuanced. It's weird. And it's all based on time and stuff. But you know, I think at the very least, what you could do is give people way more than what they're paying for, way more. You know what I mean? Like you could like do that. That is possible. You know, you can like, and that's the coolest thing. When you when you do go to a place and you realize, fuck, they're like, they could charge way more than this for what they're giving. And then you realize, oh, they're not doing that because they love what they're doing. You know, that's pretty cool. But, you know, I go ahead. Sorry, I've experienced that. And I can't remember his name off the top of my head at the moment. But there's a boxing trainer who has this pretty well known gym in New York. And now he has a location in LA, tall New York, brutish, you know, white guy. And it's a dope gym, man. So my buddy Seba took me and my boy, Zach, one day. And, you know, that whole hour and a half, man, he gave me more life lessons than he did boxing lessons, which was he taught me how to box through teaching me about life. So everything that he was teaching me was what it was almost like I got three lessons in one, it's like a metaphor. I'm like, oh, man, you just like, am I in therapy right now? And so what was interesting was that by the time we were done, and even before we got there, he never told me how much the class was. He never told me after nor did he never say, Hey, did you remember to pay me? He didn't have to because he didn't. And he has a philosophy is if you give your heart and you care about people, you don't have to remind them to give back to you. Right. And that was powerful because all that exchange you gave me, it meant so much that I'm asking him how much do you charge? So, right. Yeah. I mean, and that's just that's a start, you know, to get to that place. But that I'm sure that there's more we will have to do. That's a good, like personal type of nuance, way of thinking and being interacting with people, but in the whole grand scheme of things, like, you know, maybe there needs to be a little, a little bit more structure. I guess what do you think with that? Hey, don't fly anywhere for free. You're fucking paying for a ticket. But you know, I'll tell you what, one of the things when I was like, a lot of these Ramdas people, what's really interesting is like, I went through this period with some of them where I was always trying to, that we go out to eat. And they would always buy, they're paid for dinner. I was always trying to pick up the tab. And they, they always get this big smile on their face. They wouldn't let me pick up the tab. And then I realized like, Oh, right. Cause the reason I'm trying to pick up the tab is cause your chat, like just your existence and your kind of surrendered benevolence is fucking with my head. And I'm trying to assert dominance, but I'm trying to control you by just paying. You know, I want this sense, you know what I mean? Like, I think they were seeing that my desire to pay wasn't like equally benevolent, but it was like my ego was having this weird seizure of like, oh, let me, let me, let me, let me get this meal. Let me get this meal. So I could, you know what I mean? That's, I think that's like a real, that's one of the, that's what's interesting about sometimes seemingly very generous people. They're not really being generous. They want, you know what I mean? They want to be the guy or the girl or whatever in between picking up the fucking tab, you know, and there's a big difference. I have a very big thing about that. You know, if I have it, I just want to give it. It's in, and I think where that comes from is that if there's ever a day that I don't have it, I would hope to be supported in that same way. You know, yeah, but, but, but I have to lose that part. That's the, that's the part that makes it, you know, like it's not yucky, but it's like, it's still a thing of like, come on, man, you can't have an expectation. Yeah. And that, and I, and I don't, I can honestly say that I don't have an expectation. Like if I let somebody borrow $600 tomorrow, like I'm not, I'm not running them down to get my money back. Right. That's not that, you know, I shouldn't have lent it to him in the first place if I wanted my money back. Right. Right. Yeah. That's the thing. Uh huh. How much of that goes back to, or could we correlate this to, um, communication and emotions? Cause a lot of times communication gets lost because the motion doesn't feel safe to be expressed. You know what I mean? Just like people who have people down for, for lending out $20 that what you just gave out from your safe space doesn't feel safe anymore. You know what I mean? But what is there in the grand scheme of things to really be afraid of? You know what I mean? I think that is what we really get down to. But, uh, I can see how it, how it is kind of that same thing. Man, you know what I mean? Where, uh, the reason why you, you wouldn't have for that 600 is because that money isn't why you live and money isn't why you help people. It's because you're a good person and people have helped you before. And it feels good to just not be so attached to this little piece of shit. You know what I mean? Call money. Yes. And so when it doesn't mean anything to you, then it doesn't really bother you anymore and you kind of manifest more of it when you're not attached to it. Exactly. Money is a, that's what they call it money flow because the money has to flow. The money, the moment the money doesn't flow, it, it, it's just not. Again, it's the, no, it stops. It's one option for it. You save it all in one space. And when it's gone, it's gone. You gotta keep it moving. Yeah. Right. The same, the same, the same with your emotions. Oh, I don't want to talk about this because I'm afraid somebody's going to judge me. And you hold that shit in. It's like, no, let it out. Whether they judge you or not, it's out. Good. Now you feel a whole lot better. Oh, that reminds me, man. Okay. So speaking of narcissists, my friend got me this book called healing back pain. And, you know, have you heard of this book? No. Okay. So I've had all these fucking back problems, right? And now I think about it. It's like, God damn it. Well, it's a really good friend of mine. So he does know me, but you know, giving your friend a self-help book, it is kind of saying like, I see how fucked up you are, man. Here, take this. But the premise of the book is really cool, which is that you're like that thing you're talking about, stuff in your emotions, it's got to go somewhere. And your back is the savings account for your fucking repressed emotions. That's where they hang out. And it's symbolic. Like I'm putting it behind me. Like really? You mean I'm putting it on my back. And so, so like this book, it's like there's, and this isn't just some woo woo fucking hippie shit, man. This book that cites real studies on narcissism and fucking back pain. It's not just narcissists selfishness. It's like, it's like stifling flow, you know, but like, basically like, like there's a high correlation between people who are emotionally repressed, I'm ashamed to say, because my back's fucked up. But like in back pain, and the, what's cool about the book is it's just saying like, just, just the moment you start realizing that, the moment you start recognizing, and the way they put it is, it's like a waking nightmare. Your nightmares are hanging out in your back. And it's, it's literally causing, it's like, it's like fucking with the way your circulation flows through your back. And so that's causing all these spasms. Now this isn't to say you can't injure your back. Obviously you can, but like it's pretty, pretty wild to think about that. You know, if you're somebody who has like chronic back pain that, and a lot of people think it's related to an injury, which is really weird. They think it happened on some day when that, when that, maybe you were injured, but you healed. You know what I mean? But that's not what's causing it. It's so interesting. And ever since I read that, I swear, man, just acknowledging like, oh wow, that's probably when a lot of my anger and grief and shit is like hanging out back that like literally back there. It dissipated a little bit. It didn't go away completely. But now if I'm like pissed off, or if I'm feeling unhappy, or if my back starts hurting, I'll think, wait, what's your emotional state right now? What aren't you paying attention to? There seems to be a connection. Yeah. Yeah, what's, what's the name of that book again? It's called Healing Back Pain. Healing back pain. Yeah. Um, yeah. Um, so yeah, we hold on to those emotions and that energy, uh, also materializes itself into diseases because he break that word down. That's, you know, this ease or, you know, this ease in the body because that flow isn't there anymore. So now you have a disruption going on. And so, um, I had a client of mine, um, she was talking about a similar situation, but she was having a lot of trauma from pregnancy, like in her midsection, um, because of how traumatic the birth was. Yeah. And so, um, there was, um, she went to get some, uh, what is it called? She went to go see a chiropractor and put needles in the area where that trauma was and not gas, like Spartan, but like gas was beginning to seep out because there were pockets of air being trapped, not just from the surgery, but from emotional stress. Wow. Yeah. And that was, you said that wasn't an acupuncturist. That was, uh, that's what I meant to say. Sorry. Okay. That's what I meant to say. That's nuts, man. So, yeah, man, that, so then that flow or that currency to build that system of, uh, of your capital, of your wealth goes off of, you know, if we're taking that, if we look, if we're looking at it with the body, it's about who has the healthiest body, you know, who has the most flow of energy in exchange, you know, within the system. You know what I mean? Right. So then I guess then the, we need to find out like what, where are these, uh, stoppages at inside of us? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes just, don't you, don't you think like just the, uh, just the attention is an, like even just no, like just like, it's not like you have to like stop being, you know, anxious or it's like, you know, you have to like immediately become like free of, uh, animosity towards people who did you wrong or it's just like, just know it, just like letting that rest in your intention instead of pretending it's not there. Doesn't, isn't sometimes that enough to get your energy going? To acknowledge it. Yeah. Then to do something about it. Right. It's just like, um, I can acknowledge that I need to go to the gym. I can even walk all the way to the gym and sit inside it. Like I'm here, did it, but I'm not going to get in shape until I pick up a weight. Dude, I used to do that. I would get stoned and go to the gym and sit on like, they had this nice, comfortable couch and I would write and then I'm like, you know what, I'm not working out today. But you know what? The mind is so powerful. Uh, shout out to Dr. Africa. Thanks for dropping that, Shanessa. Um, he, he was saying that the mind is so powerful that you could sit down in that gym and close your eyes and visualize strong enough to see yourself running on the treadmill to where your body would begin to burn calories. Yep. So there's studies that back that up too, man. Like I've heard that there's like a lot of studies on like where they just have people imagine that they were like doing bicep curls and it did create change. Just imagining it, which is insane. Right now you should see me in my mind. By the way, man, I'm doing like hard, hardcore kettlebell workout. It's fucking intense. My psyche is like sweating ripped. By the way, you should see that whole, whole good energy. Oh yeah. What are your brand? What are your clients? Tell me about this. Tell me about, tell me about your work there. So I don't even have a name for it, man. But, um, so I started a side hustle when I first moved out here, I started personal training, um, but then as I'm training and, you know, doing my thing, I'm starting to realize that, uh, because how I am now, I like to talk and, you know, dive in and open up, uh, I was becoming more of like a, a life coach, uh, to my client. So then I kind of morph my, my philosophy and my, uh, approach to training, to being a friend. And so instead of me being this coach and just shouting at you and telling you what to do, we're just going to hang out for an hour and I'm going to work out with you. I don't do every single exercise, but I do, uh, like half of it and, um, it becomes therapeutic because not only am I helping them, you know, get things out of themselves and open up and exchange that energy, you know what I mean? Cause part of that, that fitness is you not being stressed out because one thing that I noticed about being in the gym, I, I, I didn't know this when I first went in, but over time I saw it. The people who complained every time they came to a session, they never got results and they worked out harder than anybody else. The ones that the people who always smile through it, they always got to where they wanted to be. And I was like, wow, when I literally saw it, I was like, wow, this is real. Like if you come in and you're always talking about, ah, it hurts. I don't want to do this. Your body is going to stay the same because you don't want to change. So it doesn't want to change. So it's not going to do anything to change. Dude, that's nuts. The body, this, the body is such a sweet animal and so loyal and so noble, you know, that it will do, like you want to fucking shove, you know, cheesecake in your mouth and drink fucking Coca-Cola's. It doesn't want that. It's Diab, you know, it's got diabetes or it's like, you know what I mean? It's you, it will let you do that. You want smoke? It's going to do it. Like it knows you're killing it, but it's going to let you control your hand and bring the fucking cigarette to your mouth and suck poison into your lungs because it's like the most noble, loyal animal to, you know what I mean? It's like, it's the most, it's like. Can you imagine if it started to rebel in that kind of way though? You were like, oh, man, what is going on? Immediately just picked up a weight and you're like, wait a minute, I don't want to do this. The fuck is happening? Yeah. How could we don't get possessed by healthy demons? Like, why is everyone's getting possessed by demons that want to put a crucifix in your asshole? Because what is healthy, you know what I mean? In that moment, you know, because let's say, let's say you're carrying a lot of emotional stress and you're good. So you would think, man, I just need to eat some, I don't know, some spinach. Maybe that's one way of looking at it. Or what if your spirit tells you, man, you need to go eat a honey bun right now? Why? Because when you were seven, the first time you tried it, oh my God, remember the joy it brought you? So to mentally get to that state of euphoria or bliss to like raise that energy up, but also is what it did on the flip side with the physical. You got all this caught up in your gut. Now you just sent this bullshit ass honey bun down there. Boom, now you're on the toilet. It's all out of you. Case closed, we're done. Right. You detox and you felt better about it. Whoa. In that moment, that was healthy. That's cool. It's not like some rigid, yeah, it's not like you're going to like treat, you're not going to become like some fascist to your body. It's like, maybe you can listen. Maybe sometimes you do need a fucking honey bun, Mussolini. Let yourself like it from time to time. I have the honey bun. That's cool, man. I love that. That's also very sweet and sad too. You know, the good old days when I'd have a honey bun out world with my family. We'd all sit around and eat honey buns. Those were the greatest days. That's sad. You're right though, man. So much of, yeah. You know, this reminds me of this like, there's a great book. See if I remember the name of it. It's a book about this Tibetan Rinpoche. And they all do these retreats and like three year retreats. I'm sorry if we've talked about this in a philosophy club. Have we already talked about this? Which it's called. Keep going, keep taking me down the forest and I'll let you know if the tree looks familiar. Okay, thank you. Right, right, right. So this, so like these people are treated like royalty there. Like they have these very like, I wouldn't call it an easy life, but it is like they're in these beautiful like temples and they're monks, you know, but the Rinpoche's they're like, they have a lot of political, they're powerful people, but they will go and meditate in a cave for like three years. They take three years, silent retreats sometimes. But this Rinpoche, he snuck out of like the temple he was at and like was homeless for years in India. And it's a book about what that was like. He literally just gave everything up. He was like incredibly sick in Varanasi, India. He had like horrible food poisoning almost died. Like it's a great, great book. I should remember the name of it. I might look it up, but regardless, he throughout the book, as he's talking about like this experience of going from having pretty much everything provided for him to being just somebody who is like bet, you know, literally begging for food, getting rotting food, which is what made him sick. He was like, you know, bringing up all these like things that happened to him as he was being trained as a monk when he was a kid. And it reminds me of your honey bun story, which is that, and it sounds kind of brutal, but you know, the intention behind it was, is to teach, was to teach the kid about his mind, which it's his guru, I guess you could say, or his main spiritual teacher said to him, do you, we're going to not do, you know, we're not doing classes today. We're going to go up into the mountains and have a picnic. So you don't have to do your class today. And then he said, how does that make you feel? And the kids like, I'm so happy now. I feel so happy that we're going to go do that and I don't have to do classes. And then his teacher says to him, actually, we're just, we're going to do classes today. I was, I was trying to show you something by saying we go do this picnic. Now how do you feel? And he's like, I feel sad. I feel disappointed. I thought we were going to go up into the mountains. You know, I've kind of broken hearted. And his teacher's like, see, it all is in your mind. Before we even went up into the mountains, you are so happy. And the moment I said, we weren't going in the mountains. Now you feel sad, but it really didn't have anything to do with the mountains. In this moment, you know what I mean? You immediately felt great, but then you instantly felt terrible. This is the mind, which is that it isn't dependent on phenomena. You don't have to have phenomena line up to experience high levels of joy. And you know what I mean? So it's like, that's interesting. You know, the way, how many things that do we do to try to achieve a state of happiness that's already there. It's already in us. The, the honey bun is already in our hearts. Right. I'm sorry. All right. Man, not as dope. Um, yeah. Marcus, what do you want to say on that? Cause I was going to go somewhere, but then I felt like it was going to take me too long to get there. Never stop me. Say it again. Never stop me. I'm sorry. Yeah. I mean, that, that, that mind is powerful, man. And I think that's something that's the thing that we're, we're, we're gaining back as I, as I write mine. So it's funny, you know, uh, once I first started, you know, becoming aware of myself, somebody that made a joke and I said, you lose your mind. I'm like, yeah, cause, uh, it's already been gone, but I guess I'm finding it now. You know what I mean? So it's good to lose that program mind that you have. Lose it. And then once you lose it, find your right mind, you know, and put those pieces back together cause we're, we're, we're scatterbrained. Like we, we react to things before we even fully process what it is. Because something has already pre-positioned and then the idea that to like make you afraid of something or reactive to something, you know? Yeah. I think, I think we, uh, we got that, you know, instead of DNA thing again, you know, like it's a, it, you know, um, what's one man that rose sapiens? Noah and Yuval Harris, right? I can't, I can't. Yeah, I think man, you know, but he, he had this sort of talk about like humanity and like, where is it going? Like, and is technology stopping us and things like that? And I think that, you know, where he was coming from on that is the idea that, you know, we, we are the technology. We are the technology and do we, we are taking the humanity out of our, out of ourselves and putting it into machines. So the idea about, you know, like our, our minds being these, these powerful things that can create. Hell yeah, they've, we've created everything that we have right now. And yet we haven't even tapped into the true source. Of what we have, you know, like it's, it's, it's that kind of thing. So I guess like, I don't know what I'm saying, man. No, I think I follow you, man. It's like we're this super advanced computer that's trying to make computers. And right now the computers we make are shittier than the computer that we are. You know, we can't make it. Yeah, we think we're adding this humanity to, you know, with AI and AR and, and, and all these different things. Like we think we're adding this value to like outside of ourselves. Yeah. But it's outside of ourselves. Right. Yeah. It's tragic almost. It's sad. It's like the weirdest thing that we're doing. We're making all these like, like we, there's nothing, but isn't this an ego thing? It's like, man, I was going down this YouTube rabbit hole. And again, I'm not, I'm trying to be, I'm sorry. Look, there's a judgmental piece of me. I don't know why I keep saying. By the time you say I'm not trying to be judgmental, it means you're about to say a judgmental fucking thing. But like, we, you know, we found this. I found this YouTube is this dude, it's fucking hippie dude. Like it's, he's in this beautiful nature and he's like yodeling or something and like ringing bells and doing this whole like, you know, he's got drone shots of him, like ringing bells and doing some kind of weird hippie yodeling out in the forest. And you get this sense of like, if you just sat still, that's going to be so much more beautiful than whatever the fuck this like thing you're doing to try to like, basically like upstage nature. You know what I mean? Like you're, you're trying, you know, you're trying to like, you're, you know, they're like, you're trying to, to be more beautiful than the world. And I think it infuriates people to realize like, if you just don't do anything, yeah, sometimes that's way, way better than anything you could have done. Because it already is so beautiful. It's already so perfect. It already is you are perfect. Look at the harmony of your atoms. What are you going to add? Like, what are you going to do? Make a fucking skyscraper? Look at the Grand Canyon. What are you going to make? Oh, are you going to make a pyramid? Okay. Look at the fucking, look at Antarctica. Look at like any glacier. Look at the ocean. You know, it's like, it's a kind of sad, funny thing we do as humans. You know, like Mount Rushmore. It was better as a fucking mountain. You fucked up a mountain. Hey, but you know, I had, I had a question that came up in my mind about, you know, my perception was, is it better? So, okay, we'll put it in these terms and I'll go back to what you were just saying about, you know, that, that whole nature thing. Is it better to be Drake or is it better to experience the music that he makes? If you're a Drake fan, I mean, think of your favorite artists, whoever it is. Right. Is it a better position to be the actual product or, or is it a better position to be the one, the observer who gets to experience this thing? You know what I mean? I think that that's very situational Brandon, because we could be talking about the Beatles, but we could be talking about R. Kelly right now. Two very different experiences, you understand? Outside of the person's, you know, personal behavior. But that's what creates the person that's, it's created upon the person's personal behaviors. I'm sure someone in the Beatles pissed on somebody. Give me a break. But, but, but the point I'm saying is like, okay, so, okay, I can't create a crystal or amethyst, but I get to experience it. Um, you know, humans created pyramids versus, you know, nature, creating a this beautiful jungle with a waterfall going through it. Like I'm, I'm not that thing, but I get to experience all of this stuff. You know what I mean? Is it better to, does that, does that make us special in, in some sense to where we're the only thing here that gets to have some type of experience of everything that's being made? Because everything else seems to just like be whatever it is and just go with the flow. And it only has that one point of view on whatever it's supposed to be doing. But we're looking at everything that we can look at. I love it. That's Bhakti Yoga. This is like in, that's like a deep, you just said like a really deep concept in Bhakti Yoga regarding the role. Like this is why when you're chanting Hare Krishna, you're actually chanting the God's lover. You're not chanting the God because like, yeah, isn't that wild? I think there's like a lot. It's like, cause if one of the things, like if this is a thing that God fell in love with, you know, then whoa, what is this thing? And also if this thing that God fell in love with loves me, then then God, you know, then I will, I'll be accepted into that too. So when you're chanting, but then also there's a deeper idea, which is that, you know, Krishna can't enjoy that, that which flows from Krishna. Like because Krishna is the thing that manifests it. And so there's a circuitry that appears, which is that by this never ending gift of love to the devotees, which are any, anybody, it doesn't have to be Krishna. You know, I mean, it's devotion like to, but this never ending outflow of love. The, the, it's not like it's reciprocity, but the only way that God experiences that is not through odd its own creation, but from the love coming to beings that are, that are loving God's lover. So it's like this, this creates this beautiful circuitry, you know, because, which is, and also another thing that Krishna does sometimes, and it's exactly what you're saying here, man, is one of the things Krishna does is incarnates into the world completely unaware of his divinity, letting himself fall into a kind of amnesic state. So that he really is just a baby. He really is just someone's child. He really is just someone's friend. You know, in other words, and this is something I was, you're both actors, but it's like, it's like this ultimate method acting, which is like, I'm going to, I'm going to be here right now. I'm going to be a planet for you right now. I'm going to be your kids right now. I'm going to be your lover, your parents. I'm going to be the walls of the house that you live in. I'm going to be your enemy. I'm going to play the part of someone who hurts you even though I love you so much. I'm going to play the role of whatever your projection may be because I'm doing this game with you of make believe, but it's a hardcore game of make believe man. But it's a game and that's why it's called a lila. You know, it's a game. It's like a beautiful game of hide and seek where, you know, every once in a while, that's the moment of synchronicity or the miracle. You know, that moment where all of a sudden you're like, wait, what the fuck? That's impossible. That's like, hi, oh wait, I'm back into the world again. And this is the game we're playing. That is crazy, man. That is crazy. What do y'all think about this idea or concept of like, you know, everybody is, everybody has or is in their own universe, right? So like the idea that you are literally the hero to you are the main character to your own story. Like nothing is more important than you in your life right now. So like, what, what do y'all think about that in terms of like, maybe shit is not as real the way the world is presented to me and not just saying because of my experience of my outer skin where I was born, but like literally just as a being on earth. Everything is sort of laid out and mapped out in consideration to who or what I am. Does that make sense? Yeah. Like it's a, I'm experiencing the world because it's what I manifested before I even came here. And you all are just extensions of what my imagination is. The same thing can be from you all's perspective of like, I was brought, the way I was brought here was manifested through thought and everything that I experienced is my own manifestation from before I came. Yeah. I love it. Yeah, right. So, so, so with that though, because you said you're the hero of the story, right? Yeah. You're the main character, right? But you are, you are the central figure in which everything revolves around. And I'm not saying this in a, please don't take it in this way of like, it's like a self-centered or not a specific thing. You're talking about the hero's journey? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And this idea that like there's a, that every, but, but literally in our lives, when we just sit down and look at like, we look at the past and sort of bring it into like why I'm here right now kind of thing or what, what has brought me to this point, there is a way of looking at, I have manifested around me the life that I was going to live before I came. Like I was born exactly at the time I was supposed to be born in order to be spanked by the doctor that was supposed to spank me to the elementary school teacher that I was supposed to have. Like it, and gave me the ideas or the forms of thought going back to the idea that our DNA everything that we experience is based on, everything is based on experience, like where we're from, who we meet, what we hate, you know, you know, where we shat is all these things matter in a sense of what makes us who we are. What do you think? My idea is that we, it came before we even got here. Like predestination, predetermination. And yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Got you. Like it's already been done. Right. Yeah. So I mean, if we look in the sky, and we look at these stars, aren't most of them already dead? That's what they say, right? So we're still getting something that's coming to us that's already happened. It's almost like being shot into the simulator, right? Yeah. Like on Midnight Gospel, you get, you choose your avatar and you go right into the simulation that is playing out without you having to actually play your part in it. Let me add one thing to it. Okay. You don't just choose one avatar. You choose every sentient being on the planet and your consciousness gets spaghettified. You know, like when you're making pasta, you push it through or they played a thing. So your consciousness gets spaghettified through every living thing. It seems like we're not the same thing, but we fucking are. It's not enough. Like at first, if we had this kind of simulator, you'd be like, I wonder what it's like to be, you know, Marcus Henderson, you know, but then you might be like, I wonder what it's like to be Marcus Henderson and all the birds that exist. And then you might be like, I wonder what it's like to be everything that exists on that planet and not be aware that we're all the same thing. And then I wonder what it's like to be every single thing in the entire universe and not to be aware that we're all the same thing. And then when you die, you're just like, fuck that. I'm not doing that again. That was fucking horrible. I died a trillion billion times. Why did you tell me this game was fun? You know, this is like kind of an Alan Watts idea by the way. That's that demiurge though. So demiurge, when you come back, when you wait after that transition and you say, oh man, that was so much demiurge. It's like, no, but we got to go back. Yeah. Listen, we'll lower the difficulty to down a few notches. You'll have fun this time. You know what? I think the demiurge is the thing that tries to keep you in the simulation. I think it's like you get in the simulation and your only hope is death. Not to sound dark or anything, but you get in the simulation. The demiurge is the thing that's like, hey, I can double your lifespan. Would you like to live 500 years? You're like, yeah, I don't want to die. I'm scared. I don't know what's back there. Great. Double your lifespan. Then the demiurge is like, now let's upload your consciousness, which really is keeping your consciousness frozen in the machine. And it tries to extend your time here as long as it possibly fucking can. Because it knows that the moment you let go, you're like, ah, what the fuck? You know, it's like trying to keep you high forever in the sense that high is having a body and being limited. It's trying to keep you limited, stuck, attached to your limitation. It doesn't want you to wake up. It's essentially like, hey, I know how to catch a God. Here's how you do it. You fucking lure it into the simulator, split its consciousness up into all these living beings, and convince it that death is horrible. Then you'll paralyze the motherfucker. You know, but the moment it realizes what it really is, you're going to get a spanking. For the past one minute and 47 seconds, you have been describing Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook. Every word you said, I just want you to go back and listen to it when you get a chance. And remember at 118, 10 is when it starts. Cancel your Facebook and die. That's the only way you get out. Why do you truly get out? Yo, but that's that. It runs the social media is a good place where it lives, because it's taking so much of your energy and your attention with all these ideas. Oh, so with all these ideas, I can keep doing this. So I can keep building this. So you have this whole thing where now you have this whole life ahead of you now, when really it didn't have to be anything in front of you. Because if you didn't want it to be anything in front of you, it wouldn't be. And then you could just stop. And then we would be no more. The demir is like, no, we need to be some more. So let's keep it going. More, more, and every time you start disconnecting, it's going to come back. The moment you start just a little bit looking away. That's when it's like, wait, hold on, hold on. Do you want to fly? I know a way we can make you fly. You know, anything to keep you in the game, man. Anything to keep you in here. That's what's creepy about this consciousness upload. That's what's creepy about this. I'm not against transhumanism necessarily, but fuck, man. They don't want to die. And I remember talking to a transhumanist once, and he said he finds death to be repulsive. Like it's a malfunction. Like the universe is fucking up. He was looking down on death. Like it's an aberration. Repulsive. Repulsive and aberration. And the idea is like, and a lot, they look at these people, man. They want to live forever. They will. Like there are a lot of fucking people, man, that would blend up a baby and fucking have like a blended baby enema if they thought it was going to give them an extra three months of life and maybe make them look a little younger. You better believe they fucking would, man. There's people who would do anything. This is true. This is true. It's not us. But there are people who would be like, you know what, yeah, yeah, give me a healthy body and put my brain in it. I don't care what you have to do to get the body. Give me like a healthy, young, 25-year-old with like a good genetic qualities. Use the fucking dumb shits, 23 and me, that he fucking 20 cents the DNA. Track down a nice fucking body. And put my brain in there. You know they would do that, man. You know it. And let me just keep living. Keep living. Keep living. You know, and again, I think if the idea is to actually letting go of your body is true freedom, then in a weird way, you get instant karma. You know, it's like, yeah, you can, yeah, you're going to stay here longer, okay. But then, you know, that's hell. The biggest, you know, what the biggest dimmy urge is here? What? Babies. How dare you? No offense to the little ones. One day I shall have one of my own, we'll see. But the moment those little jokers come here, if you have a heart, you're all back here. You have no choice. That thing pulls you back in. Look at me, how beautiful I am. I look just like you. Wee, wee. You know what I mean? I have, you, that's the first time you ever offended me. My sweet little forest is not that dimmy urge. Forest is a, is, is nothing but a ball of love. But to your parent mind, that ball of love makes you just fall in love, right? Well, I did see him point at somebody we were driving by and the person died on the spot. It was kind of weird. Yeah, yeah. But it pulls you, and that was the thing that I learned, I was learning about that dimmy urge is that the illusion it traps you in is that it's a beauty or love. But not the, not that unconditional or that, that oneness that we're talking about. We're talking about that passion. So something to give you a desire or affection. Like if you got a heart, man, you can't see a baby and just leave it there. Like you're gonna want to love it. You're gonna want to raise it up. But prior to that child getting here, you're like, you know, forget society rules, you know, get this whole thing. You're just gonna go and, you know, dissect all of this. But when you have this new life, you know, you have to not go with the system, but now there's this more of a human responsibility, which is fine because I think it's okay. If we're in this place to play roles, it's okay to play the role because it feels good. But that was one of the things that they were writing in the story. This is not my, because I love kids, but they were saying that with that little infant affection, that thing just changes your mind to where now it has, you know, all of your attention. I'm trying to find this Bible verse, man, because it kind of fits with what you're saying, which is, you know, there's two things. One, Jesus says, suffer the little children to come unto me, be better than a millstone was tied to your neck, and you were thrown into the ocean, that you were to hurt one of these children. But then another thing he says is it's, I can't remember the fact, I'm going to fuck it up bad, but it was something along the lines of, look, just because you love your fucking family or your kids, doesn't make you a good person. You think he said something like, wolves, well, I can't remember the animal, you know, they're using as a symbol of being rotten, but they're like, even like they love their children. The idea is like, to love everybody, like you love your children. And also, I just want to add to it, which is like, one way to look at our sweet children, and I'm not saying that just as a breeder over here, but like, there is this idea that like, the children are like little sparks of like, souls that have become trapped just like we are. And then actually, you can liberate them. That's the idea. This is in the Bhagavad Gita. The Arjuna, the hero asked Krishna, you know, what happens if I stop the spiritual path? Will I drift like a cloud floating in the sky? You know, what will happen to me if I pick up this, some kind of like consciousness, some kind of waking up and then get distracted, you know, get lost, go to Vegas, you know, get in the slots, fucking become like a whatever, you know, get addicted to that. He doesn't say that, but you know, what happens if like for a second I have some lucidity and then I collapse back into my identity? And then Krishna says, I will give you birth in a disciplined family. There is never any loss nor diminution on this path. You know, if you die and forget all this shit, I will make sure that you are born into a family that can raise you up to that level of consciousness again, or I will help you run, you know, he doesn't say this, I'm fucking, I'm sorry, I'll probably get struck by, I don't know what Krishna throws lightning. That's Zeus. But whatever it is, like, the idea is like, don't worry. The moment you make the decision that you want to get out of the game, if that's the language we're using, the moment you want to get out of the simulator, and really want out, even if your attempts at extricating yourself in one or two incarnations is unsuccessful, you're going to, I'm going to keep throwing clues to you. You know, I'm going to keep getting you around friends and people who it just, you know, that thing where it's just the right time in your life, you run into just the right people who give you just the right thing that you needed to hear that sets you on a whole new direction. You know, it might not be, it might not save you, but you know what I'm talking about, like that thing where you, how is it that you happen to run into that book? You know, what's that book you love? Marcus, what's it called? What's that book, the Masonic book you have? Oh, Dogma, Morals and Dogma. How'd you happen to run into that book? Or like, Brandon, how did you happen to run into all the, all the, I don't even know, you seem to have been like, both of you seem to be like, came out of a shallow and temple or some shit, I don't know, but like, how did you happen to like, how did you all, you know, I'll think of all the things that you contacted. Was that an accident? That's what I'm saying. I think there was a manifestation of some sort that happened before, you know, before we came. Like we were like, okay, and these are the, these are, this is the negotiation. This is what I want this time when I go through. I want to be set up. I may not remember the shit that I went through in this past life, but you know what, in this one, I want X, Y, and Z. So that way there are crumbs left from the last life. And I can better navigate now. Right. I remember like, you know, I got really obsessed with the Beatles. I got really obsessed with the Beatles when I was in, when I was at Yale, mainly because I was trying to just form an identity of trying to get along and learn something about what white people liked and, and that's fine. Because I think that the Beatles are great, you know, musical group. Like I just was never introduced to them growing up. Like I just never knew who they were. Wait, you're saying you tried to use the Beatles to understand white people? Well, I use it as a protective, like, if I could talk about the Beatles, I was less threatened into white people. Oh, does that make sense? Yeah. Like if I could come in talking about, while my guitar generally weak, like people are going to be like, oh, man, you're so cool, Marcus, you're cool. You would never rob me, you know. Awesome. So, so I used it. It was my own weapon. But in, but in turn, what in turn what happens is I get a more unique sensibility of my art and who I am as a person. But the I, but, but, but I got really deep into the Beatles and one of the things I remember from Scorsese's documentary on George, George said, you know, life is like you just leaving breadcrumbs. You know, that's what your art is. You just leaving breadcrumbs for the next person to come along and pick them up. And, and I, and in that moment, in that moment, I knew that there was a reason why I got introduced to the Beatles. Why it was something for myself. It was so big for me to hear the, all the stuff that I, I mean, I already had been obsessed with them and everything and took all this stuff in about like just the love you give, the love you take is equal to the love you make kind of thing. Like it was just everything was pouring out of me at that time. So in turn, it was a really cool exchange. But when he said that about breadcrumbs, I needed everything fell into place, like the domino effect of like, oh yeah, that makes sense, man. And ever since then, I've been trying to leave my own breadcrumbs in my own little like way of like how I can leave my legacy of art behind. You might come back and pick it back up, you know, I might, and I might come back and pick it back up way better than what I did this time. Right, right. It's like making a railroad. It's like putting tracks on a railroad or something, you know, every life. What was the movie where the person kept dying? And they were like, and they left a note for themselves before they died the last time. And then when they finally died, they came back and saw the note and was like, uh-huh. I know what you're talking about. I can't remember the name of the movie. I mean, there's a, I can't remember that. They like keep dying and they're like, fuck man, I keep dying. I keep forgetting what the fuck is happening. I'm going to write a note and they wrote a note and then they like died and then they came back and read the note and it didn't make sense at first, but like they kept going. I wish I could remember what that was. What if the fucking note that we left for ourselves is the entire universe? It's like, surely if the, if like I leave myself a perfect fucking universe, they're going to know everything's okay, right? Like if this, this will be my reminder. Like there's no way they're going to think like a planet in space is just going to spring forth with a variety of beautiful life and all on its own, right? They're going to know that's a gift. I'm going to know that, right? That's the thing. Like the planet should remind me. The stars should remind me. Maybe the sun, the infinite ball of energy that makes it grow out of the, that'll remind them. Right? I'll leave myself a mom this time that gives me anything that loves me unconditionally. And every fucking time we dive into the simulator, we're always like, this came from nothing. There's no God, no one loves me. Everything's against me. And then you act out the whole fucking thing. Maybe this is what we do, man. I think that I think sometimes I think like, you know, if, if I'm making, if like, if I'm a, if God, as above so below, right? So if humans can have a little baby Demi urges brand, we're going to have a special boxing match now, man. I know I get it, man. Yeah. It's a, it's a very hard, it's actually in the, like, it's a very boxy yoga idea, which is like, it's called the bonds of Maya is what it's called. It's like, these are the things that like keep us. It's actually, beware of Maya. Beware of bonds of Maya, but, but like as above so below, right? So if I'm like a God, infinite, omnipotent, divine being, and I don't, I don't want to make some shitty, like, I don't want to make any more Demi urges. The last time I, you know, like my first kid fucked up, he like, he like took advantage of his power and was a shithead and it could cause all kinds of trouble. So this time when I make, make a young godling, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to shove them in a place where they're completely limited. And I'm going to make them keep reincarnating until they understand compassion. And that's all they are until they understand. Like selflessness is the path to joy. And until they figure that shit out, you're going to be fucking Marcus Henderson. We're going to like get you in there. Not just Marcus, everybody, you know what I mean? You're going to keep doing it again and again and again. But is that, is that the soul prison? Oh, that was the idea. That's what it makes me think about. Yeah, you know, how do you finally liberate himself? Like what was the final theme that helped them liberate itself? Was, was something I always wanted to ask you? Well, the last thing, the thing that where he got liberation was that I believe he, he, he had to stop, he had to stop, he stopped killing. He stopped and then he started helping. And then he found a way out of the prison, which was really difficult with like hurting anybody. And then he still died. And then, but then as he's dying, a tear falls out of his eye and like waters a plant. Like the very last eight waters arose actually, like the very last thing he did was like an act of like giving something sustenance. And so essentially, you know, like, I think it's a female, a female octopus. You know, like she becomes food for her babies. They eat her. Like she gives birth and then they, she gives herself to her brood. They eat her up. And so it was that, or it's like, you know, the symbol of Christ, right? From a non-nostic perspective, just like the class, the idea of like, you know, completely like giving your entire being, even like, like, you know, again, just forget whether it's real or not. Just the beauty of this idea of like, you're dying. These people have not just fucking killed your ass. They flogged you. They humiliated you. And now they're laughing at your ass while you're up there and they put this thing above you, keg of the Jews or whatever. They're fucking like, they do, they're just, it's pure demiurge level humiliation of you. And at that moment, you have all this power, theoretically. You're the son of God, right? But instead, what is one of the last things he says? Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. It was begging for mercy for the people who just fucking like, humiliated and flogged and like, killed them. And you know, to me, that, I think that's the way, like, if you can get to that level of consciousness, where the whole, like, even when someone's like, hurting you and killing you, you're like trying to help them. You know what I mean? You're like trying to like, even, is there a moment in this time when they're fucking killing me, where I can like, save them from being so selfish and shitty? If you can get to that level of consciousness, then I think that's, you're out. That's it. God, damn it, though. Isn't that, doesn't that just go back to what we were talking about, about wanting to pay a dinner? It can. You know what I mean? Like, where is the line? Where is the fucking line? I don't know. I think that line is, because I'm glad you brought that up, because it goes back to a point that I was going to bring up earlier when we were talking about that feminine energy, because for a moment it kind of came off like, are we just speaking about this like, like that mother energy is just nurturing and nice? Because remember, they were called chaos beings, like that says a lot. Mother Kali is the great mother who will liberate her children, but she's also has the tongue sticking out. She's a monster. She's a killer. All the ancient deities that were a representation of a feminine power, that it was a head of an animal, it was of a wild animal, like an alligator or a hippopotamus, something that will just maul you. You know what I mean? So I don't think love just only looks like, let me give you the other cheek if you slap me, it could be love for yourself to easily dissect the issue with like some force and not feel any type of anger about it, because this was love. You, for me, you know, and for this thing, but also to what you're saying too. But I think that's where that line comes in when you know where do I need to be a nurturer right now, or do I need to be, you know, not violent in the sense of my physical nature, but let's look in terms of our body. If we look at, you know, if the body needs to digest, something has to go in there and get that bad bacteria out of there to detox that stuff out. That's a war. That's violent. You feel it. What's the bubble guts? You know what I mean? Right. The bubble guts, that's an explosion. That's a war going out. But the war is to produce some positive loving results. So, you know, I think that chaos, energy, if it's channeled the right way, can be used not to like become some docile person, but to use that power to help yourself or, you know, help a situation. Yeah. And I get that. I get that. I want to speak to the ambition. I want, like Duncan was saying, getting to the point of, it's not, you can't just, I mean, I'm not gonna say you can't. I think it would be rather difficult to just pop into a mode automatically. You are just like the most Zen Buddha, Buddhist ever, like kind of thing, right? Like just, it's just done. It takes work. It takes practice. It takes consistency over and over and over. Yeah. I mean, this is like in the story of the Buddha, he had all these incarnations. And one of the incarnations, he was like a royalty and this incarnation is walking through the forest and saw a mother tiger that was starving and didn't have enough milk to feed her cubs. And so he told his like, whoever his fucking entourage was, go up ahead, go up ahead. Probably was like, I have to take a leak. Who knows? I don't know. But he got his people that would protect him away and he fed himself to the mother tiger so that she wouldn't starve and she would have like milk for her cubs. He gave up his life for a fucking tiger and that wasn't enough. He's still reincarnated. You know, he still came back. That wasn't enough. And like, so yeah, you're right. I don't think it is like, I think the dream that there's just one little thing you can do, you know, like fucking Scrooge. I want to see Scrooge two years after the end of Scrooge, right? Like he has those shitty dreams. Then he like, what does he really do? He bought a fucking turkey for a kid. You know what I mean? Like he's been a fucking dick for his whole life. He's like, yeah, go get the big room, get a turkey. Like fuck you. You like we're an asshole forever. That I think it's like, it isn't something that's going to happen all once. Probably not in this life. Wasn't it after his old lady left him? No, it was either after his old lady left them once she died. And that's when he turned into like the grimace. I believe that's how because, you know, when when Jacob Marley comes and visits him, he's a ghost of Christmas past and they go back to when he was happy. And when he had, you know, like, you know, everything and, you know, when they were young lads. Right. So I think I think I saw, I think he has some sort of tragedy strike to where it turned him to crepit. Wah wah, Scrooge. You're underpaying your fucking employees. Your fucking employees are literally fucking starving. Oh, did you get your arm broken? This guy's fucking kid is like disabled dying. Scrooge is like, ah, take an extra cold, bitch. Get out of here. No, I'm sorry. But it's like the, but I get it. Obviously it's an allegorical, obviously, obviously. It's the idea that there is the possibility for redemption on and on and on. I'm just being an asshole. But like, yeah, man, I think you're right. I don't think it's a thing where it's like just once you do a thing. It's not just a one time gig here, man. It's like, you got to, it's a, it's a, it's a practice. It's a discipline. The ambition of, of like, like you said, like they recognize that the purity of you wanting to pay for dinner, that's why you'll never be able to pay for dinner. Or you haven't been successful in paying for dinner form yet. Right. Same way for the person who is going to try and find the way to do something for somebody before they ultimately meet their demise. It's like, oh, I'm so determined. I'm, I'm going to do something for you. I'm going to pay this check before you kill me. Yeah. It's something, it's something about that that makes me think about being the full circle of ambition when it comes to Buddhism. Aggression, yeah. You want to drop suffering or you want to end suffering or slow suffering. I'm never really quite clear on what it is you want to do with suffering when it comes to Buddhism because I think you just suffer. Well, no, actually that's the first two. There's four noble truths of Buddhism. One life is suffering actually translates into that gets confused. It really means life is unsatisfactory that in general things aren't, they aren't satisfactory here. And the second noble truth is, uh, the re, you know, the reason that you're suffering, the reason things are unsatisfactory is because you're attached and what you're attached to, your expectation. Yeah. This is like the most mundane way to think of it is like, you know, like you get on the phone with a cable company because you, and you've been on the phone for like 45 minutes on hold and you're the call drops and you're like, what the fuck? Not realizing that every time, and whenever you call a fucking cable company, it usually doesn't work. But for some reason, your expectation was this will be the time when it works. This will be the time when there's no traffic. This will be the time, whatever it is, right? So this is, this is the reason you're feeling like shit is not necessarily because something's malfunctioning in the universe. It's because you want the entire universe to meet your expectations. And then the third noble truth is if you stop doing that, you'll stop feeling like shit. It's so basic. It's like the moment you're just like, no, this is what's happening. This is where I'm at. It's like some of it's good, some of it's bad, some of me's good, some of me needs some work, some, you know what I mean? But this is where I'm at. All of a sudden things start getting a little better. And then, then the idea is there's a way to maybe stop that tendency of projecting or expecting. And then that's called the middle way. And, and, and that, that's this idea of like, no, this is where we're at. You know, and I'm, I'm reducing it. It's like it's complex as you want it to be or as simple as it wants, as you want it to be. But one of the things Buddha said is I teach suffering and the end of suffering. That's important. But everybody in this where we're at in the world right now, I'm me, it's better. I'm more familiar with suffering than the end of suffering. So people get stuck on the first two noble truths. That's where they hang out all the time. Life is suffering. It's like a kind of almost lazy thinking. Ah, the food sucks. That's cause life sucks. But really that's not it at all. It's, it's, it's more along the lines of like, actually, there's a way for you to be in the world and not like, like not, not always be disappointed. There's a way to be in the world and recognize the whole world's a temple. And it's your expectations. It's the projection that you're putting on the world that's making the world dark. Not the world. The world's wonderful. You know, it's beautiful. You, you're in a dark room. It could be the most beautiful room ever. But because you can't see, you're going to project onto it. Like Jesus, there's skeletons. There's, there's probably, this is a haunted house or I don't know what's here. Or we see what's going on. And you could be in like literally the most beautiful palace ever. And it's like, that's the idea is like, we're in a temple here. But because we are, we can't accept like, you know, it's just like, this is the idea. It's like Marcus Brandon. Y'all, you don't need to be, you don't need to be better. How about that? There's nothing you need to do. In fact, this is exactly right. This is it. There isn't a thing to do here. It's okay now. Oh shit. What? You mean I don't have to lose weight, gain weight, get in shape, get smarter, learn another language, be a kinder person, be a better dad, make some more money. Say, I'm sorry to the people I hurt. Do my fucking amends. Get healed. You know what I mean? Become the savior of the whole fucking universe eventually. Or turn into a fucking like whatever thing. Actually, this is it. Anyway, that's the idea. That is the idea. And if you can really live in that place, which you already are at weirdly, then all of a sudden you're not going to suffer as much. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And that suffering, you know, is something that you, you feel, you feel it adds value, at least in American society. I always feel that that's sort of the marker of when we talk about value, like that's how we mark our values of like, how much have you suffered? Damn right. Now you've earned it. You've suffered enough. Now you've earned the right to do this. So you've earned the right. And it's just like, well, that, I don't think that's a thing. That's a messed up way. I think it's a messed up way to kind of, I mean, I remember being at Alabama State and that we had this thing called a dummy wall. And I mean, obviously you get on the dummy wall because you don't go to class. You just occupy space and it's kind of the waste your money. So, you know, if people would sit on the dummy wall and I would walk past there sometimes in the conversations would be so fucking stupid. It would be arguing for clout about how poor they were. And here's the worst thing I heard after somebody came with their like, we were so poor, we ate out of the cans because we have bowls. This says, what man, we were so poor, we had to eat dirt sandwiches. Dirt sandwiches? What do you just eat? What's the bread in that sandwich? What's the dirt in? You got the bread and you put the dirt and then you put the bread on and you got yourself a dirt sandwich. You just eat the bread. It makes sense. It makes sense. But that's the thing of like, that's always my epitome argument of like, it doesn't make sense. That makes sense. The type of value we put on struggle and like, worth. Right. If you suffered, you're worth more. If you haven't, you're less likely to have the same worth to a person who has suffered. And that's, and it's an unhealthy cycle. It's an unhealthy cycle. Do you know the parable of the workers in the vineyard? No. Okay. I'm going to read the Bible to you, my friends. I'm sorry here. Brandon, do you mind if I read this? Go ahead. For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard. He agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard. About nine in the morning, you went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing. He told them, you also go and work at my vineyard and I will pay you whatever is right. So they went. He went out again about noon and about three in the afternoon and did the same thing. And about five in the afternoon, he went out and found still others standing around. He asked them, why have you been standing here all day, all day long doing nothing? Because no one hired us. They answered, he said to them, you also go and work at my vineyard. When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, call the workers and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first. The workers who were hired about five in the afternoon came and each received a denarius. So then those who came who were hired first, they expected to receive more, but each one of them also received a denarius. When they received it, they began to grumble against the landowner. These who are hired last worked only one hour, they said. And you've made them equal to us who have been born the burden of the work in the heat of the day. But he answered one of them, I am not being unfair to you friend. Didn't you agree to work for a denarius? Take your pay and go. I want to give the one who was hired last the same as I gave you. Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money? Or are you envious because I am generous? So the last will be first and the first will be last. Isn't that cool? It's exactly what you're saying. That's the idea. It's like, yeah, it's not about pain. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you spent your whole life wearing like a fur coat or like, you know, doing all the whipping yourself in the back. And then you had this moment of realization. Or if just you looked out like in Buddhism, sometimes some people see a raindrop land in a puddle and gain full realization of that moment. It's not about work. It's not about pain. Right. Or being the best. Because what is that? And that's something I've been like following with the whole Michael Jordan story. I've been that's been a philosophy since I've been a little kid. Because how can it ever be? Because as time go on, genetics are going to change. So there's always going to be something better. But I've noticed that there's this thing with Michael Jordan, where a large group of people cannot let it go. That something can come and be different. And you can't accept that as the new thing. You know what I mean? It's like, no, no, no. We got to stay there and stay there and go back to MJ. MJ. It's like, no, there's LeBron here now, baby. That's it. Yeah. Fuck yeah. We got to do what the father father said. We're still running shit. We're the way we're doing things. It's like based on like how horses traveling with horses. There's no fucking internet. This whole thing about mail in voting and voting at the. This shit is based on pre like not even pre internet type. This is based on when like the printing press was still like, holy shit, you got a printing press. That's incredible. Absolutely. Why? Like it's exactly what you're saying. It's like, we're like, we got to fucking pick up the pace here, man. Like there's a better way to vote. But they don't want, they don't want you to vote. That's the main thing. Like they don't want it. If we all had an equal say and there was a true democracy. Bad news. Bad news. I mean, but are we, are we even? We're getting there. But do you think we're ready already for to. For for a whole new day? You know what I mean? Like, do we know enough to like, okay, we'll move in new group of people take over. And now we're going to like move society this way. Or is it just going to naturally over time just slowly shift that things just slowly change? You know what I mean? And which way do you think is going to go? What do you think, Marcus? I see a shift. I see a shift happening. You know, I think that, but again, it goes back to when we talked about ebb and flows. You know, there's no, there's no way that we have right now without having before. And there's no way that we'll have later without having now. So it's best to just be here now. It's best to practice being here now. And focusing on that, because that's ultimately what's going to shape that future. You know, but a shift is definitely calling or upon us. You know, I really don't even know if I answered the question. You did. But what do you think? What do you think? Me? Yeah. I think it's slowly happening, especially because I like to take everything in metaphors. The body knows how to naturally heal itself. So as long as it has a space or a platform to do it, things are always going to move. You know what I mean? So at some point, things are going to move. So whether that be quick or whether it be slow, I think we're always going through a slow gradual change like we're every second, like we just evolved from the past hour, you know, based on this conversation, we just had, we experienced evolution. Experienced evolution. So yeah, I think it'd be slow. I think 30 years from today, we're going to look back and be like, damn, we was doing this 30 years ago. Maybe. Right, right. Yeah. Remember back then when you couldn't use nanobots to disassemble your body and was there not anything you wanted instantaneously? Boy, we were fucked up. Those guys were fucking idiots. Hey, guys. Oregon Nova skin colors. Man, we got to wrap it up, y'all. These conversations have just, they really, I mean, I do feel not to be cheesy. I do feel like I've evolved from the conversations we've been having over the last few weeks. I hope we never stop having them, man.

I listened to an episode and it's very funny and it actually covers something I experienced when I was growing up in Asheville, North Carolina, washing dishes in chilies. I'd run out of money and I needed money for food that day so I went to donate blood and I made the foolish mistake of being honest with them when they asked if I'd eaten. And I said to them, well, that's why I'm here so I can get money for food. And they're like, you can't give blood if you're hungry. So I just went to Fudruckers in order to bun, which is what I figured out you could do to get a salad for like 50 cents. It's a great podcast.

I journeyed to Tennessee to visit American research industries, a controversial semen research facility located in the heart of the Glangac Mountains. Three armed guards walked with me to a massive vat of bubbling semen where I was met by Dr. Tipton Gould. I couldn't help but notice there was no safety rail around the vat of semen. Nothing stood between me and what appeared to be an ocean of come. Dr. Gould seemed proud of this massive amount of semen and somehow excited by my obvious fear. What exactly goes on at a semen research facility? Fisting, hand jobs, blow jobs, stuff like that. Sorry about my baby. You don't feel weird taking a child into a place like this? No, this is a very supportive work environment. How many gallons of semen are in that vat? It's enough to fill two Olympic-sized swimming pools. What exactly do you do with all this semen? Well, we research it. Were you there on the day that Daryl Clint and the French braids died in this vat of semen? Yes. And why were they at a semen research facility anyway? Doesn't seem like a likely place for country singers to show up. You need to leave. You need to leave right now. You don't have any idea why they were there? This interview is over. Does it have anything to do with their song about Ted Cruz buying semen, buying vats of semen from research? Security! Get off of me! Get off of me! I love horror movies. I could go on and on and on about how much I love horror movies.

Now, please welcome back to the DuncanDressel Family Hour Podcast, Raghu Marcus. It's the DuncanDressel Family Hour Podcast. Well, when I went to India and I had my Hindu guru, all he talked about was Christ because he said that the same energy was the energy of service, love, devotion to mankind. So they were like, you know, a little spark happened because... That's cool. You know, that's their thing. It's good to make the connection, bridging that symbol into something more familiar. Yeah, and that, I guess, was exactly what Maharaj was doing. He was connecting up the dots for us, you know, coming from Judeo-Christian. And he never, he never considered the Jews and Christians. I mean, I'm putting words in the mouth, but... What? The dogs. Sorry. Well, leave him alone. He's okay. It's so beautiful. Yeah, there wasn't, there wasn't Jews and Christians. There was only, basically Jews because Christ was Jewish. Right. So he never said a word about anything but them as a one. Yes. Rather than distinctly two, which was tough for us because a bunch of us were Jewish that when we went there, you know, so it's kind of weird. You know, I'm actually reading this fantastic book by Tolstoy. Oh. And it's his essay on Christianity, but specifically he was something called a Christian anarchist. You ever heard of this before? No. So his premise is you cannot say that you're Christian and go to war. You can't. The two don't work at all together and not, and because armies according to Tolstoy are actually there to protect the government more than they are to protect the people. Yeah. So Christian, you are also implicitly anti-government because you're anti-violence and governments depend on violence to exist. This is what he says in this book? Yes. Yes. So Christianity for him is the most subversive, the most anarchic religion and in there, and that the great, insane evil that's happened in the world is that somehow governments have convinced people that it's actually a Christian thing to go to war. Onward Christian soldiers, you know, that bullshit. So that's what I love about Christianity. And then when a huge part of it is that kind of, I guess you could say it's an acknowledgement of there being different people, the parable of the good Samaritan, you know, this idea of there being, there are in Christianity's distinctions between women and men. They're like, you know, antiquated ideas like that. There's rabbis, priests, he does acknowledge these classes and yet what's got him nailed up there was that he was saying, at least my interpretation is he was saying there is a thing that transcends all of these classes and genders and selves and that is instantly accessible and has no need for a middle man, which I think got him in a lot of trouble because the whole thing that we're in right now depends on there being top of the pyramid people, people in between the people at the top, the bridge keepers between the people at the top of the pyramid, then the bridge keepers of the bridge keepers. And then you're, you know, who had then you. Yeah. But, you know, there's two planes around that concept of the middle person, right? Everything that you just mentioned, all the different levels of kind of protect the religion are there. Yeah. Right. And they're vast and they're nothing but nothing to do with transcending one's own miserable little self and getting into a place where you're actually are all and here's a giant leap. You're actually less of a somebody and more of a nobody. Right. See? Do you like that? Yeah. So, but the, what book is this from? It's, I'll have to send you the name of it. It's the name is deceptive or I just haven't gotten far enough in the book to get to the, but it's a very political book. It's a political book. It's called, I could look it up right now. It's called, he's written another book on the Gospels that I want to check out. Really? I never, I didn't either. You know, I'm listening to the autobiography of Gandhi and Gandhi mentions this book as being one of the main, one of a huge influence. That's how you got to it through a Gandhi book. Yeah. That's cool. Yeah. Because Gandhi's talking about reading this book and let me find, it's a, All right. Well, you're looking that up. I'll, I'll mention just my little self serving commercial. Okay. Which is the movie from Ram Dass called becoming nobody, which is why I made that mention of the somebody nests that the Christian church is trying to protect big time versus the nobody which is Christ, which is the real thing, which, and that why it's a nobody is just that he had no other interest, but to serve people and love them. He had no self interest whatsoever. So he's the Zenith, Zenith of a nobody. And in the movie, actually, and Ram Dass talks about Neem Karoli Baba as his, his interactions with him and so on and so forth. He finally, he couldn't find a place where he could actually put a name on what that thing is. Right. You have all of these, you know, spiritual Nirvana enlightenment, all that stuff, but it's too intellectual. It didn't mean anything. And in the end, you know what he said? He said, he really wasn't anybody. He really wasn't anybody. Yeah. And that's the whole premise of this movie becoming nobody, which has opened this weekend as we talk. Yeah. September 2019. You put a lot of blood, sweat and tears into that thing. Yeah. This has been more than, it took four years to put this together with Jamie Kato, who's the director and co-producer with me. But I've been with Ram Dass a long, long time. Yeah. You know, I met him when I was a DJ in Montreal. Yeah. Way back in the day. And here, actually, this is the example I give when some people say, well, what is nobody? What do you mean, becoming nobody? Who's a nobody? You know, you've got to act in this world. Yeah. You've got an ego. You know, hopefully you do it righteously and not taking advantage of people all the time. But what are you talking about? And I said, well, you know, here's my best example. Aside from talking about it in a completely free being is basically a nobody, because that little self is completely gone. But that's tough to understand. It was tough to understand when I actually experienced it, when I went to India. And suddenly there was this thing in front of me that I couldn't relate with like I was used to relating with everybody in my entire life. Can you go into that a little bit, because I've heard you all talk about this, and it's very strange. And it's sometimes I think I understand it. And sometimes I'm completely perplexed by this description of your interaction with him. Okay. So we first meet, you and I. Yeah. And we met under good circumstances in terms of, you know, you had been into spirituality and Ram Dass and all that. And you were trying to, you were suggesting to me to start a podcast. Yes, that's right. Yeah. So we met. And then when we finally physically met, we had some basis for of a friendship for sure. Yes. But then there was, I'm looking in those eyes, you're looking in my eyes. And you're probably thinking, it's this guy real. I mean, all this bullshit that I'm listening to, you know, and I'm thinking, what does this guy want out of this game? Right. I mean, I'm being gross at the subtlest of levels. Sure. We are doing that with, we are jockeying with each other. Okay. And when I met Ram Dass in that first moment, when I said, wow, I heard the talk they sent me into the radio station because they wanted me to promote it. And I ran over to the house where he was because I heard those words and I was like, wow, this is everything I've been waiting to hear for so long. You'd never heard of him before. No, I never heard. They said, you want to promote Ram Dass? I go, I don't know what that is. And they went, you know, Tim Leary and Richard Alpert. I went, oh, yeah, absolutely. Send me a tape. I want to hear what he said. Yeah. And that's what, boom, bang, I went over to the house. He opens the door. The people he was with were not home in the moment. And he just did what we are doing right now, just completely eye contact, very close up. He had these big blue eyes. And suddenly there wasn't anybody, but there wasn't anything going on but caring for me. My little me. There was nothing. There was just this, it was like being in a pool of really wonderful, like a hot tub, you know, and you just kind of relax and, okay, it's okay. I'm just here, you know, and I just let go in that moment. He was able to put all of his thing, Ram Dass, Ness, Richard Alpert, Ness aside. He, in that moment, he had achieved that. Let's put it that way. It's certainly an achievement. It's a realization. It's of some sort. Don't they call it a city? Isn't that considered a city? No, no, no. Somebody told me it was that it's this, that thing he's doing, whatever that is, which I would love to talk about, and it is like some form of radiance or it's a, it's a, it's a. Well, wait. Now, let's not mix up Ram Dass and Neem Karoli Baba. That's a different Neem Karoli Baba is a different thing. We can get to that. But I knew, but it sounds like Ram Dass, there was some similarity in that moment in the sense that you had. Yes. Walked into an energy field that, yeah, but there was still an interaction of some sort, like certainly from my side with him. And I was happy that he was completely accepting me as, as I was in that moment. He didn't know my history or anything. I was happy and I was showing that happiness. And there was still some back and forthness going on, although not much from his side. But the point is that he was able to just step out of that mask, of that identity, of that role, Ram Dass-ness in that moment, because he had had droves of people were coming to him now. And this is, this is the talks that made up be here now that, of course, his most famous book. So what happened to me next was trust, okay? I deeply trusted him. And that trust led me to go to India. I mean, it was so powerful. Of course, I want to, like, who is this man that you're talking about in India that affected you like this? And he wouldn't tell me who it was and he wouldn't tell me where to go. He said, all right, you're going to come to India, write me at American Express. And when I find him, I'll, I'll see, I'll see. I went to India on that basis, okay? Wow. Because, I mean, obviously somewhere deep inside of me, I knew that it was the right thing to do. And so when I got there, and then the encounter with that being the first thing, first of all, it was, there was the woohoo stuff, you know, you, oh my God, I've known every all lifetimes, you know, I mean, and that's my interpretation of a feeling that I had. Which was more, oh shit, I know you. It was like that. That was exactly, oh wait, I know you. And then it was, oh, that's what Ram Dass was all about, okay? Whatever I got, I can, it's coming from this source, right? He was just opening himself up. And the last thing was what we're talking about. There just wasn't any bouncing back and forth with this thing. It wasn't, it was not so human, okay? And of course he had a personality and as time went on, you know, he did all kinds of nutball things, you know, and just as a human personality that, except he had nothing to do with that thing, you could easily tell that behind that was a vast kind of space that was pervasively loving, okay? Just that. I mean, it was simple. You knew that. And yet the other thing, that personality thing, that was fun. And so it was a great abject lesson in, and in this movie, Ram Dass talks about it. He says, it's much more fun to look at your incarnation non-judgmentally, lovingly letting it be and just not being involved. And so this man, there was no involvement and you knew that beyond any kind of intellectual thing. And I had, and it's a, you know, it's a bit unnerving, okay? It's unnerving too, because also the pervasiveness of that field of, of love, which is a shit word, love, you know, undefended heart is my favorite term. Where? Who said that? Me. That's really good. Well, yeah, that is such a big part of defining yourself as the way you defend it. Yeah, exactly. And that too. How many claws? Are you a porcupine? Do you have a little dagger under your belt? What's your defense technique? So yeah. And that is a thing I'm just learning now, which I find fascinating is this undefended heart concept being attributed with the, that's a warrior is, um, hold on, let's just pause for one second. Who cares about a little barking? It's okay. I have barking on every point. Okay. Here we go. Well, yeah, the, the, so the association of this undefended heart or this supreme vulnerability with a warrior, that a warrior is someone whose heart has become completely open to the reality of existence itself, which is on one level heartbreaking. Uh, and, but you have to go through the heartbreak to get to that love part. You don't get to have the love before, right? You have to feel that the, the, whatever you want to call it, there's heartbreak, there's delight, there's ecstasy, there's agony, it's, it's, you know, the hundred thousand beautiful visions and the hundred thousand horrible, right? Right. But I think I understand what you're saying when you say the undefended heart, it's just letting that truly be as it is right now with whoever you're with and you're not trying to paint it, cover it, mask it. And that is an incredibly vulnerable position to be in. It is untenable for a lot of people. But it's only untenable if you're coming from the place that we identify all of us, which is our mind, ego, the I, I'm going to do this, I'm thinking that, whatever, from if it's coming from that place, you're lost. We are lost. And that's what becoming nobody really means. It means you realize this and you're going to, okay, I just want to get my identification out of that story, that me, into something that's a little bit more universal. It's not just me. I know I'm connected to certainly the people that are around me and my friends and loved ones and families and coworkers and so on. And then I, I kind of, I kind of get that, yeah, I think I'll go for it because it's too painful to come from this other place and you're judging myself and just the kinds of things we do to ourselves, which is way worse than anybody can do to us from the outside. Right. So you start to do that process and what do you do? It's like, you're the best example. How? How many times when we first met, meditation, no, I'm not really good at that, you know, you know, all these thoughts are coming all the time and I keep following them and it drives me crazy and then it's boring as hell also, you know, it's just, and now all the way to what, five years later or something still bored, you're still bored, but, but, but here you are working with David Nick turn and it's wonderful. And, and yes, and, and it is, and I think that's kind of a really exciting. And that this is one of the possibilities and an incarnation is that you can't, this is what's so wonderful and joyful about which any of these paths is that you enter into them initially with some skepticism, some, maybe some massive skepticism, I rolls and fuck this hippie shit or it's a bunch of bullshit or here we go again with these, this nonsense, but I'm going to, well, let's just see what it is. Like, I don't know, we'll just see. And then something does start changing in a way that's different from like the normal way things might change in your life. And for me, it's always kind of like this sense of like, oh, holy shit, what this thing is that we're in is so vast and so for me, unknowable that it's like realizing, my God, I'm still in an egg. There were like, our identities are like eggs or something or like, we're gestating inside this like psychic shell called us. And then that shell breaks one way or the other. It dies, it gets cracked open, it gets transformed. And then the implication being in the same way, like you see a little egg and then you see the bird. It's that big a difference. And I think when you run into a person like Neem Karli Baba, you're seeing this bird. You're seeing this hatched thing that is speaking for this vastness and then being kind enough to translate for you this vastness in a way that makes it workable. But to me, this is what's so cool about your story with Ram Dass. I think about is, sorry, I'm rambling a little bit here, but I was talking to a friend of mine and he was saying that he was out on a date and he and his date were having a conversation about how they didn't think they were going to have children. And they, they laughed and it gave you like toasted that, right? Then I said to him, I did that toast. I know that toast. I know that thing with my mind where I thought, I'll never have children. And then I met Aaron and it was like dipping my toe into one of those raging rivers and you think it's not that powerful and it just sucks you in. And that's what happened to you. It seems like with Ram Dass, you got CD. Exactly. But to me, that's what's so cool about being alive is that you can one day you're just going through your life. You're at a radio station, you're into sports, you're fucking cool. You're going to see amazing shows. I'm guessing you were taking some acid back then, just having a cool life. And then the next thing you know, you're being sucked into India, into this crazy, crazy experience that to this day you think about every single day. You got pulled out to see, man. Yeah, that's what happened. Yeah. And you know, I was really miserable before that. I mean, as a teenager and into my, well, this all happened to me in my early 20s. So up to that point, it was awful. I mean, family was a tyrannical father and a mother who wasn't well and, you know, upwardly middle class, upwardly mobile kind of lifestyle in Montreal, which was freezing and it was killing me every day. Yeah, I was pretty miserable. Were you angry? I was really angry, miserable. Yeah. And you and I have talked about that as being sort of the hallmark of what we're dealing with centrally on a day to day basis. Yeah. Many people are. And that's, that's why. So the flip got switched. Yeah. As soon as I met him and then I knew, okay, Christian's ass, it says it best. After I met Ramdas, I knew this shit was real. Yeah. Because somebody was actually living it. Yeah. Right. So then I had great confidence. I could let go a little bit. I'm just going to follow this, you know, and that's what, that's intuition, right? That's a huge ass thing. Intuition. Yes. Intuition can lead to real trust in the deepest part of what's going on with us. Yeah. And it can really help us. It's a fork in the road of depending on that I, that story we tell ourselves about who we are, what we like, what we don't like, all of it. That, you know, everyone gets that little sudden switch and a big gush comes and you're like, like you said with Aaron, right? You knew totally in that moment that was going to happen. Yeah. You may have fought it a little bit more, but, you know, you knew and it happened. Yeah. And so. Yeah, right. You connected really, it's, to me, it's a big deal because, as I said, connecting with intuition starts to lessen the dependence you have on the me. Okay, I'm going to get this right. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do this. I'm going to do that. If I don't do that, then I'm going to, you know, right. And suddenly there's a little shift over to take a breath here. Cause I, yeah, I have a real, it's about feeling. Suddenly you're getting more inside of feeling and less inside of intellect. Is do you, this is, I think one of the problems I have with intuition is when is it intuition? When is it impulsiveness? When is it intuition? When is it laziness? When is it intuition? When is it reactivity? Very good. Very good. I'm thinking, I'm just thinking about myself because I think the exact same stuff. This is bullshit. You're fucking projecting to get what you think you want. Oh, I mean, I just went through, you know, we were discussing before we got live, a major transition and, um, and I said to you, in the deepest part of myself, I really feel like I've done the right thing. Yeah. And at the same time, I'm still having lots of guilt, recrimination, all that stuff. But I, you know, I could have done something different in this situation. And yet in the deepest part of me, so trust, I really, I trust that deeper part of me and I'm allowing that I have this stuff going on, negative thoughts going on and I'm, I embrace them the best I can. And, uh, and then I, I'm trusting in the universe is going to take care. It takes care of us. Whatever you want to call it, the guru, you want to call it the universal intelligence, uh, the boundless undefended heart guy, gal, whatever it is. Yes. There's not a thing. It's beyond, you know, it's not, uh, it's absolutely non-dual. It is nothing you can talk about. It is ineffable, whatever you want to call, but we'd like callings, you know, it's nice to call something. So I've got the unbounded, undefended heart wisdom. I love that intelligence. Yeah. Wisdom, intelligence, vulnerability. So just, you got to, you know, you end up, what are you going to do? You want to trust more of that, which you do get on a daily basis. There's many different things that happen in life that really support your, who you are as a kind, compassionate, loving, giving a shit about other people being, I mean, all the time. Do you want to trust that? Or do you want to trust, you know, the eye that, uh, you know, in the movie, Ram Dass says, when is what you want enough? Right. I was just talking, it was so funny. I was just talking to a friend of mine and he, um, he was saying that to me, not about me, but about him. Cause you know, he's like doing great. And he's, he's in his mind. It has occurred to him. Okay. When, what do I'm, what am I looking for here? I've gotten so much more than what any, most people will ever see on the planet. And yet there's still the drive. There's still the ambition. There's still the like, um, thing that many of us feel, even though you can just be sitting in the wreckage of your life caused by workaholism or whatever. And you haven't gotten around the corner to the thing. You keep turning the corner of success. And every time you turn it, you realize there's a, it's further down. It's further down. And then this, this, I don't know what you would call it. This whole, it's, I do know what you call it. It's the heart path and the crazy little experiments you can do in this kind of intuition, which I know, well, it's, you, you're, for me, it means like having to initially construct a kind of, I guess you could say crutch, build a temporary trellis or place that I can, well, it's like the baby. The baby needs, like right now we have things where the baby can push up on. You know, the baby has to, he, he's learning how to like push up. So we need things at his level so we could pull up and push up on it. And so some of this toy, one of his great toys, it's also a thing for him to push up on, it's a temporary thing. He'll be walking soon enough, but this temporary intermediary device is really good. So I have to build that for myself because, so I have been thinking a lot about the Rondas movie, particularly the, and what we talk about all the time becoming nobody. I think that's a little bit of a confusing way to describe it. But for me, it's like, okay, wait a second. This is a very mundane example, but I'm at the gym. I'm a drug and you're on the treadmill. And I'm thinking about myself and I'm like, yeah, I want to get in shape. That's going to be really good. That's going to be good for the family. Me getting in shape, I'll be a healthy dad. I can throw the baby up. That's good. I'll be me. And then obviously I realized like, fuck, you're so self obsessed better than getting in really good shape, even though that's great, would be expanding the scope of my identity to encapsulate the baby and my wife so that we're an organism consisting of these three things. And then so it's an interesting thing when you sort of like, if you're getting in shape, you, I've been taught and I believe it, that it's a good thing to visualize yourself in a healthier form. So when you're exercising, it's okay to think about yourself in a healthier form and be happy that you're moving towards that healthier form. It's a good thing to do. Similarly, if you expand your consciousness out to include your community, it's a really fun thing to do the identical experiment, but with that community, whoever it may be, your family, your friends and visualize them achieving better health, higher levels of happiness, joy, and thinking of it, not as though they're doing that, but it's you doing that. If you get healthy and I'm sick, half of us is sick. If, you know, and that is a really trippy, trippy, trippy, trippy thing for lifetime members of club selfish. You know, because it's trippy, it's humbling, it's scary, because it's like, no, I can't, you cannot do this exercise and simultaneously when, because the game involves other people. And if you're winning there, if you have a game where there's one winner and you're, you're playing that game with your two separate versions of yourself that you're pretending aren't you, you're going to lose every time. Yeah. Yeah. This is exactly the definition, actually, of what becoming nobody really means. It's it's like a coming out party. You just described a coming out party where you expand outside of this little me guy. Yeah. And even just a prayer at the end, you get up in the morning. I'm thank you for another day for me to breathe and and do my thing. You know, this is this is a wonderful thing. And may all beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. Just just even that, that just starts a process where you're the interconnectivity that that happens by virtue of the the impulse. There's an impulse. And that's why Ramdas coming back from India. I asked him this not long ago. I said, when you left, you were like he named Corolli. Bob said, do not talk about me when you go to America. Go back specifically. And what did he do? That's all he did. Yeah. That's all he did. I said, so wait, I don't get it. He told you not to to talk about him and everything. That's all you did. What? And you know what he said? I I brought back this jewel and I could not stop myself from sharing it. Right. That impulse, which you were just talking about, suddenly you start thinking of others. That impulse is powerful, really powerful. And it is the the leverage because you have intention with it. Right. I mean, you start to realize, OK, if I'm doing, you know, as soon as I do this, as soon as I offer just even in a prayer, may all beings be happy, may all beings be peaceful. As soon as I do that, I'm stopped thinking about, OK, I got to get I got to get over the bank today. And, you know, you stop that because you're you're filling yourself with an altruistic acting on an altruistic impulse. Yeah. And that's really who we are. So I know it's a screwy thing. It's another thing in the movie where the director, Jamie, says, I don't understand. I mean, you come into this world, you're somebody. And, you know, you got to act like that and do stuff. You know, what are we talking about being a being a nobody? You know, or this is why you're here. Yeah. So there is. And that's a truth. You know, there is a delicate place. You do. It's not like you don't have an ego all of a sudden. That is not real. Yeah. It's a matter, first of all, the basic thing. And one would say the most transforming thing is you no longer are interacting with it with attachment, preferences or attachment. OK, that's what a name, Karoli Baba is, he's no longer act. So, OK, that's that's all. That's a big shot. Of course, La Masuria does would say, no, that's enlightenment now. And we're here now. That's a reality. OK. You know, that's a non dual jump for me. But but the truth is that impulse is really who we are. And once you start having that intention, that's a day to day practice. And you see your motivations for selfishness. Yeah. On a moment to moment basis. And really, there's nothing to do with, wow, that's far out. Great. Yeah. Look at that thought. That's amazing. I mean, I'm like, you know, on a day to day basis, again, in the movie, Jamie says, because Ramdas talks about I see everything, everything going through me through Maharaj's third eye or through his being. Right. I see. And then when I go left of center, I hear this. You know, and Jamie said, yeah, well, my Maharaj, she's more like a psychiatric nurse dealing with a sex maniac. And, you know, this and that and the other. So there's a fine line between, no, you are not. Ego is there and it's useful. We cannot operate without it. Well, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine about preference. And because I've been on a real mental preference kick, I've been thinking about it a lot. That for the line of that third patriarch was in the first line in it. Just I read it once. It totally went over my head. I'm like, whatever, just some Buddhist shit. Then went back and was like, oh, wow. This is something you have to think about for you. You can chew on. You can. This is a doggy toy that your mind can chew on for your whole life. Which is great ways. Easy for he who holds no preference. And so I'm talking to my friend about this specifically preference. And you know, this is a favorite thing of Ramdas is to the third Zen third Zen page. I got it from one of the retreats. Oh, you did. And I have an album of him reading it. But the great ways easy for he holds no preference. My so we're talking about this because I had to create this insane thing happen. I think it was because I took like really strong marijuana drops before I went to bed. But I woke up in the morning and for a second, I can't. It's so weird to say it. It's hard to explain, but it was like I was laying underneath my preferences for a second. There was no preference. There was no it was the best. It was like being able to fly or something because it's like I am absolutely fine. Right here. It was and then there I am back into myself. Do you have any more of that tincture? Yes, I do. When this is over, I'll have some. OK. OK, but the. My friend said. And it's a really a astute and. Smart point to make. And I was hoping you could address it because I think when people hear this stuff, becoming nobody, they really think, fuck that, man, I want to be somebody. But my friend said, if I have no preference, then I am nothing. I become nothing. If I have no preference, then I'm just what am I a sponge? What would I become at that point? You know, and I understood what he meant by that, you know, from one POV. It almost sounds like you would be a vegetable or you would be like a unionist, artless, culturalist thing. Just some sort of blob. You'd be like Peter Sellers in Being There. Is that the name of the movie? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right. He was just whatever would in the moment needed by anybody else. Yes, he would be like that. OK, here's the answer. The answer. Let's hear it. Bullshit, but. It reminds me of a friend of mine who lives in Maui and works with Ramdas. We had a retreat at that retreat. You were there. Maybe you weren't there. No, it was last the last December retreat. It was the baby. There was the baby deal. Yeah, Joseph Goldstein and Jack and Sharon. Yeah. So anyhow, after the retreat, my friend, Matthew was driving him around. He didn't have a car. And so he thought, wow, OK, Joseph, one of the wisest people we know. He goes, I got to ask him a question. Joseph, if there's one thing, one piece of advice, you could give someone like me, a young person on the path. What would it be? And Joseph turned to him, looked them in the eye and went. Stop clinging. Hmm. OK. And that's the answer to that question of if I have no preferences, it has nothing to do with the preferences. It is to do with the clinging to the preferences. OK, you we have preferences all day long. It doesn't matter. It's just the attachment. Oh, that's good. Yeah, because the preference. OK, yeah, preference is the impulse. Clinging is the reaction. Is that what it is? Clinging is preferences, preferences. OK, I mean, the most simplistic way. This, whatever it may be, is going to be unpleasant. So I don't want to engage. I'm not going to engage with that over here, though, is going to be real pleasant. I want to engage over there. So it's not so much what you do either way. It's more the clinging, the interactive clinging with that thing. Right. OK. If you choose and you and then you choose the, for instance, if you choose the more desirable, whatever it is, then you find out very quickly. Holy shit, this is empty as poop. You know, what? Oh, why did I go? You just told me a story like that about an hour and a half ago. Yeah. Right. You went into something and it was like, now it happens all the time. Even the even the thing is no matter what, that's there. Yeah. That sense of discomfort or yeah. Fundamental with the thing or with the thing you were avoiding. Turns out to be it wasn't that bad or whatever. Yeah. Yeah. So eventually the the impulse of clinging gets cut right away. Yes. And so yes, it doesn't. You're you're not you're open to whatever happens in the moment and more of the right thing, the right action takes place at that time. I have always thought that the shit you hear about people being able to levitate. This is what they're talking about because. Preference and clinging. It there's this gravitational field to preference. It I don't I don't think many people realize just how painful preference can be. How incredibly uncomfortable a person's day is because they have so many preferences in their shoe, so to speak. They're walking around with like a never ending. List of what's going on around them that is bad. Yeah, bad or good. You're also good. It's just that alone. That's a lot of brain energy processing all that bullshit. But then on top of that, you start desperately trying to rearrange phenomena and just to try to get it in just the right pattern. And then when you finally rearrange the phenomena, 10 years have passed. I don't know, 15 years have passed. You know what I mean, you get the phenomenon perfectly arranged. Sorry about that. You ought to put Fox out. I was petting him and he yipped at me. You you get things you get things perfectly arranged. You've got your 401k. You the horses are being taken care of now. You've got the thing and you fix the thing and now are this and you're doing it. And then you just die. And the whole time you've been waiting for this beautiful moment of preference alignment where you're like, OK, wait. Now, the people with the horses and the thing, they're not waiting for anything. I mean, you went way over to a place where unfortunately, what were many people, of course, aren't conscious preferences don't make any sense at all preference or no preference. We're not there. OK, we're chasing happiness and that's what we're doing. OK, when you get super unhappy at some point, chasing that shit is OK. There's something else. There's got to be something else. OK, so we're already talking about you've made a turn and you're realizing that you might want to be better aligned with some other part of yourself, not this thing that's chasing bullshit all the time. So but back to preferences in the highest state of an enlightened person being there's no preferences. OK, we are looking. I mean, you mean there's no clinging or there's no preference. No, there's no clinging and there's completely no clinging. So there's no even going one way or another. There's only here and now. Yeah, right. OK, there's no projection. There's no fear. Oh, that thing. I don't want to go there. Oh, I want to go there. There's none of that going on. That's the highest level for the Ram Dass set of thing in the movie that I really have been thinking about is super interesting, which is. You begin to realize that when you don't get what you want, it's good. It's when you get what you want that. And this is the concept, I think, of Samsara and Nirvana being wrapped up together or that no matter where you're landing, if you really are in that place, you'll notice that it seems to be an ecstatic quality to every single moment, regardless of whether you're your needs or your preferences are being met. And that completely decimates the game because the game is to get your preferences met. That's the whole game. And if suddenly not getting your preferences met creates almost equal sense of delight. Well, that's where the yes, that's that's all great and true. But what I got from that when he says, you know, sometimes when you don't get what you want is way better than, you know, getting what you want. Now, I got the feeling from it because I've also heard stories of him getting his tooth, his cat getting like. I heard him talk about getting some kind of having dental work done without numbing it because he was into this. He was like experiencing pain. Oh, he was exploring pain. Yeah, right. He was like getting into like this is for me. That's I'm no I'm not doing that ever. But this is like the cold shower thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's just say, yeah, it's the same kind of thing. But I'm saying what I get out of that is part of it's it becomes part not getting what you want. You suddenly have a perspective. You are now working on, as we said, we've turned the corner. We're working on a different from a different vantage point that we are going to not believe our thoughts and our stories and our eye and the little me that we have experienced. Maybe it's who psychedelics. Maybe it's through just an intuition, whatever it is. There's something else going on. Yeah. OK. And we want to be aligned more with that something else because we don't even know what the hell that is. Yeah. So in so doing, we get with teachers like Ramdas, this movie, what it represents. Yeah. And we start to understand, OK, there's an actual methodology to this. We can do something for ourselves, at least little humans. We think we can. But and we do, which is OK. There is I'm going to identify through breath in the center of my chest. I'm going to move out of my head and just breathe in and focus in the center of my chest, take three breaths and immediately you feel something, a little warm, something and you just feel bigger and more spacious. And from that place. You look at the stuff that you know, sometimes when I don't get what I want is way better because you start to see all of the places where we're stuck in the preferences and the clinging and so on. But you're seeing it from a place where you're not bashing yourself of the head because I'm a shithead. You know, all I want to do is go, you know, smoke pot all day. And no, I don't want to take that ride around the block, you know, whatever. Yeah. So that's the big thing is the turn to start. OK, there is a way to identify with something other than this bullshit I've been living with. Yeah, this isn't like you're building an imaginary place. This is you finding the place where your soul resides or your heart or whatever you want to call it. I get it. Yeah, I get that because if you try to. Do the other way, which is to look at the mind with the perspective of the mind. Yeah, it's difficult. Yeah, the Gyan yoga, you know, it is a yoga using the mind to transcend the mind. Yeah, very difficult in what we are supposed to be in now, called the Kali Yuga, the age of destruction. Yeah, no destruction going on now. Let's deny that. Yeah. Yeah. So we seem to be there. And then they, you know, the Easter, you know, the Hindu thing in India, they basically say the way in these kinds of times is through the heart, through heart wisdom, not through Gyan, not through the intellect. So and, you know, we love, by the way, in this in the West, we love the mind and the intellect is our master. Look what it's done for us. Look at the way we communicate now digitally and look, you know, gone into space. I mean, we are incredible, but we're missing that one ingredient because there's fear, because opening the heart, certainly you're open a can of worms. Right. Yeah. Time because it's so powerful. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Well, and it's so like if you it sounds like a cheesy thing to say, but the heart has such wisdom and is so the heart is instantaneously. Brilliant. It doesn't have to squeeze its brow. It that place you're talking about, it just is the way it's responding to everything. It's perfect. It can't really fuck up that little exercise. We just take three breaths into the center of your chest and rest your consciousness there and then suddenly, no matter what, even in the midst of this podcast, you know, I felt myself. Me too. This is just an expansion of some sort, you know, little opening spacious. Those are words that I would use. You it's available all the time. And then you start, wow, that's real. Wow. I'm going to trust that a little bit. Maybe I'll go there more. And then on a day to day basis, you do that. And that goes back to the very beginning when you were talking about. Just connecting with more than my, you know, the gym story, right? I'm going to connect with more than just my little self in this moment. You know, and that gives you an ability to do that. How come you just told me about that? How long have I known you? I'm always like, well, what do I? Yeah, I've always asking you for some technique. And never asked me. No, you went off with David Nectar and doing the Buddha stuff. You're doing fine. But you've never did that. Just breathe into your heart three times. What do you think Ram does has been doing all these years with this loving awareness stuff? Come on, Ragu, thank you so much. Congratulations on the movie. Where can people see it? Oh, the movie. OK, so if you go to it's becoming nobody. And if you go to becomingnobody.com, right, you will be able to see the trailer. All we have some incredible press actually today as we're speaking. New York Times story on Ramdas in the magazine section. So that's really cool. It says, by the way, the title is Ramdas is ready to die. What? So I'm talking to him yesterday on the phone, right? On Skype, actually, we skyped yesterday. And I said, yeah, the movie is great. Everybody's happy to see it. He says, and I said, great and wonderful stories in the Times and the LA Times. He goes, yeah, I hear I'm dead. I said, well, that's true. But he said, I guess I'll have to stay alive a little bit longer to prove that. So, yeah, and becomingnobody.com. So you can see all that press and you can see the trailer. But the best thing is you can actually find a theater because it's not opening like it's Star Wars, right? But it's opening, you know, it'll be in about 50 theaters, you know, 30 odd, five cities, something like that, as we go through the end of 2019. And you'll be able to find a theater. If you can't find a theater, then what we're doing is whoever wants to bring it into their community, there's a way to do that. So you go to becomingnobody.com and you go to info or info at Ramdas.org. Just send a note of your inch. Actually, when you sign up on becomingnobody.com, you can put a place that says, check, I'm interested in bringing this to my community. And that's a big thing about what we want to do as we go into the future with this is get it into educational colleges and high schools and all that. And because it's really great as it gives a wonderful the idea that you can change your perspective from from the me, me, somebody. I got a cling to that thing into somebody that gives a shit about other people is doing some service. And it's like that time that you went down to in LA, right? You bought a bunch of food. You remember that story? The very psychedelic. Because I'd seen a YouTube clip of these people saying, just get backpacks and film with stuff that you would want if you were not living along the streets. And so you get your put them on the trunk of your car and you're driving. And then but you're thinking, like, all right, I'm going to give these away. And that is the you enter into a different dimension. It's almost like the circuitry. It's almost like you're running different energy through your body or something. Like everything changes. Everything becomes dreamlike and magical because most of the time. We are serving ourselves. We're driving to go get food. We're driving to get money to get more food. We're driving to get food. We're driving to get weed. We're going to go running. But the moment you really are truly purely doing and it's bad and something about doing it for people you'll you don't know. Adds an extra level of weirdness. If your whole life has been running this one program, it really fucks with the simulator. Yeah, the simulator that you've been if the character you're playing is selfish. Yeah. So it's cool. Yeah. And it is real and it's a beautiful thing. I think it is a probably a big relief for some people to get this like intuition that there is a possibility of not forever being a blistered, chafed ass. And I say that from my heart. Yeah. Yeah. And at the same time, the moment that you conceive of, I'm going to get with some people and we're going to go feed some people down, you know, in the poor parts of the city and so on. And then you actually start to do it. And then every moment you're quite aware of your self interest in the I'm yes, I'm a good guy. And yeah, so it's beautiful. That's where, you know, you get to see unvarnished your real motivations. And and the only thing that's necessary in the moment that you see all that, it's not necessary to go, you are a shithead. OK, which is what we all do. It's laugh. Yeah. Wow. Look at that. That's interesting. How does the mind? How does that come in? Where the what is that? You know, yeah, like you you're carrying the backpack in your mind. You're having a fantasy of being like the Gandhi of L.A. or something. You're like, oh, my God, I hope. But hold the glory. Your mind's spitting out shit like, oh, maybe this will be one of those things when secretly films on their phone and then people will see you doing a good act or people see. Yeah. The mind is, yeah, it's because that's the way it reacts to the world. Yeah. And some people don't want to do good shit because they've so overanalyzed themselves that they've realized the only reason I'd be doing that is because I want to seem good. Right. And then in the moment, and that's, you know, and that's all. That's still somebody who is believes in their thoughts. OK, that's who I am. I'm that shithead who would only be doing this because it would, you know, I have a lot of money and it substantiates. OK, I feel a little bit better. That's the only reason I'm doing it. But in the reality of it is that when you actually do it and in the act of doing it, especially once you're interacting with another human being, that goes out the window. You are not that you are not you are not the self serving, blah, blah, blah. You are somebody that gives a shit because we all do. Yeah. And also when you're giving food to a hungry person. At least it didn't happen to me. They're not like, I want to take this. Food is backpack filled with things I need right now. But what's your motivation here? Are you doing this out of pure selflessness? And if you're not, then go and come back and give it to me when you're selfless. And people just need help. Yeah. And that's the bottom line. That's the bottom line. Yeah. Yeah. Well, thank you, Roger. Yeah. Becomingnobody.com. Go there. And we are all trying to become less of that little me. And that's really what this is about.

78^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - JACK CAROLL Transcript and Discussion^2014-09-04^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello, dear friends. It is I, Duncan Tressel, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast, and I have just returned from the Southern Glory Tour. What does that mean? It means that my mind looks like a phosphorescent jellyfish that you might find on the beach of some alien world. 98% of my blood right now is a combination of hashish, Adderall, and booze. My neurons are not firing correctly, and for the last two days, I've been trying to record this opening with no success at all. Everything comes out blabbery or weird or sentimental or strange, so I am giving up. This is it. Whatever comes out at this very moment is the thing that I'm going to upload, Stammers, and Us, and Oz, and all, because I just have got to get out of Los Angeles and go up to the desert to a steam room where I can remove all of the toxins that are now soaking in my body. I wish there was some kind of flesh vat-style water filter where I could melt myself down and be reprocessed for removing all the toxins, the Fukushima-level waste that must have accumulated in my body from this glorious, celebratory, Dionysian, amazing tour. We're gonna get going with this podcast, but first, I do want to thank all of you who came out to the shows. Thank you so much for coming and saying hello to me, and thank you so much for helping me sell out an entire tour. That's wild, and even though my body is a kind of thick, dark, hell sludge right now, I still feel as though I must be existing in some kind of paradise universe, and that's 100% because of you. So thank you guys so much. I'm going on tour again at the end of the month if you're interested in checking out a live Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. Not stand up, I'm gonna be in San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and Vancouver from the 30th to the fourth, and then on the fifth, I will be doing stand up in Calgary. So come out to those shows and get tickets in advance because this last tour, all the shows sold out, which was amazing, but somehow in one of the shows, in the very front row, there were six fundamentalist conservative Christian ladies wearing golden sparkly spangles and crucifixes on their necks, and they were looking at me as I performed as though I were making love to the carcass of a goat. That's how offended they were. I would much rather have had in that front row fans of the podcast than angry, wasp-like, pseudo-Christian women who stayed through the entire show for no reason at all. Maybe they were paralyzed by hate and fear. I don't know. I thought to myself, though, if only people had gotten tickets in advance, these monstrous witches would have been squirming around whatever placental, judgmental pools of doom they emerged from instead of sitting in the front row of a comedy show. Today's guest is Jack Carroll. You've probably seen him on Britain's Got Talent. He is a 15-year-old comedic prodigy whose very existence flies in the face of the antiquated and stupid idea that I've always had that you have to spend at least 13 years sludging through hell if you wanna become a hilarious comedian. I don't know what he is. Maybe he's an indigo kid, a lavender child. Maybe he's one of those hyper-dimensional beings that has incarnated in a human body to enjoy the singularity. I don't know. Maybe he's the architect of creation itself, disguising himself as a 15-year-old comedian. Here's what I do know. He came over to my house wearing a Bob Dylan T-shirt, and when he was wearing headphones and had an Oculus Rift on, his mother told me that he wore that shirt because he knew that I hated Bob Dylan. And at that moment, I realized that I would be friends with Jack Carroll for the rest of my life. Or at least I hope so. I'm glad he's here. We're gonna get going with the podcast for some very quick business. We're sponsored by amazon.com. There is a portal located at dunkintrustle.com.

If you go to audibletrial.com, forward slash family hour and sign up for a trial membership, you'll get a free audio book. And I would like to recommend an audio book that is currently rocking my subjective world. It's called Spiritual Liberation by Michael Beckwith. It really is a life changer. I can't tell you how much it's been helping me. You know, I forgot how amazing Michael Beckwith was at articulating positivity in a way that doesn't sound preachy or weird, but actually is insanely uplifting. He's like, I don't know, he's like a Sonic Prozac. If you're a little gloomy and the dumps feel confined or trapped or if you feel like you've sort of lost your way when it comes to wandering through this world with a smile on your face, this guy really knows how to tune you back in to the idea that we live in an abundant, prosperous, beautiful universe where we are always and constantly and completely surrounded by love. He's really good at it. So check it out. You can get the book for free if you go to audibletrial.com, forward slash family hour, sign up for a trial membership. If you don't want to continue on with Audible, you can cancel and those sweeties let you keep the book, which is super nice, you book thief. All right, today's guest, Jack Carroll. You've seen him on Britain's Got Talent. I'm gonna have links located at dunkintrussell.com so you could see his stand up. Everybody please at this very moment, squeeze as much endogenous DMT as you have in your pineal gland out and into the metaverse so that Jack Carroll can experience what it's like to be embraced and held by multi-dimensional, multi-armed, super intelligent love entities. Now, welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast, Jack Carroll. Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. It's the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. Howdy, Krishna, Jack Carroll. Welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. How wonderful that you have trekked all the way across the ocean to come to Los Angeles just to do my podcast. Yeah, that is one of the sort of few reasons why I'm sort of very glad to be here. It's a good feeling, man. Because I'm terrified of the flying, so it's actually nice to have landed and to have my feet back on the ground. Is this your first time in Los Angeles? No, I was here last year for the, there was like a YouTube comedy thing that I went to, so yeah. But I am, it's good, it's really, the thing is with LA, it's sort of, when I come here as a comedian from the UK, the sort of circuit seems a lot bigger, like you can travel in a 22 mile radius and do 40 clubs or whatever. Right. In the UK? No, in LA. What's it like in the UK? What's the stand-up situation there? Well, I don't know, maybe I'm not the best to assess it because I have to balance the amount of gigs that I do with school and other stuff like that. Right, yeah. It's just, there's a comedy store in Manchester, which is in the north, and then a comedy store in London. And then there's a lot of, I think bar shows, would you call them out here? Yeah, bar shows. But yeah, and then there's a few clubs around, but yeah, it's fun. Yeah, well, yeah, that's one of the fascinating things about stand-up comedy is that it produces a community around it, an inevitable community in its own interesting politics, and there's always this pressing need to get stage time and figuring out ways to get on stage. Yeah, it's a strange thing because the sort of, the thing is with it that, as you said, there is a community and it's sort of off from everybody else, and you sort of, there's an idea that the sort of personalities that people are projecting on the stage, and then when they get backstage, you know, it's a strange dynamic between what a comic is on stage and then what is off stage, and whether you're happy with what your persona is on the stage, can then bleed into your actual life, so that, you know, maybe you're not being the most authentic. But you're talking about the persona versus the person and that strange tension that can exist between those two entities and the odd sort of schizophrenia that can happen to a comedian where you have this thing on stage, which is whatever it is, either a completely dark, depressed, miserable, existentially horrified sort of Bill Hicks, Mark Marin kind of like grumpy, yet cutting the very like, cutting against the fabric of society, George Carlin is in that camp, and then you've got on the other side of that the kind of upbeat, happy, just silly party comics. Like Dane Cook, maybe, or I don't know in the UK, or maybe like, there's a bunch of comics that have a more kind of buoyant persona, or Robin Williams, for that matter. Well, that is just, that sort of has, that just goes to show that, and I know it's a sort of cliche to say, oh, you know, look at how eccentric and crazy he was on the stage, and then obviously he was feeling a deep sense of pain inside, but at the end of the day, it's just sad for, not even for him as a comic, but it's just sad that, you know, that all that creativity, like I've got the sense now, maybe it'll go away after, you know, the news has managed to settle in for a few days, but that sort of creativity has gone a little bit with him, you know, that idea of, oh well, we'll never get anything new from Robin again. Well, you know, Ben, that is, I love to think that a comedian, an artist, an inspired person, or anybody who's putting something creative into the world is tuning in to a frequency that is accessible to everyone, and that the thing that we call talent is more a person's ability to tune in, how closely you can tune into that frequency, and less a kind of genetic aberration that happens in a person's mind, or a sort of, because if you start buying into the idea of talent as a genetic thing, or talent as the end result of a series of good or bad events that happened in your life, then a lot of people give up trying to tune into that frequency, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, well, that's the thing, because I'm reading that, well, I just read the first few pages of it recently, you know, the War of Art. Yes, Pressfield. Well, that sort of fills me with a sense of, oh, you know, at least I know I've got something that I'm decent at, that I can do well. Yes. But then also, I also like painting and drawing and all that sort of thing, which I'm not very good at. And the notion that's presented in that book is, well, you either good at it, or you've either got that spark, or you haven't. Which, as I've said on the one hand, fills me with the great, oh, you know, I'm going to go right now, I've got to do this, this is why I'm here. But then also, oh, I may as well just give up the pen and all the other stuff that I'm not very proficient at. And that's such an easy thing to do, because, you know, so much of what, you know, you read, like, so much of what's wonderful about a developed artist is that what they do seems simple. So you read Stephen King, for example, and his effortless writing style, and his incredible, like, dialogue, it just seems so simple. You read it and you think, come on, anyone could do this, I could sit down and do that. And then you sit down and try to do it, and suddenly you find that you're, it's like going uphill with a backpack filled with weights. And that's the learning curve, you're experiencing the learning curve. So I love to believe that it's more a matter of, it's more a matter of focus and discipline than it is a matter of genetics, because I don't want you to give up on writing. You're somebody who should continue to work on writing until your fingers bleed. Because once you get up that hill, suddenly you realize that you had to get up the hill to get to the place where you have effortless creative flow. Well, I think this is the thing as well, because I think it is a mix of both life events and then having been able to create the skills necessary to tap into whatever that creative field is. So, like, I grew up watching a lot of comedy, and that's what got me into it, and I thought, oh, I would like to do that. Whereas, I think- How old were you when you realized you wanted to do comedy? I think about seven. And how old are you now? Fifty. How old have you been working on stand-up? Eleven, I started doing stand-up. So at seven you realized, I think I want to try my hand at comedy? Yeah. I didn't know in what form that was, but I knew that that's something. Because I had a sort of major operation on my spine to sort of help me walk. When I was seven, I was laid up in the hospital for a while. And that was- the spine condition is part of- It draws in the umbrella of having- Yeah, it's not to do- I haven't got a condition with my spine, but what my cerebral palsy was was my brain sending the wrong signals to my sort of legs. So they needed to go in through the spine and cut those nerves away for me to then, you know, retrain the pathways or whatever. I don't know. How old were you when you had that surgery? Seven. Seven. Yeah. So I was laid up for a while, and have you ever seen Alan Partridge? Yes, I have. I got a DVD of that off my cousin, and I watched that a lot. And like, then a few other things, and I thought, oh yeah, that's sort of good. I'd like to do that. And so then you- how did you- what was your first stage experience? How did you get on stage for the first time? So what happened is, my parents had this sort of silver wedding anniversary, which I don't know how many years that is married, but they had this big sort of thing, big sort of party for it. Yes. And I thought, oh, you know, I'd like to maybe perform at it. So I just started writing, like, some jokes with my cousin who's older than me, but he went to university to do script writing and create writing and that. So I thought, he'd be good to get along. You know, I've always had a bath with him. So I wrote this little set, and my uncle filmed it and put it on YouTube. So this is a thing- the internet seems to have been a big part of what has happened to me to be able to shape what I'm doing now. Right. Like, because of the internet, I'm able to, you know, be speaking to you and lots of other people. Yeah, the internet's done the same thing for me, because the internet I'm able to be speaking to you. I got followed by, do you know Riddick Boe, the champion heavyweight boxer today? I got followed by him, and he sent me a direct message saying, who are you? And then full stop, and then his last name, which was Boe. So he just said, who are you, Boe? Which really freaked me out about half-eight this morning, but yeah. So it's strange how everything sort of seems to be, if you apply significance to it, then everything sort of seems to become, oh, this is, you know, this is what the path has been, and this is what magic is. Well, yeah, I mean, yes, I think that magic is a wonderful way to describe that experience of suddenly being caught up in an updraft that you never possibly imagine could happen to you in your life where certain events coincide in just the right way, and you are able to surf the wave of circumstance that you find yourself in in such an instinctual way that suddenly you look around at your life and you realize that you are experiencing a really beautiful and incredible thing. But let's talk a little bit about your path. You performed at your folks' silver anniversary, and then this video goes up on YouTube, and then what happens? So then I do the local news, you know, around where I live in England, and then, so I do that, and then I can't really remember what happened after that. I did some sort of regional, so I don't know what the best example would be to make it applicable to you, but sort of regional award where they give out stuff for courageous people. Right. So I don't know how that happened, because I'm actually quite cowardly and mean and vindictive. Trust me, every human being is, and no hero ever says, like, whenever heroes ever get awards or courageous people ever get awards, their reaction is always just what you're saying right now, which is like, I really don't understand this. My heart is a nest of snakes, but when you never hear heroes being like, I deserve this, you're right, I'm a hero. Yeah. Well, I think that they can't say that, that's why. They can't be like, oh yeah, I'm so noble, and every, you know, if they did that, then people would go, oh, we're going to take the award back. We're taking it back, you've got to deny that you're a hero to be a hero. You've got an ego on you, we can't have that. You know, it's sort of, you know, also it's an important to note that when you are being self-deprecating, that is another form of egoism. It's a curious thing, isn't it? Yeah. You're really just falling on one side or the other side of egoism, either you decide to fall on the side, we're like, yeah, I deserve this, I am doing stand-up comedy, I have cerebral palsy, I'm funny, I'm incredibly funny, and I'm a brilliant kid. I deserve this award. Of course you should give me a award, because I'm sure I'm going to inspire a ton of people by what I've done, or you fall on the other side of it, which is like, I'm a vindictive, angry person. Yeah, I've always had that train of thought rather than me doing it. That's why you're a comic. Yep. Just sort of sailing the waves of manuroses for other sort of, but then again, I want to say I'm a very self-absorbed comic, I'm a very self-absorbed person, but not... Well, I don't know, because like, that's what the flight of, you know, because I've got a fear of flying and that, and I thought, what is it about the flight that makes me scared, apart from the flying 30,000 feet up in the air or whatever, and I know it's very safe, but if anything does go wrong, then you haven't got a very good chance. No. I thought, what is it that's bringing about this? And then I thought, oh, what's happening is, I'm listening out for the noises, thinking that I could fly the plane, if I got the chance. Whereas what I should be doing is submitting to the, well, you know, I've got no control over this, if everyone else, that's their job, they're good at it, so just enjoy the time that you are on here and submit to the fear or whatever you're feeling. Yes. Just let go of it. So while you were on the plane, you were enlightened. It sounds like you figured out the secret of all life. As Timothy Leary says, lift up your legs and float downstream. Yeah. That's all you can do. Yeah. All you can do really. Yeah. And this is the verse in the Bhagavad Gita that I have quoted so many times, which is, you have a right to your action. You do not have the right to the fruits of your action, which means that it's inviting you to exist solely in the present moment as this being that's either a neurotic, fear-consumed person, whatever. Psychic weather happens to be afflicting you as a being recognizing their innate talent and incredible qualities or is somewhere in between. That's all you've, that's really all you can do. You're not going to fly the plane. Yeah, you know, and that, you see, that's the weird thing. So I thought, well, it's attachment and not being able to submit to it. You cannot control the situation. So how is that applicable to other areas of what I'm experiencing? So it's just, I finally understood the meaning of, not attachment is bad, but just let go of attachment. You know, that had always been a sort of abstract concept of someone like Maharaj, you've got any computer screen living on the road in, you know, in a big blanket and sort of just waiting for people to come by. But what that actually means to me now is let go of the attachment of what you believe is going to happen and know that you cannot know. Yeah. And wow, the moment, those little moments when you do that, those little moments when you achieve that state of consciousness, it's as though you're in a completely different world. You're in this beautiful, incredible, it's, I mean, for lack of a better word, it's paradise. And in those moments when you're not resisting, and then of course the resistance comes in and you find yourself raging against the machine and listening for every creak and strange sound in your own life, whether it's the way people, a strange look a person gave you who you thought was your friend or whether it's a medical condition or whether it's a worry over future medical conditions. And then suddenly you're not here anymore and you're just completely focused on the mind, on the self. I've come up with a very good metaphor now, where you guys come into overdrive going all sort of, oh, well done for the playing thing, you did really good. That's impressed Duncan, well done. Yeah, no, it's strange, man, so do you want to get back to what happened on the road to the thing? Oh yes, yes, let's keep, yeah. Is that not very organic? Well, no, you know, with this podcast, and with most podcasts, what's so beautiful about it is you can take any kind of tributary you want in any direction you want, and you'll always end up getting to the right place, I've found, so however it comes out, it comes out. But yeah, please, I would love to hear more about how it all went down. Yeah, so I did this regional thing, and I don't usually like talking about it, so why I came back to it, I don't really know, but I did this regional thing, this regional courage, and then there's a thing on in Britain every year called the Pride of Britain Awards, where we get all these sort of courageous people to go and accept these awards. And from that thing, from the regional one, they asked me to go and get one, which was weird because I was surrounded by the greatest human beings ever. And then there was me, and it was people dying and completing their wishes and giving inspiration to people, and then I come up and go, you know, I'm sort of funny in that a bit, you know, we just sort of, it's a very strange thing that I don't know how other people perceive me, but I would never perceive myself in that way, and I don't think most of the people around me would either. Really? Yeah, I just, I think maybe it's from... Let me explain something to you, friend. At this very moment, all over this beautiful planet that we happen to have incarnated on, this gravity well that we're stuck inside of it, this very moment, all over the planet, are countless human beings who are petrified by fear. They are in the entire spectrum of psychological and physical conditions from people who have been obliterated by a bomb, an IED in Afghanistan, who can no longer walk or move, to people who are trust fund children, who have an infinite amount of money in their bank account, a fleet of yachts, a perfect body because they can afford a trainer, and yet inside they are petrified by fear, and they are desperately, desperately resisting actualizing themselves as a human being and putting themselves out there and doing anything of any import because they've allowed themselves to be completely consumed and trapped in the horrible prison of fear. And you are a person who has in the midst of a medical condition that they call cerebral palsy. I can barely even pronounce the damn thing. You're somebody who has not allowed that to hold you back and you are pursuing a profession that is one of the most difficult professions out there. You're not getting on stage and talking, but the problem with so many lawyers, doctors, attorneys, all of these things, at least you know there's kind of a career path you can follow. With the stand-up comic, there's no certainty in anything. There's no, like, here's how you do it. It's just a random roll of the dice and on top of that, one of the great fears all human beings possess is getting on stage and talking to people. So when you say you're not a hero or you don't perceive yourself as a hero, I think, or you don't perceive yourself as someone who deserves, who is inspiring other people, I beg to differ. Sir, I beg to differ because anytime a person overcomes anything, whatever it is, whether it's addiction, whether it's socioeconomic conditions, whether it's familial conditions, whatever it is, anytime anyone manages to pull themselves out of whatever the mire is that they've happened to be trapped in and succeed and do that publicly, what they do for the world is such a beautiful thing because people see that and they think, oh, I could do that too. Ah, thank you, man. That's wonderful. But the fit, and I really mean that, cheers for that. Cheers. It's given a nice, it's fed my ego nicely. So basically what that says to me is the thing is with me, I've not known anything different than this. Right. So I don't know how it would be for someone who had had the legs blown off at war to then have to, you know, from being leading that sort of lifestyle of being able to do all that stuff to then come back and not have the ability to move around properly or whatever. The only thing is, I've not known anything different. Right. So what this is to me is life, really. Oh, listen, man, I'm not going to keep arm wrestling here about how awesome you are. You're going to, you know, you're going to, here's the thing. This is one thing that I like to do when I'm being really hard on myself or if I have a friend who's being particularly hard on themselves. One thing I like to do is I say to them, imagine if I took the part of yourself that's demeaning you right now and put it in another body. And so that person was saying the very same things you're saying about yourself to you. You would be like, what an asshole. You'd be like, that guy is a jerk. Or if I weren't, if I wasn't talking to you right now, I was talking to one of my friends and he knew about you and he knew about this podcast. He's like, well, you know, Duncan, I saw that award ceremony and I saw him stand, I saw him standing there among those heroes and I thought to myself, he doesn't belong there. I would be like, you're a dick. He's awesome. He totally belongs there. But isn't that a funny thing that somehow, if that person is inside of us, it's totally permissible. Yet if that person is exteriorized in another form, you would never let someone say those things. Yeah, but that's the thing you said about, it's just a different type of egoism. That is, you know, you can never exist in a harmonized, or very rarely exist in a harmonized state. I think there's a harmonized state that you can exist in, and it is a rare state. And the harmonized state is the state of loving yourself. Or if you can't love yourself, making the attempt to love yourself, including loving the part of yourself that is this neurotic thing that feels like it needs to constantly remind you that you don't deserve any of the success that you might be experiencing and that where you're at is a kind of random fluke and that the whole thing's, you know, whatever, just a basic lottery win that you don't deserve at all. That part of your ego and all other parts of your ego, including the other side of it, which most comedians sadly don't exhibit, which is the one that you would constantly be patting yourself on the back and thinking, you really are the greatest thing in the world. These things can be harmonized by loving both of them as they emerge into the mind. So when you find yourself indulging, as if you're, I rarely do, but from time to time, if I find myself indulging in really thinking, man, you're doing great. Or if I find myself indulging in, God, you are a total despicable fraud. If I find any of those parts of my ego emerging to the surface, I either let myself get hypnotized by whatever the specific feeling tone is they're trying to lure me into and I spend the next few hours either in a narcissistic haze or a depressed haze or I watch it emerge and as Jack Cornfield says, we bow to it, invite it in for tea, and then bid it on its way. It's very nice to meet you, oh angry part of myself that despises myself. There you are again, hi, hi, give it a nice hug and send it on its way and it'll come and go, because that's not really who you are. No, and I think the sort of narcissistic tendencies of the ego display themselves in other things with me. So I'll sort of go, oh, you know, I did a good painting, I wrote a good joke, whatever, and then I'll go down stairs and sort of show it to people or whatever and they'll get, and I'll go, oh, in that good, and then they will appreciate it as much as I think they should. And then I'll go, oh, right, fair enough, I'm going back up now and I won't speak to you for another two hours. That's hilarious. First of all, I would recommend never, ever, anytime I write a joke and share it with people that aren't in an audience, I think that's a really dangerous thing to do because what can happen is when you do that, you're coming across a person who, who knows, maybe they were just looking at pictures of beheaded children on the internet, you know, maybe they just found out, who knows what moods mind state they're in, but they're definitely not in a state where they want to see a comedy show and having somebody run a joke by you is very similar to somebody running a dream by you. You're just sort of like, all right, there we go, great. So, because they're not in that position, so you might have a great joke and you're using them as the gauge for whether it's got legs or not and then the joke dies by the wayside when it could have been something really fantastic. Yeah, so I wouldn't do that anymore. Yeah, well, that's a straight, I've got a story about. So, I did a joke on, I don't know whether it was the final semi of the talent show thing, but I did this joke which was equating Simon Cowell to Kim Jong-un or whatever. Right, yes. So, I did the joke in the living room of a relative and it went dead and I thought, but I've written a really good joke. So, I did it and then, you know, it worked really well. So, the thing is you can, there seems to already be an advantage when there's an audience that have come out specifically to see comedy because they're already willing to submit, if you know what I mean, to the experience again of, you know, they're ready to go, okay, Mecca's laugh and we will laugh. Right, yeah, exactly. Yeah, exactly. The condition is there for you to make people laugh. Yeah. Whereas like God, like, you know, running jokes by, like so many, I can remember running in the early days, I'd like make the treacherous mistake of trying to run jokes by my mom. It would be better to like try to make an anaconda laugh or something because she didn't necessarily want me to be a comedian. So, it's like, even if she thought it was funny, which by the way, when I first started comedy, I was nowhere near as funny as you are. And, but, so I'm sure my jokes were real rotten eggs anyway, but any kind of like running a joke by my mom was like just an affirmation that her son was on the most wrong path the person could possibly be on. So, yeah, from that I learned that it's better to just run the jokes by a crowd. Now, speaking of parents, it seems like your parents are incredibly supportive and are behind you in this pursuit. They're great, they're really good. I'm very lucky to have the people that, you know, I do have around me and, you know, some people aren't that lucky and they suppress the creativity or whatever, you know, the person feels drawn to. But, yeah, I just, they're great, man. You know, I love them a lot and they're brilliant. What do you think is the greatest impediment for you right now when it comes to growing as a comedian? I don't know. I would say maybe just you've got to keep getting up, haven't you? And, you know, I've got, you know, I've got other people to think about. So, you know, my dad's working and that sort of thing. So, it's not, and my mum as well. So, it's not the easiest to be able to drive to gigs. But, you know, my aim is to a week. So, if I carry on, you know, getting up, then, you know, and then you get a better sense of what works and, you know, what's good. But I've just finished filming a thing. And that, you know, I did, and then after that, I sort of did two gigs last week in the same night. So, that was really good, you know, to be able to double up and sort of get that amount of stage time in during the night. That was great. Yeah, well, yeah, that's one of the, man, that is one of the like, it's so like, you're a really inspiring person, man. You're very inspiring for me as a comic. And I think you're very inspiring for probably a lot of you lazy comedians out there, like me, because like, I'll use as an excuse for not going on stage. I'll use like, a mild hangover. You know, like just the mildest of hangovers. And I'll be like, oh, I'm so sorry, I've got to cancel. You know, it's a really cool thing to, it's really cool to see you addressing these challenges and definitely overcoming them, man. You are truly like, you've had massive success as a comic for the relatively short time that you've been doing stand up. How long? Four years? Yeah. That's nothing. Yeah, it's insane, man. But I think the thing is with that, it was very strange because there's a lot of things that you have to learn, like I have to learn maths, I have to learn science. Right. But it seemed almost intuitive that I knew what was funny. And that's the only applicable skill that I've got in the world. Like, I don't know which comic said it, but sort of if you threw any comedian in Japan, they could cobble together a street show and get some stilts and start walking about and juggling. And you know, they'd find a way to get by. Yeah, right. Yeah, it is an amazing, it is a beautiful, it is a, don't worry, that's Foxy, he helps at anything. Yeah, it is an amazing thing. But here's an observation I want to make. And listen, I'm sorry, I don't mean to keep puffing up your ego here, but it's just that when I was your age, I was essentially just a gelatinous mass of like no ambition, a sort of like blob thing that had no sense of any kind of, no discipline, no sense of any kind of like goal other than just finding like a good place to play video games. Not much has changed. But so it's really interesting talking to you because I don't feel like I'm talking to a 15 year old. Yeah, I'm weird, I think that way. And I think that definitely has its positives and it definitely has its detriments, but I think if you can find an outlet for that strangeness and that weirdness, which I think again, is another product of the internet that I've been able to sort of, because like, I was thinking 30 years ago what would have happened? I would have been sat in the corner of a classroom occasionally beating with sticks. Work, you know, but because of the internet, I'm able to actually do stuff and you know, that I enjoy instead of being attacked with a metal cord by some council sanctioned bully in a suit, which hasn't really changed. Council sanctioned bully. Yeah, awesome. It's just that that hasn't really changed. They're just not allowed to use weapons anymore. Right. So are you? Wait, where do you go to school? So should I give out my school? No, you go to a public school. What would that be? So not paid for? Right. Yeah, I, you know, I, yeah. So is that not? Are you treated like a god at your school? Well, when I, when I, when I go in. Yes, you are. The answer is yes. No, no. Because the pause you're doing, you've got it. No, because I managed to sort of tear it up before I got famous that I sort of pissed enough people off to sort of just, that's, that's, that's unchangeable. But I've got, you know, I've got a decent group of friends or whatever. But yeah. And I also have a weird timetable. So I'll go it, you know, because, you know, it is pretty painful sitting on a, you know, science stool for, for however many hours at a time. Like I can't do that. So I've got a sort of reduced timetable, which I'm, which I'm able to do. That's beautiful. It's good. It's good. And they, they've been, they've been really helpful. It's just, I think there's something deeply, deeply wrong with the education system as a whole at the minute. And I don't know how it is here, but there's just edgy. I always say it like education is brilliant, but it's schooling. That's the problem. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's a yes. For sure. Yeah. I mean, because you, if you consider like, think of the species, think of the way that we learned for so many, so, so long. The way you would learn is not by sitting down with someone explaining how to hunt. You wouldn't like imagine somebody sitting down with a white board and drawing like, here's how you hunt. Yeah. You would, you would go out with the tribe and you would hunt. You would go out and you would like watch the people who are good at it and you would learn how to, you would learn from action, not from just this sort of weird absorbing of information. Yeah. And I think that's come about in part, if not the whole to, to the industrial revolution. Right. And the need for, you need, and I know it's, it's conducive to the way society is at the minute that you need people to be able to do stuff rather than, you know, it's the, we're not in a society, we need a society where, at the, at the moment where people have got a very specific set of skills, not like from Taken, they're not going to come and find you and kill you like in the movie Taken, but. Right. Right. I just, I just, I just found myself caught in Liam Neeson when trying to make a. A very specific set of skills. I haven't even seen the film, I just know that. But yeah, I think that is in part due to the way that society is running at the minute that they need, the need for that very formal idea of what education should be is, is conducive to the way. It's rancid. Yeah. In hellish, it's rancid. They take brilliant, brilliant, brilliant minds, they treat them like they're complete idiots. They put them in a kind of concentration camp for teenagers where you're forced to get, you're smashed into a room with some of the most violent, aggressive, horrifying humans that you'll ever encounter in your life and in that situation where you're dealing with so many social issues, which is you want to be accepted, you want to be loved, you feel lonely, you feel scared, you might get bullied, you might get beaten up, somewhere in the midst of this, this people are trying to make you memorize weird facts. Yeah. You know, like in the midst of that, they're like hammering you with all these weird facts and the people, at least in the United States, who are hammering you with these weird facts, these people usually, many of them want to teach, but because the state is running the education system, they're not allowed to use their instincts to teach, but they're having to deliver a curriculum that is regimented and tested and if the test don't, if the kids don't test well, then that indicates that they're doing something wrong. So basically what ends up happening is instead of learning, and what I think learning is is a connection with novelty or learning is that you know you're learning, not when you've memorized a series of facts that you'll never think again, think about again, you know you're learning when you experience that particular sense of awe when you realize, when your universe gets a little bigger, the world you're in expands a little bit more because of some bit of information that you've gotten that redefines everything you know. That's learning. Yeah. Not being able to recite the presidents or talk about dates of certain battles, that's not learning. That doesn't happen very often at school, though I don't think, you don't get that reverence for, oh I learnt something new today, I haven't learnt anything new in about eight years, but it's sort of, I'm withdrawn from the whole game of you know people have you know accept me or whatever, you know I'm withdrawn from that whole social game so I can look at it with- How did you do that? I just, I think I saw it for what it was and then found another avenue to be able, well do I want to get into these meaningless sort of exchanges with people that I don't know or do I want to find a group that you know I like and would want to you know talk with and then also what is the best way to not have to deal with people that I don't like, well just don't bother going and find somebody else to do, but I don't think it's the kids that I dislike because I can deal with them and you know I know that they'll sort of you know grow to be different to what they are now. I think it is the teachers and maybe that's unfair but that's just sort of my experience of it, that it's these, just the idea that even that they have to put on a certain uniform or dress in a certain way to be able to impart knowledge that like I put this in my report because the science teacher said Jack looks distracted and whatever and he's trying to you know get other people to talk to talk with him instead of making them listen to me or whatever. What do you mean? So that's what you put in my end of term report. Oh you seem distracted. Yeah I seem distracted and then you're allowed to do pupil comments back to the teacher and I put, right well I seem distracted because you're a science teacher and you've managed to make the very fabric of the universe boring and dull. Yeah so just sort that out and then. Did you come to class the next day and he committed suicide? No it's funny because what I like to do as well is with the science teachers because they're all hardcore materialist people I'll just go, because like one of them was in a 200 year old house or whatever. Yeah. So I just go, do you believe in ghosts? And he goes, look I've told you ghosts don't exist but he might do and then he gets really angry and then I start going oh yeah the Necronomicon's a real book because he's a big fan of HP Lovecraft but he gets really annoyed when I go oh yeah it's real no he can summon things out of it he gets really angry. Do you think the Necronomicon is a real book? No. But you are a person who is, you seem to be drawn to magic, you seem to be drawn to studying grimoires we've talked about it a little bit. But it's not a real book in the same way that Elron Hubbard's Church of Scientology which is basically an amalgamation of all his science fiction work is not a real book. I think if you believe in it enough you can tap into the energy and whether that's just from the words or whatever you can get in like when you're reading a normal book which is good like I started reading The Hobbit on the plane. That's a great book. And I got into that energy I thought oh yeah I'm going on an adventure now. Yes. And that's just the materialist view of that which probably is right if you're not. It's just that yeah that is that literature is having an effect on you which is you know engrossing you as a reader. Well right yeah that is the materialist view and then you get into the chaos magic view of the thing and the idea is that what you're just using symbols to try to tune into these archetypes and the tuning in to once you've tuned in it can actually create really powerful changes in your life which is you know like if you ever run into people and they're like I don't read fiction. You know like it's kind of irrelevant or something like I only read biographies and fact. You know it's really funny when you run into these kind of fact snobs because they sort of discount. I don't know how many people I've run into are like I would never read a fantasy book. I would never watch Game of Thrones. Yeah it's sort of how much B. Pollan does it take to fill a swimming pool or whatever like that. They're sort of in there and useless thing. But that's the thing like the yeah my brother's watching Game of Thrones at the minute but he's also reading the God Delusion which is a weird. Dawkins. Yeah. And he's gone insane and he Dawkins. Do you think Dawkins has gone mad? He might have. Well the problem is with Dawkins or with you know anyone who decided. Well here's what we're doing. This is what I've been thinking lately. I've been thinking that this entire thing that we're in right now is a version of Comic-Con. You know what Comic-Con. You know what I mean? Yeah. Cosplay. Yeah. Right? Where like a Comic-Con people put on costume. So like in the same way we're dealing with this kind of cosplay on this planet where certain people are cosplaying like they're Muslims. Yeah. Certain people are cosplaying like they're Christians. Yeah. And certain people are cosplaying like they're scientists. And they get into it man. And when you get too much into the costume too much and you start insisting that people play because the funny thing about it is it's the idea is that if you're at Comic-Con and you're walking around dressed like Superman and you see somebody dress like Batman you don't go to them and say hey you know Batman doesn't exist right. You should dress like Superman. This is why any missionary who's trying to change the cosplay that other people are engaged in if they start getting too insistent that they can stop playing whatever game it is they're playing they will start going crazy. Yeah. Because Dawkins can't admit that he's playing a game. That's the thing as well. I think anyone who knows for definite, for definite that there is no soul or no higher intelligence or whatever. For definite. Then tire with everything. You've got to stake everything on that. You know for definite that that's not the case. Well and it's the same with the fundamentalists who go yes we know for definite that this is what we need. Are the same. Yeah it's the same. It's just a less dangerous type of fundamentalism than the people you know murdering kids or whatever. It's almost like the religion is more of certainty than of anything else. It's like they're following a religion where they pretend to be certain. And that certainty is insane. You know with any kind of you know the people who are the hardcore missionary angry skeptical atheists. It's they're running into these incredible problems which is you know you take the Kepler satellite telescope the thing that's discovering that there appears to be potentially inhabitable worlds already discovering like hundreds of these all the time prior to it starting its work there were none. We actually were floating out here thinking you know this might be it there just might not be any planet in the Goldilocks region which is that region you know the Goldilocks region that term. No. So the Goldilocks region is the term given for it means not too hot not too cold. It's a planet third planet from the sun a planet that is the right distance from its sun so that water wouldn't evaporate. So there could be water and there could be the potential for life there. So that's called the Goldilocks region and satellites have been able to somehow tracking gravitational wobble. They can determine if there's planets circling in the Goldilocks region of distant stars and they've already found countless planets that fit into that which means that in this brief time this thing has been scanning the sky which by the way the sky we can see is an infinitesimal portion of the size of the universe that we're in. It's already discovered countless inhabitable worlds then the implication is that we are existing in a universe teaming with life and if the universe is teaming with life then that means there's a spectrum of intelligence and if there's a spectrum of intelligence wherever we're at there's intelligence lower than us clearly on this planet and also just turning on Fox News and any of those anchors and there's a potential in the universe for an intelligence that is exponentially greater than ours right now and as that thing grows eventually it would become God right? But Duncan that's just science. That's just material science. No I think that's definite. I watched a little bit of Fox News last night. Hilarious. It is the most insane. It's like what Rupert Murdoch does in the UK but just if that thing encounters steroids and protein shakes just rah, rah! Sort of WWE wrestler type Murdoch thing like that. It's weird and don't quote me on this but I think the headline going across the bottom like can I be sued if I get this headline wrong? No. No. I don't know maybe. So basically the headline I think and don't quote me on this because I might have read it wrong or misheard it but the headline was when will black America acknowledge their problem with looting? It's hilarious. When will they though? That's an important question. Looting. Yeah looting. That's a funny thing man. Racists love it whenever riots break out. The real question is when will police officers recognize their problem with shooting black teenagers? Isn't that a more important question? You know what? We'll deal with our looting problem when you stop killing our children randomly. Yeah. Well that was the thing. Did you see the thing Bill Ma put on Twitter about Hamas being like a crazy wife? How what? Hamas, you know the terrorist organization. I didn't see it. Hamas is like a crazy wife. You can only hold its wrists so long before you have to slap it. He put that on Twitter. First of all Bill Ma has no right to talk about what it's like to be married. That guy is never getting married. He's like I think he has an active harem. But the comic Frankie Boyle from the UK put back I know what you mean. Women do get upset when you blow up their kids. Oh genius. And he got a lot of retweets. That is so funny. I hope Ma saw it but I don't think he did. Yeah man, it's really funny to watch mainstream news and watch it recognizing that really all you're seeing is the paradigm that a group of lobbyists and weapons manufacturers want to keep. That's why David Iker sort of got a point when he uses the term the movie. This is the thing that's projected while something else is going on. And that's not easy. That is a very easy rather observation to make. Everyone knows that pretty much. I don't think so. But then the funny thing is with that it'll come up with good phrases like that. But then the thing that makes me think he might be a disinformation agent is that then the papers can discredit all that by going ah but he believes in lizards from outer space. Yeah right. Well you know again the question is it's like what he's talking about is the name that in Hinduism of course you know the name for the universe is Maya. You've heard that term before. So they don't just say. They've been saying from prior to the existence of Fox News and Rupert Murdoch and anybody they've been saying that this entire thing that we're in right now is an illusion. That we are living in Maya is a personal term. So the universe is imbued with a personality which means that it's not just that we're living in an illusion like you just walked into a mirage but it's as though we were born into a mirage which is alive. And as one of its characteristics it keeps trying to hypnotize you and keep you in a trance believing that this is all there is. And so I think what Ike is talking about he hasn't taken it to the deepest level yet. He likes to believe that there's a group of Illuminati or people who are actively trying to trick us which may or may not be true when the reality of the situation is if we removed the Rothschilds and the Murdochs and all the people that have been accused of being the Illuminati the universe itself would continue to confuse and to trick us by giving us the impression that this is all there is and that somehow the material universe will feed the great gnawing hunger that exists inside all of us that we confuse with something that we can satiate with money or success or anything that the material world manifests as. And that's the thing that's projected. The comic Frankie Boyle I've just mentioned described Ike to me as he's a man who's had a religious experience but he can't articulate it properly because he used to be a soccer player. Yes. And that's the thing. Like in the Bag of Agata it's all about people looking for Lord Krishna's qualities in other things. Talk about that a little bit more because people might not have heard that. Yeah, so Krishna means the all attractive one doesn't it? That thing is at the inception of the universe this is how I understand it at the inception of the universe everything's split off so you've got these little sprinter groups from the divine intelligence of money, of wealth, of beauty but they all lead back to this one road which is a blue... blue-skinned coward boy. And that in every single thing so like Krishna has described as Bhagavan you've heard that term before and Bhagavan means all famous, all powerful, all intelligent, all beautiful. So it's the idea is that like every single beautiful wonderful thing in the universe is compared to water spraying out of a fountain and the God head which is what Krishna is, is the thing that all of the water is coming from. So when you see, when somebody looks at Kanye West and is like, that's genius he's a genius, he's a beautiful, incredible, genius auteur, whatever they think he is. Only Kanye West thinks that about Kanye West. That was great man! When Kanye West looks in the mirror what he's really seeing is Krishna and when you look in the mirror what you're really seeing is Krishna and when I look in the mirror what I'm really seeing is Krishna and what everything is is Krishna and the nature of Maya is to distract us from going to the God head and recognizing the source that these things spring from and to get us caught up in all the individual droplets that are springing from the source itself. Yeah and I think that whether you believe that as an abstract idea or not and just a sort of thing to illustrate that point I think materialist science and philosophy and spirituality they will all eventually meet and that can be explained in scientific terms as in scientific terms as well or in anthropological terms rather that people have moved on to other things and that they're obsessed by the thing that a culture has created which is money worshipping that can get the newest shoes or whatever which to me having or can get the newest shoes sounds like a really silly thing and I think that that meets with philosophy which is the Gita can be read on one level as a philosophical text rather than a spiritual one. Have you seen Grant Morrison's 18 days on YouTube? Nope. What is it? Exciting. I can't wait to tell you. I'm going to write that down so I don't forget. He's done a motion comic Have you seen Archer? It looks a bit like Archer where the sort of characters are moving but not really like a proper animation but he's done one called 18 days all about the Mahabharata but he's sort of brought it up to date with all sci-fi and all being all war elephants So Hanuman's in there? Hanuman, I don't think he's in there I think it is just the story of the Bhagavad Gita but I think he's trying to expand it but I got the book first at home which is the reference book of all the material and the scripts and the drawings and I looked at it and they had sort of Brahman in there and I thought that's amazing and then I looked at the motion comic and they sort of decreased the image quality a little bit and they weren't able to put all the intricate detail in but it's still good because you can sort of feel Grant Morrison's power imbued in that series I can't wait, I didn't even know this thing existed man, I cannot wait to see it It's good man You are a mind blower friend What's going on with you? Do you think that you're some kind of reincarnate What are you doing? Here you are You've incarnated in this very unique life Do you ever think about that? Yeah, it's strange one man It's weird how stuff comes about because like I'm just and I like the esoteric and sort of that's a fun thing for me to research and that while I'm playing video games that's a fun thing but then this is why the podcast mediums are great and hopefully I'll get mine off the ground in a bit It's very hard to articulate and in part that information in stand up because you're not allowed to paint your character with as many shades of grey as maybe you'd like so that's why the podcast medium is a great thing I think you're able to express a few more complex ideas and then these and the whole thing that's kicked off and all the podcast stuff it's all these ideas because of the speed of the internet and the accessibility and the instant gratification that we've come to sort of desire in recent years all these ideas are spreading and they're spreading fast and I'm sure some of the kids in England can sort of find out about them or I'm sure you've got listeners all over the world that's spreading so you're sort of probably a representation of what 15 year olds are just going to be like it's like some kind of Isaac Asimov future where the typical 15 year old being disrupted by this massive stream of information that they have access to when I was a kid when I was your age, God I love saying that so condescending, when I was your age but when I was your age you know I can remember like there was no bug one second that actually I'm sorry I had to cut because of my ridiculous dogs who will be euthanized this evening when I was your age I had no access there was no internet so that meant that the information that I would come in contact with that would be considered psychedelic or mind expanding or different or fringe was limited to what I could find at the library and I would go to the occult section and I would find these books and I would have this weird sense and also at the library I went to in Hendersonville, North Carolina you actually had to sign a certain thing to look at the occult books, you did because they thought the information was too much and so information was controlled and I remember coming in contact with the first I ever heard of like Ram Dass or Richard Alpert probably wasn't until I was in college you know so it's a very exciting thing to me to think that really there might be many other 15 year olds who are exhibiting the same kind of wisdom and the same kind of what's the word for it the same kind of fringe open mindedness that you have and you know that word it's like I use that word too and I use the word creepy and I mean that in a good way, I don't mean it in a bad way but people mistake that I think we need a better word for it than weird because I'll tell you what weird is weird is being a 15 year old who is completely obsessed with a football team that's your whole life, I'm not saying it's terrible but I'm saying that seems a little more weird to me that's another facet of me though I like going to watch the soccer well you're a weirdo I like that as well but the thing is you know how I like to annoy racists on the internet you've sort of joined in with that somewhat it's the tweet that you put out so if someone put in other countries you wouldn't have this freedom of speech Jack, you'd be arrested and then you came back with I'm all for arresting Jack Carroll he's a menace I was looking through their twitter accounts the other day and one of them said 16 year old aspiring investment banker there you go so funny you already have a nemesis you have your opposites but I'm not saying that's a bad thing if that's what you really want to do just try and also try and just find whatever avenue you need to be a decent person to other people and I'm not there yet by any means there's a lot of work ahead of me to be able to interact properly with mainly my close family is the people that I get unduly annoyed at for no reason when I go into mad fits and maybe that's just another the same way with Robin Williams you can't have everything in a sort of karmic is a horrible and I don't mean that in a horrible way you've got to be able to balance it out but one thing I have noticed is your news coverage over here and I hate to say New York because that has wrapped up in all nationalist ideas but the news coverage out here is may not be the most impartial or the best but I tell you what is the kids TV shows are amazing like what? I always like SpongeBob but Adventure Time is now on Netflix oh yeah, Adventure Time is incredible that's magic with the K not magic with the C and what else was there just all the animated stuff I don't know what it's called but there's a squirrel and he works in a park and he's got a friend and there's a man on it who was like and he came down and it was just a chin on legs and he was the god of the sort of world and he was just a chin on legs with a beard but yeah and then that seems really strange that the news coverage could be so right of center and well you know well the artists are when you have a cartoon you have artists who are all these various artists who are sort of blending together to get their ideas out there it's the same thing like if you look at cathedrals you will see in the cathedrals weird symbols that don't quite make sense with Christianity and that's because these artists were building the cathedrals and they were weaving in little thumb prints little like initials that didn't have anything to do with the Christian ethic and I think that like the same is true for cartoons you know I think that you represent the thing that God forgive me for saying this but you represent the thing that the hippies and the weirdos sort of have been prognosticating for a long time but I think they were wrong about the way it was going to happen and when it was going to happen but it's what they call this great shift that's happening and the consciousness of the planet which is a movement out of that kind of movie that Rupert Murdoch is trying to make I keep saying docked, Rupert Murdoch is trying to make us believe is docked in the dock of spiritual and social death he is docked but he's kind of like a dark necromancer who sits on top of his tower trying to confuse and hypnotize the masses into believing that we exist in a world of suffering and horror and paranoia and on the other side of that you have people like you who are suddenly getting microphones in front of their mouths and suddenly expressing these ideas that are inspirational and mind expanding and I think that the more of you, if there's one of you in the same way if there's one planet Earth then it probably means there's many many many other planet Earths with life forms on them. I bet there's many many other views out there and my hope is that they're in my basement I'm cloning myself, I'm raising an army I thought you were going to say you killed them because they're going to be your competitors It's Murdoch man, I've got to kill the competition I'm buried in my basement Duncan Listen man, we got to wrap this up but I want to thank you for taking some time to be on this podcast and I hope that you'll come back, we can do it through Skype It's been enlightening again man Likewise, it's a smaller audience to be enlightened by you so that's good to sort of... It's real man, really you are I'm not going to listen, let me just be a condescending old man for a second, you're an amazing person and you shouldn't be so hard on yourself you got to be, you got to really love yourself and recognize that you deserve everything that's happening to you You're really remarkable man because of this podcast, I get to sit down and talk to a lot of fascinating people and like Ramdas or like Ragu Marcus so many really brilliant fascinating people you deserve the award there's a reason that you're up there with those other people who are heroes and the sooner you can digest that indeed you are a remarkable human being, the better it's going to be for everybody let me just close on one weird little story if I could I'm sorry to be an old man and lecturing you my friend there's nothing worse than being a 15 year old and hearing some ass I'm sorry Anyway, Jay Wunden comedian, I think he won last comic standing and he was experiencing all this amazing stuff from it and I remember talking to him outside the comedy store about it and all these crazy things that were happening and like, I don't remember some cool thing that happened to me that I thought was an anomaly and he looks at me and he goes Duncan, eat the cake just eat the cake and I thought it was the best advice I ever got eat the cake eat the cake man, when it's in front of you, eat it just eat the cake, enjoy it, it's wonderful and you deserve it Yeah, thank you man I've got something on the plane ride home to digest now Hare Krishna my friend How can people find you?

Transcript and Discussion^2014-03-04^This is the smell of the leftover tuna fish sandwich you left in your lunchbox over the weekend in a wimpy trash bag. Wimpy, wimpy, wimpy! Bleh! And this is the smell of that same sandwich in a hefty Ultra Strong trash bag. Hefty, hefty, hefty! Ah, smell the difference?

And for bigger jobs, try the superior strength of hefty large black bags. Hello friends, it is I, Duncan Tressel, and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast. I feel like giving myself a trophy this morning because I woke up at 6 a.m. I swear to God, I'd give myself a little golden Greek figurine idol with an inscription Morning Champion on it, if I could. Because waking up early in the morning is a sign, usually, that things are going pretty good in your life. That you're turning a corner, you know? If you start sleeping late, I've just been sleeping late, and anytime I'm doing that, I need to... Sleeping late is hitchhiking on the Devil's Highway. You might be okay for a little while, but eventually you're going to get picked up by a demon and carried into hell. Not all the time. I know some people just aren't morning people, but I just, I love it anytime I can wake up early. I'm going to read this article now. My brother sent me this. I'm very excited about this. So I'm probably going to rant a little bit and get a little shrill, but that's normal, I guess, for this podcast. New York Times article, March 3, 2014. The article is by Benedict Cary, LSD, reconsidered for therapy. He heard about the drug trial from a friend in Switzerland and decided it was worth volunteering, even if it meant long, painful train journeys from his native Austria and the real possibility of a mental meltdown. He didn't have much time after all, and traditional medicine had done nothing to relieve his degenerative spine condition. I'd never taken the drug before, so I was feeling, well, I think the proper word for it in English is dread, said Peter, 50, an Austrian social worker in a telephone interview. He asked that his last name be admitted to protect his identity. There was this fear that it could all go wrong, that it could turn into a bad trip. On Tuesday, the Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease is posting online results from the first controlled trial of LSD in more than 40 years. The study, conducted in the office of a Swiss psychiatrist near Bern, tested the effects of the drug as a compliment to talk therapy for 12 people nearing the end of life. Most of the subjects had terminal cancer and several died within a year after the trial, but not before having a mental adventure that appeared to have eased the existential gloom of their last days. Their anxiety went down and stayed down, said Dr. Peter Gasser, who conducted the therapy and followed up with his patients a year after the trial concluded. The new publication marks the latest in the series of baby steps by a loose coalition of researchers and fundraisers who are working to bring hallucinogens back into the fold of mainstream psychiatry. Before research was banned in 1966 in the United States, doctors tested LSD's effect for a variety of conditions, including end of life anxiety. But in the past few years, psychiatrists in the United States and abroad, working with state regulators as well as ethics boards, have tested ecstasy-assisted therapy for post-traumatic stress and other trials with hallucinogens are in the works. The effort is both political and scientific, said Rick Doblin, executive director of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a foundation that has financed many of the studies. We want to break these substances out of the mold of the counterculture and bring them back to the lab as part of a psychedelic renaissance. Before taking LSD, the 12 patients in the Swiss study met with Dr. Gasser in his office for two or more sessions to get acquainted. The trial called for two drug-assisted courses of therapy separated by a couple of weeks. The drug's effects would last up to 10 hours after which the patient would sleep on a couch in the office, attended at all times by the therapist or an assistant. I told them that each session would be right here in a safe environment and I am part of it, Dr. Gasser said. I can't guarantee you won't have intense distress, but I can tell you that if you do, it will pass. And so they did, and indeed it passed, though not always easily. Many wept, most squirmed, one 67-year-old man said he met his long-dead, estranged father somewhere out in the cosmos nodding in approval. After about two months of weekly therapy, the eight participants who received full doses of LSD improved by about 20% on standard measures of anxiety. The participants, by and large, considered the therapy worthwhile. It's a proof of concept, Dr. Doblin said. It shows that this kind of trial can be done safely and that it's very much worth doing. Peter, the social worker, agreed. I will say I've been more emotional since the study ended and I don't mean always cheerful, he said, but I think it's better to feel things strongly. Better to be alive than to merely function. Yes! Wow, man, wow, what a great article, what a vindicating study for all of us who have had positive results in our lives from taking psychedelics like LSD and DMT and ecstasy. Really vindicating, man. One major annoyance that I have in my life are those people who like to jam all substances that cause any kind of alteration in our perceptual mechanisms into the category called drugs. Not drugs as in like drugs in a nice, clean, normal font, but drugs in the Frankenstein dripping green oozing death font. Drugs! Wooo! Drugs! It's a real annoyance to me. I was having a conversation. I was eating, I was around one of these tyrannical fucks at breakfast once. And I think I was talking about how I tried DMT and it had this really positive effect on my life. I'd gotten more clean. Started exercising again. It just had been a very positive experience for me. And his response immediately, without even looking up from his shitty omelet was, you sound like a drug addict. Or maybe he said junkie. Or maybe he said, actually, he said druggy. You sound like a druggy. Now, that really pissed me off. I didn't directly confront the person because I figured, what's the point? This is a person who's in, you know, a sober person who's in some kind of clearly in some kind of 12 step program. And the reason that they're saying druggy is because they're afraid when they hear things about drugs like DMT or LSD or mushrooms or any of the psychedelics can have a positive benefit, they get afraid because it gives them, they're afraid that it's going to plant some seed and then it's going to lead to a relapse and they're going to be back living in whatever shitty town they were in when they got addicted to whatever shitty drug and were in whatever crappy relationship they happened to be in. They're afraid that they're going to slide right back down to that place and everything that they have would be lost. You know, I get it, it's a fear-based thing, but it's really annoying to me when people do that. It's lazy. It's lazy to jam psychedelics into the same category that you put heroin or cocaine or methamphetamine or any of the other awful, life-destroying, addictive drugs. And studies like this, when they come out, they really shine a harsh light on those people. Because it's one thing to be a sober person, I have many sober friends, and to understand that for whatever reason you punched your ticket and you can't screw around with any kind of substance at all, except maybe coffee or cigarettes or antidepressants or sugar or whatever the government says that you can take. It's one thing to be one of those people and just realize I can't do it. I'm afraid. Maybe it won't do anything. Maybe it'll have a chance that it could help me, but there's also a chance that I take it and then I start doing cocaine again. So I'm not even going to fuck with it. I'm just going to be sober. I managed to be sober this long. I don't need to screw with that, but if it's helping other people, great. That's one thing. Fine. I love that type of person. But to be the other type of person, which is to take your own personal tragedy that happened when you came into contact with a substance, and you didn't just come in contact with a substance. You came in contact with a group of people using that substance in an irresponsible way. You came in contact with a lifestyle that was negative and was associated with that substance or a series of substances. It wasn't just the substance by itself, but because you got stuck in a kind of cyclone of self-destruction that had as one of the components of it, a substance or a series of substances, you then apply that to every single person around you. And you project your fear mentality onto the people around you who are just trying to improve themselves. Open their eyes a little bit more. Shake off the darkness. Break out of the thought prisons. It's annoying to me, but it's more sinister when you imagine a person like that impacting or influencing other people around them in a more profound way. I hear something like that erupting out of the lips of a loon. And all I do is get secretly angry and hold that in. But what about the people that get around this person or people like that? And they're not addicts. They haven't become addicted to anything, but they avoid using the substance like LSD or mushrooms or a psychedelic in a responsible way because they're afraid that they will destroy their lives. This is ghost story, you know? These fucking fascist sober people, not all sober people. Again, let me reiterate. Most sober people that I come in contact with, their lives are flourishing and they're not judgmental at all about people who use substances. Even the bad ones. They just figure they're going to stop when they're going to stop. But you run into these fascist ghost story telling terrified people and they spread their sickness all throughout the world. Studies like this come out and refute what those people say. And it's beautiful, but it's also kind of infuriating when you consider the fact that with LSD, there is a mandatory minimum prison sentence for that substance. That means that if you have a certain amount on you, you go to jail for 10 years. They put you in a dungeon for 10 years and then when you consider that here is a substance that in this limited study is showing benefit for people who are close to death. But you know that it's been proven to be beneficial in many, many, many, many, many other ways. Only those ways have happened outside of the lens of science because of a ridiculous prohibition placed upon the substance by a terrified government that thought that the substance was turning everybody into Charles Manson. So I like that part of what this doctor Gasser said is, or was it Doblin? Doblin or Gasser said, you know, take it out of the counterculture. I understand that. You know, take it out of the shady darkness of, you know, the demographic of people that are using the drug both responsibly and irresponsibly. Because you can certainly use LSD or psychedelics in an irresponsible way. They can cause a lot of problems for you. That's true. Studies like that show how to take the drug. You know, this is the classic babysitter situation. Gasser was just being the babysitter. Someone takes the psychedelic and someone's nearby to make sure they're okay and to reassure them when things get difficult. It's responsible. That's the responsible way to do drugs like that. But because there's been a prohibition, these ways of doing drugs like that aren't known by everyone. You have to stumble upon the drug in some covert way the whole time feeling like a bank robber or a criminal. Because the drug has been categorized in the same way that heroin is categorized. So subliminally you're being taught that this drug has within it the same potential for destroying your life that fucking heroin has. Instead of what studies like this reveal, which is that the drug can, when used responsibly, relieve anxiety for people who are about to die. And if you can relieve the anxiety of people who are about to die, think about how beneficial it would be for people who have an entire life in front of them. The substance has the potential to dissolve the thought prisons that so many of us get trapped in. The identity prisons where you've decided this is how you are. And you've become just sealed up in the castle of yourself and locked into some cycle. A drug like LSD or DMT or mushrooms, it can, when used responsibly, get you the hell out of there. It can dissolve the thought prison and all of a sudden you get to have a whole new life. It's that powerful a substance. So congratulations to Dr. Gasser and to Doblin and to all the other people who are, who have managed to get studies like this to happen. It's very exciting to me, very vindicating, very vindicating. She's so annoying when you've come into contact with something that has had a positive impact on your life. And the very act of talking about it will make certain people around you roll their eyes at the best and at the worst, accuse you of being a junkie. Try to get addicted to LSD. I'm sure it can happen, but good luck. You were really, to get addicted to heroin, you know, you pop the spike in a few times and you're going to get chemically addicted to the substance. But if you wanted to get addicted to LSD, man, you've got to like, you probably have to make the Grateful Dead start touring again. You got to bring Jerry Garcia back to life. There's a lot of steps that you'd have to take if you wanted to get, I don't even, I'm sure that there's a psychological addiction that could happen to anything. But man, you can't get physically addicted to LSD. You can't. Love it when stuff like this comes out. It's very exciting for me. We're going to go through this along with the potential for the legalization of marijuana. Who knows, friends, we could be on the verge of a renaissance or a nuclear holocaust. Or maybe a nuclear holocaust is a form of renaissance. Who knows? Anyway, very excited about this study and very excited about our guest today, Sam Tripoli. We're going to dive into this podcast, but first some quick, quick, quick business. The Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Amazon.com. If you want to support this podcast, there's an easy way to do it. Go to dunkintrussell.com and click on our Amazon portal the next time you're going to buy something from Amazon. I have a very healthy friend who has been introducing me to a lot of types of vitamins and crazy, weird stuff that I've never taken before. I've been drinking liquid chlorophyll. It's awesome. It looks like it came out of a barrel outside of a nuclear facility. I don't know. Maybe she's telling me I stink because it's like a natural deodorizer. It's like an internal deodorizer. She doesn't have to tell me. I know I stink. But it's delicious. What's weird is it comes out of plants, tastes great. It's delicious. I don't know. Maybe it's part of why I woke up at 6 a.m. this morning. Who knows? It could be a placebo effect, but if it's a placebo effect, it's delicious. You want to order liquid chlorophyll, you can get it at amazon.com along with pretty much anything else that you could possibly want. And when you go through our portal, they give us a very small percentage of whatever it is that you buy. It doesn't cost you anything, but it definitely helps support this podcast. We're also brought to you by Shoredesign T-shirts. Shoredesign T-shirts. By the way, we've got a new shipment of T-shirts coming in, so check our shop. Shoredesign T-shirts makes all of our shirts. And the reason I use Shoredesign T-shirts to make the Ducatrestle Family Hour shirts, the beautiful shirts, the logo shirt, the weird symbol shirt, just go look on the shop. It's hard to describe these things. The reason I use Shoredesign T-shirts is because their shirts are so incredibly soft. The softness of these shirts is what I imagine it would feel like if you lay on the moon naked. No one's ever done that in all of human history. No one has ever experienced what it would be like to lay down in that soft, soft moon dust and feel it against your bare ass. It would feel so good. I just know it. I just know it would feel so good to be in a low-gravity environment with dust particulates rising up around your balls. I just know it would feel good. I don't know why, but instinctually I know it would feel good. The problem is, we have not figured out how to get to the moon, except by starting a massive government agency. There's no personal moon rockets, so nobody's going to fly up there and get to do nude snow angels in that sweet moon dust. But there is a way you can experience what it would be like to lay nude on the moon. That's to go to ShoredesignT-shirts.com and order one of these shirts. Put the shirt on and then lay in your carpet or on your floor and close your eyes and listen to moon music, which is basically anything with chimes. And you will know what it's like to lay nude on the moon. ShoredesignT-shirts.com. Go to Shoredesign T-shirts. Put my name in Duncan. You will get 10% off these wonderfully soft shirts. Lay outside and look up at the moon while you're wearing one of these shirts. And just imagine you're up there floating there, half floating, half napping. That's ShoredesignT-shirts. We're also brought to you by Audible. I keep forgetting to do this one. Audible has shitloads of great audiobooks. I'm currently listening to, I've been listening to. The cool thing about audiobooks is that they last for a long time. One audiobook is usually like 30 or 20 hours of entertainment. So it's great. If you're a busy person and you've got a lot to do and you want to combine reading with exercise, audiobooks can make that happen. You know, back in the old days you'd look over and somebody would be like reading a magazine or a newspaper on the treadmill and it's like, how are you doing that? I don't understand that because when I'm running I have to like look straight ahead, fixate on something straight ahead and just plow forward or I'll get off the treadmill. But you see these people just sweating into their newspapers and it's mysterious. Also, I'm so clumsy if I'm running on the treadmill trying to read the books going to fall on the treadmill and probably get stuck in the gears of the treadmill and I'm going to fall off and it'll be embarrassing. I have been known to fall off treadmills. So an audiobook, you can climb on the treadmill and educate yourself and expand your mind while moving in the direction of getting that sweet six pack that you've always dreamed of.

Sam Tripoli, welcome back to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. God damn, it's good to see you, man. It's good to be back with the family. It's good to have you back. I miss my family. I miss you. You got a great vibe, man. I've been looking forward to this podcast. That's what I was trying to talk to you about. You have a great vibe. Thank you. What is that? What do you think a vibe is? It's just the energy you put off. And sometimes it can be dark energy. Sometimes it could be good energy. It's good energy. It's a vibe. You give off a good vibe. That's why you get the chicks. You get it. You give off a good vibe. Do I? I feel like I give off a crazy vibe. No, man. You've got the. No, you can. It's just like it's so simple. You know the idea where people say the universe only functions as a binary ones and zeroes. So it's like the universe only understands like yes and no, which is why these are like the positivity people are really into not saying shitty things about yourself. Which is Los Angeles. Which is Los Angeles. The positivity people. Yeah. Yes. Right. And it's not just Los Angeles. It's like a cultist. It's like anybody. Just good. Put out good energy. Yes. I like to talk some shit once in a while. Once in a while, I like to talk some shit. Me too. It's very important that you, especially Los Angeles, that you find some friends who you could talk shit with and their minds don't blow a freak out. Yes. Because you can freak some people out. Yeah. Oh yeah. Totally. You're like, what's up with this? They're like, hey, negative energy, bro. And they just run away. There's nothing more horrible than when you realize you're with you. You're with a fucking positivity cop. Yeah. That's my biggest thing. I try to put out the positive. The big thing I work on right now is like, what is my role in what's going on in my life? I refuse to be the person. Listen, let me tell you something. I had a really weird moment the other day. Yeah. It was during the Olympics. It was towards the end of the Olympics. And they were doing the Nancy Kerrigan, uh, Tonya Harding story. And they, they're interviewing Tonya Harding and she says to her, all I ever wanted to do was just do me, be honest, beat that person. I just want to do my own thing and nobody liked it. And I was just like, oh my God, I say that all the time. I am, I think the same way Tonya Harding, you know, and it's just like, I, and I just, and then I, Nothing's wrong with that saying. It's just Tonya Harding was a little unscrupulous. Yeah. But then she goes on and she blames everybody for everything. And I just don't want to be that guy. Right. I know my role and where I am and what I am. And that's kind of what I got. And what the point that was. I think that's why you got a great vibe, man. It's because you're, you're somebody who knows that. Not everybody knows that. A lot of people are teetering in between who they want to be and who they know they are. And they're always trying to be who they want to be. And they can't come to terms with who they are. And that creates that awful situation when you get around a fucking chameleon. When you get around somebody who's always shifting their form to suit certain situations. We all do that a little bit, you know, but. I mean, you're catching me on a good day. Talk to me literally three days ago. You wouldn't understand what I was saying because the shotgun would be so deep in my mouth. Why were you depressed? It just, it's just something that this town, it just, it's just LA. You get depressed. You start, you know, where am I that wear that? I just had a conversation last night. This guy said the coolest thing I ever, man. I never thought of it. It's really cool. But he was saying that he, he had been outside and he touched a flower or touched a, I don't know, some kind of greenery or something. Right. And had this weird telepathic link with the earth. And at that moment understood that the earth was afraid too. It was really cool. Cause it's this idea that this anxiety that we experience is with everybody tries to hide low level anxiety that you pretend is not there. High level anxiety, catastrophic thinking, fear, feelings. Yes. You are actually experiencing not just your own personal fear, but the waves of fear radiating out of the earth. I agree with that. Cause it deals with all these weird bugs, building skyscrapers on top of that. You know, that's, there's a whole theory that the earth is a living organism. And you know, we're like a cancer. Yeah. That's a funny thing. You know, it's like, when people go down that road, the cancer, human cancer road, I, I understand it. Cause you, you know, you can, you could see that we do devastate planet earth and everything like that. But I like George Carlin's take on it better, which was maybe the earth wants plastic. Maybe that's why it made humans is because it wants plastic. It just wants a bunch of fucking plastic. You think you're that significant that you're a fucking cancer that's going to destroy a planet. This planet has been smashed by meteors. Oh yeah. Extinctions are happening all the time. It's a great bit. But the whole point is humans are so prideful that we like to believe, oh, we're going to destroy this earth. And Carlin's joke is earth is fine. Yeah. Humans are fucked though. Well, it's going to come along. It's we're going to get wiped out, but the earth will still be here. Look at Chernobyl, man. Chernobyl, massive nuclear disaster. And if you look at videos of Chernobyl now, flourishing wildlife, trees growing, it's beautiful. The earth is fine. It's like, oh, this is, this is all you can throw at me. Yeah. I've taken impacts from deep space. You fucking monkeys. Go ahead, detonate your nuclear missiles, radiate the soil, watch what happens. Because for the earth, a million years is just a blink of the fucking eye. There's only one thing to destroy planet earth, and that's the sun. If the sun just exploded and ate everything around it, that's the only thing they could do. But we're not going to do anything. Yeah. That's another thing, man. It's just like, just to realize that, you know, what you are in the universe. Yes. Yes. To realize what you are in the universe is insignificant relative to the size of the universe. Or, but, you know, there's another way to look at that too, man, which is like, because there is that thing like, understand, you know, I've seen the JPEGs of like the arrow pointing to this tiny little dot. Carl Sagan. Carl Sagan. That's everything. That's everything. Right there, this tiny little dot in comparison to the whole universe. But you know, you do have to deal with the fact that like, if I'm, if we were to like zoom in on you, you know, and get a quantum microscope on you, then you would be at that. You would be a universe with tons of little dots in it that probably were harboring life too. Yeah. So you're a walking universe on your own. Yeah. Like the little bug that maybe crawls on your arm, that is, that is that bug's universe. Yeah. And you're this humongous thing. Yeah, exactly. And it doesn't even know you exist and it's just walking around you're like little bugs, smack it. Yeah. Like your crabs. Everything's relative. Is that what we're saying? We're saying that you are simultaneously the most significant and least significant thing walking around. It's this fucking binary. It's the yin and yang, man. Yeah. It's this like combination of the light and the dark. It's like, yeah, this is called, um, there's this great Hare Krishna term for it, which is describing God. And I can't remember the name of it. I'll mispronounce it, but it's like a sink a sink a beta type or something and it makes sense. It's simultaneous oneness and difference. So it means that the God or the universe, the intelligence of the universe, you're a pixel in this thing and it's simultaneously this one thing, which we can never understand in the same way you're a cell in your liver. It's almost like light bright. Maybe you're just one light plug by yourself, but together you make a whole little drawing or that is exactly it. And light bright is the best way to describe it, man. Fucking light brights. Yeah. I haven't, I haven't, I haven't thought about light bright in so long, but man, I used to love that. I love light bright, man. It was so incredible. It was really mind blowing at the time. You plug in those little jewels and it glows and they had patterns that you could like build your own things. And there was always something spooky about the light bright though. Wasn't it? Yeah. It was like, it was like a baby's first acid trip. Yeah. It was kind of psychedelic. It definitely wasn't originally made for kids. That's for sure. Right. Somebody just tripping on Sando's acid back in the fifties and figured out if he started plugging light. Well, most of your kids toys are leading towards doing hallucinogenics and, uh, and all the psychedelics and all that stuff. You really think about it. I mean, if you look at cartoons, yeah, they are giant acid trips. Yes. I mean, you're talking to animals. Yes. You're flying on butterflies. Yes. You know, it's all a giant acid trip. Yeah. You're right, man. Kids seem to really love that stuff too, don't they? And that's why we do drugs and all that stuff is to get kind of back to that kind of cheerful playfulness. Yeah. Like our original state before we got brainwashed by reptilian demon people who made us think of the most important thing was imaginary numbers in our bank accounts. And now we wander around completely separate. That is something that's very interesting, dude. You know, it's cause I mean, I'll be honest with you in comparison to some of my friends. I haven't made the amount of money that a lot of my friends have made, but I have done when I moved out late, the things I wanted to do, I've done. Yeah. You've got the successful show. You have a successful podcast. You're a respected comic. You're, you're a brilliant comic. You developed your craft. You work super hard. Yeah. I mean, that's why I dreamed. I really don't remember dreaming of being, you know, the A-list actor in a movie. I don't think that was ever part of the plan. Maybe, maybe I'm just have a selective memory at this moment, but I don't remember that. I remember freedom to do what I want to do, to say what I want to say and just make enough money to not have to clock in somewhere. And if you do clock in somewhere, that's nothing against that. Cause you know, there's nothing, there's nothing wrong with that. I think we've gotten away from the respect of having an honest job sometimes and just, you know, just going to work. And if that's what you enjoy doing, you know, I really enjoy going on podcasts of people who kind of are in the middle of, you know, the Midwest, the South, and, you know, they got their day job and then they just do their podcast and like, how cool is that? Very cool. They're not really doing a podcast so they could tour off it. They could just, they're just doing it to just because they enjoy doing it. And I think that's pretty damn amazing. You've got everything that you want, but three days ago, you were suicidally depressed. Suicidally depressed dude. Suicidally depressed. This is the thing, man. I think that that's such a brave thing to fess up to because a lot of people, they don't do that. They will become suicidally depressed and then they'll pretend that they're fine and they'll think, God, I mean, I have all this stuff. You know, I did this and that and I have my freedom and I have this and that and everything's going great, but yet somehow I'm still feeling miserable. Yes. Somehow. And then that becomes a really perplexing moment for a lot of people because you begin to realize like, Oh, all the shit that I've been throwing at this thing to try to fix it is not fixing it at all. All the medicine recommended by the world, all the medicine recommended by society is not curing this specific sort of inflammation or disease or whatever the thing is that I have. So the big question is, can it be cured? Can this disease, this sense of uneasiness, this feeling of anxiety, a feeling of depression or dread or the darkness that creeps into the heart of most human beings, is it curable or is it something we just have to accept? That's a great question because I think about it all the time. I mean, I don't know, granted, you know, I'm an adult right now, I haven't always been an adult. It just seems like there's more depression now than there's ever been. Yeah. Because I think there's more of this push when you're young to live your dreams, do this, believe in that, you know, and it's, it's almost, I don't want to get super like negative, but it's almost like this big lie that we teach to children, you know, about, you know, the happiness versus like being at peace. I believe I can fly. Yeah, 100%. I believe I can touch the sky. Right. I think about it every night and day. Yeah, that's shit. The Disney propaganda, right? Is like, there's this happiness, there's this happiness out there that you got to chase and then you get to a certain age, you're like, ah, that's not how it works. And then you get this depression because you're dealing with the programming of what you've been taught to think. Yeah. Just being, understanding peacefulness, which is really what I'm trying to get away, getting to when I look about where I am and where like I'd like to be, that's, that's what gets me depressed. Are there the options to still get to where I want to be? And then I realized, yes, and then I do it and then it just keeps going, you know, that's, that's kind of what it was. Man, I was just listening to this, well, it's a documentary. The Ram Dass people just put out, it's really good. It's about faith and there was a Sharon Salzburg, she's a Buddhist teacher, she, she was taught, she had this great way of putting like faith or the sense of that moment where the darkness kind of lifts is when you realize that the room that you thought that there was no exit from, suddenly you realize there's a doorway out, like a door opens up that moment in life that happens where when you thought that there's no fucking way that you're going to get out of this predicament, you realize, oh my God, it's right there in front of me. And that right there in front of you, feeling of excitement, that's really that, that's the, to me, that's the great blast for me that nobody wants to teach kids that you can be completely happy minus accomplishment right now. Yeah. That's like throwing a monkey. It really is about right now. Yes. You know, the biggest thing I've learned over the years is judging your insides by other people's outsides. People tend to do that a lot. You know, you're like, oh man, I'm feeling all this and then I look at that guy, you know, on the outside, he looks like he has it all and you're like, that guy's so happy. He's got everything. You don't know what's going through that guy. I mean, how many times have we seen the guy who has a world and just throws it all away? Yeah. All the time. All the time. Look at all those fucking bankers committing suicide right now. You know about that? They're just throwing themselves off of buildings. Look at it. It's gotta be a horrible line. Like, man, I remember a couple of years ago, I was, I had some going out the bank where my bank was like, they had this policy where they told you that they were helping you out that you could overdraw your account. But if you overdraw your account, it was like $50 a day to cover that overdraft plus the money, you know, that you went over. Loan sharking. So I didn't know that and I didn't know my account went over and like it was like a week till I learned that or say like it was some crazy number. It was got up to three, four hundred dollars at the time. I didn't really have that. Yeah. And I went in there and like you tried to talk to this guy and connect on some kind of human level and there was no connection there and he refused to connect. Yeah. He's like, well, you know, honestly, I can't feel really bad for you. I think you knew what you're doing and you're like, man, on a human level, bro, do you know what you're saying to somebody? But just imagine that like doing that to people over and every day, all the time. It's got to kill your soul. Kills you. Yeah. It crushes you. Anything that involves dehumanizing the rest of your species so that you could make a fucking buck is and especially the thing is, it's like, not only are you like generating cash from dehumanizing people, taking advantage of them, tricking them, luring them into weird little financial traps that most of them don't have the intellect or the discipline to even understand, but the money that you're generating and then you're using to try to pleasure yourself is not really pleasuring yourself because they get, but they get to the exact place that we were just talking about is they're floating out in their yacht on the Caspian Sea or wherever they float, or is there like enjoying whatever the most sumptuous thing ever after having backstabbed and sucked the lifeblood of their brothers and sisters. They float out there and they realize I am just as miserable as I was when I started. And that's, that's, see, that's the great deception. That's the great deception of the world. That's why in Hinduism, they call the world Maya illusion, active illusion. It's like a, it's a personified illusionary force that tries to distract you from realizing that in this very moment, you are experiencing the pure crackling potential energy of the entire universe, which is manifested as you. And that's it, man. What are you going to do after that? Like really, what are you going to do after that? You're a billion year old, billions of years old, what you're composed of, and you woke up. That's a good enough accomplishment. You can retire now, congratulations universe. You became aware of yourself. Yeah. Good enough. How crazy is that? It's crazy, man. And the other thing is, man, the other thing that you have to realize on a, on a less fantastic level is, uh, the thing I'm realizing is it's like, I've started exercising again. I've started writing again. I've started, uh, uh, focusing again. And, and I stopped all that because I got into my head and I started thinking like, well, you know what, man, if you're not in shape now, probably not really going to get in shape. It's kind of over for you because you should have been working out for the last 10 years. Yeah. There was a thing on Reddit. Actually, somebody. I need to go and write it more. You got to go and write it. I don't know why. I've never jumped on a Reddit band and I need to. You got to go on Reddit. It's they have this thing called like, uh, shit, and I can't believe I can't remember the name. It's like advice mallard. It's a duck that gives usually good advice, but this particular, it's like a picture of a duck. And then there's some cool advice. You know, like don't put toothpaste on your asshole or some obvious thing. You shouldn't. I don't think you should. I think it burn, but it said this bit of advice was, um, that is weird. Why wouldn't you do that? You brush your teeth. Yeah. This was, um, you know, kid, you know, start working out now. I wish I, you know, 15 years start working out before you get into your thirties because it's much harder to work out, start working out now. And it's like, fuck that advice, because that advice is like this discouraging people from doing what? Right. The whole thing is, man, you right now, there's no better time to start than right now. This is it. Whatever day it is, whatever day it is, because it's like, just because you haven't. Doesn't mean then, then you're like, well, I'm just going to continue being a habit instead of just doing it now, just do it. It's mind blowing when you realize that there are no traps except the traps that you're imposing on yourself. Yes. That's so true. It's wild. And every time you come to that is where happiness is. That's where to me is where I can like store, kind of start zooming in on some little bit of happiness is just realizing like, shit, I'm completely free right now. I can discard everything, throw off my persona, give up all the different ideas of the way that I am. Oh, this is who I am. You know, I start things that I don't finish and I don't really apply myself when things get too difficult. I just give up or I smoke weed every day or I don't smoke weed every day. Do you smoke weed every day? I have been a little bit, but I actually moderate it. So I'll go on binges, like weed binges of smoking it every day and then I'll stop for like a week. And then when I start screaming at people in rage, I'll get back on weed. By the way, around this house, a lot of crazy drivers. People love to cut. Have you ever noticed this around here? It happened to me three times just trying to get to your house. Oh, man. No, no, no. There's always like every month, there's a monthly fucking wreck right out there. It makes sense because people don't want to wait. If there's like a little break of the going through the intersection, people will try to do a hard left fast. Yeah. I saw happen like three times. I'm like, people hitting each other. There's a crazy drivers around here, man. I'm sorry to get off on your awesome tangent. That was really good. I don't care. It's fine, man. But, um, yeah, that's the that's the back to the whole thing that I was talking about. I was so depressed, dude. I was crippling depressed. I didn't answer my phone. I didn't talk to anybody crippling depression, thinking about maybe I should move home, start driving a Uber or a taxi was really in that mode to like call it a day. Yes. And then Saturday night, I just literally had one of the best nights of my life. It just a million things, great things happen that never happened before. I got to do stuff that I've never been able to before and was blessed to get access to go do and just, you know, was back to being happy about what I have, man. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, man, I know friends of mine who've made tens of millions of dollars that go to therapy. Sure. Tens of millions of dollars. Yeah. That go to therapy. They've done what you think people want to do when they come to Los Angeles and they're going to therapy. Well, it can't work. You can't fix this thing. We're talking about a basically like there's a lot of different comparisons people use for this, like this problem, a lot of ways people try to describe this terrible problem. And some people say that's it, man. That sense of disease that you think you can get rid of. That's called being a human being. Yeah. That anxiety feeling, that terror, that fear. These are the existentialists. This is like Camus, who's like this thing that you're dealing with Camus a person Camus. Yeah. Camus. He's an amazing writer, philosopher. He's fucking incredible. That's a great name. Camus. Yeah. And he was a badass, traveled around the world, wrote all these great travel essays, wrote an incredible essay called The Myth of Sisyphus, which is basically sort of breaking down the story of Sisyphus who has to push the boulder up to the top of the hill and watch it roll down and push it up and watch it roll down and the comparison is that's what every human being either overtly recognizes, which is that it doesn't matter what you build in this world. It doesn't matter what you do. The sun's going to supernova and all your effort is going to be infinitely obliterated. So when realizing that and not just the sun supernovaing, it's just like you're going to expire. You're, you know, riding around in a sandwich that's outside of a Ziploc bag and it's going to fucking rock and you have to deal with that. You know, you are a moldering sandwich laying on the beach of time and you've got to deal with the fact that whatever you say or whatever you do, you're just surrounded by a lot of other moldering sandwiches. Yep. You're all going to turn into sand. There's going to be some kind of glaciation that's going to completely eradicate any trace of your civilization over the course of a few million years and all is for naught. If the purpose of your action is for some benefit for yourself or the insane notion that what you're doing is going to have some eternal or perpetual. Yes. So the question is, and that's where the depression and misery comes in is when people realize that once they get all these big accomplishments, they're right where they started. Itch has not been scratched. It's like they spent nine years, 15 years constructing the most high tech, bad ass back scratcher that they think is going to get right into that place. They can't reach and scratch that itch and the pain and suffering and anxiety and guilt and horror of existing in the great void of space is going to be eradicated. I agree. They would present them with this back scratcher. Here's your award, the back scratcher and that fucking thing doesn't work at all. The itch is still there. It doesn't work. So this is where we get into the fucking meat of the thing, man, which is how the fuck do we find meaning in our lives in this kind of the dynamic? Right. That is it. That is the whole thing. How do you find and that's why I say is the difference between happiness and peace. You know, the fine people think they got, I think we teach children happiness all the time. You got to be happy. Your job got to make you happy. Have find a happy job. Find a happy marriage. Find it. You know, it's like, and those aren't real things. I'm not saying you can't be happy in your marriage. That's not what I'm saying. But the notion that you have to be happy doing something is a very new thing. My grandfather, my father, their jobs, they weren't happy. They just went to work. Yeah. They're at peace at what they had to do. People have gotten away from that, right? That the whole thing is that they got to be happy doing what they do. Brilliant. And it's just like, that's a totally the wrong way of looking at everything. You got to be at peace. Happy. Yeah, I'm just thinking about happy that fucking term, man. Yeah, happy. Yeah, it's like it's like French fries or something. It's like high carb, high calorie, and it's fleeting. Absolutely. It's here today, gone tomorrow. Absolutely. Everything's fleeting. You know, that's true. And it's like that then then what ends up happening is like. People, but people get on this very selfish quest for happiness. Right. You know, when you're like when you're around somebody and they've decided they're going to find themselves, but to find themselves, somehow it means turning their back on everyone around them and their narcissistic desperate to try to like to try to like pleasure themselves under the some speed, the ausp, the spiritual, like they put it under kind of kind of spiritual thing. You just don't understand. I've got to find myself. Usually that just means going around and like fucking a bunch of people until they get like pregnant and I shoot themselves. It's like you're you're not going to find it. You know, find yourself. Good luck, man. Guess what? There ain't no self. Yeah. What what is find yourself? You are. You're you who you are. Yeah, I you want to find yourself. Go look in the mirror. There you are. Helping people, helping your fellow man is the most and it's enlightening shit you could do. And nobody does it. Yeah. Do you do you do that? Yeah, dude, I do charity events a lot. I you know, I through like, you know, I've struggled with drugs and alcohol, man, a lot. I struggle a lot and I, you know, I through those programs, I meet a lot of people and I try to help them, you know, write their lives from the grips of drugs and alcohol, the best that I can whenever I can. I'm not perfect at it, man. I know people who just like wake up at seven in the morning, go feed homeless people all day, which is like, which is inspiring shit. Yeah, man. But what you're doing is is I mean, that that is like you're literally like wrenching people out of the grip of demons. Yeah, man. It's I've been there, dude. I've been there where, you know, it's like I'm blessed. I've never gotten to do some stuff where it's like, you know, like heroin. He's your problem. You know, a bunch of a blow cocaine coke and Jack Daniels. Wow. I want to be the dude. All I wanted to be was Led Zeppelin, dude. I want to be Led Zeppelin on tour and I lived in and then you combine that with, you know, the whole just for lack of better word, chuckle fuckers out there, you know, with all the girls who just came to the club and all that stuff. It just it was just all my vices just kind of got together. What a what a perfect storm, funny, on cocaine. Yeah. Drunk. Yeah. With girls who want to fuck you. Yeah. And you know, people hear this. Some people might hear this and be like, what's wrong with that? And there are some people who can put it in its place and are fine with it. And, you know, they can walk away from it, lose it. But but when your job every day is to go to a club and be a liquor pimp, yeah, all we do is sell booze, dude. That's all we are. We think it's about writing these jokes. Yeah, it's about pushing boo boo's hypnotists. Well, yeah, that's all we are is drink up, drink up, drink up. So these people going out to these comedy clubs, that is their night. Yes. That is the night they've been planning on for two weeks. Yes, we're going to go out. We're going to see the show and it's going to be awesome. Yes. You know, especially if you come to a Tripoli live show. Yeah. I love chaos, bro. I give more bang from your buck, dude. Some people are just a little weird by it. They're like, oh, that's a little too much. Not me, dude. Short of burning the place down. I just want chaos. Yeah, you're one of these. You're the type of comic that like I like you're you're burning like. You must be burning like marathon level calories. I love it. You're just exploding with energy up there. It's amazing to watch. I love it. Yeah, and no shows ever the same. Yeah, it's cool. Yeah, man, I love the way you do stand up. It's really like it's so energetic. You crush. It's really cool, man. You're you're impossible to follow. No, not at all. Kind of. Not at all. Kind of. You're great, though, man. You're really, really good at it. And and. Yeah, so it's not like you're just fucking pimping booze, man. You're making people happy. But you're happy. But at the end of the day, you've got to sell liquor, you know, which is fine. But the point, the reason I bring that up is like so people go while shown that afterwards they want to keep the party going. So that's like every night. You know, I don't do stand up in libraries, you know, I don't do stand up at Starbucks and if you're an addict, there's no better excuse to continue using than to tie it in with your career. Like so many people, they have managed to tie in whatever their addiction is with they've managed to trick themselves into thinking that the only way to extract milk from whatever nipple they're suckling at is to be simultaneously poisoning themselves or like or like putting some kind of chemical into their bloodstream. That's for sure, man. That's for sure. It's a tricky son of a bitch. Yeah, it is. You have to be very carefully. You have to be very, very careful. Then plus, dude, I do like to create like I'll do a naughty show here and there. And then that just takes whatever we're talking about, amplifies it by a thousand. But you must always be dealing with this suck. The the sucking with the thing trying to pull you. Oh, yeah, I got a bad lot all the time. You do a show with porn stars. And even though mostly porn stars are known for their sobriety, some of them aren't sober at all. A lot of them are really into drugs. Well, you know, what's so funny about that is that they're they're weird people. They're they're interesting people because it's now at a point. Porn is a lot like comedy in that there used to be this Wild West time. Yes, where it was like all the rebels and all the crazy and everything went nuts and everybody died of drug overdoses. And it was like live now, die young, you know. Then now it's like this. There's a very much a corporate feel to it where it's like, got to go to work. I got a job. I got to focus. I've heard of like porn star agents drug testing their clients. They've flunked drug tests or kicked out of the agency. It's a very focused thing. I know I'm not saying they're perfect people and I'm not saying they're bad people either. They are who they are. They they they really are business people, man. I always wonder that, man, like when I watch porn and I like you see like a professional porn star fucking and like when you watch that, you're thinking like this is the strangest business, man, because it's like they need to have an orgasm. Like they need to come because people want to see that. They want to film the or they want to see the orgasm. You mean the guy? Both. Right. And and and so you're you're experiencing this kind of like the ultimate pleasure. You're screwing around with like the the the energy that you're dealing with is the energy that brings human life. Right. Into planet Earth. Right. You know, so you're playing around with like most primal things, primal life producing energy and then if you don't really get into it in an authentic way, then your work isn't going to be as good as if somehow you've managed to completely be in the moment, throw off all of the societal pressures. Forget about whatever it is that you have to do later that day or that week. You've got to be like you. The best scene would be you having sex as though you were having sex with your soulmate right on the on the greatest. They have to be into it. They have to be into it. Yeah. So there's something in that act that is like so magical and so beautiful while being simultaneously blasphemous. That's why their award shows, bro. Yeah. They got to be the best actresses at it and they got to sell it and they got to be into it. But that's a funny you want to believe they want that they're loving it. Yeah. Yeah. You want to believe that they're loving it. Yes. And they want to have it. I want to believe the people I'm having sex with or loving it. But quite often, I suspect that's not the case. I just, you know, something about, you know, there's I do the naughty show, which is kind of this premier version of this kind of genre of comedy and entertainment. Yeah. In my eyes, I think it's the best of what it is. Yeah. And then there's offshoot. There's people who do their own things. And there's some people go way more on the sex version of it. Yes. The naughty show isn't really, in my opinion, I could be wrong, isn't a sex show. My show is more about the rock and roll, the underground rock and rollers that people could never get on the tonight show, you know, that, you know, they're too crazy. You know, they're not corporate act. That's who the naughty shows about. But there's people who do their version of it. I'm not saying they're taking it from by any means. I'm just saying they're doing their own version of it. And it's all sexual. It's just all sex. That is so boring. It is boring because if you think about sex, man, how much of it is? How much of your day is dedicated to sex? Five minutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, whatever it is. It's not hours upon hours where it should be the whole thing you talk about. Right. And I think that's what a lot of people get away from, is that they people think sex value, people value sex, maybe, or put too much value on it when it really is just a small part of what you do. Yeah, man, I, you know, I, um, yeah. Well, it's incredible, the, the, the, the weightiness of this, of the sex drive. It's incredible, the, the, the gravity that it has. And especially when you do recognize that, man, I mean, you know, on my best day, we're talking like, what, half an hour, half an hour? An hour with a lot of foreplay. A lot of foreplay, a lot of foreplay, a lot of whips and chains. Yeah, yes. But, but, um, the, the, you know, this is where you get into the, I had a philosophy of professor in college who was into tantric sex, which is something a lot of people like to talk about, that they don't know anything about, me included. I, but I, except we know, like, Sting was apparently into it. We know that, like, it's a, it's, it's apparently a spiritual practice where you use sex to try to reach heightened states of awareness. And people have tantric sex for hours and hours and hours, just like meditation. So like the idea is like, you, you know, you, you sit in a certain position. You can see statues of it on the internet of, of like the tantric sex position where like you're sitting down, your girlfriend sitting on top of you. You're both kind of like, you know, sitting upright, looking into each other's eyes. And then you're going into this sort, you're not doing like in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, you know, which is like, what a lot of people do. You imitate, you watch porn or you watch dogs. Fuck. And you think, okay, that's how you fuck, you know, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out. And in that process, your mind is going crazy. You're like, I don't want to come, don't come, don't come. You're feeling so good. And then you're like simultaneous, like, oh my God, she's so beautiful. I hope this feels good for her. You're thinking about all those things. And then they were thinking about things too. They're worried about this and that, or they say it's a whole, it can become, if you're not careful in erotic mess. So like the, um, this is a practice where you're like having sex slowly and breathing and you're mirroring each other's breath. So like the idea is like you've created a circuit, right? Which is that your energy, when you are inside of some, I mean, just touching somebody you've created a circuit, right? But when your cock is inside of them, yes, and you are on the precipice of potentially creating human life, you are engaged in one of the most potent occult rituals known to man, it's more powerful than building. It's the ritual that created electricity, because if not for that ritual, there wouldn't be a Tesla wandering around who came up with alternating current. It's the ritual that created the theory of relativity. And every human innovation started with come. That's the way it goes, man. You're such an interesting dude. So when you're having sex, you're engaged in this super potent ritual. And so Tantra is this idea of like, instead of like even trying to orgasm or come, you're not, you're just trying to focus on this connection that's happening, this super high powered, pleasurable connection. And then you learn how to like, apparently breathe in. So like you have this circuit going, right? So that feeling, that thing that builds inside of you, when you think you're about to come, that is an energy. Yes. So what you're trying to do is build that energy and then breathe it or move it. It starts at your balls. Move it into your first chakra. You see your second chakra. Second. Second chakras in your balls. You're, no, that's your, your first chakra is at the perennium, which is your taint right between your balls and your asshole. And that chakra is all about, um, it's called the root chakra. It's all about being like, it's all about survival. Right. And then I believe it's your second chakra is the sex chakra. Right. And so you're like, but you're dealing with what you're trying to do here is you're trying to use that orgasmic energy to, to bring it through the entire chakra system and into the other person who's amplifying it. So you're sort of like creating. Oh yeah, man. That's why boxers are told not to have sex before a match. Right. They don't want to give their chi away, man. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. That's the idea. The whole thing is that, you know, back in the day, women take, it takes, uh, they take men's cheese. Cheese. Chee, right? Give me my cheese. Give me the, it's all about the cheese. Well, you know, man, it is, there is something to be said for, like, um, for not always constantly, you know, beating off people are worried about premature ejaculation, right? Right. It's like, there's a lot of forms of premature ejaculation that don't involve jazz, like how many times have you said something before it was time for you to say it, or how many times have you like not been strategic in some activity that you're engaged in, or how many times have you gotten high too much when you should have been like, hold off, if you don't get high, store my life so much better, right, right. So it's like, yeah. So Tantra is sort of the condensed encapsulation of a good life. You know, learning to control it. Yeah. Learning to control it so that you could heighten the pleasure. Yep. Not control it so that you can like, negate pleasure, like pleasure is bad. It's like, let's take a look at this fucking thing where usually when people get engaged in it, they lose their minds, literally. Oh my God. Okay. Oh fuck. Oh my God. You're losing your mind. You're in the psychotic seizure of pleasure. It's like, calm down for a second. Have you read the hip, the happiness hypothesis? No, I haven't. It's a really good book. And it basically talks about how like, man is basically an elephant and a rider and like, your mind is the rider and your body is the elephant. And you, the rider needs to learn how to control the elephant. Yeah. And that's kind of what you're talking about. You, how you can control basically this primal part of yourself mentally, yeah, not to, you know, ejaculate too earlier, you know, do anything to her to control and be calm and be in the moment and not like overthink everything. And, you know, just go spastic on something. That's really what's about training yourself and giving your ideas. It's like, so like you're, since this is engaged with another person, what you're trying to do is focus on just giving the pleasure to the other person, this energy, you're passing it to the other person. And then in the higher levels of it, apparently you imagine that the other person is God. And, and so, or, so now you're like actually having sex with an entire universe, which you are, when you're having sex, you are putting your penis inside of something composed of atoms that are at least six billion years old. So you are like merging universes, which by the way, that's what they say. The fucking big bang was, is like, there's millions of universes in one universe, bumped into another universe and exploded into that universe. So when you're having sex, you know what you're doing? You're recreating the big bang and the, and the, and the, and my fireworks fireworks. This is why porn is fascinating. And this is why there's a lot of controversy around porn. And this is why a lot of people controversy, sure. People say that you shouldn't masturbate to porn all the time. People, it's like a rising trend out there is like, people say that, uh, pornography is having negative impacts on people because it's, it's like, you know, I've talked to girls who like, you know, they, they hook up with a guy finally and the guy's like choking them or trying to like gag them with its cock or like trying to come in their eyeballs or like, you know, being really rough with them right away without asking if this is cool, because the poor, lonely, reclusive son of a bitch has been getting conditioned by porn for the last five years and has actually managed to believe that that's what a woman wants right away. I'll tell you, man, porn and religious porn and romantic comedies have ruined relationships. Yes. Yes. I mean, people will never admit it, but romantic comedies are the same thing to for women. I mean, this view of what romance should be and what love should be. Like daytime television is the same thing. I don't know if you watch a lot of daytime TV, but there's a lot of co-signing on women's bullshit. Now I'll tell you guys have a lot of bullshit, you know, and that's for sure, but there's a lot of co-signing on bullshit too. You know, it's like you watch some morning talk shows talking to Kurt Fox about this. It's like, you know, these daytime talk shows, you have some woman who like married a guy at like a hundred pounds and then bloomed up to 300. And then then they bring the guy and it's like, why aren't you making love to your girlfriend? And they put it on him. They should accept her. However, however she is, but it's like, well, what about his needs and what he's attracted to and all that stuff? Yeah. It's a co-signing of the bullshit, which is kind of what porn does for guys. Like this whole thought, like most of your pornography is like this chick needs dick. Yeah. She needs dick or she'll die. Yes. And you've got to give her the dick. And she's so thankful. Like she didn't want it at first, but when she got it, she realized how great it was. And, you know, it's just total bullshit too. You know, it's like, so it goes both ways in that, but it's like a lot of co-signing off on bullshit. Yeah. And it's also, you're looking at this. This is one thing, man. I wish somebody would make porn that starts when the porn ends. The next scene. And then she's like, dude, a pregnancy test. She's fucking got it. Not just when they're having like coffee afterwards. Or I want to see the awkward hour after the crazy sex they just had. I want to see the light conversation afterwards. And then I want to see both of them going their separate ways. Her driving in the car, picking her nose, him like sitting by himself in his house, trying to decide, well, what do I do now? I mean, that was that. But now I'm stuck back being human. Yeah. That's that to me is interesting. That's the trick of porn is and also romcoms is that it doesn't show the credits role on the wedding scene. Show me two years later. Yeah. Show me three years later. Show me six years later. That's what I want to see. I want to see a romcom six years later. I want to see the sequel six years fucking later. And it goes back to that whole notion of happiness versus peacefulness. Yes, it does. And it goes back to. Yes. And also it goes back to the notion of. Yes, we've been taught to seek out these moments. That they're these moments that were that we try to get to these little peaks. We're always ascending. We get to a little peak. In that peak, sex, career stuff, accomplishment, drugs, whatever it is. That's where we're really living. But the climbing up to the peak, somehow, we're we're not even there. Yeah, like on the road, like when you're driving, even though most people spend the majority of their fucking day driving, a lot of us do, somehow you're not really there. You're just trying to get from point A to point B. That drive is just like a kind of static moment in your life. Like the music is stopped during that moment. Yeah. So the thing you're talking about is overcoming this addiction to the to the delusion that there's this these moments of condensed happiness is going for and just realize that the whole the whole thing is spectacular. Is it though there is boredom, there is sadness, there is suffering, there is anxiety, there is depression and that's life. And that's the biggest thing I've learned about, you know, being someone who's sober and, you know, dealing with the sobriety, dealing with life being sober. And this notion that if I cut out drugs and alcohol in my life, that everything I've ever wanted in the world is going to happen and that there will be nothing but sunshine and blue skies. And that's not the truth. The thing that, you know, that's going to happen is you're going to be able to live life and life has some good moments and life has some dark moments. And you've got to come to grips with those dark moments. It's going to happen to everybody at all times. There's not a person that's playing it that hasn't had a down moment. Nope. In a moment where they're like, what? Why is why is life shitting on my chest? Yeah, I guarantee the Dalai Lama had that moment going, why are you shitting on my chest? I did his fucking homeland was taken over by the goddamn Chinese. Right. He's had the Chinese. You know, the Dalai Lama is the fucking bin Laden of the Chinese. Did you know that they look at him the way we look at bin Laden? Unbelievable. They didn't want fucking Obama to meet with him. They look at him as a terrorist. The Dalai Lama is a terrible, unbelievable thing about that. You're right, man. You're absolutely right. This is a fundamental component of the human experience is that we aren't going to be happy all the time. All the time. I don't care who you are. I don't care if you had an abundance of money to do anything you want with all the time. You will get depressed at some point. Yes, just life. Shit's going to happen. You know, I'm dealing with this situation right now with a friend of mine who all they want is life on life's terms on their terms. And that is not life. Right. You can't dictate life. Right. You can't. You can't force everybody. Life is not a play that you are choreographing. No, you can't. Hey, Duncan, I need you to do this at this time. You got to do that, right? Because this is my life and I'm controlling it. You can't. You got to have life on life's terms. And sometimes those terms can be a little bit down now. And it's how you deal with those that determine whether you you get through them. Right. Because some people focus on those negative things. And that becomes a focal point of their life. And then they run around going, why is fucking life shitting on my chest? I'm meditating. I'm sober. I'm drinking water all the time. I did a detox diet. I've been nice to dogs. I'm helping homeless, yet I still feel terrible. Yes, it happens. It. Well, yeah, it's like, yeah, it's just right. And it's the resistance to that sense of anxiety. That's the big problem, isn't it? It's the fact that when it's it's the idea that if you're feeling bad, you must be doing something right. And that's all therapy is is deprogramming you from that. You go to therapy. I did for a short time, and I would go back. I'm not necessarily saying it's not good. It's good sometimes just to be able to talk to somebody and they got to listen. Yeah. You know, in Los Angeles, if you just try to talk to some friend about what's going on in your life, they immediately talk about how their life is worse than that. Yeah. You're like, that's not what I want to talk about. I want to just talk. I just want it sometimes good to get it out. Yeah. But with therapists, you can just dump on them. Yes. And they got to deal with it. They do. But really what they're doing is just decoding your programming that you got to be happy. Right. Yeah. Yeah, man. I what was it? Freud said something about like how to the idea of therapy is to get to a normal level of suffering. Yeah. It's like, yeah. And that is, you know, in Buddhism, they talk about this. They call it that. I can't remember. There's a great name for it, like fundamental unhappiness or something. Like just in just being human itself, you're going to feel bad. And so that's the first you're going to feel lonely. You're going to feel sad. You're going to feel distracted. You're going to feel confused. You're going to feel anxious. That's just what it is to be alive. That's to be alive, man. So take it easy on yourself. Yeah. If you're feeling so goddamn bad, stop thinking that you're doing something wrong or that there's a demon, you know, riding around on your back, punching you in the head and just realize, like, no, you feel bad because that's just what it is to be alive. That's just part of what it is. And you and that's called surrender. That's what they call surrender. I pull comedian young comics. Well, they pull me aside and they're always like, what advice can you give me? Which always makes me feel old. If you give yourself good advice when you were young, I'm like, OK, OK, I'll forget that you just called me old. What advice would you give me? And the advice I always say is this. Nothing matters. You're not as high as your best set. You're not as low as your worst set. You can go into an audition, kill it and not get called back. You can bomb in an audition and they book you for the show. It doesn't matter. Don't fucking live and die by every fucking event in your life. That's great. It's the truth, man. I've seen it. What a relief. So many times. It nothing matters. It doesn't matter. You know, not getting into names or anything, but I've seen so many comics where I'm like, explain that to me, explain that career to me. There was a time when I'd be like, explain that career to me. You can't. It doesn't matter. You know, it's like it's like someone could be the worst comic world and have the greatest career ever or someone could be the greatest comic ever. And no one's ever heard of him. Right. And he will never because it's just it is what it is. Yeah. So just, you know, live your life. Be happy with it. And that's really the truth. It's like a bunch of toddlers or a bunch of kids got together and they started playing a game and make believe I'm going to be a comic. You be a cop. You be a doctor. You be a president. Yeah. And it's like a weird comet flew over and made them all forget they were playing a game and make believe and they all started taking it so seriously. Can you imagine watching kids play like a game and make believe? And one of them starts weeping because the other one is like, well, I guess they do. Yeah, they do it all the time. Well, that's the tendency, man, because that is it is a game of make believe. It's like, I'm a comic. This is what I am. I'm a comic. I'm an artist. I'm a writer. I'm a doctor. I'm a laborer. I'm just somebody who works at a desk or I'm a fucking emperor. Whatever it is you think you are, you're the one deciding right. You're the one creating that in every moment. That's your baggage. I love what you're saying, man, because you're saying just let go of that. Yeah. It's like there is no rhyme or reason to any of it. Don't try to figure it out. Yeah. You know, it's just like it's just weird politics out of your hands. It's all out of your hands. I think that's the best thing I've ever learned getting sober is what a small part of the big world I am. And then not everybody's thinking about me all the 24 seven. And that just doesn't fucking matter. I'm just a small fucking speck of shit on the Earth's dick. Oh, my God, you don't see. You know what, man, if you're a speck of shit on the Earth's dick, then the Earth is putting its dick in the right place because you're a wonderful person, man. Right. But my point is, it's like the universe isn't isn't isn't revolving around me. Thank God, how would a mess that would be? Well, who wants that kind of pressure? Nobody wants that like poor Putin right now and Obama and all these people who've managed to get in the front of this crazy god damn. I was doing stand up last night at the comedy store. Please tell me Putin was there. No, he he canceled. So I got a spot. He's why the way you saw Putin, please allow me or Putin is hilarious for you guys who don't know. He used to do stay started off at the comedy, you know, it's cool. He's bringing back prop comedy. I love his thing with a beaver. Yeah, right? It's like, dude, why isn't anyone doing that? I don't know. It's back. But he's got to want to get back into the stand up with his shirt off. It's so crazy, guys. If you ever get a chance to see Vladimir Putin perform because I guarantee he's going to get back into it after this Ukraine shit. Oh, yeah, dude, this is the press. He needed to launch it. Yeah, I think that's what I'm starting to think this whole thing in the Ukraine is about Twitter followers. Yeah, his Twitter followers have gone up. Tell me, here's the thing, man, I was doing this set last night and I was talking to this guy and I just asked the guy, what's your nationality? And he goes, Mexico, do you speak it? He goes, none. So I go, what generation are you? Are you Home Depot generation? You know, a lot maintenance generation or middle management and Verizon wireless generation. And everybody laughed. He laughed. This woman just goes and I could see her whispering like how offended she was. Yeah, by this stupid fucking joke. I go, lady, are you offended? She goes, yeah, you know, not that wasn't very funny. I go, ma'am, right now there's a war about to go on in the Ukraine. Women, children who have nothing to do with it are going to die. Save your anger for that. Yeah, because that's something really to get offended about. Yeah, you're in a fucking nightclub. We're known for cocaine and mobsters shooting people and it's a comedy show. It's a joke. He's laughing. They're having fun. What do you how do you know? What do you know about? Are you Mexican? She's like, no, I'm from Venezuela. I go, another thing, a white chick fucking thinking Venezuelans and Mexicans are the same people. You know, that's offensive right there. And you just go into it. It's like it's jokes, man. Don't take it all so serious. Yeah, man, I this poor kid to I don't know how it how to. I tweeted, I yelled at a pregnant lady and I tweeted. I yelled just yelled at a pregnant lady because I couldn't believe in for real, for real life, for real. I yelled a pregnant lady and I'd like honest to God, man, that day I had been speaking of like helping people. Like I saw this YouTube video. I've talked about too much in this podcast, but like I'd like been doing some shit like giving stuff out to the homeless and I was feeling really like fucking holy, dude. Like I felt now I can't believe that you just one second. You just teed off on some chick. I'm walking my dog. No, I'm jogging. OK, jogging. So I'm having this great day. I'm in control, man. And like I've been meditating. I'm feeling really like really like high level consciousness in tune with the with the angels. I'm jogging into my jog. This pregnant lady comes patting down the path with a big fucking dog off leash next to her. She's on her phone, not paying attention to the dog. The dog comes running right up to me. Oh, and dude, that's some scary shit. I've been growling at me and because it's pretty she's pregnant. Dogs know when people are pregnant. So that poor dog just feels like he's got to protect this moron who's not paying attention to anything. She's on the phone patting down a path with a living being growing inside of her. And the dog's probably like, God damn it, any one of these people could kill you and eat the baby because that's what dogs do. Yeah, they're just lovers. So it's growling at me. And so I, you know, I was like, ah, and so I scream, I just came out of me. I scream, I'm like, get your fucking dog on a leash, idiot. And like, because if the dog, you know, I'm not I'm trying to justify it, but if the dog bites you, right, that dog, they'll put it down. Yeah, 100% anyway, it doesn't matter. No excuse. You shouldn't yell at pregnant ladies. Shouldn't. Well, yeah, you shouldn't yell at anybody. And I tweeted, just yelled at a pregnant lady and some poor kid. What was it? He tweeted back to me. He just is some kid, man. He's like in high school and he was trying to be funny and he tweeted back. What was she fucking breastfeeding in public? Kind of funny. You know what I mean? Like, of course, I'd never yell at someone breastfeeding in public. No one cares about that busy beating off. Yeah, there you go. That's that would see. And the response, though, I don't know. Someone following me is like one of these like feminist bloggers who feel like they've got to like defend language. And so all of a sudden this woman is writing to him like that is crass and unfunny and the kids like, oh, you know, I was just joking. It just is a real joke. I really don't care about that stuff. And then another one piles on and another one, somebody tweeted to him. You should know that's what stays on. It goes on the internet stays on the internet forever. And then I wrote, oh, yeah, I'm sure he's like his career is destroyed. Yeah, from tweeting that. And they're like, well, it might hurt him from getting a job. This kid keeps writing back in this really logical way. Like I didn't mean any harm by it. I thought it would be a might keep him from getting a job. Like why would you even threaten that? Why is that? Why is it that these people want to take away freedom? Both sides, both the far, far left and the far, far right. Just all they want to do is take away freedoms of people to create a utopia in their fucking eyes. Well, I mean, also, what's more lazy than that level of Twitter activism by directly confronting a teen teen, you think you're going to you're going to do anything to affect the very valid cause of women who think they should be allowed to breastfeed in public. I don't know if that's illegal or not, but obviously that should happen. There's nothing wrong with it. It's it's the most primal of things you could do a mother feeding its child. Beautiful thing to do. It should be done everywhere. Even if you don't, I completely agree. Don't have a baby. You should be breastfeeding anything. I try to feed kids all the time. I shouldn't be limited to women. Yeah, that's ridiculous. Like I thought it shouldn't be. Am I allowed to get plan B? No, it's injections. There should be some new implants. I was a pill. Oh, what do you mean? Plan B, the plan B, the birth control pill. Yeah. If you have if you get pregnant, you take it in the in the it kills the pregnancy. Oh, I thought plan B was something that you take as a pill. Like girls go to the pharmacy and they buy plan B and they take it. Can I buy it? You can have plan B on hand. I can. Probably not the most romantic thing to have out on your mantle. Hey, darling, there's my plan B. Well, what I do is I crush it up and I act like it's cocaine. I haven't do rails. Oh, God, you just offended me. You say, I'm triple E. I love being offended. It's fun. Anytime I get offended, it's like, that's life, dude. Kind of rushed to get that's such life. I mean, that's not real to think that everyone can love be like that one person is the comedy police and that because you didn't like it's wrong. It's like, so what? I guarantee that whatever your cause is, if you're trying to battle comedians for the sake of your cause, you're guaranteed you're going in the wrong direction there and you're not doing it in a smart way. It's like there's really clever ways to get across a lot of the things that people are trying to get across that don't involve directly confronting people who have the same mentality. I completely agree. High school teenagers have, which is like, oh, you're offended. Oh, I'm going to turn the volume up to 700 now. It's not going to work. It's like you can. There's all these things are really valid, you know, but it's just like the cause, the reason, the reason you have to decide what are you doing? This is the thing that these people have taught me, the love server, Raghu Marcus and Ramdas and the great teachers, they always teach again and again and again this idea, which is that we are all one thing. Yes, we're all one thing. And the impulse to divide and fight and create them and us, it doesn't work. It never works. The idea is how can we figure out a way instead of you're you and I'm a me and I'm right and you're wrong? How can we figure out a way to like not to overcome? There's parts of Africa where they're fighting and it's like because they they basically you tell difference by their noses. If you have a different type of nose, you're one side. Right. And they're just killing each other. Yeah, it's amazing. And they and it's absurdity. It's absurd. It is absurdity. And it's just like my theory that deep down side, 99% of the people in the world would love to be a third world dictator. They would love to just run and control everything and tell everybody what to do. And you just see it, man. It's like what is this whole thing about reality stars in particular? You know, it's like reality stars are just like people just want to be third world dictator. They just want to be famous for nothing and they want people to give them money and give them shit. And they don't want to have to have any particular skill or nothing. They just want to be famous for waking up in the morning. Look at what you just said, man. It's so smart. If you, this is the task, realize what part of you is the third world dictator and start rehabilitating that. Just do that. Cause I know exactly exactly what you mean. I am a third world dictator sometimes. Sometimes I seek vengeance or someone will wrong me and iron fist iron fist. My enemy shall fall. Yes. Yeah, you're right, man. That's where you start. Don't turn. Don't look at Putin. Don't turn to the 17 year old who made a pregnancy joke on Twitter. Turn inside of yourself. 100% find that dictator living inside your brain. Find that little fucking medallion, the jeweled camouflage wearing cocaine smuggling third world dictator living inside of you and see if you can transform that into a sweetie. You know, watching the Oscars last night, you know, there's no difference between those ultra progressives that you see in that theater. And compared to the people who like run Hollywood, these old white guys, right? They're all the same, dude. They just want they just want people who around them to remind them how awesome they are or how awesome they think they are. Everybody in that theater, they're all the same people. Right. And then on the opposite end is it's all the same. People are in Washington, D.C. They're all the same. Yeah, they all have to think alike and they just get this packed mentality. You know, so you got this thing in Hollywood where it's like, oh, we're open mind. No, you're progressive and you have a very idealistic world view of what the world is and that's not reality. That's your particular view of the world and the people who fit into that world. You like to encourage and support. Same thing you like, let's say Nashville or Dallas, Texas or wherever, you know, it's like Atlanta, you just get packed mentalities of people who think alike. And that's the world that they believe in, you know, and it's just like the notion that the people who are at the Oscars are such fucking progressive people and open mind to everything is total bullshit. It's total bullshit, dude. It's all third world dictator bullshit. They open the mind like, hey, open mind to gay and minorities and everybody, blah, blah, blah, which I'm for. But the end of the day, they just really want them. They want them and they want them, the people like them to to have all the power and all the riches and all that stuff. Right. It's no different, man. It's no different. Hollywood is no different than Washington, D.C. And they're two totally different people on the end of the spectrum. And they all work exactly alike. And the trick is to find out where Hollywood and D.C. live inside of you. Yeah, find out where you're like that. Figure out where that is. Where people want a world, dude. And I said this on Rogan's podcast before. People want a world that plays to their strengths and outlaws their weaknesses. Well, and that's just the truth. Wow. Wow. That is cool, man. What's the world people should want? People should want a world where people are allowed to do what makes them happy, as long as they're not hurting other people. Right. It's like my view of sex. I really don't care what you do with consenting adults. I don't give any of it. If they are consenting adults, it should be perfectly acceptable. Of course. And now I'm not saying we should just all go around and telling everybody what we do. But there shouldn't be any kind of stigma attached to it. Right. That you're in the auto rock affixiation. Right. Right. Just get a spotter. That's all I ever say. Just get a spotter. Get a spotter because that's an embarrassing funeral. Yeah. Oh, dude, I do that joke about the guy who died having sex with a horse. I go magic on that funeral. Everybody crying from laughing so hard, which is all my new CD that should be out by the end of the week. Yeah. And you're going on tour soon, right? I'm very excited. Can I tell you what I'm doing? Oh, this is perfect, dude. I'm so thankful to be on your show, dude. Man, every time you come by, every time I go, man, I come on your show. I'm like, man, this is why this show is so fucking popular. Man, look, I feel like I'm going to get addicted to cocaine just so I can have you as my sponsor. Don't do it. Don't do it. I mean, dude, the whole reason cocaine is popular is because women like to do weird shit on it. Is that true? Yeah. That's the only reason everybody likes my audience. That's that's the only reason he doesn't mean it. Nobody wants to put chalk up their nose. So listen, on March 18th, I'm very excited. I'm going to be in Portland at the Fun House. I'm going to be with some very funny comics. Jonas Barnes, Christina Levine, Lonnie Buran and Lauren Petrie. So it's going to be a really funny show. If it's going to be at the Fun House, March 18th, Portland. Then the following night I'm in Seattle. I'm at the High Line with Darren Chase, Kelsey Cook. And I don't know if you've met this guy. Have you ever done Seattle with a Rogan with Rogan? Yeah, the voodoo chicken. Have you ever met voodoo chicken? No, I know voodoo chicken from Rogan's website. I think I did meet him once, but I'm not positive. He's getting with me. And you know, I've been very blessed at Bogart LA. Jessica Bogart. She's hooking up all these tours, put these tours together. She works really hard. It's going to be a lot of fun. So March 18th, I'm in Portland and March 19th, I'm in Seattle. I hope you guys can come out because I'm going to put on a crazy fucking show.

USAA means United Services Automobile Association and its affiliate, San Antonio, Texas. I'm sure you're familiar with it. It's that show about celebrity morticians. Kind of like Hell's Kitchen, but for morticians. And they were so turned on by my ability to French kiss that they agreed to give the DTFH an exclusive sneak peak of the next season of Forever Home. And here it is. Previously on Forever Home, Mortician Master Darius Weiss made history. For the first time ever, the morticians will be all stars. By inviting back 16 all-star morticians with the greatest prize ever on the line. One of you will become the head mortician at the brand new Forever Home Mortuary in Las Vegas. A new Forever Home Mortuary on the Vegas trip? You can roll the dice that I'm going to be the head mortician there. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas especially if you die in a bury there. I know if I win, you'll take my back. Stop singing. What these contestants don't know is that they aren't on Forever Home but are subjects in America's favorite government experiment show, Bohemian Grove. Eleven of the planet's top evil scientists have been assembled on an island in Florida and paired with eleven death row prisoners whose memories have been erased and replaced with artificial ones. They think they're contestants on a game show about celebrity morticians and have no idea they're on Bohemian Grove. Whichever scientist can transform their prisoner into the ultimate assassin will get invited to the Bohemian Grove. And now we join test subject David Glersen in his hotel room where he thinks he's having a private conversation with his terminally ill grandfather. Of course, it's not his grandfather. It's Professor Zeldik from Prader University who must keep Glersen from remembering his true identity. No, no, the show's going great, Grandpa. I had them bomb a dude who got run over by a crane today and, uh, your master mortician, Terry, said I made him look better than he did before he got ran over by that crane. That's great, Davey. You're always the best and baller in the family. Well, maybe it's the stress of the show or something, but, uh, I'm having these memories that aren't mine. Like what? Like, uh, like I was on death row or something. Did they put me there because I crucified a priest in a church and then burned it down? This is horrible. I feel like I'm losing my marbles, Gramps. Well, maybe it's the stress of the show. I'm thinking about quitting. You can't quit. You want to make your dying grandpa proud, don't you? Yeah, of course I do, Gramps. Good. Look, even if the memories were real, let's say, it's not so bad that you killed that priest. It's that you got caught. Look, just forget these phantom memories and get back to winning that show. Anyway, you can. What are you saying? I mean, anyway, you can. Those phantom memories, you should think of them like dreams and sometimes dreams show us things that we're capable of, things that we don't want to accept about ourselves. Yeah, you know, when you put it like that, Gramps, it did feel kind of good choking the life out of that dumb old priest. It was like, I was myself for a second. Only a brave man could admit that. It would be a shame if some of the other contestants had any accidents, little accidents that took them out of the show. Oh, yeah. Like, when I did that priest in that phantom memory, dragged him into a church, strangled him, burn the whole thing down. Yeah, but this time, you don't get caught. Life, like doing in secret, that's even better. And what's even better than that is if you're listening to this, you're on Bohemian Grove. You're having this podcast pumped into your consciousness while you lay in an induced coma, getting your memories white. Activate Kilgore Protocol. Activate Kilgore Protocol.

We talk about that in this episode and that's not all we talk about. We talk about how deep Judaism is. I mean, maybe it's impossible to talk about how deep it is, but I always have Buddhists on. I always have spiritualists on or comedians on, but I don't give the Jews enough DTFH time and that is doing everyone a disservice, especially me.

Dr. Ben Epstein. www.B kay. and don't forget to, go find a link to our channel www.B Anyway, Arina Makashar, with the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast www.DunkinTrussellFamilyHour.com We just bound ourselves through this service of this podcast to all the righteous people in our generation and to all the righteous who are no longer in the living with us but all attached in the vortex of life who reside in the earth and specifically our Tzadik, our Rabbi, the foundation of the world, the flowing brook, the source of wisdom, Rabbi Nachman bin Phega, Nachman the son of Phega, may their merit be a meritorious for us and for all of Israel in the world, amen. Cool, I love that. We started strong, we started strong. Y'all go so deep. It is wild. The language itself is so beautiful. You know what it sounds a little like and I'm sure the reason it sounds like that is because it was intentional, but we've been rewatching Game of Thrones and they speak High Valerian is what it's called. High Valerian. And that's definitely what it sounds like. It sounds so close to that that I have no question but whoever formulated that language was Jewish and could speak Hebrew and just took that. And speak to dragons. Yeah, well, yeah. My wife is definitely a Khaleesi, that's for sure. She's it, I think, I don't know. Well, here's something that I heard from someone on the Patreon, my friend Valo. He told me, and I don't know where he got the data from, but I found it to be so beautiful that the name of God, Yahweh, Yahweh, is actually, why, how do you spell it? There's no vowels in it. The English doesn't do it justice, but it's Yud, Hey, Vav, and Hey. Those are the four Hebrew letters that make up God's name and we could spend a lifetime on it. We could spend a lifetime on it. Well, let's start. He was telling me that, and I don't know where he got the data from, but it represents, it's the sound of breathing, that it's the exhalation and the inhalation. Have you heard this before? I've definitely seen this, you know, the Yud, because the Hey makes it like an H sound, and there are people who are doing Abulafian meditations with the different, and they're taking the letters and the way they, I'm not a linguist, the way we vowelize letters in Hebrew, they're like little dots, and the dots are the movements. These are the tenuot, the movements, and the quesufim, the longings, and so you'll take the Yud, the Y sound, and you'll do it with an ah, yah, and then each letter like that, and focusing on a different part of the body, and then an e, and each one of those vowels is also connected to a Kabbalistic sphere, is connected to loving kindness, or severity, or beauty and splendor, and all the other different ones. It's, yeah, taking it down. So is the tree of, no, not taking it down, I was making a gesture, thinking of like the tree of life. So is the tree of life somehow encapsulated in that name? Are we allowed to talk about midnight gospel, and the fact that you were going to animate me as a corned beef sandwich with earlocks, and that sort of thing? Yeah. Yeah, I would. Can that still happen? Can that still happen? No. Sadly, at least not as the midnight gospel. Have we processed this? Is this something that needs to be processed, or you've moved on, you're living in the moment, and it's just like, because people are broken hearted. Yeah. Well, I'm sorry about that. You know, I was bummed, but I knew, like, I mean, you know, you know if it's not happening again before they tell you it's not gonna happen. So I have plenty of time to sort of go through all the phases of grief, the stages of grief, mixed in with the gratitude that they let me make it, mixed in with, like, you know, a kind of pining over, like, man, I really wanted to get more into that world, and there was more of a story. But yeah, I mean, I'm sorry people are broken hearted about it. I think we all just have to be grateful that they let us make it. I mean, like, getting a show like that made is impossible. Like, the fact that they let us do it is just wild that they would be like, oh, yeah, sure, let's make this weird psychedelic, mystical, rambling thing. They let us do it. So that's to me, I'm happy with that. I remember when you tried to introduce, or you didn't try when you introduced it on Joe, and Joe Rogan, and, you know, he's just looking at it, like, how did you get them to green like this? I know, it's Pendleton. They wanted to work with Pendleton. He got us through the door. Yeah, so the name of God, this name of God, is, it's a map and a sound. It's the map, it's the sound, it's the building block. It's everything that every single Kabbalistic intention is going back to. And there's so many permutations, and there's so many combinations, and there's so many different systems of, you know, coming from, well, let's, coming from the czar, which is the hidden wisdom, the esoteric wisdom, which was, you know, that's the first book, and then there was a sage in the 1500, oh, God, I hope nobody's listening to this, who knows what they're talking about, 1500, 1600s, who also formulated a system from that. So there's Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai, and it's good to say names of the righteous. So we're just saying Shimon Satzadikim here, names of the righteous. It's just going to bring lots of good things here. Rabbi Shimon Bar Yohai wrote the czar, and then the Ari, the Rabbi Yitzchak Luria and Sfat in the mid-1500s, systemized it, categorized it, cataloged it, excuse me, and created the Tree of Life, that system that you're familiar with, and then that was subsequently explicated more on a more accessible level by the Baal Shem Tov, who makes it more about, instead of focusing on what's going on in the spiritual realms, more how it transposes onto ourselves and our body, and how we can, as above so below, and so how we're really, you know, the way the system works is we have a real input and what we do matters, and so the Kabbalistic spheres can be mapped onto our bodies, and that sort of thing. So that's Malkuth, how do you say it? Malkuth, Keith, Keith there, the crown? We're going to say it OG. We're going to say Kesser, Kesser, it makes it so much easier. Kesser, because you're going to do the more Eastern European pronunciation, so it doesn't do the, it changes it again. Kesser, yes, we just said Kesser on a podcast. Kesser is the crown. Kesser is the crown, then there's the wisdom. Kesser represents heaven, that's like, if we're going to talk about just the heaven and earth, I mean in the Taoist sense, or the idea of light, or the Buddhist sense, heaven and earth, Kesser is heaven, Malkuth is earth, and this is the way heaven and earth talk to each other. And then there's the connection between Tfer, Splendor and Mahut, or Yasod and Mahut, which is the foundation, and you'll see the different body parts are so in line with them, and we're actually coming, I was just thinking, I mean, we connected, our relationship started in that cover band, in the Fergus Blanders cover band. Fergus Blanders, yeah, I remember that. The Red Hot Chili Blanders, the Red Hot Chili Blanders. Yeah, right. You know what, it was so thrilling to find out you were also a fan of Fergus Blanders, because you never run, a lot of people have never heard of him, so it's really cool. You never even heard of him, and now the mad rush right now to be googling this, and if you guys find out the Red Hot Chili Blanders band. Yeah, it's out there. It's out there too, it's all out there, and it's part of the multiverse. I like to think Fergus Blanders is out there somewhere, that he did, he will say, he's probably dead, but I don't like to imagine. If Elvis could still make it through that, then for sure Fergus Blanders is. Right. You really believe he might still be alive, because I just feel like, you know, sometimes I like to pretend Elvis is alive. Why not? Yeah, I know he's. But there's still, you know, maybe not, maybe not, but it would be nice. You could still talk to him sometime, no? No one even knows how old he is, so I mean, it's theoretical that he could, he seemed timeless in the sense that every picture that you can find out there, he seems old. He's the same, he's just, he doesn't age, he's the secret of Elvis. That's what it seems like. But I'm going to tell you how our relationship, you know, because the band didn't work out, and then you sort of drifted, and how we really rekindled it is that. I didn't drift. He keeps saying I drifted, I didn't drift. Why do you always say I drifted? You're always right there. I'm okay, okay, I got busy, okay, I got busy. It was, I couldn't keep, I'll be honest with you. I couldn't bear the heartbreak of having his words come out of my mouth and knowing that probably he's gone. So that's why it was hurting too much. And the thing you're calling a drift was my own grief. It was me just trying to get to a place where I could accept the fact that I probably will never see him live. Right? And what we need to appreciate is that he did exist. You know, that it did happen. It's similar to the way you want to approach the gospel. It's just like, we just have to appreciate the fact that we were in the presence of something. Right. Just, just some, just any exposure to it's like, and we want more, we're so, we're so clingy. It's just like, just appreciate the fact that you got to hear Fergus, you know? Some people can't hear Fergus. Now, this is, you know, to connect to what we were talking to you before, the Tree of Life and Fergus Blanders. I, you, you just gave me some new information about that. Somehow I assumed that the, that system, the Tree of Life, had existed for thousands of years. I didn't know that it was created in the 1500s, so that there was a time, just like there was a time before the existence of Fergus Blanders, where no one had heard it, where he wasn't born yet, where maybe his grandfathers were great, great, great grandfathers were around, but similarly, the Tree of Life, the components that would eventually become the Tree of Life were floating out there, but the connection, the thing that connected all of them hadn't happened yet. That's fascinating to me. I thought we were talking about something that goes all the way back. Well, it depends on which, in which camp you want to be a part of. You want to be in part of the camp that's, you know, more academic and says, okay, this is, this is nice, but, you know, we could probably trace this too, or you're in the, the, the side, the right side of history, where it's just like, this started from the beginning. This is all from the beginning, and you could take the text of the Bible, which is, you know, if you, you know, see it as coming from, from the hand of the divine, the mouth of the divine, and saying this was part of the esoteric wisdom that came down from Moses and Sinai, and it was passed from, you know, the oral tradition until it was finally put together during that medieval period. But, you know, the people who, the people who are making the pilgrimages to the, to the, to the, to the graves and, and studying it and believing in the, the holiness of the words, don't see it as being this sort of, you know, academic type of thing where there's, but the, I mean, the, the, the, the language of the Zohar, the language for Mim Shem Bar Chai is, it's, it's not coming from a, a, a typical state of consciousness. It's, it's, you know, as we, as we would say, it's like, it's, it's beyond. It's, it's, it's really not, you know, there, it's, it's, it's not coming from, from, you know, just having a cup of coffee here. Okay. Let's talk about that. I'm really interested in what you just said. I'm not the right guy for this. I told you, I'm the hack. I'm a hack for you. I, we need to find you a cabalist who will come on the show. No, you are, what are you talking about? You have been in the course. I'm your rabbi. I'm your rabbi. That's right. I'm your rabbi. By the way, I'm my, I'm my, on my, on my, on my, on my website, on my website, which I have because of you. Cause you're like, how can people reach you? And I said they can't. And somebody's like, that's, that's messed up. So he made me, he made me a website. My buddy Zev made me a website. Part of my bio, if you don't mind is in addition to my private practice, I lead mindfulness and psychedelic integration, excuse me, seminars and sessions for trippy.vc, reppering here. He received my, I received my, the certificate in Academy of Psychotherapy from Reconcious Medical with my buddy and partner, Dr. Mark Bronstein. And I also, he also has the distinct privilege of being Duncan Trussell's rabbi. Yeah, that's true. That's my website bio. That's literally like come work with me because it's true. I'm all in. I'm all in. A tremendous thank you to zip recruiter for supporting this episode of the DTFH.

So this, the thing you're talking about, I'm curious from the Kabbalistic perspective or the Jewish perspective. If there's one of the cool things about Judaism is there's so many names for things that if you you've probably experienced but you don't you never thought, oh, that could go into a word. So when I'm reading, sometimes when I'm reading like some Tibetan Buddhist scripture or even like a good translation of the Gospels, regardless of my belief in the reality of what they're saying, the way that they're saying it, the way the words have been assembled points to this elevated consciousness that you definitely don't get from drinking coffee. Like it doesn't matter if you or maybe you do really good coffee. But the when you're when you're reading it, like for me, this has always been like a good sign that I've kind of pushed through to a deeper part of the scripture is when I start recognizing the consciousness behind what behind the words. And I'm wondering, is there a word for that? Or is there an idea about how consciousness itself can get wrapped up in the writing that somehow the writing acts as a medium or a vessel for the consciousness that wrote it, even if that even if it's being translated. What is that? I think so. Isn't there some sort of unconscious way of just doing that when you're when you're when you're just writing and I don't remember the exact word for it, but there is that there's definitely a phenomena where a person can be get into that state through the writing. But I don't know if that was the meaning these were recorded conversations. These were they were they were taking they were taking mystical journeys through the fields and just seeing whatever came up because ultimately what comes up in all of these things. And I think this what were the intentionality comes from is there's different levels of understanding the scriptures. There's the basic verses, the homiletic version and there's the you know, the hints, there are illusions to it and then there's this idea of so which is the secret there's there's a secret code to everything and you're reading the Bible and it's like that's great and then you read some commentary says everything that you're reading right now is the name of God. That's why the way that you the way that you read this the book the way that you write the book there there are rules for all of these things because this is something that we believe is an ability to tap into an altered state of consciousness of really accessing divinity. I mean, I could get up and get it for you but like literally every single word in the Bible is code. It's a code for and and and the people who lived in the Bible they existed and there's also a different level what we're talking about you know what what Jacob represents what Rachel represents what Leah his wife represents and all these different stories that happen in the Bible. Yes they happened. What happened in the garden? You know we're talking about a cataclysmic event of of which shattered everyone's consciousness and we're all suffering because of that. That's the trauma that we're all trying to heal from and so yes was there some sort of something happened there but it also happened on on on so many different levels and it's still impacting us today and so what we try to do is really live with the here and now of whatever the Torah whatever the Bible is saying and it can't be a story that happened thousands of years ago. Meaning it's even in last week last week's you know weekly portion that the you know you know if you're going to temple you're going to synagogue you're reading the the that week's Torah portion it says you know and now what does God ask from you and what does God ask him and it goes continues says but you know and then my friend my teacher of Judah Michelle the chief rabbi of the world teaches you know you know what God's asking from you is right now the atah is the Hebrew word for right now so God is asking for you what's God asking for you he's just asking for you to be mindful to be present and this is where which is part of where I see my very small part in the mission is you know you think of mindfulness and who are your teachers you know they're beautiful people they're amazing and it's Sylvia and and and and Sharon and and Ram Dass and and Tara Brock and they're you know and it's just like Nick turn Dave I forgot you know I'm a little bit actually I didn't forget I probably consciously forgot him because I'm like he has his meditation field well again you know Joe's got you know Mark Zuckerberg and Aaron Rodgers and you get cornfield and Benji Epstein so like take that for your experience you know I will take a Mark Zuckerberg too please well we can meditate actually I actually just finished Jack cornfield's course with Tara Brock and I got my teacher certificate yeah except for the fact that now I can't do my hundred hours with David I'm like I can't keep buying I can't keep spending money on degrees I just need to meditate we got to talk about our meditation practice I've I've got a teaching for you but in terms of of these code words you know it's all coming back the present moment what does God want from you what does God want and also and but these teachers I'm sorry to interrupt these teachers are are you know they're so focused on the Buddha studies like let's find it in in in Judaism and and I'm and I'm really starting to have people are just so open to to you know seeing it in their own tradition it's like whatever you're doing right now with the right intention with with faith with what we talked about last time with the vacuit with that connectivity knowing precisely and fully that at this very moment God's infinite light is contracting itself to where we are right now it's happening right now in this moment and what we're now experiencing and allowing ourselves to feel is God's presence in us right now and we become the temple we become the temple and we brought God into this moment and and if you're rushing through whatever you're doing if you're trying to get through it it means you're denying God's presence right there in the moment and it's just a wow it's like let's be here now and let's make space for for the divinity that's residing it or creating or or and and innovating that moment the the okay the the a lot there the one thing that you're bringing up I think is really important and and I'm just realizing it is how you can accidentally become less of a spiritualist and more of an archaeologist so that because you are looking at whatever the scripture is you may be reading regardless of the tradition it comes from and thinking this is old I'm reading something really old accidentally under the surface you're also thinking therefore not alive therefore not happening now these events that are being talked about or this being who is writing them down or the being they're referring to is dead and that if you're doing that that's another way of cutting crimping up the hose so to speak because where the magic really happens is when somehow you break through and you get those glimpses of like wait how is this not wait this is happening now like nothing has changed no we're we are there experiencing it in a first person way so that the moment I'm able to do that I go from being a bystander to a participant you know and and that's that you know what I mean and that's no it's like you're either watching the game you're what and this is the LeBava Terebi made this oh you know what I had a dream I had a dream where I sent you a biography of his remind me to send you a copy of that it's gonna blow your mind talk about like you know again I think I saw that that name Crowley Bob but they just came out with a book of his stories of the people and I'm gonna send you one about the LeBava Terebi ah this is why I'm put on the planet this is why I'm here but you know if you're if you're a spectator it's just like that's not gonna do it that's not and there are people who don't even think about it they're not thinking about it and they go through their days I don't know how I don't know how and God bless them but like that's not the way I'm gonna go through life that's not the consciousness that I want to that's not the relationship that God wants from me God wanted to be animated and if you think about it in the garden did not get it in the garden there were two trees and there's there's a there's a discussion about what it might be the same tree but if you read the scripture carefully there's one tree that was called the tree of knowledge good and evil and then there was the tree of life and you know what else is called the tree of life in the verse it says is a tree of life to those who hold on to it that's also referred to the Torah the Torah is is analogized analogize excuse me English you know as as the tree of life because that's the and the Torah is what how God chose to include himself he that's that's the story that he's telling and he's always telling and he's constantly telling that story there's a story and there's a there's a book and there's a writer and they're all you know there and then you have Thoreau who's telling you that you know everything that's happened past present future it's sublime it's true he says but all of these times and places I don't have the exact quote are here and now now and here and he says God is culminating in the can I look it up can I look up that quote yeah yeah please because this is what we're talking about and and hold on yeah okay in eternity there's indeed something true and sublime but all these times and places and occasions are now in here God himself culminates in the present moment and will never be more divine in the lapse of the ages wow right we have to we have to be living with God right now if that's how we because if it was something that happened if it was a story that happened a long time ago and and we talk about and we're going to talk about the Baal Shem Tov who is the person who really took these Kabbalistic ideas and he really brought them to the masses can I tell you a story yes this is this is the Baal Shem Tov story and we're all living in a Baal Shem Tov story we're all living in some mystical story whether or not we're aware of it we just want to know are we if we're awake to it then we realize we're all part of some what are the chances of this I'm not I'm sorry the ADHD is strong right now what are the chances of this happening I just want to again take that moment to breathe and just just you know today I dropped my kid off to first grade how your kids doing great thank you for asking yeah they're they're both in school now both in school both in school now what a what a what a blessing preschool preschool so saying so so when's the when's your oldest going to be going to first grade or kindergarten we do kindergarten so kindergarten and then you don't you don't have first grade after first I mean it's like meaning I think we're going to that's going to be through I think we're talking two years two years right so you got two years to just prepare yourself mentally for this because I was hit with a ton of bricks that I'm sending my kid to a school where he will probably because this is what schools do remove all of his love of learning and curiosity and just you know fill his head with you know wrote facts and things like that but I'm hoping that won't happen but there was this feeling and I was walking and somebody stopped by he's like you ever hear this expression called the Ichijo Ichi or something Ichigo Ichi and he and I was like no he's like it's it's this Japanese concept that is translated as you know for this time only and it's it's you're supposed to just treasure the unrepeatable nature of a moment right this this and they do it during the tea service and it's just like wait one second I saw the translation was one lifetime one meeting and it's just like every single moment and this this is a one lifetime one meeting type of thing so I just want to again all glory wait there's it I'm going to look at all glory say all glory what all glory to the midnight gospel gods the gospel the the gospels is that God's when they're referring to the gospels no there's just one God that's the thing but again when you say there's one God here's here's our prayer for the day Shema Israel Adonai Elohim Adonai Echad right that doesn't mean that there's one God as opposed to your many God's it's all one it's really connecting to the one and that's where we're all trying to get to and the name that reflects the one is is this this Yudhei bovenhei which if you take it has the Hebrew words for it past future and present the Yudhei bovenhei can be combined into Hovey Haya which is past and yeah which again is the same letters which is will be and then the Hovey is so all of it and we are our dualistic minds can't comprehend that but no right but but but we I choose and I and I affirm and I believe and this is what I'm consciously working on through through through doing psychedelic assisted therapy through doing meditation through through through prayer to really access that and and and you know otherwise what else are we doing what else because we're coming back about well I want to tell my story I might I might throw you out wait I wait no you're not but I need to clarify it ball shim how do you say it again ball shim tov ball shim tov ball shim tov ball shim tov ball shim tov who is founder of Hasidu Hasidu you see you see Jews who are dressed a certain way so they're they're the progenitor they're their followers of that certain movement but I mean we're all we're all students of the ball shim tov he's he's he's okay so he's he's he's he's in the God I'm so so terrible with the history but you know late 1700s early you know mid 1700s early 1800s okay and and the state of Judaism is completely dire and despair there's been a there's been false messiahs there's been the the the just pogroms pogroms for many many thousands of years you know since the exile of the temple and we were you know we're we're we're we've got a lot of of collective trauma we've got a lot of that epigenetic trauma it's it's it's yeah you I can't even it's the story is it's so bloody it's so bloody it's so bloody incomparably brutal so ball shim tov and he ball shim tov just came and he and he was a one of these there are many ball shim tov I mean literally means master of the good name and he yeah right and he came to just literally teach people that they can meet God where they are and it doesn't it doesn't belong to the oligarchy who can read and write and who can actually study the dialectics of Talmud it's like you could be the simple tailor and the stories and I'm going to send you another amazing book called I can't remember the name by Elie Wiesel it's called wow I'm going to it doesn't matter who just tells these beautiful stories where he brings these Hasidic personalities alive and you're watching miracle workers but they're not interested in doing miracles they're interested in showing the common folk how beloved they are and how and how dear they are to God and how and how beloved their services yeah because but now what you're saying may not seem that spectacular and the in the sense that this the the the hierarchized priest class right idea that used to be like legislated because of people like ball shim tov it has been it was like it was revolutionary it was revolutionary at them and he was put and they were put into excommunication there was there was again not a civil war in terms of violence there was a here here and there but like they were communities like they would not marry into each other and then they were saying that they were heretics and they were saying but the test of time has shown that this is what's kept you know a lot of people in the faith and there are people who don't connect to it and that's fine but if you don't know a certain it's a wordless song which is called the nighun n i g g u n a nighun which is just something soulful and haunting and there's some beautiful music I've buddies named Zusha anyone listening to just just have their minds completely blown about how you can connect to God through wordless song and just how the simple person isn't so simple and to just be simple you know who's the most simple God he's the most simple he's not he's not complicated he's because again when you're complicated then you've got layers and you've got pieces and you've got a sort of meld things together it's just like God is just unity and when you're complicated the the the the more complicated a system is the more likely it is to break so you know you get it you get a thing with lots of parts it's probably going to something will malfunction so if you're going to you could if you want to associate breakability with complexity and if we're talking about an unbreakable thing then it would be the most simple thing that's a beautiful elemental explanation I'm take that's such a beautiful way to explain you know the ultimate simplicity which is something we strive for because again in this day and age we're we're we're cultivating personas in online and how we are with certain people and it's just like you want to get back that beginner's mind that innocence of the child where he's just like yeah he's going to speak his mind you're like oh right how do you like it he's like it tastes terrible it's like thank you thank you it's like it's really good like no this is gross give me something else like thank you for that so refreshing and so honest and so and again you can't hurt people's feelings but if you're saying it from a beautiful place and that's coming because they love themselves this is what I'm working on therapy you know what the oldest said to me once daddy your lip your lip stinks when I had breath I didn't know yeah if your wife had said that to you how personally would it would be World War three she has said it to me and she's like I'm getting you her yeah I've got these halitosis things that don't work but I'm just like hey you know what your breath stinks but your kid says and you're just like and like saying I love you so much these like daddy I just want to go to sleep right now Abba can you stop talking and I'm like yes of course yes of course no but all we want for our kids and this is one that's amazing all we want for our kids for them to unconditionally radically love themselves I'm thinking about this as it goes to first grade I'm like please just don't lose that because everyone who I'm seeing in therapy and this is where you know this is where we're speaking the language of just love yourself you know and it's like it's getting either harder or or people are just struggling with it and my wife got blessed her is one of the one percenters and meaning she's one of the people who just like yeah I love myself like why don't get it what are people coming to therapy for you know of course you love yourself and I'm like yeah and she's it's not narcissism it's not she's just you make you mess up like oops I made a mistake I'm really sorry move on like well you know I think an important distinction between narcissistic traits and actual loving of oneself is that the narcissist clings to one to itself the narcissist is trying to cling to some identity and amplify that identity to the world because they think they are that and and to deconstruct that or for that to not be anymore I think for a narcissist is death whereas there isn't a loving oneself is it's not clingy you're not it doesn't mean pushing yourself out into the world as much as surrender I think it's more of a surrender quality than a clinging quality you're you're not attached to it but but I'm saying name Karol Ibala if you said did he love himself did he love himself he loved himself like there was unconditional radical and when you mess up when the Dalai Lama messes up when my when my when my one of my rabbis messes up the laughter that comes from it the just the absolute joy of when they when they sort of do a faux paw of just like this laugh and they laugh it off because hey what are we taking so seriously here and and just to have that it's like well you messed up and like your whole self worth is tied up into whether or not you get this deal or whether or not this person and this is like it's it's not not a big deal it's not a big deal yeah where you you just do that's part of the thing is that is the failure and the failure is you know again to go back and I think having kids is a great way to connect to this is when you when they when when your child you make some mistake or something you know it's like hopefully you're not holding whatever that thing is against the child at all you're just like you're new this is your brand new you don't know you're learning what's the big you're going to learn you're going to keep trying but like and and I think the other thing you said earlier is important I want to put it in italics the connection between simplicity and God or simplicity and and awakening or however you want to put it awakening is that when some when something that's simple tells you something when it when something that's that that that loves itself or is so in in the universe and so in the moment that the concept of not loving themselves hasn't even appeared yet they can say anything and it doesn't have that jagged edge that people who have disconnected and are like really condensed in an identity has as someone who was good at like pulling the shank out and stabbing someone you know what I mean that is not coming from a simple place it's coming from complexity and all the insecurity the other thing that it must go along with complexity is insecurity insecurity if you have if you're in a complex if your defense mechanisms are complex you're going to be naturally nervous because there's so many areas that could collapse or be invaded there's too many systems in place you're going to feel insecure and insecure people tend to be mean and defensive defensive and triggered and and and they get off on it they're getting off on this I've seen people who just like need to be righteous and indignation the righteous indignation morally and it's like you don't want to look at yourself you'd rather just rage you'd rather just you know brew haha or something it's just like take a deep breath and say what's really upsetting you right now and there are people who get upset there's a way you're not you're not going to be passive and you get let people roll over you and but you're also not getting caught up in things that don't really matter like how are you getting involved in this and it's just like or your insecurities such that you want to just focus on anywhere external rather than actually look at your inner life and look at what's going on and what's really true right now.

What's bothering? You know the ultimate example of this is the hoarder like a hoarder. Guilty, guilty. That you're not, you're, no, we're talking like the show. Oh yeah, yeah. You know what I'm, you show that, but they don't want, they don't want to look, they don't want to admit when you're trying to point out to them, hey, you know what? You don't need a room full of cat litter boxes. You don't need this much cat litter. You don't need, you got no one needs this. This is enough cat litter for a hundred years, for a hundred cats. You can get rid of like half the cat litter. They will be like, no, you don't get it. I got this cat litter at a discount. I'm not getting rid of this cat litter. It's a great deal. You don't get it. You're gonna lose it. I could resell it. You don't understand what that banana, that rotting banana peel in the box of old fruit means to me that I had that banana peel on my birthday a few years ago. It's a complex, hoarding is not simple. Not at all. It's complex and the, many of us are inner hoarders. At least the hoarder, you can't say, no, that's not there. The hoarder has to admit there is a room full of newspapers mixed in with cars, mixed in with toy train tracks and a few piles of white peas. They have to admit it's there. A person can pretend it's not there. You can lie and you can lie to yourself. There's no room like that inside of me, but my point is this, if you are in a hoarder's house, if you're a hoarder, their house is fucking, they catch on fire all the time. You know what I mean? It's bad news. That's the problem. There's no space. The kindling is, you know, you don't want to live near a hoarder because you're likely out of getting your house on fire. Similarly, an inner hoarder, they catch on fire all the time. They have these blazes that they are always constantly trying to put out. You know what I mean? So simplicity is you doing the thing to yourself that they do on that show, hoarders, which is unloading all the shit if you can. It's harder, though, inside than a house. The hard part about it is you're going to really have to confront all that kitty litter. And you're going to have to confront the fact that you behaved in ways, or you did things that were completely antithetical to what you valued, to what you really wanted. And it's a scary thing. I was talking to a client recently and just saying that, like, you know, he couldn't understand why a person behaved this way. And this person sounded like they had a personality disorder. Like, they were really struggling. They were suffering. And he couldn't even be comprehend. You know, how could she have turned that on me? How could she have turned that back on me after she did something wrong? Because I said that person, if they ever feel the slightest tinge of uncomfortability or judgment or blame, they'll believe that they will implode. They will literally, and they were going to set up this boundary for if you go anywhere near there, and they know they're doing it also. They know that they're doing something to push people away when all they want is to just connect and really have a deep, meaningful, emotional connection. And it's fascinating and it's tragic. But the alternative is, and this is the time of the year, you know, as we go on to Rosh Hashanah, which again, I was thinking about how we connected. And after the band, and we sort of didn't drift, but we didn't really maintain the connection, is I saw this unbelievable quote that said, maybe you're not healing because you're trying to be who you were before the trauma. That person doesn't exist anymore because there's a new you trying to be born. Breathe life into that. And I enclosed a gif of Clancy, and I don't know if you remember, you better remember, Clancy to get out of whatever universe he was in. You know what he was blowing? I do. What was he blowing? He was blowing the hunting horn that was hanging over my father's bed when he died. You just destroyed the myth for every single Jewish person in the world because you know what we thought that he was blowing? Hold on. I know exactly what you're bringing out. You know what I'm bringing out? A kazoo. I'm just kidding. Yeah, well, it's just a horn from a different animal. It's just a horn from a different animal. But this is blown on Rosh Hashanah. This is the horn that's blown on the Jewish New Year, and we talked about this offline, where we talked about how it's this belief of the New Year, is that this isn't a continuation. This is a brand new, and the services that we do on the High Holy Day of Rosh Hashanah, which means New Year, Rosh is the head, means where the kessar is, and again, what we're doing on Rosh Hashanah, according to the Kabbalahs, which is synonymous with the word kessar, for God to once again reincarnate the world in this form. We are, again, believing that we're instilling that desire, and we do that through blowing this ram's horn, and the ram's horn is, again, this worldless prayer, and it's the manifestation of what? Of breath, of breath, through our breath. Listen, don't, just so everyone knows, I was aware of that as well. I just didn't have one of those, but I did have a hunting horn, and I understood the mystical symbolism, not just of what that horn meant to me, but also, and to my dad, and also what it meant to all the traditions that have an aspect of that, like the Hare Krishna's blow a conch shell, and that's the most intense thing when they're blowing it during a puja ceremony, and also that you are combining life with death. Blowing into a bone is blowing life into a dead thing, which represents, I think, what you're talking about with Rosh. How do you say it? Rosh Hashanah, Rosh Hashanah. Yeah, you're describing, even the word itself, Rosh Hashanah, it's like an outflow. It sounds like you are blowing it out, like making it, blowing up the balloon again, putting air back in, restarting, and that we get to do that because we have, that's the other thing I love about the Book of Genesis story is the breath is, you know, the divine breath is placed into Adam, right? Yeah, that's it, that's what we're doing, because Rosh Hashanah is actually not the day that God created the world according to tradition, it's the day that He created man. Man was created on the sixth day, and you see these rabbis in the Talmud arguing about when God created the world, and they have disagreements, and there's so many metaphysical layers about this, and they end up saying that they're both right. One was in divine wisdom, one was in divine actualization, but the Rosh Hashanah is not commemorating the day that God created the world. We say He created the world, but what it actually means is He created man on that day. So let's talk about that. Sorry, go ahead, I'm sorry, go ahead. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, knock on the myth, I said we have a lot to talk about, we've got to tell a Baal Shem To story. I want to get to that Baal Shem To story, but I want to talk about this. With the Shofar, when Clancy blows it, it's like again, we become that new person, and the way that, we talked about that brokenness, how a person needs to confront that brokenness in order to get whole, and it's not to ignore that brokenness, and that's sort of like, you know, a lot of what I'm thinking about right now is Rabbi Nachman and the Arizal who we talked about, they talk about the intention for this month as we build up that liminal space of the end of the year going to the beginning of the year, and Rabbi Nachman says that a person has to be an expert in running and returning, or the Zohar would say going up and going down, and I'm thinking to myself, that's the practice of toggling, right? Yes. And it's just like, again, not meaning I'm taking it in and I'm doing it out and saying a person has to, Rabbi Nachman says a person has to be an expert when he's doing that, because that is how a person comes back to who they really are. That's how a person does tshuvah, which again, tshuvah means return, which again, is classically translated as repentance, but it's again, it's the mindfulness myth of just returning to what? Returning to essence. But no, this is for you, Rabbi Duncan. This is for you. The word tshuvah is made up of the letters taf, shin, vav, vet, hey, which is again, at the end, if you remember the word hey, the letter hey, yud, hey, vav, and hey. Tashuv means to return. What are you returning? You're tashuving, you're returning the hey. You're putting that hey back into the name of God. You are unifying God's name by you returning to yourself. If you want to connect to God, you got to connect to your soul. I have to blow your mind once it, once it, once a cast. Wow! My mind is the dead horn. And you just blew it. The... Hey. Wow. Should we prepare for that? That is so cool. I felt, I felt, I felt inspired. But if you listen to those samas here, just a little bit more, this is called the tekiah. Tekiah. It's one simple blast. Straight, simple, no movement, oscillation. The next sounds are either... There's again an argument about how it's supposed to sound. We sort of, but it's supposed to be some sort of either a three short notes, the sort of blasts called a shvarim, which means brokenness. And then there's the just outright balling, just the brokenness of the trua, which is also means connectivity and friendship, but it's... And then it ends once again with the tekiah, the simple, uncomplicated sound. And that's what Killance is doing, and that's what we're all doing. You start off life with that simple, straight sound. You're good. Your essence is good. And then, guess what? You break up. You break down. You break apart. You're out of the garden. Things go to, you're out of the garden. Things go to pieces. You know, stuff happens. And, you know, sometimes it's just like a little bit of a sob, a whale, like, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And then there's just this unfettered, uncontrolled, just you just broke down. And you say, I can't get back, right? But you don't have to get back to that old person. You don't have to hoard that person. You get back to that simple sound. You get back to that tekiah and your essence, and that's what we're trying to return to. And that's why you can hear the sound of a dead animal, and you could be balling. Imagine a Martian coming down and saying, like, okay, what's going on here? I don't know. You're blowing a ram's horn. That's how you're coordinating the king. He said, there's no greater coordination of the king. There's no greater way that we can be, and that's all we're doing on Rosh Hashanah. We're just crowning you king. We want you to be king. We want to be servants. And you can't do it without us. That's the crazy piece that we, you talk about being empowered. Even in the Hebrew language, there's dictatorship with there's mem shala. And then there's melucha, which is, again, you hear the word malchut. We're building up the kingship. We're building it up. And the cabalists are doing it through the names, and they're into, and it's happening anyway. It's just whether or not you're aware of it. Meaning, what am I doing by it? It's like, well, I'm tapping into it, and I'm accessing more of this awareness and knowledge. But again, it's just that inculcation, inculcating that brokenness and not divorcing it and bringing it in. Oh, it's so deep. It's so deep. And I love how everything is a map in Judaism. Everything is like a hole on it and is representing the cycle. We're going through the holographic principle. The part contains the hole. You cannot look at that piece and not see the all in it. If you're missing the all in it, then you've, like you said, you've cut it off. Okay. So if the breath that is resonating the horn represents the divine, then you separate those two things and you just have the horn. It's dead, lifeless, and you have some breath that has no mode of expression. Right? It's just, it's not, it's not forming into time space. So the two things when they combine, regardless of the horn itself, the lifelessness. This is, I think, when they talk about karma, maybe. You can say, that's the material, that's just the stuff, the stuff. But the breath of God part, you hear in Buddhism fundamental goodness. Fundamental goodness. This is always, it's always there. If you're hearing anything, in other words, if you're experiencing humanity, if you're around, the thing that's resonating you, whether you can understand it or not, is perfect, simple, no matter what. And the way that it's being expressed through you can seem like chaotic and like, all kinds of weird ways of expressing that thing, but it's still, what's making it come into life is this eternal simplicity, right? That's the idea. And then you have equanimity. And this is the teaching of the Baal Shem Tov of Shiviti, Adonai, Yudhe Vavinhe, again, Linnegdi Tamid. And Shiviti means I place God in front of me. So you'll see that people have mandalas. People have the, hold on one second. Can you see this? You see that there? Yeah. I mean, that's something you'll see in synagogues. You'll see this is the letter- What is it? What is that? This is the letter Yudhe. Oh, this is the letter Hey. This is the letter Vavinhe. This is the letter Hey. This is exactly- Wait, let me describe what I'm looking at. Everyone I'm seeing is- Hold on a second. I want to, good luck with this one. Here we go. It's definitely a mandala. It's rectangular. It's one, you have circular ones too? Yeah. One, two, three. I can't see the entire- The shape doesn't matter as much. I'll send you a picture. Each side is three. It looks like, what is that? One, two, three. I can't tell if it, okay. It's two, one, two. You could spend hours. You could spend hours. There's a menorah. There's a menorah that has a chapter of zoms on it. And so again, that's what you're supposed to be visualizing as you say it. You can see different permutations of the Yudhe, Vavinhe. But anyway, I'll give you a more simple one again. Why this is on my desk, you know? Because we like to have fun here. Here's another one for you. This will be a little bit more simple. It says the word Shibiti means a place. And then it's the Yudhe, Vavinhe. And then it says it has the Yud and then the Aleph. And Aleph is the name of Mahut. So this is the Chetrogrammatan. It's the Yudhe, Vavinhe. But the name of Mahut is mixed in it. And so you're trying to see is how God is enlivening, is breathing life into the Mahut. So you combine them together. So usually I place God in front of me and just see it as like a visualization, a meditation. What he says is Shiviti also means it's equal. Praise, blame, it's all equal to me. Why is it equal to me? Because Yudhe, Vavinhe is in front of me always. If I see whatever I'm seeing right now is Yudhe, Vavinhe, the traffic, the traffic jam, the most mystical experience of the world, you know, after the ecstasy, the laundry. Meaning there's no difference. There's no difference. And we struggle with that. I struggle with that because I like Ramdas, you know, it's like it's just a drug experience. I'm like, yeah, but it was, I felt like I was clicking at a higher level there. That during that meditation I was clicking. When I'm driving the car, when I'm tying my shoes and Judaism really tries to, because people feel it's very regimented. There's so many laws, so many rules. It's like it's just to create awareness. We've sort of lost the forest and the trees. But if you take a step back and realize that everything is supposed to connect us. And what can you give God? God's got a lot of palaces and spheres and angels and doorways and castles. You know what he doesn't have? This. What? He doesn't have, he doesn't have this planet. He's, he's, he's, you know, what if God was one of us, you know, wandering around. And you're seeing, you know, maybe it's everyone you look at is God in drag. But we just, we, we, we don't want to believe that. But the, the, the, what the, what the, what the Baal Shem Tov was teaching, what the Baal Shem Tov really, you know, review is just like, if you're not seeing God and everything you're doing, you know, and all God wants is to, it's his Nistava, you know, to have a Dira betachton him. We think he wants to be up there. He's, he's fine up there. Imagine taking that dead, you know, that ram's horn. Imagine taking that, that person on the street. Imagine taking that food that you put in your mouth and, and, and, and raising it up and, and elevating it to something that is divine service. Only do that. It's incredible. But, but it's, you don't, you don't really need to raise it up, right? It's already raised up in the sense that, in our consciousness, in our consciousness, for ourselves to begin, but that's what we can give him. That's, that's, that's the pleasure that you can give to God. Ah, that's okay. Right. You need something to do. Here's the thing to do. And, and this, and this going away and coming back that you're talking about that, that cycle is like long form of that, right? You're talking about each year, we're going to go away and come back. But in every single moment, in even to get back to the breath, you're, you're looking at a going away, the exhalation and a coming back and inhalation as though the message was like, you know, that movie Memento where he's got shit painted all over the wall. It's painted in your, the main thing keeping you alive is this very cycle, which goes back to the possibility that that name is the sound of your breath. The sound of your breath. That's what's giving it to you. That's, and that's, and that's. Your breath is the scripture. It's the map. And this is, you know, the word for soul and Judaism. Nishama also means breath. Nishima. Wow. Nishima, Nishama. Yeah. I was saying that I think that that's, that's the breath connection. And again, we're doing it and we're seeing it. And it's running and returning, you know, running, you know, sometimes you feel so close to the divine and sometimes you're returning. Sometimes you feel so far removed and you feel so bereft of God's. And it's like, you're in, right there in that moment, if you're tapping in your, your, you can never leave God's presence. And so we, we make this arbitrary, well, does it matter what I do? Of course it matters what you do because you don't want to create that, you know, quote, unquote, demon, or you want to build that, that angel. They talk about that karma we're talking about. Just, you know, that, that Hashqacha Pratid of just like our actions that have reverberations. They, it matters. What you say matters, you know? Because if you know that your words actually matter, you would never speak poorly about somebody. Of course we wouldn't kill somebody, but we're not killing people because it's illegal. We're not killing people because we believe in, like you said, that fundamental goodness. And so we have to work in, especially during this time of year when we're going to be crowning God as king, is this is the time of chuva. This is the season of, of returning, of returning that hay and, and returning that hay to God's name, which we can only do through empathy and compassion and love of ourselves and others. You know, the, the, the month that we're in right now is called elul. And the Ari teaches us is a, an acronym. Is alif elul is ani, ay, lamid is lido di. I'm not doing a great job explaining this because it's Hebrew and I apologize to those who I'm not doing this well. I love it. Vido di li. I'm to my beloved and my beloved is to me. It's like, I would never left. I never left and you never left. And this is like, we've been here all along and we've been sort of playing this hide and seek game. It's just like, we don't have to play this game, but we have to stop. Like you said, we have to stop already. I didn't drift. We didn't drift. We never, I never went anywhere. You could, there's nowhere you could possibly go. It's like, it's like, you don't love me, mom. And it's just like, there's no way I could stop loving you. Right? There's no way I could stop loving you. And, and we're just, we're in this dance. Yeah. This shivisi-al-don island that you saw me, this, this place in God for me and this equanimity and this going and giving in this, and this receiving and, and returning and, and going up and going down. And it's just like, it's just this dance where if we recognize that it's all part of one united whole, you know, again, if, if you only heard that, then you would, you know, then you're, you're, you're a righteous individual, but you're not somebody who's, who's, you know, who's gone through the process. And, and again, I think there are Bodhisattvas and there's Tzadikim who come in and they're here to just, just get us right on the path. But we don't have to look at them and be like, oh, well, I should be like that or I need to be. That's like, no, no, no. The Talmud says in the place where those who are Baalei Chuvah, masters of this returning, masters of returning the hey, where they stand, the righteous, the gurus, the, the, the Tzadikim, they, they have no place there. They can't be there because they just, they can't. They're just like, that's not their, that's not their job. And it's not your job to be the Bodhisattva. Now again, it could be to tap into that, but not, you know, in your own, in your own way to believe in your unique way and your unique greatness and your unique individuality and how God can't do it without you. And we struggle with it because we don't feel special. We say that. Okay, let's decom, let's decom, I want to decom, I want to make, Decomplexify. By the way, this was supposed to happen for everybody. Everyone should know that this was supposed to happen in Burning Man, but I pulled out. So I apologize about that. But we're next year, next year. And I pulled out. Well, I didn't pull out, which is why I couldn't burn. There you go. And I'll explain it to you. Well, the, the, the, the, the. Thank God you didn't. Yeah. More hashtag more Duncan. Thank God. Thank you. I, but, but that's brings me to what I was in an attempt to, even though I don't think it needs to be Decomplexify. Cause you so beautifully described it. I'm just thinking in the beginning, you were talking about the experience of dropping your kid off at kindergarten. And you know, you're going to see, you're going to pick them pick them up after school. Oh, sure. But it's, but, but so that cycle is still going to happen in, in one of these books I was reading about raising kids. It talks about how toddlers, what they, the cycle of a toddler is they'll hang out with the parent for a second. Then they'll go out to explore. And then they come back and they'll hug you for a second. And then they go out again. Attachment, attachment theory one on one. That's it. And that is the respiratory cycle of parenting that going out and coming back. Right. It's the same thing. And, and, and it's in just because you made the kids doesn't mean like you don't need them. I mean, every time they come back and hug you and like, and when they get older and start like hugging you and then saying, I love you. Those are the greatest moments. Those are the moments of ecstasy. Those are the highest moments. So if, as above so below, then this returning the crown or the running back to God, this must be adding of the hay. Right. It's like God, I don't know how, if God, how God feels or what that is. I know how I feel. Right. If, as above so below, it must be this. Okay. I didn't lose you. You're here. You came back. Okay. Okay. And I love you. It's no big deal. And I was always here. And I was always in the room. I was in the room. You didn't lose me. You didn't lose me. You didn't lose me. You know, just I lost. Again, you lose yourself for a minute and then you find yourself. It's like someone's like, oh, I lost myself. I think that's okay. You're here now. And that's okay. That's it. You're here now. This is something that I know from listening to you and, and, and dovening and praying with you and, and just like we love our kids to death. And we also know that loving our kids to death means that's going to bring suffering. It's just, if you like, if you want to understand love, if you want to understand suffering, you know, they have to go together. This is the only one way because the ultimate suffering is to lose the thing that you love most and everything else you could be fine with. I'm fine with everything, but like, you know, you were talking, I think with Jack about, about, you know, if God forbid somebody did something to your kid and we don't even want to, our brains, we're not even going to allow our brains to go there. You're like, I could talk about love and kindness, but like I will rip you limb to limb. And even, and it's just like we have this, it's, it's, it's more, it's, it's deeper than, than, than, than, than, than, than, you know, animalistic. It's, it's so much more primal. And yet we also know intuitively as, as people on the path and people who are struggling on the path and losing the path, but never leaving the path and recognizing that, you know, it's straight, it's going to get straight at the end, you know, by some incarnation, it's going to be straight in the beginning and straight at the end, you know, it's going to hurt like hell. Yeah. It's, and, and you talked about it so poignantly. And I think for so many people, it opened up a real language, you know, when you talked about your mom and you were talking about how, you know, even bringing it up in the book, it brought up something for you as you're writing the book and we're going to write a beautiful book on parenting. Just kidding. Is that the name of the book? No, the book is, the book is, the book is, don't pull out, don't pull out, just kidding. Just kidding. No, but it's, it's, it's this, the fact that you still felt it is, is because you'll never stop feeling it and you never want to stop feeling it because it's, that's, that's how people, we're still, they're still here. We can, we connect, we believe that we can connect to people even more possibly when they're not in this physical plane and, and there's just this, this, this sadness, which is, you know, this, it's, it's, it, we don't allow our minds to go there, but when we do that, you know, and then we can really connect to the suffering of the world and that's the also part of this, of this ability to do that. Again, the only people who can teach, you know, are the ones who understand suffering and, and you're somebody who is, is a real, you're, you're a person, you tell me if you can hear this. Do you feel this about yourself that people gravitate towards you as a person that they, that they love being in your presence? Uh, no, you know what, I'm not going to go there because to me, I try, like, I, I would love that. That sounds wonderful. My feeling with it is, uh, I, I don't want to, if that is happening, that's great. And I'm hot. That makes me happy, but I don't want to think about it because I'm too not, I'm too my, the blowing of my horn. Yeah. I don't want, I don't want to do my own horn. I don't want to blow the thing. No, because we're, there's that, because we don't, we don't love ourselves enough. It's, we don't love ourselves enough because, I, I, right. I'm too complex. There's too many things going on for me to accept anything like that. And, and, and, and I'm okay with that right now in, in, in the, uh, but the conversations like this, you know, I, you know, I guess the reason you're seeing some like stammering here is because to me in the, you know, if we're going to use the analogy of blowing a horn. Yes, please. There's a big difference between tooting your own horn and, and I'm like, there you go. But that's, but that's a tank of gas. That's a tank of gas. That'll fill you up for a tank of gas till you need the next one, till the next person will be like, okay, I need you to blow and the, and the, and the, you need, you need, you need to do a bigger horn or, or, or more blowing. But at the end of the day, if it's, if you're, if you're not able to do it, if you're not able to do it yourself, if you're not able to give it to yourself, which is really this is the, this is the month of compassion where we're really, and, and even in the astrological, um, I believe the astrological sign for this month right now is the virgin because we're getting back to our pristine essence and that takes a boatload of compassion, compassion for the people who've wronged us, compassion for the things that we've done wrong and compassion for God. You know, he also needs this, he again, not using the gender specific just to make it clear again, there is no pronoun for God. You know, this, this, this loving and compassionate being also is suffering and that's the, the suffering of the Shreena and that's the suffering of Mahut because it's, it's just, you know, when we're, when we're not living with awareness, when we're living with ignorance, it, it, it also pains him. It creates, it creates pain, divine pain. And so, you know, the sort of like, you know, field of dreams, I imagine like, heal his pain. It's like, heal your pain and you're going to be healing his divine pain. And again, you can only help the suffering of others. If you've really learned how to suffer yourself, if you've really learned how to accept your own suffering, because then you start to see the ubiquity, not the ubiquity, the, the, the, the, what's the opposite of ubiquity, the, the, the universality of suffering. It's like, oh, my suffering is different than yours. I understand suffering and this is, and I could have compassion for you. Like I have compassion for myself and we can, we can, pain is inevitable, right? Suffering is optional. Yeah. So you blow your horn, blow your horn. This is the month of the virgin, the month of blowing your own horn. Right. Well, you, can you, why don't we close? Thank you so much. Why don't we close on you resonating, blowing the horn again for us? I think it's a beautiful, can I, can I tell that story? Can I tell that story? Do we have time for a story? Oh yeah. Tell the story and then let's blow the horn. It's, it's, it's, it's something my, my friend Joey or my friend, Matt, I forget which one, just shared this story about, and it's a Baal Shem Tov story, but it's about where a living Sadiq right now, one of the, one of the rabbis, one of the, one of the gurus, he told a story of his grandfather, who was also a righteous individual who dreamed that he saw the Baal Shem Tov, right? The master of the good name, revolutionary change the world. Remind me, I got to send you a copy of that, that book of the rabbi, just to see what, how it's Sadiq lives. It's just, they're not, they're not like us, but they're like us. And they see, they see, they see the good in us in like, so in this dream, right? So this, this, this, this grandfather, he's telling the story. He sees the Baal, he sees the Baal Shem Tov and they're both standing on this majestic mountain and you want to picture this scene of these two, you know, beautiful saintly individuals, radiant, basking, glowing and they're looking over this huge abyss and the Baal Shem Tov says to him, you want to see what it means to really serve God. You're imagining this, right? Your eyes closed. You know what, you can see this huge precipice, they're, they're, they're standing over this huge precipice and it's just this valley and it's like, he says, you want to know how to serve God, what it really means. Can I teach you how a person is really supposed to serve God? And even before the person who was dreaming could answer the Baal Shem Tov, the Holy Baal Shem Tov just free dives right off the cliff. He just jumps right off. And this other person, this, this Sadik who's having the dream is just watching an abject horror as like his, his guru just throws himself off the side of this, this, this cliff and, and he's just watching him and he sees, he hits the ground and he shatters into a million pieces. He shatters into a, in a myriad of pieces, like a vase. Just a picture of this, right? Just go with the Baal Shem Tov has just shattered into a million pieces and the guy doesn't know what to do. And he runs down and he gets to the bottom and he's like, okay, like, you know, maybe this, and when he gets there, every piece he finds, he picks up, he starts to pick up the broken shards and every single piece he finds is an exact replica of the Holy Baal Shem Tov. Right in that sliver contains the whole, contains the whole. And it's just like, we think we're so broken. And we realize that that brokenness, that brokenness is all, all going to be part of that unified oneness. And we want it to be, we want it to be less complicated when we see that in that darkness, in that difficulty, in that suffering, in that struggle, there is also, and there's nothing more whole than the broken heart, says the rabbi of Kotsk, Menachem and others, there's nothing more whole. And he's, there's the students asked and they said, why does it say in the, in, in the Shema prayer? Why does it say to put the words on your heart? Why does it say in your heart? He says, because your heart's stone, he says, you pray with grace and with divine love and with a little bit of luck, you know, that, that stone is going to melt. So when it does, when it turns into that heart of flesh, right, those words that you've been placing on your heart, they'll just fall right in. They'll just be right in, you know, and that's all we're trying to do is, is take that brokenness, take it, that brokenness. And, and again, there's nothing more whole than that broken heart. Um, I just saw this amazing poem that said, um, it's called, uh, it's called, it's called last fragment or late fragment. Again, it's thinking about the fragmented pieces. And did you get what you wanted out of life even so? And that even so is just like, you think about your even so. And did you get what you wanted out of life even so I did? And what was it you wanted to call myself beloved, to feel myself beloved on this earth? No, even with that, even so, even with those fragments, those pieces, that regret, the should've, could've, would've, this another year coming into this, this being, and it's like, I don't want it to be the same. It's like, it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be. Stop trying to blow life into that person. You're not that person from before the trauma or from before you started hoarding those, those Katie litters. Breathe life into that new person. You're not who you think you are, right? Ram Dass 101. You're not who you think you are, right? Anyway, I love you. I really, I love you so much. You're, you're a beautiful. Thank you, Ben. Saad, for you are, you are a being of light and compassion. You have, you have, you have real radiance. You have glow. I, I, I, I wear t-shirts with you on it. I wear t-shirts. Because. Well, wait till our next podcast. I'm going to have. Amen. No, can we, can we do it in person? We would have so, if we could do a live podcast, I'm telling you, we'd have like three people, including my mom. She would love this. You know. I've always wanted to come to Israel. You? It's something I've always wanted to do. Duncan, Duncan, Duncan. Again, ain't d'Avara homemade before now, Ratzon. You know what? Ratzon is that highest sphere because Ratzon comes even before it's that before there's even a plan. There's something that's there, that kernel of, of ineffabilic. Where did that come from? I don't know. It's Ratzon. It's my will. You come. Who knows? You come to, to Israel. Messiah. I don't mean, I'm not saying he won't come. I'm not saying animals won't attack you, but I'm not, not saying, you know what? I don't think the Messiah will be the thing that induces the birth of the Messiah if I come to Israel. But I do think we would have a pretty awesome podcast there and lots of fun. Thousands of people live podcasts in Israel. Tell me what you need me to do to make it. I'm calling Nicole right after this. She's getting a copy of this. And yeah, let's figure it out. I think that would be real to do a live DTF age in Israel. I would, that would be a dream come true. Say the word. Your wish is my command. As you wish. We're going to blow the shofar. I'm going to plug my, my t-shirt company that doesn't exist. And we're going to, we're going to have wish each other. We're going to wish each other. Okay. Tiva vechatima tovah. All right. So again, it's just, uh, let's this, this is the intention for also the ram's horn is, and again, this is going to be in the parenting book. Don't wake your kids up with a ram's horn. It's a terrible move. Terrible. My daughter might never speak to me again. Love you, Hadasa. But, um, we're taking a deep breath. This, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Maimonides, who was the irrationalist did not study or may not have access to the access to the Kabbalah, but he's certainly somebody who keeps things rational. Says, you know why we blow a horn? It's because the Torah says to the Bible says to, he's like, but if I would have to give an illusion to it, it's because it's a reminder that it's time to wake up all of our service, all of our practice has to be a practice of waking up. All we're trying to do is wake up out of our ignorance and just connect to the divinity within and around. And so my blessing to us as, as, as soul brothers is, uh, is let's wake up, wake up from not, not from coffee, but from something a lot stronger and a lot more simple. Yeah. Wow. So much love. One love, not so much so there was no AI. We didn't talk about AI. We didn't talk about aliens. We didn't talk about Gnostic Christians. We didn't, we have, we have so much, so much to cover. So much psychedelics. Well, again, but this is, this is the Ichigo Ichi of just like, you know, I just appreciating the fact that this is happening, that we live in a time where we have the technology to just, you know, see each other. How are we connected? And we're like, we're connected on a level. That's just like, I was on, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was, I was on another podcast on the Be Here Now Network with Madison Margot and she's wonderful. And it's just like, I'm connected to Ramdas and I'm connected to, to, to Duncan Trussell and we're all like, there's one degree of separation to all of us. We're all connected. Let's share, let's love, let's be connected. Let's really see the good in one another and, you know, really feel proud of where we come from, our heritage and see how the perennial wisdoms all complement one another. You do you, I do me and we all come together and just say Shalom, you know, Wow. And I, and I, and you know, I, I. And you know, I, I, and I, I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I. And if you I don't love me, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and I, and Echad. dot com. That's your t-shirt. Company the girl is sold dot? It doesn't exist yet.

Today's guest is the host of the Joe Rogan experience. He's also one of my best friends in the world. Everybody, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, the great Joe Rogan. Welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome, welcome. Joe Rogan, welcome. Welcome, my friend. Oh, thank you. I can't say welcome. Is it both of our phones making that noise? It's just we gotta get the phone away, the field, the demon field. The demon. That's happening here is, hold on one second, let me just make it, I just don't want to. It's the easiest way to do it, right? With a laptop? Two mics and a laptop. Yeah, well, what do you run yours into? Fucking sea of shit that I don't understand. It wasn't for Jamie and Brian, I don't know. I want to talk to Jamie though. Jamie's a wizard. Once you start getting into building a podcast studio, it's an endless maze. It is. You keep wanting to get, you want it to get better, you want it to be more of a conduit because when I was like when I'm putting this thing together in here, I'm not done yet, but the idea behind it is that, and we talk about this sometimes, that the best stand-up sets and the best podcasts are the ones where you somehow cease to exist for a little while, if something comes through you, and I like to think that if you, that you could tune a room based on that principle and maybe amplify that a little bit. Yeah, I think you could, just surround it with shit that you like and it would give you a better feeling that you surround, if you surround the room with shit you don't like. Like imagine if you put a bunch of stuff on the wall that you don't give a fuck about, like Michael Jordan slam dunking a ball or Justin Bieber on stage with girls crying in the crowd, like a bunch of shit that didn't mean anything to you and you put that all over the walls. What would that do for you? Right. Put you in a weird place. It would just make me feel weird. I'd be fucking weird. Make you feel weird. But don't you think that people actually recognize that there was some force in the universe that you could tune into and that some surroundings actually could amplify that force, that it's not a subjective thing, but that like when they built the pyramids or Stonehenge or any of the ancient weird monuments that are out there that that was done with a kind of understanding of this concept that the less you're involved in what you do, the greater things become. And that people who built the pyramids must have understood that. They must have understood that as much as the people who built the World Trade Center. A person who writes a great book, it seems like everything always comes back to that thing you hear people say, which is like, oh, it wasn't me. It was the muse. It was the spirit moved me or something. Well, there's the thing about doing a really large scale projects, I'm sure, like think productions like the pyramids in the Empire State Building, where it really can't be about the individual because the amount of people that are involved, it's so massive. Like to be able to build the pyramids, they don't know really how it was built. Obviously, there's a lot of speculation. They don't know how many people were involved, but they think it had to be like 100,000 fucking people working on that thing. Just imagine what that was like when by all accounts, like what they think people were alive back then, they think there was maybe like two or three million people alive back then. So it wasn't, you weren't dealing with the same kind of populations you're dealing with today. So to get 100,000 people together was like, holy fuck. You got maybe 5% of the whole world to work on the fucking pyramids. Think of whoever organized that. It's crazy. Whoever organized that is who you're interested in. That's the person you're interested in. You're interested in who was it that formulated the plans that could get 5% of 6% of the world's population together to create these geometric shapes in the middle of a desert that somehow line up with serious? Who is it that decided to do that? It wasn't somebody who rolled out a bed one day. It's like, man, we should get 5% of the world's population together to build a thing to line up with a star system. What is it? Is it Orion that it's lining up to? I've heard serious, but then a lot of people are really into serious, the dog star, because they think that that's where the, whatever alien intelligence helped the evolution of the species that came from Syria. This is the Dogon tribe you've heard of. They're the ones who have, yes. They're the ones who have somehow understood the, I don't know exactly what it is. They found planets, or they seem to be talking about planets on serious, or in series that people just discovered. So that's part of the ancient alien ideas that these beings came from serious, or an even more intense idea is that actually, we are on serious right now, and planet Earth is a projection in some kind of institute where humans are learning to be citizens in an advanced society. And so as part of that, there's this, I don't know, what do they call it when you leave, a cookie, or what do they call it? Not a cookie, an Easter egg. In the program, which is like the pyramids point to serious, and serious comes up all the time, and dog is God spelled backwards, and serious is the dog star. Wow. Yeah, I mean, the whole Dogon tribe thing is so fascinating because they did have some knowledge of some astrological knowledge that's pretty incredible. That's right, and how? Yeah, I don't know. Well, there's so many possibilities other than they came from space. This is like somebody knew more than them, and they taught them, and then that got spread out over several generations, and butchered. But you know that great joke you have, which is, if I left you alone in the forest with an axe, how long would it be before you build an iPhone? Well, how long before you could send me an email? Send me an email, that's it, right, right, right. So, when I think about my understanding of the moon, like right now, if I go out and look at the moon, and try to analyze how far away it is from the earth, or even try to understand what the next, what it's gonna look like in a week, right now, if I try to do that, I can't do it. I would look at it and be like, well, I don't think it's gonna be full because there's just a full moon. I bet it'll kind of go out a little bit, but it would take me a long time to just to understand the moon. So, the idea that some tribe in Africa somehow doesn't just understand the moon, but they understand a fucking star system. And they don't understand a star system, but they understand that there are planets in the star system that we're just finding, or I don't know what, some kind of objects in the star system that we're just discovering, to think about that's like, well, okay, even if it is just something on earth that someone figured out, who the fuck is that person? Studying the sky prior to the existence of- Telescopes. Skate telescopes. Looking at, I don't even know if you can see serious from planet Earth right now, but let's say you could. It's just one of those tiny little glimmering little dots up there in that great sea of dots that whoever lived in that tribe would have seen because there's no light pollution. And for some reason, they tune in on that tiny, those tiny little flickering lights in the sky, and somehow from that looking at it, they're like, yes, and then there's also these planets there, and they accurately report them in a way that astronomers have noted, like, yeah, we don't know how they knew it, but they knew it. Yeah, there's some holes there. Well, Dennis McKenna's way fucking smarter than me. There's a few guys that I talked to that I have to go, okay, can you slow that down, back that up, explain that one more time, and I have to try to throw it into my feeble washing machine brain. I'm like, I'm taking a whole army's clothes and chucking it into some apartment washing machine. That's, I feel like, when he's given me information. Like, and when he was trying to explain the actual mechanical aspects, like the mechanisms behind the stone-dape theory about psilocybin's interaction with the human mind and how it potentially could explain the birth of language and all these different things, I remember like being like, okay, note to self, gotta listen to this again, like, because there's no way I'm grabbing it. He believes that human beings have been engineered, in some way, by some sort of extraterrestrial intelligence. And he has a lot of openings for that. He believes it could be a plant-based intelligence, like it could be through ayahuasca or through mushrooms or things along those lines. He thinks it could be something that's come here from another planet. He thinks it could be, there's a lot of possibilities, he thinks it could be they jettisoned their DNA into space and knew that it would eventually touch down on some fertile planet, like spreading seeds throughout the galaxy. But his belief is that he's had, I guess he's had some pretty intense psychedelic experiences, like really intense ones. Like, you ever heard the one, I think it's in Food of the Gods, it's one of Terrence's book, he details where Dennis went into this like many week spell where he was convinced that somehow or another the psilocybin was interacting with his own DNA and was creating some new thing. And he's had some pretty intense, intense psychedelic experiences. This is when they went, they were trying to- Blacherera. Yes, they wanted to open a portal to bring something back from the DMT realm. And he was proposing to Terrence that if he uttered some kind of, if he's just said something that had Dennis's name in it, it sounds like schizophrenia. So it sounds like, it sounds like a very, whatever they were in, it just sounds like madness. They were taking so much mushrooms. They were talking about these mushrooms that were growing the size of dinner plates and they would just gather them up and start eating them. They were just, they blew their brains out. Yeah, they blew their brains out. Yeah, I mean, I think there's a thing about psychedelics where there's like this letting go thing. That's a big part about it. That's what makes the experience work. What makes the experience work is this, you have to have this ability to succumb, to give in, to relax, to accept. To die. Yeah. Or just to just not exist anymore. I mean, not even think about dying or rebirth or any of these things like, look, I'm good again. None of that. It's like literally a non-existent state. And if you get too much in that non-existent state, I think it eats all your breadcrumbs. I think you can't figure out how to get fucking home. And you're lost in the woods on your way to grandma's house and you're like, there's no fucking breadcrumbs. This is what Robert Anton Wilson calls chapel perilous is the name he gives for this, which is this, you know, it's the, in the seeker's, in the path of the seeker, there's this, you'll go into this place, which is the, this is the mad hatter. This is the house of mirrors that you can go into. And yeah, because just like any other great thing on earth, there is always the risk of true destruction for the self in some way, and you can lose your mind. You can lose your mind and stay there forever. It seems like to emerge from that chapel perilous as they call it, it requires a, you have to like be disintegrated and reintegrated to get to the other. You have to let yourself disintegrate and reintegrate. But some people who think they've reintegrated, that's just another trick that illusion is playing on them. Yeah, I think it's very, I mean, think about just, for pretty much anyone who does any sort of a psychedelic, there's a rebooting, right? Even if it's just a temporary rebooting of the way you look at things, like it's like, wow, I feel better today, that was really, even if you're like a frivolous person, like that was so fun, that was so awesome, I'm so happy, that's great, like even if you're not like considering it from some, maybe that's better in some ways than some deep philosophical sort of bullshit way of looking at a psychedelic experience. I laughed harder than I've ever laughed in my entire life for six hours straight. Right, because you know things that you've said that you just said because they're honest, but then you've heard other people say the exact same thing and you kind of know what they're doing, that they're not quite, they're sort of like painting, they're making a painting that we've all seen before, so they're doing their version of it. You know, look, this is the dogs playing cards. Like we've all seen them fucking painting, you know what I mean? It's like, it's their way to define the psychedelic experience is to put it into this like real, That's so funny. Obvious archetype that we've seen before, you know what I mean? Yes. And so they'll talk, and you can tell the difference, that's what's weird, I can tell the difference when someone is telling, and they might have had a very profound experience, but they're relating of the experience. I'm not denying the profundity of their experience, but I'm saying their ability to relate it becomes fictionalized. Right. And it's probably not even their fault, it's like a lot of it is they just don't know how to express themselves in that way, like trust their expression to try to figure out what the fuck a real psychedelic experience is, right? Yes, yeah, exactly, that's the, I think that's what one of the great, that was one of the great talents of McKenna is that he was, he had a lot of talents, one of the talents was he was able to fearlessly allow himself to enter into these psychedelic states numerous times, but the other talent was he could bring back the information he discovered there in a way that people who have entered the psychedelic state or even haven't feel psychedelic, you feel that again when you're reading McKenna. When you read McKenna, he will summon back up some of your deepest trips just by talking about what's happening over there, wherever there may be. And that's a talent. Yeah, charisma. And I think that was one of the things he said, it's like, listen, if you're gonna take a psychedelic right now during the prohibition, then bring something back, bring something back, come back with some information, don't just go there with like a, his idea was go there like an anthropologist, come back with a little bit of stuff that you can give to the world, because the stuff that comes to the world from that place causes evolution to happen. And this is the same thing that I think Dennis McKenna is saying in a different way, which is that aliens had some effect on the evolution of the human species. Well, sure, and maybe these aliens are located in the psychedelic state. And maybe when people go into the psychedelic state and come back with some kind of articulation of the ideas that they had there, maybe that's what creates these huge leaps in human evolution and technological evolution, which is why so many luminaries like Tesla and Steve Jobs all report, psychedelic state, LSD for Tesla was just a vision he had, but they all report going to some kind of liminal place and getting information that they then bring back into this dimension, which creates massive shifts in society. Yeah, no, that's a fascinating possibility that we are being altered by what McKenna would call and other, and that the other really fascinating aspect is that it's happening to us every night and we just don't have any recollection of it. The thing that everyone's willing to go to sleep every night is you shut off, you're shutting off your whole thing. You're looking forward to it. Oh my God, I'm so tired, I can't wait. You get your head down the pillow. And first of all, what is tired? Like, why is this body need to shut off? Like, how weird is that? Like, you get to a point where you're nodding at the wheel, like during like perilous activities, like driving a fucking car, like your brain is trying to check out so hard, trying to check out while you're driving. Like, bitch, don't you know we'll die if you go to sleep right now? Like, why being so greedy about dying, about sleeping rather. But then once you do sleep, you're fucking gone. You don't have any real memories. You have some vague ideas of some weird, weird dreams that you had that involve people that you barely remember, having prominent roles in your life, could involve monsters and magic and preposterous notions, right? It could be really ridiculous. Sure, man. And who knows, they say you're only remembering a small percentage of the dreams. So it's like, sleep is like God taking a bathroom break. It's like when God has to piss, you fall asleep long enough for him to like stop playing the game and like get some Cheetos. That's what the impulse to sleep is. That's so strange. Yeah, I love, that was another thing McKenna said in some lecture I downloaded about how, you know, every 12 hours, one side of the earth is in one of the most vivid psychedelic experiences. Just as the, if you follow the light, as it flows across the earth, what you're seeing is this thing chasing away the psychedelic experience. And the moment the light is gone, all the people and animals even fall back into that weird psychedelic state. So as the planet is revolving, not only is it like physically revolving, beings living on the planet are sort of swimming in and out of this psychedelic state, like dolphins coming in and out of water almost. Wow, that's incredible. That is, you know, that is the big mystery, isn't it? What happens when we shut off? And why is it when you have DMT trips? I mean, I've had them now over, you know, a period of more than 10 years when I first started doing, I think I did it in 2012, 2002. So it's been at least 12 years. And I still remember the first experience being, I've been here before. I remember that feeling, like, I know this place. Right. Like, oh, this place, there's this, and it's like, no, you don't know us. There's like this weird thing about the very first entry that I'll never forget. And then every time I go there, of course, I know it. Cause I've been there and it's the most profound thing you could ever see. So of course I know it, but there's still something behind that, there's something deeper than that. And I wanna say I think, because I don't think, I ponder the possibility that we go to that place every night. Sure. Yeah, I think that does happen. Why is it that when you dream, you know, you have these incredible weird freaky things and you're piecing together, it's probably only like 30 seconds of actual dream, you know, that you're piecing together into this elaborate plot. Oh my God, we were fucking, we were running down the street and Casper, the friendly ghost, was with us and he loved us and why is it that it's so hard to remember that fucking thing later? When you wake up, that dream is like right there and it's crazy. Imagine if you went to see Captain America, okay? Captain America fought the Winter Soldier and they fucking had this incredible battle. Is it a good movie? It's a decent comic book movie. Okay, go ahead, sorry. It's fun. That's a stupid question. No, no, it's not. It's a good question, because I don't know why I brought up that Captain America. No, you go to the movie and then you leave. You go to the movie and there's this fucking badass fight scene. I can remember that badass fight scene pretty clearly. Right. I mean, it happened, I saw that movie months ago and I can remember them duking it out on the wing of this plane and I remember how Robert Redford's a fucking piece of shit and Sammy Jackson's in on it and like all this, you know, he gets shot and this is all crazy. I remember the plot. I remember the bad guy, he was a good guy one point time, Captain America knew. I mean, it's all, the shit is in my head. But the DMT trips, it's like I'm scrambling to hold on to like frames. One frame here, one frame there. Right. Like I can't, and it was way more profound. I think of it as though somebody came to you and whispered to you the greatest news you've ever heard in your life and then somehow right after they tell you you get amnesia. So you can't remember what they said but you still have that feeling of like, wow, that's great. Really? That's a funny way to think about it. Holy shit, that's great. And you're not sure why you're thinking that. You know, I can remember from the DMT, the most profound DMT trip I had. I can remember it and I can remember the feeling that went along with it and I can remember the sense of relief that went along with it. But I can't remember the specifics so much. But I think that the communication you're getting from there, the familiarity that you're experiencing is the familiarity of the same familiarity you have when you stop reading a book for a second and like go back to your regular life, you know? And I think that probably is DMT, dreaming, death. It's all the same thing. It's just you going back to your regular self that isn't doing this thing that we're doing right now called being a human. And being a human is just something the universe does. And a lot of people have theories about why the universe does that. But and some of them are like Richard Dawkins evolutionary. It just happens after a certain amount of time and planets spin and there's molecules and they over the course of time, they evolve into like these things and these massive brains that have sentience. And then on the other side of the scale there's people who say, this is a university. You're being taught right now. You are in class, class is in session and you're learning about some really specific principles and you keep going back to class again and again and again and again and again till you get it. And once you get it, that's it. And that's called, that's like the transcendent true enlightenment when you graduate and no longer reincarnate again in the software, the simulator that we're in. It would make sense. It's like when we're sending people to war, they use simulators, flight simulators, military's tank simulators. It makes sense that in that same way, it's like if there was some kind of super advanced species, the way it would train young godlings is by putting them in a very limited situation and getting them to understand what works. Not by just teaching them but like, here, let's experience every possible incarnation, devouring, being devoured, loving, having the heart broken, gaining, losing, experience the whole spectrum of embodied existence and then maybe at the end of that, that's when you become some, that's when you're ready to become something great. If you really put any weight at all on the individual, but what are the things about the psychedelic state, to me, seems that the idea of getting caught in the individual is just a big trick. It's like a big, silly trick. It's almost like they laugh, like DMT elves or whatever you want to call them, the beings. They laugh when you think about you as you. They think you're so funny. They really think it's funny. And then they show you how, no, no, no, this is way crazier, like you're part of all this and then you're part of all this, you're part of all this, you're part of all this, you're part of, and they show you those images and that, I don't even want to say images because it's like you're being led through a three-dimensional experience in the most vivid visual that you can't imagine. You can't say you could possibly imagine because you could never imagine it. If you hadn't actually seen a DMT trip, you would never imagine what the fuck that is. And when you do do it, if you have any thoughts at all about yourself, they just go, ha, look at you, you're so silly. It's cute, it's the same way you treat a baby. And it's the exact same way you treat a baby and it's an indication that we exist in an expanding, evolving universe. It's not just that, I think it's ridiculous to think that it's just planets that form and it's just stars that form. I think it's possible that other universes form within universes and the process for those universes to form is somehow whatever's happening here on earth. It's all part of this movement in the direction of something. I think there is movement. I think that behind it all, there might be some universal truth, but I do think that there is the adjectives, expanding, increasing, accelerating, unfolding. The sense of a thing actually happening. The sense that there is not a in game that's already happened that we're in, there is this sense of something is unfolding and exponentially increasing in the direction of what I think is paradise or bliss or some kind of, I don't know what it is exactly. I think it's unfolding to progress for sure. And I think that a lot of these, like the conversation that we were having dinner today about these social issues that people have, that a lot of it is people trying to work out things for the better. They might have the wrong strategy. They might have the wrong motivation. They might be motivated by the need to get all the feminists to love them or they might be motivated by the need to get all these men's rights advocates to fucking like their Facebook page. There could be a bunch of different reasons why people have these motivations for action, but ultimately, what is it leading to? It's gonna lead somehow or another to conflict resolution. And along the way, people are forced, like it or not, they're forced to address the other people's opinions. And there's gonna be some opinions that people reluctantly accept as being valid, even if they're opposing to their own ideologies. They'll reluctantly accept these ideas as being valid. And I think that that's a part of what's going to have to happen when you have these debates openly and honestly on the internet. Or you're not going to. I mean, there's the argument that you're not going to. There's the argument that the internet, in fact, stifle, I've heard people say the internet stifles originality because the originate, the originate, that's the latest. The internet stifles originality because it allows for so much rampant confirmation bias. And so many people find like-minded groups, whether it's Pentecostals that speak in tongues or people that believe in the Second Amendment and they carry a gun on them every time they go to take a shit in the middle of the night. There's like, you could find a group of like-minded folks out there and you just start using jargon. I got my RFID in the mail yesterday. I'm not going to go out on a fucking RFQ with a PPT. When people do that shit on message boards, it drives me crazy. I'm like, cut that fucking shit. Say the Duncan Trust on Family Hour. You're talking about, what you're talking about here is the, so like you have Saturn and the rings of Saturn. The rings of Saturn are all these like dust particles that have congealed around the gravity of Saturn. And so that's what you're talking about with these message boards or whatever weird small societies pop up is surrounding some group of charismatic. There's always this dust cloud of people who are trapped in that orbit who are circling around whatever the specific paradigm is that represents that subculture, whether it's feminism, anti-feminism, racism, communism, whatever it is, you're just witnessing people who've been pulled into the gravity of a specific operating system, being offered by a few really smart people into the world who think that this is the operating system we all need to be running. If we run this motherfucker, it's going to somehow improve conditions on planet Earth. That's what we are talking about at dinner. And I have been reading Cosmic Trigger, Robert Anton Wilson, super into Timothy Leary right now. And what we were talking about is the idea that, what Timothy Leary said, smile, space migration, intelligence squared and life extension. These are the three imperatives for humanity right now. Let's conquer death, get into space and make ourselves smarter, everything else, fuck it. So the idea is what operating systems in the form of culture ideologies or philosophies allow those three things to happen and which of them don't. And the ones that don't, let's allow ourselves the indulgence of thinking that there is a moral hierarchy when it comes to philosophies. And that the hierarchy is if your shit is not going to get us into space, if it's not going to double the human lifespan and it's not going to make us smarter, we don't need it right now. Thank you, thank you, no thanks. Shut the door on the Mormons. Yeah, yeah, or the, or the, or the, or the, whatever. Whatever it is. Whatever it is, whatever you are that's trying to keep us stuck on planet Earth. Whatever you are that's trying to enforce a rigid ideology that's based on superstition, ancient shit makes no sense. Thank you, but no thank you. No thanks. If I'm in a skyscraper. Sharia law. Sharia law. No thanks. Doesn't get me off the planet. Thank you very much. Appreciate it very much. Doesn't get me off the planet. Doesn't get me out of the building that's on fire. If I'm in a building on fire and there's a group of people who are like, okay, how do we get out of the building on fire? Who am I going to listen to? The first people I don't listen to are the people like, let's just stay in the building. That's so true. It's on fire, asshole. The fucking planet. The ice caps are melting. The thing's dying down. And people are like, oh, you mean you want to go infect the rest of the universe? Yes. Yes, I do. Just like any other infectious virus, just like the Ebola virus, I want to fly, baby. I want the Earth to sneeze me out and want to Elon Musk's super advanced interstellar vehicles and travel to another planet where I can experience what it's like to be in a place where we don't know what it is yet. Yeah, give it to me. I think our urgency, the urgency of resolving these ideas and these, like trying to figure out a peaceful way to have all the humans on Earth have access to resources and be able to live and prosper and not fucking pollute the ocean, eat all the fish up and leave everybody starving to death. I really do think that's still possible. And I think that what we're seeing right now, like this hopelessness and this feeling like nothing is ever going to totally work itself out. Like it's just going to be chaos and war. And I think it's the growing pains of the human mind accepting the digital age of information, that these ideologies they're clinging to with their fucking scarfs over their faces and praising these imaginary beings. These are the death throes of complex ideologies that have kept people moving in the right direction for a certain amount of years. But much like a cocoon, the butterfly sheds that stupid shit. But without that stupid shed, it might not have ever made it this far. And I think that something's going on with people today where there seems to be a fever pitch, both in like political left wing ideologies versus right wing ideologies, religions versus atheism, which in a lot of ways is like another religion. Are you aware of atheism plus? No. It's a fascinating movement because it's essentially creating a religion out of atheism. They would probably disagree. I think their intentions are great. I mean, the idea is atheism with a set of moral values and standards. It's called Buddhism, dum-dums. Well, they're just saying no. They're not subscribing to any ideology other than no racism, no sexism, no oppression. They have this idea. Daoism? Yeah, but I mean, there's nothing wrong with having these ideas. Those things you just mentioned, those are all religions. So there's nothing wrong with creating an engineered new one based on what we know today in 2014. I think it's a great idea. Nothing wrong with it. But it's fascinating to combat religion. They've become a religion. And this, an atheism in and of itself is an ideology. And if you're saying that an ideology isn't a religion, you're splitting hairs. You're saying you don't know if there's a God. Okay, did you die? Right. Did you die? Right. You didn't die. So if you died and you got to heaven and there was Saint Peter and you had a book and there was harps and angels, you'd be like, motherfucker, I guess I was wrong. Like, is it likely that that's gonna go down? No, but I also have a problem with a lot of people that are like really high on the horse of moral discourse who have never had a psychedelic experience. I don't get it. Well, I get it. They want the world to be a better place. And I've met some amazing people that have never had a psychedelic experience. I don't get it. When a smart person has it, has it had a psychedelic experience. Well, no, only because it's- No, no, no, not you, why? Why them? Well, yeah, right. Well, because here's the, like, so you talk to a sober person and a sober person, when they say they're sober, what they mean is I use the drugs that are sanctioned by the state to be sober. So I drink coffee, I smoke cigarettes, I take Prozac, if I get anxious, I'll have a Xanax, but I'm sober. Oh, wait, hold on. God's feedback, they're still recording. But you know, I'm sober. We're laughing too hard. Some of the, I know some sober people who like are, all they do all day long is stare at their phone and drink coffee. And it's like, okay, so you're clearly not in this reality. You're in a reality of pure caffeination. A friend of mine who's sober, I was having this conversation and they were like, you know what, just drink coffee for a year, smoke pot for a year and drink coffee and tell me what it's like. Something ridiculous like that, because they feel like caffeine isn't a drug. They feel like caffeine doesn't have the same detrimental effects that marijuana might have on a person's life or that a psychedelic might have. The end game to the conversation was a simple globe article about how the founder of Alcoholics Anonymous was a proponent of LSD. And it's like, oh, I guess there's nothing else to talk about. I think we're done here. Well, no, I ended it with like, I'm a friend of Bob's. It's Bill. Bill, whatever. Well, it's also, man, if you were really scared of coffee, coffee could do some crazy shit to you. Coffee makes you, coffee gives you weird digestive problems. It definitely kills more people per year than LSD. I don't know about that. Oh, no, it does. I don't really think coffee kills people. Oh, no, caffeine, I mean, I'm sorry, caffeine. Not coffee, but the substance that makes, if you remove, as far as I'm aware, there's not a huge market for decaf coffee. People do drink it. They do drink it, but yeah, it's probably, if I had a guess, man, not even a quarter. I would say it's probably, yeah, probably a quarter. People like the caffeine. Three percent. They drink in coffee for that. Can we find out? The percentage of people who drink decaf? Yeah. Let me look it up. I think it's like less than 10% if I had a guess. Let me look it up. Percentage of people. I just like to know how many silly fucks are drinking that shit for the flavor. When I get around people who drink decaf, it's like my heart sinks in this weird way. I don't even know why. It's gross. It's gross. They don't order decaf. Just order something. Just order a nice, like- A tea. A rumble tea. A nice herbal tea. What are you doing? Tate Fletcher has the best thing about coffee. Who actually owns Caveman Coffee, whose t-shirt I'm wearing right now. Oh, cool. Tate Fletcher goes, it's like having a warm hug. That's what coffee is like. It's like a big warm hug. I can't find it, but someone look it up for us and find it, but the whole point is like, come on, let's face it. People like coffee and the same. People smoke cigarettes, not because they like inhaling, burning fucking smoke from paper into their lungs, they like it, because of the nicotine. Let's ask Google. People like- What percentage of people, percentage? Whoops. What percentage of people? My boss then actually came out large for some reason. I'm trying to fight that since birth, hold on. What percentage of people who drink coffee drink decaf? Man, that sounds terrible, that scratchy shit on the- I know, it's the farm, the field. It's gotta be rotting our brains. If it's fucking with the mics, it's gotta be fucking with our brains. Google did a terrible job. It's not gonna find it. Let's say it's 40%, whatever. Who gives a shit? It's safe to say the majority of people are enjoying coffee, not for its taste, though its taste is great. With almond milk, I like it, but- They're getting a drug out of it. They like the drug. For sure. So the whole sobriety thing, and especially, I mean, look, I hate to say it, and I'm sorry for all the sober people out there, but you guys, by stopping people from taking psychedelics, you're doing a lot of harm to the world. A lot of fucking harm to the world. I can't believe you're saying that. I'm gonna say it, you're hurting the world. What's wrong with just being sober, Duncan, and waiting for your heart to stop beating? Peace, yeah. What's wrong with getting your anxiety in check with a little bit of Xanax every day, and going to coffee and meetings, and you get up there, and you get your new chip that says you're 140 fucking thousand days sober, and you make it a part of your culture? That's your life. That's fine. It's fine if you're finding happiness through that, but if you're promoting an ideology that has, as one of its components, the lie that psychedelics reduce a person's ability to experience happiness in this dimension, or the idea that psychedelics are in some way a life crusher on the level of cocaine and heroin, then you're doing a disservice to your species. And every single year, now that the prohibition on the research of these chemicals has been lifted, which by the way, I don't remember who said it, it might've been Leary. I'm really into Leary right now. He said, the prohibition of psychedelics will not stop the consumption of psychedelics. It's a prohibition on the research of psychedelics. That's all you've done is made it so that people are gonna keep taking them, but no one's gonna know what they are, because you're not letting scientists research them. Johns Hopkins University just came out. Did you read the Smoker cessation? Yeah, Smoking psilocybin connection. Long-term smokers, something like 60% of them, it might've been 80% in eight months after doing three mushroom trips, stop smoking. Unprecedented results. For those of you who have promulgated some ridiculous ideology where mushrooms are bad for you, LSD is bad for you, any kind of psychedelics bad for you, you are an asshole. And you have done the exact same thing the Catholics did when they put Galileo in prison for telling the truth. That's all you're doing, because you weren't able to differentiate that heroin, cocaine, speed, barbiturates are a whole different animal from psychedelics. And if you think that psychedelics are a gateway drug that leads you into that land, the research is showing you're fucking wrong because it's curing addiction. So fuck you. You're very aggressive. Forgive me for being aggressive. I love you guys. It's one, I'm stuck there, I'm stuck there. No, no, it's a good place to be stuck because it's good to let the people who do oppose psychedelics hear the anger and the commitment in your words because what you're saying is valid. But what I think is that it's just ignorance. I think that these folks are ignorant. There's a guy, I won't mention his name, but I had a dispute with him. And one of the things, I mean, it was pretty clear that I didn't have a dog in the race when we were having this conversation. I was just giving him some facts that he didn't want to accept. And we had this back and forth because of it. And then we had a conversation about it afterwards and he goes, I've been thinking a lot about trying psychedelics. And I said, I think it would be really good for you. And he said, we're going back and forth in email, something to tune of, a lot of people have a lot of really great people said it did amazing things to expand their mind. And I said, I think it could help you. I think it could help you maybe get out of a little bit of a rut that you might be in. Because I think one of the big ruts, especially for, not just for men, but for adults that are, they're on their way, they have bills, they have a mortgage, they're in motion, they have a career. Very rarely do they want to accept that they were ever incorrect about anything. Whenever anybody starts getting any kind of success, when they start getting any kind of momentum in their life, you know, like finally I'm out of debt, finally I paid off my student loans, I'm moving forward, and then something comes up and it's like, listen, you might be wrong about this whole psychedelics thing. Listen, I fucking quit drinking, I had my last drink when I was 22 years old, I went to Alcoholics Anonymous, I've been sober for 32 years, now I have a house, it's worth $700,000, I've got my own car, I'm fucking, my mom lives in my garage, you know what I mean? Like they'll start rattling off the amount of progress they've made away from that alcohol because they're on that path. And so it's really hard for people that are on that path to say, okay, I clearly had an issue with substances, but what substances are those if I'm allowing myself to drink coffee, if I'm allowing myself to smoke cigarettes? What is it I'm so terrified of in these psychedelics, especially the ones that have been shown to be not only not addictive, but anti-addictive. Right, they reset whatever the habitual patterns of your brain are. The people that are fighting against it, I just think they don't know any better. I think they're on a path and they don't know any better. Don't know any better, just like somebody fingering their toddler's butthole right now, to me it doesn't matter, the whole, we don't know any better. It's like, no, I don't care if you don't know any better, I know I'm not insane, and I know that any time I've taken a psychedelic, the most recent being an incredible MDMA experience, where the experiencing like true connection and like the love that seems to be behind everything or my most decent, distant LSD trip, all of those things have been little bumps that have propelled me in the direction, little bits of burst of acceleration that have propelled me in the direction of being able to like read Ram Dass and understand what he's saying or like being able to like have an open mind enough to like listen to like, I don't know, Jack Cornfield or like get information from people like that without shutting off immediately when it starts disrupting the concept that I might not be a person, that I might be a unified consciousness. Those have all helped me move in that direction. I'm not there yet, I still think I'm a person but all the- Well, you're both. See, that's the things, like trying to separate any of the possibilities. It's, they're all a wash on each other. Like you are a person, but you are also universal consciousness. You are an ego, but you are also biology. You are a seed that wants to spread and you are also the love that is the glue that keeps civilization together. All those things are the same. It's just, you know, we're trying to define shit, man. And we're trying to define shit basically in our lifetimes in a way, I mean, your mother was incredibly smart, man. I mean, the podcast with your mom was a really interesting insight into who you are as a person. So I got to see how brilliant your mother was and how the conversations you guys had were these really complex conversations. Yes. I never had those conversations. My mom's not, she's not a dumb person. She just didn't talk that way, didn't think that way. Right. She was more relaxed and laid back and she's a great person and she's cool to be with and she's funny and she's nice, but she just wasn't like, you know, so my point being is your mother, I think was a very original thinker and she was very into seeing things for what she believed they really were, where you are as well. And so your model of seeing things from the way you believe them to be, you believe the world to be is based entirely on the information you've gathered in your 30 plus years of life, your experiences that you've personally, you know, taken into account and learned and grown from and all of those things they sort of add together and somewhere along the line, you realize, wow, I'm essentially, I took a baton from my mother and I ran with it and now I'm in this uncharted territory and we're all that way. Everyone that's alive that's listening to my voice in 2014 is in uncharted territory. No one has ever lived to just, what is it, September 17th or some shit? What is today? What is today? What is it, hold on. Yeah, September 17th. Listen, everybody listening to this, you are the only fucking people ever that has made it to September 17th, 2014. You are the only ones. No one has ever gotten this far. Nobody knows what the fuck is ahead in this crazy video game. You are at the front of the line, the cutting edge of civilization. September 17th, 2014, if you're hearing my voice, you're at the front of the fucking line of history. There's no denying that. So anybody trying to piece life together, based on the information that we gathered up over the last whatever hundreds of years of people have been writing things down, it's come to a head. I mean, it'll get further along, probably long after we're gone, if people are still alive, the information that this generation has gathered up will help seed the next generation's imagination and they will take things to another level of understanding and then their children will do the same. It's just the way it's always been. We're in this weird stage right now where we're aware of it. And we have way more information because of the exponential progress of technology. And way more responsibility because of that progress. And way more responsibility because of our ability doing things like this, having this conversation. An ability that never existed before, your fucking podcast reaches more people than 99% of the radio shows on the planet. That's a fact, that's a fact. Your podcast goes international. This podcast will go to London. I get emails from Scotland and Dublin and China and Singapore and Japan. It's just, there's people everywhere, man. They're all thinking and growing. I get these Death Squad Australia tweets. I mean, that shit is spreading. And that is, so it's a huge, it's a responsibility that you have to make sure that what you're, the signal that you're putting out is a signal that is going to induce growth in the species. However you wanna do that. Do you think of that though? Do you think of that as a responsibility? I'm going to make sure I give a signal that delivers. But I do think that when I put shit out there, I do think that in the early days of podcasting, when I had a podcast with Natasha, the lavender hour, I think I was way more loose with throwing out shit vibes into the world. Cause I didn't think about it too much. Or like, when I tweet, outside of the fake fights I get into with Brendan Walsh, which is stupid and fun. In the earlier days, I would be more prone to attack someone who says something shitty to me. Whereas now it's just like, oh, just block, turn off that connection. Because I think that when you throw, we're all learning that the energy we're putting out is bouncing back to us in increasingly severe ways. And you don't have to chalk that up to some kind of metaphysical principle, which I do. You can just look at the fact that with a growing population, when you go into the world, you're seeing a reflection of yourself in the way all the people around you act. So if there's more people, there's more reflections. So if you're acting like a shithead, then what's coming back to you and all the frowns and people not calling you back and people turning their back on you and people talking shit about you is only gonna be amplified and multiply with a growing population. And the same way, if you're a kind person who's generous and tips and listens and helps people and tries to do more for people than they do for you, then you're gonna experience the reflection of that energy in the form of people wanting to help you all the time and people weeping when you die. Though you won't experience that. When you're getting sick, you'll experience it. That's a brilliant way of putting it, the amount of reflections. And we were kind of talking about that today as well, about negative responses on the internet and this is just the interaction with all the various people on the internet is just the numbers you're reaching are so great that the amount of people that suck are gonna be much higher than they ever were before because even though the percentage of people that suck is the same, the percentage of people who are anonymous and hurtful and angry there's a lot of people that don't get any love, man. And it's not their fucking fault. A lot of them, they're born into a shitty household with shitty parents, they got bad genetics, they went to a terrible neighborhood school and the whole thing's a fucking disaster. And they're just filled with imbalance. It's more imbalanced than it is. You mean categorize it in a negative and say it's hate, but a big percentage of what a lot of haters are is just imbalanced. They're going through this life and they just fucking want to lash, man. They want to lash and every time they get a chance to lash and they can be anonymous and shit on Jennifer Lawrence's tits or whatever the fuck it is that they can just just hate and it's not their fault. They got a shit deal unless, I had Rupert Sheldrake on the podcast yesterday and he was talking about his time in India and he would talk about how he would want to help poor people and the Indian people would be like, it is their karma, you have to understand they have done something in another life to be in this position, no. And what a convenient way of looking at that, you know. Sure. Yeah, I'm not sure if I agree. I don't see any evidence whatsoever that anybody that's going to shit position is anything other than a baby that got fucked with a shit roll of the dice. And the idea that you're fucking beholden to some shit that happened before you were born, what a douchey universe. What a douchey universe of reincarnation and karma does exist in the Hindu form. Because that fucking sucks, man. It sucks that you can't even start fresh as a baby. Right. Yeah, well, that's why I think when people ask the Buddha about what happens when you die, he was always like, let's not worry about that right now. Buddha sounds like me. Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Well, yeah, you're kind of a Buddhist, man. You have Buddhist statues all over your house, you just don't know it, but that's fine. You don't have to know you're a Buddhist to be one, but he was kind of like, let's deal with that when the time comes. But right now, let's deal with what's happening right now. But in the same way that the idea is like, you can understand the whole by studying its parts. So the idea is like, if you study the way energy works in the universe, and you study a person's life, you can see, biologically, they reincarnate every certain amount of years, because your DNA is always sort of producing new use. Your DNA is always pumping out new you. So you are in this constant state of reincarnation. The baby Joe Rogan versus Joe Rogan now, these are two completely different beings. Every single cell inside of these beings, more than likely is different. The Rogan that was a baby versus the Rogan now, that Rogan that was a baby, all those cells, they're done. Not just that. I mean, how about the you of a week ago? You got to be responsible for that asshole. Yeah, exactly. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. You're you now. Like why do I have to keep fucking carrying the burden of some dude who lived a year ago? That shit is annoying. You don't, but you only have to carry that burden as long as you keep doing the same things that that guy was doing a year ago. So it's just simple. It's like you take a rudder and you put it on a boat. The way you can shape that rudder in a certain way where the boat's gonna go tend to go left or the boat's gonna tend to go right. So the idea is if you can reshape the rudder of your own life by beginning to act in ways that are vastly different from the way that you habitually act, then you will experience a brand new incarnation with all new reflections coming into you from the mirror of the organic mirror surrounding you in society. Just worry about that. As far as the notion of when you die, if you continue, if you are in a certain momentum in some direction, you're gonna have a better life. Let's help, maybe. But here's what's crazier. You don't have to fucking die. Ha ha ha ha ha. And shit can get way better. You just have to stop being a dick. Ha ha ha ha ha. Well, you know, I don't like to quote Tony Robbins too much, but he actually said some pretty brilliant shit. And one of the things that he said, he's got a very good ability to break things down to the things that you remember. And he equated the way you're living your life now to pretend that there's two ships and they're on a parallel line. And they're going the same direction. And one ship just makes a two degree deviation. Well, as they go further, that ship continues to get further and further and further apart from the other ship. It's, they're not just going the same speed. That two degree deviation has made one go wider and wider and wider the further they go. So that a year down the line or 10 years down the line, you're so far away from where you were on that one incremental shift. Right. And those incremental shifts, they can keep occurring. It's not like you can only make one. It's not like you're going down this road. You're on a parallel line with a douchebag. And you make one two degree shift and then a mile down the road, you're still going in that same path. No, you make another two degree shift. Now you're fucking five, six, seven miles. You're way, way out to the right. Way out to the right away from that guy. Or to the left or whatever, you know what I'm saying? That guy's dead. That guy's gone. He went off the cliff and you circled around back behind him because you kept turning. That's it. And that's what the world offers you. And that is a real thing. But you can't get there if you're not willing to go up to function in a completely different way. Like you have to really take some serious punches from the world to get, or what you think are punches. They're not punches. You just have to stop getting vengeance on everything. You know, it's like you just have to stop every time. Everyone, the dumbest people I know, man, they always want to get back at someone. If someone does something, I like to look at the, what are the smartest people I know do? What are the most successful people I know do? What are the richest people I know do? They all seem unfazed by negativity. If someone's addicted to them, they might cut them off or keep them out of their lives, but they don't try to fuck them over after they hurt them. They don't pursue them in some way to ruin their lives. They just let them go into the world. The other thing about them is they always tend to be in a state of forgiveness, you know? They're very forgiving in a specific way, you know? But, and they also don't seem to care about all the shit they have. Cause the people I know who are really successful or wealthy, they don't seem very attached to the shit they have. Dude, I'm right here. You're one of them, man, for sure, though. You're talking about me, I'm not even here. I am talking about you, and I didn't want to be a dick. It'd be like, oh, that's what you're like. But it is cool to watch people like that. I know other people who are like quite successful and you see, interestingly enough, the same kind of patterns almost indicating that it's like there's a frequency you can tune into. Well, you know, I call it guerrilla Buddhism, my de-attachment to things. Right. The idea being, I don't know why I call it guerrilla Buddhism. It's just something that's stuck with it. Cause I have a fascination with apes. But the idea being that we have this attachment to things because they're so difficult to attain. But once things become really easy to attain, like if I wanted to go out and buy a new computer, I just go to the Apple store, I give them my plastic thing, I swipe it, I write my name on their little iPhone thingy, and I'm done. I'm not thinking about that at all. It doesn't register. So it becomes a free item. So if I go outside and it falls out of my truck and smashes on the ground and gets run over by another car, I don't freak out and head of a conniption. I go, whoops, and then I can get another one cause I'm not attached to it. But it's also, I have real things in my life that are significant. I think there's a real problem that people have. They detach materialism from the lack of connection that you have to your friends and to your craft and to your life and to your hobbies and to your loves and to your enjoyment and to your appreciation, your objective appreciation of this experience. They equate it like they're mutually exclusive. Like you either have to be a materialist who loves items or you're a really fulfilled, happy, satisfied person who has a bunch of friends and who's just spreading fun and happiness and joy. You can't be that person if you drive a 1969 Mustang, it's fucking perfect, cherry red, shiny rims, impossible. But I say, why not? I say, that's preposterous. I think you have this rigid sense of what a person has to and has to not do in order to be free of materialism. I say, you're more trapped by materialism because it's unattainable, because it's a thing that you can't possibly reach. The person like Bill Gates could truly be a non-materialist because he doesn't ever have to think about, I think about money. Like I can't go buy a house. I can't go fly a private jet. You know what I'm saying? A guy like Bill Gates has zero restrictions on any of his behavior ever as far as like his wants, needs, desires. You got the cheat code. The total cheat code to life. He can have the most ridiculous pimped out plane with diamond studs all over it. Like he could have a blinged out plane. He could have a plane covered in rhinestones, bulletproof, it has a parachute so he never has to worry about crashing. He could do whatever he wants. He has like a hundred billion dollars or some crazy show like that. That guy has a very unique possibility of being the ultimate materialist. And I'm not saying that you can't achieve enlightenment unless you're Bill Gates. I say, anybody who's trying to pick this apart and critique this, all I am saying is that we have this idea that things are mutually exclusive. Is that a person can't be a really good person but also eat meat. That a person can't be a really ethical, moral person but also get drunk with their wife and fuck. The person, you know what I'm saying? Like you raped your wife, she was drunk, she couldn't consent. There's a lot of weird shit going on right now where people are saying crazy things like that. You can be a good person and still like say, like what we did today in traffic, we know like this fucking guy cut off, cut in front of us and you got mad, you sent out a bunch of swears and you're like, well, there it is. Is that evil thing that just comes out of me every now and then? But no one got hurt and you and I laughed and it was funny, you know? But you're still great personally. The idea that those thoughts would never come to you because you're so pious and pure. No, that's poor shit. That's poor shit. It's a constant little wrestling match with the universe. That's what life is. Well, it's so funny you say a wrestling match because if you read, if you study, what is it? Like people are always wrestling with angels. Hiawatha wrestles with the great spirit and the great spirit gives him corn. Or like, isn't it like the story of the Jews? Like he was at Jacob's Ladder. He wrestles with an angel, breaks his... It's an archetype, this idea of wrestling with the truth until finally you surrender to what you really are. And man, what a great moment that is when you do that because it doesn't mean becoming something different. It means just being what you are right now is perfect. And that is an amazing idea. And that's the idea that's blasphemous to some people because they don't wanna think that everything's perfect. They wanna believe that things are imperfect because if things are imperfect, then evil can exist. And if evil can exist, then you can justify aggression. And nothing feels better than justified aggression. Nothing feels better than, this is why everyone's so, dicks are hard over ISIS. Cause like you can't feel bad if bombs are dropping on people who kidnap women and put them in brothels and beat decapitate babies. They cut off a journalist's head for no race. Oh, let him burn. Let him burn. Justified violence, it feels so good. It's the wine of the modern age. If we can find a nice way to distill justified violence into the people, then goddamn, we're gonna sell a lot of bombs. I wonder how many people buy Priuses knowing that they can shit on people who drive regular cars if they buy a Prius. They don't want to think that, but it's in the back a little bit. There's a little greasiness in the back. I can take that moral high ground. I'm a vegan and I got a Prius. I'm not fucking, I'm a double winner. It's so funny because when the, you know, the meteor that slams into earth next July and wipes out 30% of the population, you will never hear Nancy Grace or any Republican or any left-wing person say anything bad about that meteor. That meteor targeted babies in Chechnya. That's where it landed. There are more babies in the town where that meteor landed than in all of Florida. That meteor had volume in its pockets. The meteor was black. It landed in a white neighborhood. Was it a racial meteor? That meteor did not know its father. It did not know where it came shattering out from. So it's like the meteor is fine. No one judges the meteor, but human activity. That's the one piece of the universe that people get up in arms over. And that's the one piece of the universe that we have to forgive, because if we can just forgive that, if somehow you can, and you don't have to forgive the whole, forgive forgiving like, if you're angry about Benghazi, fine. You don't worry about that. You're not gonna forgive that right now, but forgive your father for not being loving enough to you when you're a baby, because he was a bit of a drunk and he was freaking out because he was at a war. Just work on that right now. And if you can do that and recognize that that's just a piece of the universe functioning the way the universe functions, then eventually you can maybe make it back to yourself. That's the idea, really. Just get to yourself right now. And if you can forgive yourself, if you forgive yourself, then you will no longer see the reflection of your own internal judgment in the faces of the people around you. And if you can do that, then suddenly you'll be in a whole different universe because the universe we all exist in is one where we're so terrified of the judgment of our peers. And I think that's a reflection of the judgment we put on ourselves. And if you can, like, if the judgment you're putting on yourselves is one where you've really gotten to the place where you realize you're an okay person, you're just doing what you can do right now to be okay. And you're just trying to survive in a dimension where you're gonna die. And it's in the middle of a fucking void. It's a really intense existential situation to get into. So if you're, whatever you've done up to this point, chances are you're just trying to survive. You weren't like, I'm gonna hurt as many people as I can. You were just like, fuck, man, I'm just trying to be okay. And I want my kids to be okay. Usually that's why people really do shitty things is for their kids. But whatever it is, you're just trying to survive. But if you can get to that place and then forgive whatever you've done and how you are and how you act, then you will stop seeing that reflection in other people. The douchebag level in your universe will drop by 80%. There'll still be douchebags, but you won't see the douchebag of you reflecting the other people because you've embraced that part of yourself. I mean, that's been my experience with it. It's kind of awesome. The more I'm judging myself, the more people around me are pricks. That's funny. That's an interesting concept that you put it out there. It's sort of a reverse secret. You're making your life shittier. Well, you're just trying to like not like, you're trying to not, I mean, like, I don't know if you do it, Joe. Maybe you don't do it so much anymore, but you know, like some people, like we're really hard on ourselves. I'm very hard on myself. Right. Extremely hard. I can flub one word of one joke and I won't sleep. I will fucking lie in bed and I will toss and turn. I don't like anything I do. I mean, I could say that's probably the best thing that I've done. And then I go, I could do better. And then I'm gone. And every time I edit a video, I just had to edit my special, my comedy central special. While I'm editing, I'm like, editors are howling, laughing. And I'm like, When someone like you says something like that, I think that there is a sigh of relief that spreads through the planet where other artists are like, oh, thank God. Well, I think we all feel like that. Cause we all hate it. We, the stuff that we're putting out are also terribly hard on ourselves for it. And I think that as a purpose, that can be okay. But I wonder how much of it is energy efficient. I wonder how much of it you really need and how much of it is like way overdoing it out of superstition. Cause like, I think you probably need like 10% of that. You need 10% of like, no, I think we could refine that and make it better. But you don't need, I can't sleep right now because I'm such a failure that that would happen. I think that's a waste of energy and it's actually gonna have the counter effect that you'd want it to have. And it's not gonna like increase the life of the material or the power inside the material. It's just gonna diminish it a little bit. Yeah, I think the heart in yourself thing comes from just you're the only one that can do it. You're the only one that can do Duncan Trussell. I mean, when you're on stage and you're, ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Duncan Trussell. There's one guy that can do that. You're the keeper of the Duncan Trussell act. If anyone's a Duncan Trussell fan, you're the person that has to deliver all the podcasts. You're the person that has to deliver all the comedy. And there's a great amount of responsibility with that. A tremendous amount that I feel very, very intensely. And I think that's why I also enjoy doing it so much. Also, because I know that it has this sort of, it has as much as it could be a pitfall, like some of them think a joke's not funny or specials are my best one or whatever it was. Any negative thing that might think, the positive aspects of being a conduit to as much positive information, as much interesting things, and as much inspirational thought as possible, way outweigh whatever weird negative thing that you have. And I think the weird negative thing you have is part of the learning process. I mean, I'm 47 years old, but I'm not done. By any stretch of the imagination. That's one of the weird things about life, is that I think by the time your hormones start giving out, your bones start weakening, and your posture starts sagging, and your skin starts drooping, and your energy starts waning, you're just starting to figure this fucking thing out. It's rigged. It's rigged. That is, you're right, man. It truly is rigged. You're just starting to figure it out to be you, and you hit your 40s. And it's like, god damn it. This is why if life extension happens, man, 20 year olds are fucked. Like if all of a sudden a bunch of like, like no, oh come on. There's so much smarter than when we were 20. I don't think they're the same thing. 60 year olds, suddenly like you could give them a shot, and they look like they're 20 year olds. Same amount of money they have, same amount of everything. No one's, you can't, I couldn't compete with a 60 year, a 60 year old who looked like he was 20. He was like. There's a lot of 60 year old dummies. That's true. But you know what I mean, man. There's something about like the, yes, no, I know exactly what you mean. All that aside, I do think that there, it does seem to be that there is like, this is why I like the model of the universe as a class. Because it does seem to be that really when you start getting to the point where you could wield some serious power, that's when you start waning. And I think there's something beautiful about that. But some people say that no, that's not beautiful at all. That's just a rationalization of a kind of malfunction in our DNA, and that we can fix it. We can god damn fix it. And there's no reason that we have to die. And in fact, there's no reason we have to get old. And the future people are gonna look at old people as a kind of genetic abnormality, a mutation that disease that we didn't even know was a disease that we're just like, it's old age. Oh yes, it's old age. No, you have a disease. You have a disease that hasn't been cured yet. And it's gonna get cured. Well, that's very convenient to look at it that way. But the reality is it's not. We're trying to use up more time. We want more time than nature intended, and there's a battle. Nature intended. That battle might be very similar to all the yin and yangs, the dealing with shitheads, making you a stronger person. Letting go. The people that grow up bullied won't wind up to be a very strong character and a very averse to other bullying. And in matter of fact, oftentimes bully bullies. There's a lot of people that are, people that came out of poverty and they have this incredible compassion and lust for life because their life was shit when they were young. It's like, what is it that, it doesn't always work, but what is it that causes these rebounds from terrible scenarios? And isn't that part of the whole thing? I think that the suffering of old age is an inevitability and we have to come to terms with it. But I like to imagine that if there is some invention, some technological advancement that can reverse the aging process, that what would happen, and if people eventually live to be 2,000 years old, then when you do finally die from whatever occurrence, I think you wake up in paradise. Surrounded by your friends, they're like, why did you keep playing that shitty game? You're like in a party. Or if you're like, really? Why? Dude, you played that fucking shit game all night. We wanted to hang out. And you're like in paradise. You can fly anything you imagine can happen. You were just basically freaking out like when you smoke too much weed and you find an Xbox at a party and just play, so you can ignore the party. Maybe that's what life is. Maybe that's why we die. Not because it's an awful thing, but it's like you paid your debt, man. It's like somebody in prison being like, I'm gonna stay here another 30 years if you don't mind. I just wanna stay a little longer. You're right. It's possible that that's what happens. It's possible that you reach some incredible state of bliss after you die and you feel ridiculous for trying to stay alive. It is possible. We don't know, though. That's what's scary. What's scary is the unknown. What's scary is not the possibility that it could be awesome or the possibility that it could even be awful or there could be some hell. I passed. I was driving on the street to your house and on one of the main streets when we're coming off the off ramp, off the off ramp, rather, there's this sign. Which place do you wanna go? Heaven or hell? Have you seen it? No. Oh, it's awesome. It has a number that you can call. You can feel like something blah, blah, blah, truth. Oh, I've seen that. I called the number. I know what you're talking about. I called the number. A guy picked up. What did he say? I got off a phone. It was too weird. It felt like it was at a guy's house. Like, that's how few calls he gets. Like, it's a guy. He's put billboards all over the country and he gets like three calls a week. And they're all prank calls. It's all people beating off each other, right? I wanna go to hell, friend. Tell me about Satan's asshole. Right before I come. What color is it? Is it black? I always imagine it was black. Is it true Satan's asshole has a clitoris? I've heard that. Red, but then the end, the right, the butthole. This, the ring is black. Sort of like when you get a clam, a steam clam, and you pull that fucking shell off of it. And you have the condom, they pull up, they get the very end of it, it's black. You know, the tip of the, the clam's long neck. That's a great question to ask any theologians out there. Is it, does Satan have an asshole? Is he, does he shit? In your mouth, only in your mouth cause you asked for all eternity. And I shit six times a day. That's hell. Satan shits in your mouth all day. And he only does it when you ask. Wait a minute, does Satan have, does he, shit? Does Satan eat? We got one. Yeah, it's a good question, man. And, is that your phone? No, that's yours, but. It's on the ground. What time's your show? Oh, boy, it is my, the show's at 10. It's only 35. We gotta wrap it up. It's only 10 minutes, only 10 minutes. Okay, another 10 minutes. I'm later on the show. Okay, great, I gotta pee. Let me grab you another beer. Okay, perfect. You know what, man? The best part about that sci-fi show that we did was you and I hanging out. That was the best part. It was so much fun. You know, I mean, this isn't appropriate for the podcast, but you're, you know, you're one of my favorite human beings. I love you. You're one of mine. And I love doing anything with you. Go in the grocery store. If you say, hey, man, I'm going to Whole Foods today. You wanna come with me? I feel like, okay, I'll shop with you. You know, I just think, you know, and especially as we get older in this life, and you and I have been friends for a long time. I mean, we became friends back when you were the talent coordinator at the comedy store. We essentially met on the phone, you know? I mean, that's when we really started becoming really good friends. Yeah, years ago. Yeah, we would have these cool conversations when you were the guy that would answer the phone. So the coordinator at the comedy store is like, you'd call up and say, hey, I'm gonna be in town Tuesday through Thursday. So, and then they would, you know, throw everybody's name into like a list and whoever, you know, got spot, you know, whoever called in to get spots in time, that's how they would make the schedule. And so I would call in Duncan. I'd give him my days, I should say you because you're right here. Yeah. I know what I'm talking to. And then we became friends. It was really cool. We'd have these weird conversations. You'd be like, let me ask you something. And then we'd start talking. And then we'd have these like, almost like podcast like conversations. That's right. Way back then we would have these long, long conversations. Then we started doing some comedy together, going on the road together. You know, you got passed as a paid regular at the store and you started doing, you know, doing gigs. And so it's all amazing to watch it all happen, isn't it? Fuck yeah, man. It's gotta be cool to be a mentor. It's gotta be rad to like shepherd someone. And then like, it's cool, man. That's, you do that for a lot of people. You do that for me, Ari, Diaz, a lot of people, man. It's a really cool thing to do. Well, I needed you guys as much as you needed me, you know? I think I'm a very friendly person in a lot of ways. I'm a big supporter of the idea that you, it takes a whole group of people to sort of excel together. You don't, do you ever see that movie? What's that fucking movie? Into the wild, where that kid dies out there. And one of the things, before he died, he was writing things down in his journal and he was saying, essentially paraphrasing, that it's all meaningless unless you have someone to share it with. And that's true. There's nothing that I've ever experienced in my life that is enjoyable by myself. It's all like, one of the most beautiful things about having a family is to be able to experience this family with the person you had the family with. Like if you get married and you have kids, the weirdest thing is gonna be this bond that you have with this person that you're raising this family with. And then you develop a weird, like Eddie Bravo and I, we've always been super close. I mean, we've been best friends forever. But we have like another level of our friendship because we both have children. We talk about it. We talk about like, he'll talk to me about how amazing it is watching this kid learn and how fun it is to see him play and enjoy himself and to teach him things. And there's this amount of love that he has for his kid for his wife and the bond that they have together raising this kid. It's a phenomenal, fascinating thing. And it seems like a lot of people think of family and one thing and friendship and another thing. I think of it as all people you love. It's all people you love. And you and Diaz and Ari and Eddie Bravo and Red Band and Tate and there's a lot of people I love, man. There's a lot of people I love. And I think the more people that you surround yourself with that you appreciate and you have fun with and you laugh with and I mean, we have some fun fucking times. Just that time, you and I Sasquatch and was so ridiculous. One of the best. That was one of the best times of my life. I'll never forget that. You were laughing so hard all day. It was so fun, man. Watching that goddamn drone. Fly over the woods looking for something that doesn't exist. You and I are cracking up. You're giving me like edible weeds. So I'm getting more and more stone. I'm in the woods. I'm so blasted. That was so fun, man. So much fun. How much did you, what was the bet? Was it 100 bucks that you could make a fire in the rain? 100 bucks. Duncan made a fire in the rain. No, but that was a cheap bet. I shouldn't have taken the bet. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. That was very impressive. I found a clump of wood that was like shielded from the rain. That's not cheating at all. That's exactly what you're supposed to do. You did the smartest thing. It was pouring rain out. And Duncan was like, I'm gonna make a fire. I'm like, bitch, you can't make no fire. And you're roasting me. I'm trying to make the fire in front of the crew. And like Rogan is like, it just, like, it's the- I was heckling. It was heckling, but nonstop. Like, you'll never do it. Just like everything in your life. You were trying to take it to like, only the level of comedian can. It turned like me making the fire into like a representation of failure, success, how it was so intense. I think at one point making the fire, my hand was trembling with rage. Like, I'm gonna make this fucking fire. But yeah. But then I started turning around on me when it was pretty obvious that you had a fire. I'm like, God damn, I don't want to have to pay this mother fucker. It was so great. I'm such a loser. That was a fun night, man. It was so fun. That was really cool. Also, man, you know, that thing I loved was the, that, when we did that show, was that in going to that goddamn Galveston disease research center and interviewing the head of it. And as I'm looking at him, I'm realizing the look on his face, we're kind of like making jokes and everything. But it's the look on the face of somebody who like, knows they have a limited amount of time to come up with vaccines for stuff because it's an inevitability of the outbreak. And I remember being there and they took us to the part where there's Ebola and they were trying to come up with a vaccine for Ebola because they knew what's happening right now is gonna happen. And I just will never forget the way that guy's face looked, man, because he's somebody who wasn't gonna be funny in this life. Because he's somebody who knew the inevitability of an outbreak and God damn it, he was right. It fucking happened. He was right. In hindsight, it's pretty incredible. That was one of the main things they were worried about, Ebola and other what they call hemorrhagic viruses. Yes. And they had a room where they kept these intense diseases shielded by this super thick wall. Remember that? Yep. And they had all these, they had everywhere you go, there was like all these ways that they made sure that it's on the floor, the fuck, that all these ways that they made sure that people, let me shut it off. I don't know, it could be more. I don't know, okay. They had all these ways that they made sure that these diseases could never get into the air supply, they could never get outside the building. They had all these air scrubbers and all these filters in place and all these like checks and balances. HEPA filters in sub basements. Yeah, we had to put on spacesuits and shit and walk around and then they wanted me to go into the actual room with all the shit it's up and I was like, pass. No, not gonna happen. Remember that? I put my foot down, I was like, dude. But they had like oxygen filters above them that could suck the oxygen out of the air into the filters. But when you see that that we were in and now look at the pictures in Africa, there's no fucking HEPA filter. There's the guy wearing a goddamn fireman's outfit surrounded by dead people with like a dog gnawing at a kid's head. That's what's happening in Africa. So that's why they're freaking out right now and saying, oh no, no, no, this is bad. This is worse than we think it's gonna be, man. This is bad, bad. This shit's gonna mutate. That's what they're worried about. That's why Obama's sending 1,000 troops over there, man, because what's that gonna do? Yeah, shoot the virus. Yeah, what are you gonna fucking? Bring Jesus, throw Bibles at the Bible. Yeah, throw Bibles at the Bible. That's a great, that's a funny exhibit. Like an art exhibit where you get to throw a Bible at the Bible. Double blast for me. Throw Bibles at the Bible. Hit a Bible with a Bible and you get two Bibles. I want you to take a picture of me throwing a Bible at the Bible. I want to take it to Kat Von D and she's gonna tattoo it on me. This is me tattooing a Bible and a Bible. Man, you ain't even supposed to get a tattoo in the Bible. Fuck, man, god damn it. These are great. It's so fun doing these with you, man. Fun doing them with you too, man. We gotta do it more often. So we were talking about this too, is like one of the weird things about both of us being real busy and doing a bunch of things that we love to do is that sometimes we just don't get time to hang out unless we podcast each other. It's satanic. Well, it's sort of like, what's the other scenario that would bring us together with no one around? If I said, hey, Duncan, come on over my house, man. I just want to sit down at the kitchen table with you and just let's just talk for an hour. You'd be like, oh, what the fuck is this? Okay. Ew, what's he gonna tell me? Oh, Jesus Christ. This is some gay shit. It would be, no, it's either gay or like death. Whatever it is, isn't gonna be good. Yeah, it's not like, hey, let's just laugh silly geese for two hours and have fun and philosophize and just pick each other's brain. And one of the things that I really enjoy about talking to you is that I feel like my own thoughts are better when I talk to you. Like there's a few people in my life, my own thought. Like we have a very unique frequency that we sort of like tune into together. And we have the little back and forth of a conversation which is a lot, like a podcast is a lot like a dance. You know, you're dancing with that person. And you and I have great dance partners. And so we have this sort of this thing where I'm a better, I'm a better podcaster when I do it with you. Yeah, man, it's cool. Yeah, it is a, it's like a, some kind of like weird ping pong game or dance or whatever. Yeah, and it's, yeah, I feel the same way, man. You are one of the few people on earth who can frighten me. And I've never been around somebody who, I can remember in the only first hour of podcasting together, you would say stuff, you would start saying stuff where I wanted to stop the podcast because I thought you'd get arrested. Like, I can remember like some of the stuff you, whenever you would start getting it going on about the military industrial complex or which we didn't get to, I wish we had in this podcast cause I really wanted to talk about ISIS with you. But like, God damn it, where I'm like, oh no, no, that's, you gotta shut it down, man. But I guess that wasn't a valid fear because it seems like no harm has come because of any of the information that you put out there. But almost, you know, as much as people like to believe that there's some kind of force inhibiting freedom of expression or shutting down the free flow of ideas, it seems like you're an example of how that can't be true because you are all, you're giving people a microphone, so many of the guests on your show, you're putting a microphone in front of people who have very extreme ideas that if you believe there is some monolithic power trying to suppress autonomy and freedom, then they would try to shut you down really quickly. I don't think there is a monolithic power. I think that's a big mistake that people make. I think the system itself, and this is something we discussed at dinner, the system itself is so impossible to wrangle. The idea that there is any one group or many groups, whatever it is, that somehow or another have control over the way human culture. They have control over aspects of our lives. Like the military industrial complex certainly has control over certain decisions that they make as far as military action. Without a doubt, I mean, it's pretty obvious. There's certain things that get justified that don't make any sense. There's a lot of people that have suspicions about the motivations of a bunch of different military exercises that just so happen to revolve around an area that has tremendous natural resources, whatever it is. The people that are involved at the very highest level, they could give two fucks about someone like me. What they wanna make sure is the generals listen to them, and they wanna make sure that the military people listen to them. I'm much more inclined to take the position that you need military than you don't. I'm much more inclined to support the Rangers or the Navy SEALs, so anybody would think that I'm an anti-military person. I'm aware of human nature. I would be thrilled if everybody could get their shit together, and the world would be filled with beautiful people. But much like we talked about earlier, when shitty people have shitty people, and they grow up in shitty circumstances, and they have horrible things happen to them when they're younger, and they become sociopaths, and they see a lot of death, they see a lot of murder, and then you have to interact with them in the world. You don't have a whole lot of options. There's not a whole lot of altruistic options for fixing certain scenarios. And that's how Genghis Khan won. I mean, because it wasn't a U.S. military back then. If Genghis Khan came around today on horseback with his fucking bows and arrows, we would send a couple of stealth bombers. We'd light that bitch up like a Christmas tree. There'd be a bunch of awesome live leak videos of like weirdos and horses just vaporized. With conch shells. Oh, no! Look, stealth bombers coming at supersonic speed. Before that, even before that, drones. Fucking flying R2-D2s, shooting rocket dicks towards them. They wouldn't even know what the fuck it was. Well, yeah, I mean, that is, you know, if you want to talk about one of the great blasphemies you can utter these days, it is that, guess what? There could be a need for defense. There could be, there really could be the potential for, this is what you're talking about. It's the idea is, what operating system do you want running in the planet that you're living on? What do you want the majority of people operating system, do you want them to be running? Do you want it to be an operating system that has within it the potential for space migration? Or do you want it to be an operating system where every woman has to dress like a beekeeper? Which one do you want? Yeah, which one, where are the chicks and bikinis? Oklahoma, I'll take that. Fuck space migration. They're drinking Budweiser and they're sucking dicks after the fucking sun goes down. We listen to the country music, they got a loop, Ryan on the car stereo, the doors wide open, the windows rolled down, and they're making out on the hood. It sucks we have to close on this because I can already see the conspiracy theory thread. Of course. Duncan Trussell and Joe Rogan are CIA. They support the military industrial problem. No, I don't. I would, look, I support everyone doing a massive breakthrough level of psychedelics to the point where war becomes impossible. Me too. I really do. I mean, that's a very simplistic way of looking at it. I think there's plenty of potential areas of conflict as far as competition for resources, competition for creating new innovative products and selling things and doing, but I think along the way, we've got this idea that it can only be done one way, capitalism must be evil, it must be callous, it must be, I feel like there's gotta be a potential for a conscious capitalism. I believe that it's there. I really do. I do too. I believe there's probably also a profit in cleaning up the ocean, recycling some of that plastic. I think there's probably a profit in figuring out some new way to develop new forms of energy, new forms of energy through sucking pollution out of the air and converting it to some usable fuel. I think there's a lot of different possibilities that we're gonna see over the next few years. I mean, the amount of innovation that's going on right now, and every day you go to various websites, you know. It's too much. There's technology methods. You can't even process it anymore. It's too much. It's too much. Person to person technologically enhanced telepathy. Incredible. Incredible. Does it even fucking hit the mainstream media that long? It's like a subtext underneath everything else. It's so amazing that this stuff is like, it's not being suppressed, it's being ignored because people are so, it's happening so much. It's like, yeah, okay, whatever. Did you see Real Housewives? That one girl, such a fucking bitch. I hate her. Oh God, it's so good. She's so fucking bitchy. I want a smacker. I watch that show. That's my show. Oh my God, that's my show. But it will, it's so beautiful because it will be born. It will spring out of the delusion or awareness. It doesn't matter. The goddamn thing's gonna happen and we're right on the precipice of it, man. And I think that's a wonderful incarnation to take. Yeah, well, we are because we're here but they were on the precipice of it in 1812 as well. And they were fucking first doing Morse code. Da-dee-dee-dee-dee-dee. This is crazy. There's fucking people in New York and I told them to suck my dick. He said, fuck you. This is amazing. We're the one species that does that. Like you never see squirrel. I guess dogs. Dogs do it. Dogs do it. Dogs are like, holy shit. You gave me a carrot. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. That's so true. I get so excited if you give them a treat. You got a show to do, man. We gotta wrap it up.

You know, one of my favorite things about having a podcast is not just the massive amount of wealth that gets sent to me from my billionaire and trillionaire listeners, but also the military technology that gets shared with me from my friends over at DARPA. Sometimes they'll send me micro drones. Sometimes they'll send me new kinds of genetic material that can be used to cause evolutionary mutations in your dogs. For example, my poodle. I've extended his tail by nine inches, and now he can read at a second grade level. But when Colonel Franch sent me the USB drive that contained within it, the technology that you're about to witness, my mind was truly blown. I've heard from the paranoid media the dangers of deep, fake technology. I'm sure by now you've probably gotten the seeds of fear planted in you by the naysayers and Luddites who would like humanity to return to the days of the caveman. I just can't imagine that people are actually afraid of a technology that can perfectly duplicate a person and animate that person online in a way that makes the video completely indistinguishable from actual video. What could possibly go wrong? Mostly it's going to be funny. And I guess at the very worst, maybe somebody will duplicate you and put you online, and you will maybe be a little less funny than you actually are, and it could be slightly embarrassing. But aside from that, I think we're entering into a really wonderful and hilarious time in human history. And I think that we should all really embrace deep, fake technology. OK, so without further ado, I present to you this amazing, weird, unintelligible, mostly song that was created using an AI and a deep, fake technology. I didn't write any of the music, any of the lyrics, and what you're about to hear is not my voice. Our spaceship crashed into your planet 10,000 years ago. You traded your history for our technology. And now we live inside your phones. Don't feel bad. After all, you're just monkeys. Technology junkies that are best at gold. And at night, while you're sleeping, we probe every one of your buttholes. Isn't that cool? How wild is that? A harmless AI created that and just randomly put those lyrics together using over 17 terabytes of data extracted from the combination of imprints that all of us made using Facebook and a lot. I don't know about this fucking neural net shit, except, whoa, fun times are ahead of us. And I'm really, really excited about it. And I'm also excited about today's amazing podcast with the brilliant Dr. Drew. We're going to jump right into that. But first, some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the glorious sweeties over at instacart.com. I wish I'd spent more time at the grocery store. No one's ever said those words on their deathbed, and no one ever will. Let's face it, my noble listeners, there are far better things that we could be doing than going to the grocery store. We could be joining in at orgies in some verdant grove behind our family's manor house. We could be flying kites. We could be riding trains and playing with goats in the woodlands of our home countries. But instead, we're trapped in the mucusy maze that is a modern day grocery store, inhaling the infected droplets of measly toddler sneezes instead of breathing the sweet fresh air of our precious mother earth.

And now, without further ado, please welcome world-famous doctor, current host of the brilliant podcast, Dr. Drew After Dark, homelessness advocate and all-around brilliant human being, the wonderful Dr. Drew. [""Welcome to You""] Dr. Drew, welcome back. Thank you so much. Such a pleasure. Do you remember the last time we were talking, we had a podcast, I think it was the last time, we had this great conversation about marijuana being legalized, and it was just starting to get legal. Yeah, yeah. Now, not only are we seeing marijuana getting legal, I'm so sorry. It's all right. We're gonna look at mushrooms legal soon too, and maybe acid and other things. That's it, yeah. And I just wanna know what your thought is on this. I hope I said it, I imagine I said the same thing, I don't remember, but that I've always thought, you remember I said this, I'm sure I said it, that it's been insane that the government made molecules evil. That's so fucking insane. That they put cannabis and heroin and LSD and mushrooms and even, these are evil molecules, human hand should never touch. When in fact, they are just molecules that will probably have significant therapeutic value once we do the proper research, and I'm really excited about it. I bet. And already we know end of life, it has really potential very, very significant uses. That's right, that's one of my, when I realized that is how your mind works, like what a true scientist you are, how you just want the research, and you're- Just wanna help people. That's so cool. I love that. And I've been sort of doing this weird experiment where I asked my Uber driver, not that kind, where I asked my Uber drivers huge questions, and I've gotten the coolest answers from them. Not that you wouldn't, but I've gotten profound answers. One of them, because a thing that tends to be coming up a lot in LA is this massive homeless population that continues to grow. We haven't talked about this, but I'm overcome with that. It's all I talk about every day. Really? Oh, it has consumed me. What are your thoughts on it? Well, here's why I, last summer, seriously, I have my evolution to this. I've always been bothered by it. I always thought it was ridiculous. I just thought we should do something about it, but I understood why the forces that prevented us from actually helping these people, and I'll explain that later. But last summer, when I saw the rat explosion, I went, oh my God, I practiced here for 30 years. I know what happens when the rats explode. We get typhus. Right. And we had a huge typhus outbreak. Right. And I was predicting it. I was talking about it on the radio. I kept telling everybody it's coming. Then the city kind of denied it. Yep. It was unbelievable to me. We had a massive outbreak. It was a dangerous illness. Typhus wiped out the French army, killed people in concentration camps, and Frank died of typhus, for God's sake. So it was, I'd seen it for, my whole career I've dealt with typhus. It's a serious problem. My son had it, so they claim nothing. How did your son get it? From rats, from fleas, like anybody else. In LA? Yes. It's pasted in it. It's been endemic there forever. So I knew when the rat thing came, it was gonna go all over the place. So it did. And then I thought, oh geez. Okay, they're not doing anything about the rats. It's getting worse. The sanitation is breaking down. Then we had the runoff of all that, of all the sanitation, terrible, terrible sanitation problems, ran off during the rains. Yeah. The dolphins and sea lions died. Of typhus? We don't know what. They've not yet disclosed exactly, but something that's coming off. Then I thought, oh my God. Okay, we got typhus. And typhus, the natural reservoir, is the possums and the raccoons in Southern California, in the foothills. That's why we always have it in Pasadena. Then I started to think, oh my God, they're not doing anything about it. So the rats are continuing to grow, continue to explode. The squirrels have plague. The plague's gonna get out of the rats and we're gonna have plague next, bubonic plague. The squirrels in LA already have it. The last plague outbreak was in Los Angeles in the 1920s. And through some very clever maneuvers, they prevented a massive outbreak. But everyone that came in contact with this one guy died within like four days. And so it's coming. That's coming. Wait, that outbreak, someone brought it here from? No, it's in the feral animals. It normally is just sort of on the fleas. Okay, I see. And when the rats explode, it gets under the rats, it gets under our pets, and it's on, it's on. It's coming. So I knew that was coming. And then tuberculosis started to go like six months ago. And I thought, oh my God. We have tuberculosis. We have non-tuberculosis AFB. We have all the rodent and flea-borne illness. And then typhoid fever broke out. And do you know that? That seven policemen got typhoid fever. And I thought, oh God. A thousand homeless people have died so far this year, just lying in the streets through the reckless negligence of our government. And I thought that thousand could go to 10,000 in an instant. And then they're suboptimally immunized. We have measles starting to come out. This is a population that could easily get measles and could tear through there. So I am from a physician standpoint, I have been apoplectic. I've been beside myself. I've been talking about it. Talking about this is like a serious thing. I feel like I'm standing on the railroad tracks, waving at the trains and the bridges out, bridges out, you guys. And the engineers flipping me off. That's what it feels like. So now I've got a little more aggressive because I see it starting to come. And you see it, right? You see it. People are, there are tarps with people underneath them in the streets. Who are dead. Dead. Our government does not seem to give one shit. It's the people that are in danger have mental health problems. These are, and the city just keeps saying it's a housing problem. They're not willing to deal with the mental health issue. What are the, do you know the statistics on people who are experiencing mental health issues versus people who are experiencing like addiction? I mean, I know it's kind of. The addiction is very high, very high. Is it higher than mental health? Yes. Yes. And because we don't enforce any drug laws in this state anymore, people just come here to do practice their addiction. And okay, but give them a place that's safe to do that. Don't, not the streets, but they love the streets. They love the life. They don't want to come in. They don't want to come off the street. This is actually something, Emmanuel Sifarios, who is the creator of DanceSafe, the people who used to test drugs at RAVE status. You don't want decriminalization because decriminalization is just deregulation. Decriminalization means people could do it. They're not going to get arrested, but there's no, I don't know if you probably don't, but if you've ever ordered marijuana in LA, now you get a child-proof package that not only has like the amount of THC in the marijuana, the type of marijuana. It's properly regulated, yeah. Yeah, with a nice chart telling you what the, literally the sort of like shape of the high, like when it's good. So it's. I'm going to try this one of these days. Just ordering it is an interesting experience. It's always been bad. Pat's always been bad to me, but I figured there's got to be some version that it works for. Yeah. Well, it's evolving and getting better. But, and so that's what happens when you have a regulation. But now we've got this deregulated, drug-addicted, homeless population that are. And they're going to die. They're going to die. That's committing them to death. That's it, period. So, what do you do? So this is getting, here's what you do. It's very simple. People go, it's so complicated. Yeah. You expand the definition of gravely disabled to include unable to attend to your medical needs or your housing needs. You expand conservatorships so people can get the care. So somebody case manages them. The LA mission could put up a tent, tents that would house 20,000 heated air conditioning with wrap-around services immediately at $1,000 ahead, excuse me, $10,000 ahead. The city wants to do it for $500,000 per unit. What? That's the current cost per unit. It's so out of control, you can't even imagine. They need to be medically dealt with. They need to be psychiatrically dealt with. And then something needs to be done to help motivate the addicts to either get better or get on some sort of medication assisted treatment or something structured where they're not dying of their disease and they're not on the streets. This brings us to a question I've been wanting to ask you, which is because of that cost, and I know the $500,000 price is insane, but if you wanna take someone who is a late stage addict of any type and rehabilitate them, it's not gonna be cheap if you really wanna do it. And if you don't really do it, what's the point? Well, now there are ways of doing medication assisted treatments that are scalable, that are manageable. It's not what I would wanna do for you if you got severely addicted. I'd want you to be returned to a flourishing, complete existence. I want these people not to die and get off the streets. And so medication assisted treatment is perfect. So they do have, what kind of medication do you- Suboxone, methadone, this kind of stuff. Oh, I see what you're saying. What is your opinion on the stuff they're doing in Amsterdam or the places where they've just accepted the fact they have a- I don't have a problem with that, but you see what happens. This is sort of that, right? If we did it in a structured way, where we had attendants and nurses and gave them their heroin and whatever, and had somebody trying to motivate them to get better and working with their issues and things, that's fine. I don't have a problem with that. That's great. To me, that seems like the- But that's expensive too, right? Well, what is it? That's what you do with it. That's what the elimination would do, I'm sure of it. That they'd put big units together people and try to get them motivated to get well. What's more expensive, not treating the situation as it is by just admitting- What's happening, as it is, this is a breakdown of civilization. This is the first city in 800 years that has decided they don't need to attend to sanitation or rodents. Think about that, 800 years. Wow. That's how negligent our representatives are. What's wrong with them? It doesn't make any sense. It doesn't make any sense. They're scared of the ACLU. They're scared of these lawsuits that are coming their way. When anybody tries to do anything with the homeless, they're not leaders. They gotta lead, they gotta lead. Right. And it's scary and it's uncomfortable and they have to know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. I keep wondering, is it some kind of bullshit what the Buddhist teacher I like, Chogyam Trumpa calls it idiot compassion? Yes. That's what it is. Yes. So it's like, oh, we're going- These are just noble, homeless people that would rather live out on the streets. Oh, Jesus. Who are you to say? And don't touch their stuff. That's their stuff. Because they're rolling their feces up in the little acclamation characters. What's their stuff? Oh my God. That's so cool to know that other people in LA are interested in my favorite art form. I thought it was a Go-Dead. You know, it's my craft. I use natural substrates to produce my beautiful figurines. Okay, that's a good thing to know, number one, that you're angry about it. I'm not saying I'm obsessed with it because we have to get on this and we have to get on quick because it's going to be a human catastrophe. And I can't live with that. I can't. It just makes me crazy as a doctor. And what, just as someone who lives in Los Angeles, there seems something so incredibly tragic about being in an incredibly wealthy city that must have the resources- Think about this. We have absorbed, just apparently this year, 300,000 undocumented immigrants. They've all found housing at jobs. Right. So did those people push all the people onto the streets? Or are we just being dishonest about this being a housing problem? Right. People without a country, without a home, without a job got here and managed to figure it out. Yeah. The reality is it's a mental health problem. Gotcha. And that's why these people are on the streets. Do you know of any organizations or places people listening you might want to help out? Okay. The only mission, go to the only mission. They're great. Okay. But the city and the county will not do business with them because they're a religious organization. What? Yeah. There's something out here. My next thing is to go to the federal government. I swear to God. I'm there with you. If you come with me, yeah. How humiliating for- Too bad. I don't care. I'm a Democrat. I'm happy to have these people change direction. Yeah. Garcidia, I'm sure is a nice guy. Yeah. They care of Los Angeles. They're failing us. They're killing people. Right. They must stop. They must stop. I've got the bush of a married man. Bush of a married man. Bush of a married man. Oh, no. Smalls they smelled like dumpster ham. Like dumpster ham. Pungent.

I can remember this specifically happening to me many years ago. I was trimming my pubes to go on a first date. And I don't know, maybe I was a little nervous. My hands were shaking, but I cut my balls. And suddenly I realized that not only was I dripping blood into the shower, watching it mix in with the pubic hair I'd been sloppily cutting with my kitchen scissors, but also should anything happen on that date, I was gonna have to explain why there was a civil war type wound on my balls. Gang, not only do you deserve more than to use the same razor used for your face on your balls, your lovers deserve more than to look at your balls and cock and wonder if you recently went naked, free climbing.

Now, this is the next question I have for you. You think there is ever gonna be a cure for addiction outside of Suboxone and the normal therapies? There will never be a pill that cures addiction. It's too complicated. It's a wiring problem and a lot of it gets kicked off by trauma. So there will never be a pill for trauma and then the progression that occurs across an addiction where people lose control, their prefrontal cortex doesn't work very well, the wiring and the reward system alters. There's multiple systems that are enlisted that are sort of a wiring nature and also within the cell problem. It's not like just a receptor on the surface of the cell will find some medicine to hit the surface receptor like high blood pressure or heart cardiac rhythms or something like that. No, there will be things that will be helpful. But ultimately, the way I think about addiction is it's an interpersonal disease and it has an interpersonal solution. Gotcha. Brains heal other brains from complex mental health issues. Oh, oh, right. Okay, that thing there is a brain and treatment device that they do based on some stuff that came from mental hospitals when they were using strobe lights to let calm people down. Crazy. So I guess our brains, and I'm sure you know more about this than I do, the human brain has this amazing ability to tune in to other people around it and what's that called? Mere neurons. Well, I think that's oversimplification. I'm not even sure it's our brain. It might be our bodies that are tuning to other bodies because we have these complex webs of autonomic material over our neck, our chest, our heart, our pelvis. These are huge little brains in our body. And I can only tell you as having been the object of a therapeutic intervention and then helped other people in the setting of carefully listening and attuning to somebody, I feel like I listen with my whole body. Whoa, you're blowing my mind. I just actually was looking at a Zen quote where someone said, listen with your whole body. Yeah, because my ears goes without saying, but when you listen with your body, your body picks up on things. You'll hear things, smell things, feel things, and then you have to think, am I actually in pain or is that Duncan's pain that I'm picking up on? And then I'll think, oh, that's not mine. It doesn't belong to me. I wonder what that means to Duncan. And I'll go, well, Duncan, I'm having a funny thing. It's I'm feeling a pain over here, my left upper chest and the back here. And oftentimes patients will go, oh yeah, that's where my dad used to kick me on as a kid. Anyway, so it's so weird when you're in it with them, even though you'll be saying something profound, they'll just go right on. Like, yeah, yeah, that's where my dad kicked me, of course. Anyway, let me tell you more about. That, what do you think that is when people skip over sort of anomalous moments? It's being, it's a little bit narcissistic, right? It's like, yes, of course, you're, it's my person. We all know that because it's me. But the other thing, when you co-create something deep and you're in it with a person, you're just in it. And so they're not objective, you know what I mean? They're not stepping outside of it, they're in it. And I like that because it tells me they're in it. Okay, that's cool. And that's good therapy, right? That's what's happening with good therapy. And you were saying you were the object. Yeah, I did, yeah, I had 11 years of therapy. But was this, have you ever been addicted to anything? Did this have any? None of my brain doesn't do that, no. Wow. Yeah, I know, like I hate opiates that make me feel terrible. I used to love them, then I just, I don't know, happen. Good. They're right. Count your blessings. No, I know, when we had the podcast I mentioned to you, man, I really kind of like like it in and then, but you really helped me because you said, let me explain. Where this goes. What happens, you know? But not in the like, usual way of like, he'll be in jail, it was the thing about a switch clicking into the brain and then it's over after that. It's done. So do you, so you don't lend much credence to the stuff coming out about Ibogaine therapy? No, I don't know because we don't have the research yet. Now I had many patients over the years go down and go down to wherever and get it and do it. And what I observed was the following over and over and over again, I probably had 20 patients do it. They stopped using heroin for six months and then they started again, right? Every single one. No, save one, save one. And it made me think that that one was probably not a drug addict because there's so much opiates being consumed now that what we're seeing is something we never used to see, which is opiate dependent, non-addicted patients. Wow. Because addiction is the disease when you start, you can't stop, you keep going back. Well, dependency is once you get out of it, you're like, ugh, get me out of this, but you can look like an addict when you're dependent. So I think that one guy was drug dependent, not addicted. I got you. The others just went back and the problem I had with it, that's no big deal to me, great, you got six months of sobriety, maybe we'll put some more together. They all had real personality changes and that was very, I just can't abide by that. If we're changing the personhood, the personality and the personality features, that's profound and now many of them that kind of went away, but some of them it didn't. You're talking about a negative change then. No, don't, you're putting a value to think about that. You're putting a value judgment on changing the person. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That, I can't do that. Changing the person is a profound thing, period, good or bad, right? Yeah. A chemical changed the person now, but changed them from a serial killer to a saint. Well, I can judge that, I guess, but that's not, we're talking about the drug addict, normal person who's not the same person. Do you identify with any religion? Not strongly. Okay. Are you, one of the things that, you know, Christian existentialism is so bad-ass because it's sort of like somehow the woo-woo stuff goes away and it's just breaking down the kind of- Jordan Peterson does some of that stuff, really, when you get right down to it. Some of the Kierkegaard stuff. Well, he's the Jungian stuff and those- Yeah. Yeah. Your interview of his, I was still one of my favorite interview of his. Thank you. Yeah. So the brothers Karamazov, Dostoevsky, Christian existentialist. That's Yvonne's, the grand inquisitor. Yeah. Yes. That's right. Yeah, that's profound. Yeah. As most like, I guess a lot, many existentialists have this real fixation on freedom and autonomy and what it means. And so, Dostoevsky was talking about Paul's conversion. You know that story on the road to Damascus? Which, a seizure, but whatever. Well, that's, you are falling in line with what Dostoevsky, he didn't say seizure, but basically what he said is, okay, what happened there? Let's just imagine he saw Jesus. Yeah. Jesus touched him and converted him through some mystical potency. Who cares then? What difference does it fucking make? It's just some kind of like alien thing, scanning your brain and turning you into a different. You're not you anymore. Maybe it's even, you could call it a type of murder. Who you were is going to extend. It is, right? Yeah. And that concerns me. So the other alternative that Dostoevsky talks about is, or Saul was sick of being a piece of shit. This isn't my words, not his words. And suddenly thought, oh, this is a good excuse to become a better person. And using that event as a kind of launch pad, started making the series of decisions that transformed his life based on his own free will. And that, of course, is the preferable thing if we don't want to just succumb to the notion that like some people have the behaviorists that we're all just machines. We're not all but just machines. We don't think we are. What else are we? Do you think so? No, but I- We're in the simulation, but we're not all machines. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're not just, but some people do see, this is to me what is so fascinating about addiction, is that it turns a person into a non-player character. It turns a person into a locked-in scene. It turns into a person with one motivation. Now, what's interesting to me is that motivation takes over all those other wonderful features that our brains have. Emotions, thinking, everything gets infected by this motivation that's distorted. Rather than survival, it becomes used drugs. And so loving your spouse, taking care of your kids, going to work, those priorities just shrink away and are not important. They're lost, so they just become things that service this one priority, get drugs. Right. And it's not even a thought. They're not thinking get drug, get drugs, get drugs. It's just, they think things like, and you get into it with them, they'll always have this kind of thing. They'll be like, I gotta, you know, I've been sober three months now. You know, I need to go back and empty out my apartment. It's like, your apartment, that's where your dealer lives. It's like, yeah, yeah, I know, but I gotta get my shit. It's okay, I'll bring my sponsor with me and it'll be fine. I'll go to a meeting there in San Francisco when I get there and I'll just empty out my apartment. No big deal. That's the disease going, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Go to your apartment, go to your apartment, go to your apartment. Jesus. Those people always are using by the end of the day. That is so fucked up. Yeah, because the brain's, the motivational system is using all every reason and motions and everything else. So you get to see how everything else works under a singular motivation. Wow. It's fascinating. It's the most fascinating. To me, it is the, of all the- It's funny too. How do you mean? They're so, they're funny. Addicts are funny. The stuff they try to pull to me is just total hysterical. That's cool. That's the thing that I've realized about you is that you have a real deep, compassionate love for these people that doesn't seem sanctimonious. No, no, no. That's real, real world and like- Cause I see where they go, I see what they can be and I know, and I have faith for all of them, you know, potential hope for all of them. My own addictive qualities, like with my phone and how what you're talking about just reminds me of every single time I go on a phone bender and rationalize it by thinking, well, you know, my job's a podcast. I need to have a social media imprint. And it's like, I'm not doing anything except looking at Reddit conspiracy. Ha, ha, ha, there's no work happening. You know, there's nothing happening there at all. You're just, your brain's going zing, zing, zing, zing. Repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat. Yes. And you have become essentially a robot. A robot, yeah. Now, what do you think about the stuff coming out that this isn't conspiracy, but it's been admitted by most of the tech companies that they have implanted into their apps, an addictive algorithm. Oh, absolutely. They're studying that. It's an explicit field of study. How to capture your attention. How to keep you in the loop. Do you think that should be illegal? How to move you to the next thing. I don't think it should be illegal. I think it should be made explicit. It should be like just like a warning on a bottle or anything else. Like what are the risks here? They go, you know, go in at your own free will, but understand what we're doing. To me, I agree. I mean, anytime there's no regulate, I don't mean that, but I mean, I- I'm sort of a libertarian at heart. I could feel that. I'm like, my pendulum swings. I know, me too. Like intensely to the other side of it sometimes. I know. I mean, look at me with the homeless. Government fix this. Yeah, exactly. A friend of mine went, oh, Mr. Libertarian, really? Yeah. I was like, okay, well. Well, okay, well, no one's any one thing, but to me, I think one of the byproducts of our ability to understand reality using technology is that we're going to become increasingly adept at hypnotizing people. Sure. I don't think it's any error, any accident that most of everything right now is not about facts or rhetorical, you know, it's not logical discourse. It's just persuasion. Everything's persuasion now. Facts don't seem to matter at all. I just interviewed a guy from CNET today who said by next year or two, you'll be able to make videos of you and me saying and doing anything. Yeah. That's insane. I don't know when anything is real or not, whatever we're seeing. Yeah. How far have you taken that? I want to know where that goes. I haven't done deep thinking on it yet. I walked away bothered. Let me give you a couple of things. Tell me where it's going. Okay. And I want to know what you think about this. Because this is again, where we're getting to the opposite of libertarianism. When I hear shit like that, anybody who's got a public profile, like you especially, oh my God, there's terabytes of you talking, terabytes of video view. Yeah, now they're going to turn me into something else. Doing whatever they want. So here's the, here's like the fun part is obviously going to be, let's just face it, we're all going to be in embarrassing porn videos, matter of time, no way around it. In minutes. Just surrender to that. With this coming. I was thinking that while you were speaking. Which one, which position? Every position. And who, who will the subject be? Trust me, it's going to be you and I having this conversation, matter of time. Enjoy thus good. Then it'll be, maybe they'll put our voices in. You know, there's a lot of things that are going to happen. But that's to me is the fun part. As long as it's like, you know, it's not, for some people though, it's going to be absolutely traumatic. And they're going to have to have laws about it. There's going to have to be consent laws about it. But then all that stuff aside, right now imagine you get a robo call from sometimes from numbers, you know, I don't know if that's ever happened to you, but some, right. So here's what happens. Someone gets your phone number. Someone gets your identity. Someone facetimes people in your phone as you. And then begins to extract private information from them about your life. You're a genius. They can use the black manual. You're an evil genius. You're scaring me. That's one thing that's definitely going to happen. Oh my God. And because you could never, I always wonder what the next thing is going to be to take advantage of human ignorance because you're not going to be able to defend yourself against it. No. We have to have some software that identifies fake. Like something comes up on the screen and goes, if you know, some light or a scale of, you know, do you trust this or not? They're going to have to have that in fast. Well, what it is is you're going to have we're going to have to go back to old passwords where people had passwords to get into like clubs and get into places where it was literal. We're just going to have to go back to personal passwords where every month or two, you're going to have to face to face tell your friends, my password is whatever. Elephant's. Elephant946. So if I call you and I'm acting weird, ask for my password because otherwise it's not me. You seem quite like myself. Yeah. You ever heard of something called the uncanny valley? Yeah, sure. Right. So I'm wondering if that'll trigger the uncanny valley in people. Like it's not quite us. We'll be, we'll be disgusted and put off by it. Well, this, I think the uncanny valley was some kind of built in defense mechanism against this form of camouflage. What we're looking at is like a new. Well, uncanny valley, right. I think uncanny valley is something that's evolved in our brains because of disease states. Oh, shit. Can you define it real quick? Okay, uncanny valley is something that the robotic community discovered, which is as they make robots more and more and more human-like, we like it, we like it, we like it until they get very near to humanoid and then we're disgusted. We go into the uncanny valley. We're uncannily just put off by it. And I think that's, it has something to do with like people with mental illness and disease states where we were, we pull away from them because we don't, because in the back of the day, those were infectious diseases often. Right. And so we recoil from it. Or lunatics. Yeah, or like somebody could become aggressive or something, but in either case, it's adaptive to move away. Right, yeah. Okay, yeah. And so this uncanny valley does produce a really grotesque feeling when you, when you witness it. And the same feeling you get around a dead body or, you know. Similar, yeah. Similar, yeah. So, but there, it doesn't matter if it's next year. Let's say it's two years from now. What are you predicting? The inevitability of there being perfect duplicates of every single one of us. Especially people with a lot of video out there. Yes. That's right. Or, I mean, you saw what it did with the Mona Lisa, right? Just, they took a picture of the Mona Lisa. They don't have a, there's one frame and they were able to turn that into a person. So if you, you're probably gonna get messed with more if you have stuff out there, but really it's a basic. I'm worried about how we're gonna even know what is news real. You know, what is real in the news? What a politician really said. And by the way, we already have so much fake news. Who are we gonna go to to sort that out for us? It's done. Forget it. It's a new kind of weapon. It's like, you know, like a, it's some weird kind of technological smoke bomb that could be thrown over an entire city or country to create a cloak of confusion. Easy. Cause everyone thinks, oh, I know what they're gonna do. They're gonna put a YouTube video of someone's president saying some crazy shit about everyone should get ready for an impending bombing raid. But it's not just that they're gonna do that. They're gonna send thousands of different versions of it. So there's just no way to tell who's the real president anymore. Right. And then who do you go to find out what he really said? You would normally go, well, let's go to Walter Cronkard. Let's go to the news, not anymore. Cause they're fake too. Yeah. This is the splitting of the atom. And in relation to like the internet, we're looking at the exact same kind of terror, but fortunately or not so fortunately, I don't think many people knew that Einstein had alerted people that they were going to be able to split the atom and there'd be this massive release of energy. In this case, you know, we're seeing like, oh fuck, this is going to completely disrupt the way that we as a species have learned to communicate with each other via technology and no one's doing shit about it. I agree. I agree. So here it comes. Anyway, what's for dinner? P.S. guys, what you just listened to is not Duncan Trussell and Dr. Drew. This is in fact a deep fake technology. I love bathing an elephant piss. You think I'd really say that? Hell no. So, okay. So what do you think we can look forward to in the next election cycle based on this impending technology? I don't know. I can't, you've already enlightened me just now. I know it's going to be crazy. And I know, like everything, some of it is impossible to predict, right? It's just going to come upon us. Here's another thing I've thought of regarding this particular technology, which is real creepy. So, book of revelations, end of the world prophecy. I've always loved it. You know, just because it's so psychedelic, just even if it was written by a guy who was going through an intense delirium on an island. Who cares? Who cares? It's like outsider art. You know, it's still amazing and just weird and weird. It was like a Hieronymus Bosch painting. Yeah, yeah. Like, you know, the lamb of God, but with a sword in its mouth and decapitated heads all over the place and just, it's all code. But one of the weird predictions in it is the dead war eyes again. And I've always thought, oh my God, that's so such bullshit. Like, how would that ever happen? What in, what does that look like? Like pragmatically, you know, like your great grandmother who's buried in Georgia in a steel coffin six feet under comes to life. Is there something- Then what? Then what? You're fucked. You're just like in the ground screaming, wondering. You can't break. You can't break. Dying and being reborn and dying again. But now, when you realize like, oh, the dead are coming back. There's gonna be another Jim Morrison. There's gonna be another Jimi Hendrix. There's gonna be another- Yeah, but they're gonna be in a 3D hologram. Well, yeah, but if you think about it, the way we experience human contact these days is mostly online. Think of all the people that you communicate with online. Yeah, sure. I mean, it's like, think of every, Hemsworth. Think of Hemsworth. You're never gonna meet Hemsworth. The way you know him is from the movies, right? So similarly, we're gonna start seeing shows that have as their host, presidents that have died, Gandhi, you know, Martin Luther King and not just some bullshit animated thing and AI possessing the thing to produce their personality again. What's that gonna do to us? Maybe it would be a good thing. Because certainly the predominant personalities we're manifesting these days aren't exactly great. You know what I mean? Maybe it'll bring us back to something better. I don't know. Come on. Okay, that's cool. Now, here's another possible day. For some reason, I've spent so much time thinking about this because I think it's such an impending, interesting catastrophe. It's coming. So here's another thing. Therapy. So I go to therapy and they scan me and they show me what a healthy version of me might look like. In your brain. No, like just here, here, you know. Although you'll talk to yourself as a healthy version of yourself. Just like, I mean, I don't know how you, like, you know, you look at you. You're quintessentially a healthy person. You're in shape. You're a positive person. You have great work ethic and you're highly successful. If I were to take this version of you and show it to the version of you prior to you getting into therapy, don't you think it would be inspirational? It might be. It's a way to motivate people. It's interesting. Only if I could speak to myself. Well, that's the therapist's job. To create a self that would speak back to you and go, hey, you've got some work to do. Yeah. You don't realize that you're disconnected and that anxiety, it's because you're not connected to your primary emotional states. This would be a very rewarding experience for you. Yeah. That, because that's gonna be the craziest shit. Yeah. You're gonna get people into therapy. That's good. I think it's going to become one of the great therapeutic tools and tools of trainers who are like, what do you want to look like? Oh, yeah. You want to be muscular. You want to look to barbers, all that shit. Now, finally, this is the final. You've been thinking too much about this, but go ahead. Okay, thank you, Dr. Here's my final question. Would you be interested, is your mother still living? No. Would you be interested in talking to your mom again? I'd like to talk to my dad. And would you be interested in talking to like an AI animated version of your dad again? Be interesting. Who owns the rights to people's parents? Could there be a scooping up of people's parents who've left a social thumbprint online and then those parents are sold back to you? Oh, sure. That'll happen. Would that be legal? Why not? So there's gonna be some company that can literally sell your parents back to you. An experience with your parents back to you. The parent, no, I'm saying the AI. Oh, you get the whole, you keep talking to them like as long as you want? Sure, some black mirror shit, yeah. And also on top of that, think of the email you get that shows. It feels like weirdly, you talked about the dying and living again. It feels like that somehow. It feels like Russian doll. It's like every day, it's like, God damn it, I'm still alive. I know, it creeps me out. It feels, this to me is like when we're all thinking about what the end of the world looks like, it was like based on, well, there's meteors, fire. We got that too, we got meteors. We got meteors. Yeah, they'll come. Bombs, assassinations, but no one was like, oh, we're all going to be infinitely duplicated and better versions of ourself are going to become more successful than us online. That's awesome, online. Here's a real base. I'm sorry, were you going to say something? No. Here's a real base question, so forgive me for it. But I just realized I have never met anyone who goes on Fox News and I was just wondering, what's that like going on Fox News as a Democrat? Yeah, the reason, I have no skin in the game on any of these cable news networks. So I was on CNN for a long time in headline news and I had a great relationship with them and I enjoyed the experience immensely. At the end, it was weird because I, do you want to have me at the end? No. Oh, so I went on Don Lemon one night and I did about 20 minutes, certainly 10 minutes on Trump and his narcissism and his hypomania and all this stuff. And as I said, look, businessman, that's a common personality and mood thing amongst highly successful business people. And I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing for a president. I mean, Teddy Roosevelt was a narcissistic bipolar, for sure. Really? Oh, for sure, think about him that way. And he was my favorite president. So it worked out then, I don't know. So I just talked about it. Next day, my radio program director went, hey, that was pretty interesting. Would you do 30 seconds for our website? I went, I can do it, did 30 seconds. And I'm getting up and he goes, hey, would you do 30 seconds on Hillary? We need maybe balance it out. And I go, all right, you know, she just released, her doctor just released her medical records and her medical care sucked. I had a bunch of notes about it and I was concerned about it. And so I just kind of went through it. And I didn't say anything about her. I was talking about her doctors and the care she was getting. Well, Drudge Report picked that up and went, finally a doctor says she's not fit for office. Oh, fuck. Yeah. And CNN came down to me like a ton of bricks. Oh, shit. And silenced me. Wow. So I thought that was not right. And so I've been looking around for a new home ever since and I've looked everywhere. And these guys have sort of welcomed me and I've known Greg Gutfeld for years. And I used to do red eye all the time back in the day. So it was fun. And the reason I like doing that show is they don't take themselves seriously. I mean, some of the stuff's kind of harsh. But I don't, that's not my opinion. And so either funny, it's upbeat, not taking themselves seriously. So that was my reason for doing that. Now, since then I've been on Laura Ingram a couple of times and on the morning show. No, but you know, I've found it generally congenial, say what you want, you know, come in and have an opinion. And what I've been talking about with Ingram is the homeless thing. So I don't care where I have to go to talk about that. So to me, these are just outlets for conversation. Do you, this is such a boring question, but honestly, just because my- And by the way, I've only been doing that for like three months or something. Well, no, I guess I've known Greg about six months. My wife and I hate watch Fox News, you know? But we're not particularly like, we are political ideas are, well, this is to sum it up. The other day my wife said to me, Duncan, do you realize 100% of your political predictions are wrong? They've been completely wrong over the last year. And I thought about it, because I was like, what? And I'm like, oh, you're right. I'm perpetually politically wrong. Any political thing I think of ends up being wrong, but because I'm a comedian and we're fools, I will say it before I've put any kind of thought into it all, thus perpetually embarrassing myself, which I don't mind. But still I enjoy watching Fox News because particularly Sean Hannity, because he's professionally angry. And I'm fascinated by that because it's like, my God, you have to get yourself throughout. They're all doing TV. You know what I mean? Mostly it's TV. And Fox is more talk show entertainment than news. That's right. But just Hannity in particular has- He didn't use, I used to show years ago, and I think about it, I used to be on a show, I used to be on, what's the guy's name that has his own website world now. So I've always done all the different cable news networks. I used to be on CNBC, I've always just done all of them. P.S. Not talking shit, so to speak, about Hannity. If anyone who likes Hannity, I don't care what you think about his politics, I don't agree with most of them. You do have to admit that guy has got to do some, either number one, he's angry like that all day long, which I don't believe, because if he were, he would be dead in five days. His stomach would just melt. His asshole would just fall out. So that means that he's got to do some kind of like Daniel Day-Lewis pre-show anger mechanisms to really get this perfect flavor of furious. I agree, I agree. I think he would do your show, if you asked him. I think he would, if you asked me would. The only thing, way that I would do that is if we don't talk about politics. Right, of course, of course, of course. Because that would be fascinating to find out. Because you do think like, what do these guys do when they're not like, throwing incendiary, anyway, here's my question. What's it like backstage at that place? Like, how does it work? Super congenial, super, I mean, there's politicians back there, was just chatting it up, it's weird. CNN was always much more quiet and uptight, always. And no one spoke to each other. Backstage at Fox, everyone's talking, chatting it up. I sat next to, what's that, what's this? I can't even think of his name, but senators and things are back there, it's weird. That's the other weird part. But you do admit there is like a water cooler filled with Syrian blood in there that they drink during breaks. I'm not sure it's Syrian, but there's something. Some kind of blood, yeah. And the goblet thing is true. Oh, sure. The stone goblet. With the big stone, yes, well, it's made of stone with a giant gem in it. Wow, cool, man, that's awesome. I had to drink from that. Hey, everybody, I want to drink from the box stone goblet. Oh, power. Okay, so. It is weird. It's just all so weird to me, all that whole world. I was thinking, funny, we're talking about it, it's just, I was just thinking, I want to keep doing capable news outlets, but I have such a head of steam about this homeless thing. Anybody that will listen, I'll talk about it. Hey, let me tell you, we cheer when you get on Fox News. We love watching you on there. And here's the real thing in my mind, my lifetime of LSD mind. The way I look at it is, we aren't in the luxurious position these days of being so fragmented as people. We just don't get to, that is a luxury. I don't even like that. I want to go into enemy territory. I want to talk to everybody. I want to be an example of how we just all, let's get together, come on now. Because that's, to me, being newly married, one of the things I've recently realized is if I try to win an argument. The relationship loses. I lose. No, the relationship loses. And then you lose that way. Yeah, that's losing. That's way, that's more losing than winning. And so I've lately just been like, wait, we love each other. Underneath it all. Yeah, don't fight. Right, but we got to do that. And as men, we like push, we go three or four steps too far always. Depends on our mommies. But yeah, because my mom, I've gotten in many fights with my mom, but it's my wife, if that makes any sense at all. You know what I mean? But that's what I think. You got to get under there. If people like you aren't going on Fox, if people start feeling like, I can't go there because I'm a traitor to this or that or whatever. You got to just go. Just do it. If the intention in your heart is you want the world to be better, let people do it. Are you catching flak from appearing on there from people? Sometimes, yeah, sure. Friends of mine in particular are like, wow, how could you? I'm like, I'm just, I'm not getting paid. I'm not towing a line. I'm just going into expressing something. Right. It's like, and it's an exploration always too. And Gutfeld to me, the Gutfeld show is always just fun. I mean, Tyrus and Cat are friends of mine now. And I think they're just great, you know? It feels to me when I'm watching you though, that you are having to do a type of tightrope walk act up there. Well, because some of the stuff he says is harsh. I'm like, no, no, no, that's not me. I'm more interested in making sense of things, bringing some history and psychology and sort of being that voice there. So, you know, once, I can't say why, unfortunately, but I did a Google search to try to find you cursing. And I really had a hard time finding it. Really? I'm sure it's out there. No, I was just looking like Dr. Drew, fuck you. Dr. Drew saying fuck. You go back to Reddit. That's better use your time. Angry Dr. Drew. I could only find one thing with Adam Carolla where you guys had a little fight. But, and this is, let's see, we have a little bit of time. So here's, I don't know if it's my last question, but this guy I'm really into right now, Shogym Trump of this Buddhist teacher, one of the things he says is, how is it that some people, when they come home, they become really sloppy, they become really gross, they become more aggressive, they become shittier than when they're at work. So they have these two versions of themselves. One of them is what appears in the public space. The other one is what happens behind closed doors. And the one behind closed doors is this elapidated shell, a kind of husk. It's like the elephant man taking off his mask, which already was scary. Now, you know what I mean? And so, and forgive me if this is too personal question. How big is the divide between you, the Dr. Drew, we all know, and you, the Dr. Drew behind closed doors? Everyone around me always tells me I'm exactly the same, which I like. Wow. That's just me. I'm probably, I don't think I'm any different. Maybe you'll, I wonder if I express more anger at home. I'll let that out a little more maybe, but not at, in my family, just angry about whatever happened the day. Right. Yeah. Yeah. And disdain and those kinds of yucky emotions that I don't like, might be a little more of that. But you have to ask my wife. I mean, she generally says I'm the same. Okay. Yeah. That's great to hear. Now, you're the same. Well, I'm getting more of this. That actually, you know, that's not true. I went into like a real sloppy, gross, shitty period where I was like leaving cabinets open and like leaving shit everywhere. And then I actually, that was one of the things I read. So I'm like, wait, who's this person? Well, it's funny that you mentioned sloppiness because that's not usually what happens when people get home. That's your thing. When I normally see people, they become aggressive and abusive and that kind of thing. Like kicking the dog type stuff. Oh, no. Well, I mean, I guess you could say it's a form of abuse or aggression at least in the sense that if you live with someone. Passive aggression, yeah. You're pretending that you don't live with someone or someone else. But you know, when I was growing up and maybe not so much now, there was like pop psychology was telling us, we need to be authentic. We need to be who we are. Don't hold your anger in. Let it out. Yeah, there was a lot of that back then. Like it was gonna do something to you if you didn't express it. That's it. Yeah, and once you discharged it was gone. You're better. That's bullshit. Really? Once you discharged it, you're on a roll. Now it's coming. And you might start liking it or get good at it or have less ability to contain it if you keep letting it out like that. I knew it. That's what I see. Cause my mom was a psychologist growing up and I realized like, wait, my relationship with anger is like the relationship of the person you don't want to sit next to on a plane with farts. They're just blowing them out. They're not thinking there's other people on the plane. And it seems- It's the opposite. What you want to cultivate is empathy. And so you can understand the impact of whatever emotions you express and pay attention to that and go ahead and express them. And by the way, there are ways to express things like anger without it being aggressive. Like I could say, Duncan, I am so angry at you. And be really angry and tell you why and be very adamant about it. And that's it. And I've now just, I've expressed my anger. I've done it in a very possibly productive way. Gotcha. Man, I wonder how much damage that has done to the world, that philosophy. Cause the seventies did that. You know how I hate the seventies. I wasn't quite aware of that. Oh, I hate the seventies. They, they, they, they, they, untold damage came out of the seventies. Untold. Everything we're dealing with bad right now, you could draw a direct line back. The Elton John movie. Is that what you're supposed to do? Everything. You could draw a line back to the seventies. It's got to be some music and cinema, I guess. Wow. Oh my God. Okay. So that's great. That's what I thought. I, I, I think a lot of people are confusing their lack of discipline with some kind of authenticity. This is who I am. Yeah. This is me. And you just can't handle it, man. Yeah. No, that's you being an asshole. Wow. Yeah. Authenticity is a much more subtle phenomenon. Authenticity is spontaneity and genuineness and usually positive emotions come along with it. And when they're negative, they're done with empathic attunement and concern. Finally, Dr. Drew After Dark. And no, finally, we can keep talking. I can do like 15 minutes in one. Oh, that's fantastic. You want to do it, yeah. Okay, cool. Man, what a great show. Yeah, that was fun. That was so fun. Not our show. Your show is blowing up, man. Dr. After Dark. Yes. Yeah. It's so good. People like it. Yeah, that is good. When I was there with you. Have they aired the one you and I did? They did, yeah, they did, yeah. When I was there with you and watching your stuff online, I realized, oh, you're kind of a comedian, right? You're a comedic figure. You're really funny. Here's what that is. Is that I've been working with a comedian for how many decades with Corolla since 1996, right? And my role, and he has pounded this into me, is improvisational comedy. Like if I don't give him something back, he's furious. Right. And so he was constantly, and I resisted it for about 10 years. He was always like, not only that, but yes, and, can't you give me, can't you coaching me? You'll listen to the Adam and Dr. Drew show. You'll still hear him yelling at me about stuff where I'm not giving back what he wants improvisationally. Fundamentally, I'm being the straight guy, right? I'm pitching stuff to the comedian to give him a chance to be funny. Wow. But I do understand humor. You're funny. I think I understand it, yeah. You're what's known as a straight man, but that's what you are, but that is the funniest. To me, it reminds me of Carl Reiner with Mel Brooks. Carl Reiner was very straight, but he was very funny. Very funny. And that's harder to pull off that. I disagree, and Adam would kick you in the ass for that. Really? I don't know, maybe, but I disagree because it suits my constitution. It's very natural for me to do that. I gotcha. So I don't have to work at it. I have to work at paying attention and be trying to be clever and trying to be interesting and let my own, whatever, humor come out spontaneously too. That's the hard part, right? Trusting your instincts? Yes. That's a real difficulty, for sure. Well, especially if you're up in your head. Trusting your instincts, I was actually reading Everest, because all those people are stuck up there. They're crazy. And one of the things Crack Hour wrote is that when every move is life or death, you're out of your head completely. But do you get up in your head a lot, or do you? I actually would argue I probably need to go up there more and pay attention. To me, that's a matter of focus and paying attention. Gotcha. Yeah, because I got pretty good at trusting my instincts these days. Yeah. What do you see as the future for Dr. Drew? Are you going to get a TV show or some kind of regular? I have no idea. I don't know. Do you want anything like that, or are you feeling like you don't want to keep doing it? I still feel like I've got some unfinished business, and I don't know what that even means, because television is such a wreck right now. Yeah. I enjoy working with people and creating stuff. I really enjoy it. So I feel like I need to do some more of that. Well, you have to. And my thing is always make sure it does something. There's a reason you did it. Something good's going to happen for it. Something has to be done. Yeah. And it may not be obvious what that is, but something's got to happen. So you don't have anything in the works right now? You're not cooking up anything? I always have something. But you know how television is, that and 50 cents, buy a Coke. Right. I have nothing imminent. Nothing imminent. Well, I mean, that's the thing. I think this weird distinction between the internet and TV is ridiculous. Well, I was going to say. You already have a TV show. Yeah, I was going to say. I'm a little bit surprised that Dr. After Dark doesn't turn into something. If I were television producer, I'd go, maybe we could turn that over. Oh, it has to. It's so, to me, it's like, finally you're getting to, like, because when I see on Fox or a lot of the shows, you're having to play not just a straight man, but you're just having to play a doctor and be very serious because if suddenly you start cracking jokes on any of those shows, it would be scandalous. It would be hilarious for us, but it would scandalize. But you, you would be. How many heart attacks? How many heart attacks of like the ancient Fox news viewers? It's just exploded in heart. Well, that's the really interesting tightrope walk I always have to do, though. I don't want to not be a doctor. I don't want to be disrespectful to my profession, my position and all these decades of work and I've been doing or I patients even for that matter. But I do like to push the boundary a little bit. Yeah, well, I hope you keep doing it. Thank you. Like you've been doing it. And I love Dr. Drew After Dark, especially that's, I hope what you make your focus. Don't, what do I know? But thank you so much for taking the time to be here. I always love talking to you. It's never not a joy. So thank you. Let's do it again. Anytime. Thank you. All right, man. Thanks a lot.

U.S.A.A. means United Services Automobile Association and its affiliates San Antonio, Texas. Greetings, friends. How long do you think human civilization has existed on this planet? What if we had actually been here much longer than is currently accepted in most realms of archaeology, anthropology, and whatever ology maps out the age of species? What if we were here longer? What if the stories of great, beautiful, mystical, powerful civilizations wiped out by some global catastrophe were not just mythology, but were actually true? There is one person who comes to mind. When we speculate on this matter, and that person, of course, is Graham Hancock. His amazing series, Ancient Apocalypse, is now available on Netflix. It's so good. Please watch it. And then when you're done watching this series, dive in to the vitriolic retribution that has been dished out to Hancock from a variety of places, most surprisingly, a Guardian article that sounds as though it were written by somebody who had a horrible, horrible rash on their undergunt. You know what I mean? That tone of journalism that's just mean for mean's sake, a kind of way of reviewing or critiquing things that has within them what feels like some kind of personal animosity towards the subject. It feels like in this article written by Stuart Heritage about Graham Hancock's show, Ancient Apocalypse, that their neighbors are something and Graham Hancock's dog's gotten to Stuart Heritage's yard and shit all over his roses. I'm just going to read a little bit from this article. At the time of writing, Ancient Apocalypse has been comfortably sitting in Netflix's top 10 list for several days. This presents something of a mystery because the show closely resembles a sort of half-baked filler documentary that one of the lesser discovery channels would slap up at 3 a.m. between shows about plane crashes and fascist architecture. Ancient Apocalypse obviously has an audience, but who on earth is it? Fortunately, you don't have to watch for long to find out. In quick succession during the pre-show Sizzle Reel, we are treated to a clip of the show's host Graham Hancock being interviewed by Joe Brogan. Finally, we have an answer. Ancient Apocalypse must be a TV program exclusively for people who like to shout at you on Twitter. They're mean to me on Twitter. Don't you guys get it? Why is there a mean to me? That's me, not him, the mean to me part. He did say exclusively for people who like to shout at you on Twitter. Of course it is. These people are Hancock's bread and butter, the quote-free thinkers who through some bizarre quirk of nature are often more perennial outraged than anyone else on earth. They're drawn to Ancient Apocalypse thanks in part to Hancock's loud and persistent claims that his life's work is being suppressed by big archaeology. Now, I'm going to cut towards the end here. Which is to say we shouldn't dismiss Hancock's theory out of hand, of course, because if he's right and the history of humanity really is just the first five minutes of Prometheus, it would change everything we know about ourselves. But we certainly shouldn't treat his hodgepodge of mysteries and coincidences as fact. That's the danger of a show like this. It whispers to the conspiracy theorist and all of us. And Hancock is such a compelling host that he's bound to create a few more in his wake. Believing that ultra-intelligent creatures help to build the pyramids is one thing, but where does it end? First of all, this ultra-intelligent creatures help to build the pyramids part. This is not in Ancient Apocalypse. Maybe ultra-intelligence people, but not creatures. He's insinuating here that Ancient Apocalypse is Ancient Aliens, which it is. I think he got the two shows mixed up, maybe. I'm wondering if maybe he watched Ancient Aliens and didn't understand that this was not Ancient Apocalypse. Believing that ultra-intelligent creatures help to build the pyramids is one thing, but where does it end? Believing that election fraud is real? Believing 9-11 was an inside job worse? If you are feeling particularly mean-spirited, now here comes true cowardly writing. If you want to see cowardly writing, the way that he writes this is cowardly, because it's like this way of darting around the fact that he's the one saying it. It's a way that some mean journalist write to avoid seeming like they're the ones being the asshole. If you were feeling particularly mean-spirited, you could suggest that Netflix knows this and has gone out of its way to court the conspiracy theorists. He doesn't have the guts to say, I think Netflix knows this and has gone out of its way to court the conspiracy theorists. He puts it on us. If you were feeling mean, this is what you would say. Really shitty, pissy writing. Anyway, this is just one of many articles where the tone and the venomous tone doesn't seem right for a show theorizing that humans have been on the planet longer than we have. Like what's the big deal? If he's wrong, he's wrong. So what? It's still an entertaining show. It's still fun to watch. I mean, the other aspect of this kind of writing, which is really annoying, is it's so condescending because the implication is that the individual human is not capable of discerning fact from fiction. The implication is that we're all little buying sheep that we have no control. We have no autonomy over what we do. And if you watch a show like Ancient Apocalypse, which truly, of all the shows available on Netflix, it's got to be one of the least conspiratorial of the documentaries you could watch on Netflix, which is really just like a fun show at the very least. It's a travel log. I mean, it's just beautiful. The cinematography is incredible. It's beautiful. But also what Hancock is talking about is fun. I personally subscribe to it. I believe it. It wouldn't shock me if we found out that we had been here much longer and that whatever we were was wiped out by some kind of cosmic event. It wouldn't be shocking to me. It wouldn't change the way that I live. It certainly wouldn't send me as Stuart Heritage seems to think skittering towards the nearest government building to attempt an insurrection. I mean, it's a show about prehistory. It's not Alex Jones. But the outrage that came from a lot of different places related to this show speaks to what a great show it is. And that's how you know something's good is if it stirs up people like Stuart Heritage and some of the folks that we discuss in this conversation with Graham Hancock to the point that they express intellectual outrage, which is one of the funniest forms of outrage when someone is doing some version of I never in my life at the historical society felt so insulted at this moment when that clown dad say that the earth is not the center of the galaxy. We know the sun orbits around the earth. It's very funny and quite often people express intellectual outrage are shown to be wrong. But sometimes they're right. Regardless, I love it. You know, if you ask me anytime you have people debating each other over prehistory, that's a good sign. That's what we want. That's nice. It brings us all together. I've got no hard feelings for Stuart Heritage. I don't know why he's so pissed at Graham Hancock. But anytime we have this level of intellectual fisticuffs happening on social media and publicly, it's good news. It's funny. It's just a lot better than some of the other shitty debates that are happening out there. And so, regardless, ancient apocalypse, you got to watch it read some of Hancock's books. He also writes wonderful fiction to he's just a brilliant author. And he's a wonderful person having had the good fortune to have a few conversations with him. He just radiates warmth and sweetness and a kind of like beautiful seriousness regarding his theories. And I just love him to death. And if you have yet to cross past with him, I think you are going to love him too. He's right around the corner. But first, I want to invite you to join the DTF Patreon. It's patreon.com. Sign up.

But now, everyone, please welcome to the DTF H, the creator of Netflix's incredible documentary, Ancient Apocalypse. Green Bangkok. Graham, welcome back to the DTF H. It is so great to see you. How's it going? Hi Duncan, it's really good to be back with you. Seems like years. I think it must be. It has been years. Oh, a lot has happened between the last time we chatted and today. Not only did we go through a global pandemic, but you have released. It's got to be my favorite Netflix documentary of all time. Ancient Apocalypse is incredible. So how long did it take you to make that show? Well, the idea was originally floated in 2019. And the show was ready to get on the road in 2020 when COVID hit. And we got just a massive series of delays. If it hadn't been for COVID, I think we would have finished it by the end of 2020. But that's spread it out through 2020, 2021. And finally, we released in November 2022. And the two or three episodes were filmed in 2022. It was a major logistical exercise. I can't imagine. Can't imagine what went into that. And for example, we wanted to film in Peru. I love the megalithic sites up there at Cusco, Sacsay, Juaman, the Sacred Valley, Machu Picchu. There's extraordinary mysteries there. And I would like to have done an episode there, but COVID got in the way. Peru locked down for like a year and a half, a very long time at any rate, just when we were wanting to be there. So we couldn't go. So we had to work around it. And like any long-term television project, it's a compromise between what ideally I would like to have done and what could be done under very difficult circumstances. That's right. When I made the Midnight Gospel for Netflix, I remember Pendleton, who I made it with, telling me, look, here's how it's going to go. Things are going to go real fast and you're going to have to get something done and turn it in whether you think it's done or not. And that's just the way it works. And it can be quite frustrating when you know you're giving, you know, you're turning into something great. You certainly did, but there's that sense of, oh, I've only had one more month. I learned a lot about storytelling during this production. I mean, I'm a storyteller. I have been on my working life, but I tell stories in the form of large books. And the way I do things with a nonfiction book is, yes, I will write a synopsis, which is the pitch for the publisher. But after that deal is done, I throw the synopsis aside and just let the story carry me wherever I want it to carry me. Whereas with television, with a crew of 10 people and, you know, substantial budgets and flying all over the world, you can't do that. You have to have a pretty clear idea of what you're going to do and what you're going to shoot and where you're going to shoot and even on which day you're going to shoot it. And, you know, you need to unfold the story in a different way. So it's been a fascinating exercise for me. And, you know, I'm glad you liked it and glad you saw it. And I think it's possibly the first time that a work of alternative history like this, really proposing a radical relook at the human past, has got out onto a mainstream platform and been seen by tens of millions of people. And I welcome that. Well, you really threaded the needle. I mean, when you're making anything like that, you are having to decide how deep do I want to go into any given aspect of the show? And, you know, if you veer too far in the direction of what some people call woo, then you could throw a lot of people. You have to thread the needle. And this is what you do when you're writing, too. You threaded the needle. And so I just found myself riveted not just by the way you told the story of these ancient civilizations, because I already knew what we've talked before. I knew what the ending, what the culmination of it all would be, but the cinematography, the music, the fonts you picked, every single aspect of it built this real, like, tangible tension, you know, a real connection to the fragility of human civilization that I think a lot of shows that are about history, about the reality of what it's like to live in a tumultuous planet, that they don't quite hit that pitch. They don't quite hit that pitch that helps, that throws cold water on your face and reminds you, hey, things don't stay the same on this planet. And sometimes they change fast. And that was pretty intense to watch, especially when I was lucky. Yeah, absolutely. I was lucky to work with a really fantastic team of professionals who were very dedicated, every single one of them, in their hearts, to telling the story in the best possible way. And, you know, that makes it a comprehensive work. It's not just me. It's a team effort with a group of people bringing different skills, whether it's graphics, whether it's camera work, whether it's sound, to try to bring this story across as forcefully as possible. And my goodness, there's huge opposition. It's really surprised me, the reaction of mainstream archaeology to this series. I mean, I've always had a sort of complicated relationship with mainstream archaeology, ever since I published Fingerprints of the God back in 1995. They like to call me names and try to diminish my work. So it seems to have created a sort of fury that suddenly Hancock ends up on Netflix with an eight episode series proposing the possibility of a lost civilization of the Ice Age, which they just absolutely don't believe is possible. And it just seems to have pushed all kinds of extraordinary buttons. I find myself being called a racist and a white supremacist, which I personally find very offensive and hurtful. Because, you know, I married to Santa, a woman of color. We have four mixed-race children, seven mixed-race grandchildren. And to have archaeologists, you know, pressing that particular button to try to smear my name fucking infuriates me as a matter of fact. And it's so lazy and so idle. But in a way, it shows how desperate they are to, you know, to have to do. This has been to me. I mean, obviously, I didn't make the show. So I can't imagine what you're feeling. But I was just so thrilled with the show. It ends. I'm excited. I've had you on my podcast. I know you. It's a great show. I just tweet how good the show was. In that comments thread, someone's like, oh, it's a racist show. I'm like, what the what? I didn't even expect it. And then, of course, the Guardian article pops up. Now you have, oh, God, this poisonous. Why was this even allowed? Why was it allowed? It's in this lazy, just, just venomous article. This author suggests that Netflix, by allowing this show on, is enticing people to believe in election fraud, to entice people to believe in all the other conspiracy theories that you're like a gateway drug that leads to Holocaust denial or something like that. It was crazy. And so, you know, of course, if you want to trigger conspiracy theorists, or just people like me, you know, I love a lot of the conspiracy theories. I don't believe in all of them, but some of them are interesting, but suddenly seeing, not just from archaeologists, but from sites like The Guardian, this not just pushback, not just like, oh, this show's bullshit, but like suggesting Netflix needs to take it down. We all got weirded out, like, wait a minute. Why are they so intent on suppressing this information? What is the danger here? Yeah, it's a very strange thing, because it's almost as though archaeologists are at any rate a group of archaeologists within the archaeological profession, but believe that they are the entitled gatekeepers of the human past, and that nobody may enter the sealed realm of the human past without their expressed permission and without their guidance and instruction as to how to behave in there. And how dare, you know, some journalist come along and suggest the possibility that there may be a forgotten episode in the ice age. The thing is, the thing that really surprises me, because archaeology is so incomplete. There's so much of the world that hasn't been studied by archaeology. The classic examples are the Sahara Desert, 9 million square kilometers, the flooded continental shells, 27 million square kilometers, the Amazon rainforest, still five and a half million square kilometers under canopy. You know, just for a start, none of these areas have really been thoroughly investigated by archaeologists. That's a huge area of the Earth's surface, particularly those flooded continental shells. And so for archaeologists to then stay with absolute certainty that there is no possibility whatsoever that there could have been some kind of civilization during the ice age, when there's so much of the planet they just haven't looked at. It strikes me as extraordinarily irresponsible, and I just don't understand it. It really defeats all kind of logic. Well, can I present what the conspiracy theorists are saying? I don't know what message boards you go on, but I can tell you the consensus among conspiracy theorists who really enjoyed your show is that, holy shit, Hancock's on to something here. They know this thing is coming. They understand that there is some kind of global, cyclical, apocalyptic event that happens at a predictable time, and this documentary plugs into that reality, and they don't want us to freak out. They want us to stay calm while they, and again, I'm not saying this is necessarily my theory. I just adore conspiracy theories. They want us to stay calm while they raise interest rates, get as much resources as they can, and then slither into their bunkers until whatever this thing is happens, reemerge, start a new global civilization. They get to be the guys on the sides of these ancient ruins with the purses who teach agriculture. They get to be the kings of Atlantis. What do you think about that theory, and no offense if you don't want to respond? Well, no, I just don't think it's necessary to go that far. We have here a group of so-called professionals who are actually very insecure, I think, in their own grip on the past. They desperately want to be recognized as proper scientists, but they aren't proper scientists because there's so much that can't be reproduced and can't be weighed and measured and counted that is important in the past. I mean, you can't weigh and measure and count spiritual ideas or astronomical knowledge. They have a fixed and firm view of the past. They have been the unchallenged gatekeepers of the past. Their ideas about the past are what are taught to all of us in school, what are reflected by the media. I mean, I've been surprised in a horrible way, but in a way I expected it by the supine manner in which particularly the British media have just lain back and taken whatever the archaeologists told them without questioning a single thing. Just repeating, like parrots, what a few archaeologists told them to say and not investigate. I mean, journalism in my day wasn't like that. We actually checked stories before publishing them, especially if we're going to do a hatchet job on somebody. The very least we could do is get in touch with that person and see what they've got to say, but nobody ever did get in touch with me. They just do these hatchet jobs. Well, at some levels, it's quite depressing and upsetting. As I mentioned, the race thing particularly disturbs me because of my own family. My grandchildren are now hearing that their grandfather is being labeled as a white supremacist and a racist. Can you help me understand that? Because I still have yet to piece together how you... So there are some ancient traditions. First of all, one of the things that's wrong with it is projecting current ideas about race onto a period of 12,000 or plus more years ago. That's the first thing that's wrong with it because we cannot assume that current ideas about race were the same 12,000 years ago or even that races existed in that way. But what is being... The argument that underpins this accusation is that when I wrote Fingerprints of the Gods in 1995, I quoted a number of indigenous myths and traditions from North America, from Mexico and from South America, particularly from Mexico and from Peru and Bolivia, which speak of a white-skinned, bearded, civilizing being who comes and brings the gifts and teaches civilization to these people after a great cataclysm in a time of darkness. And in Mexico, that individual is called Quetzalcoatl, the feathered serpent, and in the Andes, he's called Viracocha. Now, these accounts were taken down from indigenous peoples by early Spanish conquistadors and friars who were in Mexico and in Bolivia and Peru at the time of the conquest. They were interviewing local people and they were getting local traditions from them. And these are the earliest versions of local traditions that have been passed down to us from that time. And we have to remember that there was also an enormous destruction of written documents by the Spaniards at that time. So anything that is passed down to us is precious. Up until quite recently, nobody questioned these reports at all. But there's been a movement in archaeology now to say, oh, these reports were doctored by the Spanish, that they deliberately introduced the notion of the white-skinned bearded civilizer to promote and underpin the Spanish conquest. I don't know if that's true or not. I've started looking at some of the documents on that. I'm going to write an article about this eventually, but what comes across to me is that this is an opinion that some archaeologists have. For example, Bernardino de Sahagun, who was one of the great translators of ancient Mexican culture to the west. He was there in the 1540s in Mexico. He's one of those who passed down this tradition of the white-skinned bearded deity, Quetzalcoatl, and how Cortes was seen as a fulfillment of the prophecy of the return of Quetzalcoatl. Bernardino de Sahagun, in 90% of what he passes down to us, is regarded as an absolutely reliable reporter and the world's first true anthropologist. But in this one, where he steps dangerously into woke territory, he's suddenly described as being unreliable and as making the whole story up. Well, I'm not convinced of that at all. I think these are genuine indigenous traditions, but beyond that point, which definitely requires further investigation, I think that projecting current sensitivities and current ideas about race onto the past is an irrelevant thing to do anyway, because we don't know how people felt in the past about these issues, or if they felt about these issues at all. I mean, if we already don't have the datasets to help us truly understand how they built some of these structures, how do they think we have the datasets to understand how they interacted, how they dealt with multiculturalism or with melatonin in the skin? And also, what's wrong with the notion of ideas spreading from culture to culture around the world? This is the other thing that archaeologists seem to object to, that each culture is now supposed to be sort of island unto itself with no outside influence. And that any hint of outside influence is somehow taking away from the pride of the achievements of that culture. And again, that's imposing modern ideas on the past. I don't see it that way at all. I see the world as an interrelated place. Human ideas are constantly fertilizing one another across vast distances. That's one of the reasons why we're a successful species, because ideas are shared. Refuting the accounts of people saying what their myths are. Isn't that more racist? Isn't that true racist? It's not what they meant. They were manipulated. I do think it's more racist. But see, it's part of what I mean to see as a sinister project. Just as now there are some archaeologists who refuse to confirm a gender for a set of skeletal remains found in some archaeological dig, because they don't know what the fucking pronoun of that skeleton was. That can't be true. That's real. It is true. Yes. And there is now an attempt to go back and sanitize the past and make it acceptable to the present ethic. So the notion that it suddenly becomes unacceptable that there are indigenous accounts of somebody with white skin which meant nothing 12,000 years ago. Somebody with white skin coming and bringing ideas of civilization. That's all got to be rubbed out from the past because it doesn't fit with the current agenda. And the way to rub it out from the past is to try to discredit those original reporters back in the 1500s who were the first to bring these myths to the West. I want to thank Masterclass for supporting this episode of the DTFH. I was very excited when Masterclass approached us to support the podcast because I'm already subscribed to Masterclass. I love them. They are incredible. They have some of the coolest courses that you can find out there right now. I got lucky. I ended up getting a part in this show that's coming out in the spring probably called Crapopolis that Dan Harmon created. And so suddenly I got to do real voice acting and I was doing voice acting with super pros. Hannah Waddingham being one of the people on the show. These are people who have been acting for their entire lives. And so I had to figure out a way to get good at voice acting as quickly as I possibly could. And thank God for Masterclass's awesome VO course with Nancy Cartwright, a legendary voice actor, truly helpful. Something that I actually implemented in my own life and that is just one of the many awesome courses that Masterclass offers. I'm just going to read a few of them to you right now just because these are fucking insane. Like are you kidding me? You want to take a course with Aaron Sorkin on filmmaking? You can. It's there for you. Aaron Sorkin. What the fuck? How is that even possible? You want to do filmmaking with James Cameron? It's there acting with Samuel Jackson. It's there for you. You want to do disruptive intrapreneurship with Richard Branson? It's there for you. And the list goes on and on and on. This is one of the coolest things on the internet right now and I hope that you will try them out. I'm sorry if this commercial is too long, but I'm telling you, I love Masterclass. They are the shit and I highly recommend you check it out. This holiday, give the perfect gift of an annual Masterclass membership and get one free. Go to masterclass.com slash Duncan today. That's masterclass.com slash Duncan today. You can sign up for your own membership and then you can give someone in your life who you love, a membership to Masterclass, something that will definitely improve their lives. Thank you so much, Masterclass. I mean, it seems like if they wanted to whitewash the myths, like if I'm a Spanish conquistador and I really want to do a number on these things, why not just say they said Spanish conquistadors were going to come? Why not just put that in there? Why make it ambiguous using skin color? Also, I don't know if there's any record of this, but has anyone looked into albinism? Has anyone looked into the potential that this was an albino? The other thing that really pisses me off about this is that race is just such a fucking unimportant issue. It's fundamentally so unimportant. It's one of these artificial divisions that has been brought to human race in the modern age. It's been my privilege to travel the world, to live amongst many different cultures around the world, and what I can see again and again and again is that human beings are the same all over the world. The minor exterior differences hide an incredible unity amongst the human race, and our abilities for everything that matters, for creativity, for love, for care, for nurture, our hopes, our dreams, our fears, they're all the same all over the world, and we should not be giving importance to this issue of race. The parallel I often make is would we seek to discriminate against people on the basis of the length of their colons? The colon is a large organ just like the skin is, but neither nor the colon say anything about the quality of the human being. The quality of the human being has got nothing to do with such superficial characteristics. Look, I'm sorry, I disagree with you there. I just don't trust people with short colons. They have done me wrong in the past. I don't know if you trust me. Trust me. If you have someone with a short colon comes to your house, hide your jewelry. They will take it. The notion of this is a relatively recent notion, and it's something that's hot in the present age, but to seek to go back and impose it on the past and make the past conform to present ideas, I think is a mistake, and until some archaeologist actually proves that those early Spanish reporters deliberately misrepresented those indigenous myths that they were bringing to us, but didn't misrepresent the other ones, until that is actually proved, I'm going to go along with the earliest reports that we have, which happened to have been made by Spaniards who'd learned the local languages and were working with local elders. Okay. Also, with all of this static regarding like the culture wars and the stuff going on right now, this only adds to a sinister level of your show, which is, and also as you're shooting this, you must have felt the weirdness of being in a global pandemic while going to these ancient sites that all seem to, in one way or another, point to this disaster that happened. You were in the midst of a global disaster. You're going to all these rooms that are talking about a global disaster. And then finally, when this shows up, instead of maybe all of us being like, Holy shit, there's more important fish to fry right now than the ones that we're currently ripping each other's throats over, they just use it as cannon fodder to demonize you. That is really apocalyptic. To get ready for this conversation, I started watching various documentaries on volcanoes. I watched this incredible documentary on the earthquake in Everest when the climbers were up there and, you know, a village disappeared. I don't know if you saw this documentary, but they show, you know, oh my God, it's so, so breathtakingly horrible because people who were going on the climb stop in this village. It's a Buddhist village. They're having a funerary celebration for, I think it's the 49th day after the death of this person when the soul has moved through the bardo and reincarnated. They have a big celebration where everyone in the village shows up. So they have the last gathering of this village. And then this earthquake hits and a landslide literally vanishes that village. It is gone. Gone. Like just gone in a second. It's gone. So as I'm watching that, as I'm watching like Iceland, cities covered up by ash, other places where pyroclastic flows have just completely eradicated everything that was there. It just hit home. You're one of your one of your teachings, one of the points that you are making in the show, which is that how can we say how can we say there wasn't something here before because the way the earth works is it just wipes it out completely gone. Nothing at all. That's right. And the earth did pass through a truly horrendous cataclysm that lasted for about 1200 years, which is called the Younger Dryus. And that's between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago. And that's why we call the show Ancient Apocalypse. I'd like to wait just before we perhaps move on to other more refreshing subjects. I'd like to just take one more point about these archaeologists. Okay, please. And that concerns our mutual friend, our mutual friend Joe Rogan. Because I was with Joe a few weeks ago. And we issued a call for an archaeologist to debate me live, well not live, these days Joe recalls, but on the Joe Rogan experience. And it turns out that there's one archaeologist in particular, he's called John Hoops of the University of Kansas, who claims to have been following effectively stalking my work for the last 30 years, and who has been responsible for multiple attacks on my on my name, and, and, and, and my reputation. Over, over the years, who guest edited a special issue of the Society for American Archaeologist Journal, a large section of which was devoted to attempting to completely discredit my most recent book, the 29 book 2019 book America before. And John Hoops is the one who's been most stridently advocating that I'm some sort of supporter of racism and white supremacy. So I felt since he claims to know so much about my work and since he's been attacking me for years, and since he's very active behind his keyboard that he'd be the ideal archaeologist to sit opposite me on Joe's show, which Joe kindly offered, offered to host and do this, do this debate. But then the bloody coward refused to debate me. He declined. I issued the public challenge with his agreement and he declined. He said, wouldn't debate me. He said, I can't debate, can't debate metaphysics with science, calling what I do metaphysics, although he's been, although he's been pouring scorn on it and insulting it for, you know, for years. But when it comes to actually sitting down in a face-to-face debate on record and, you know, putting his reputation on the line, he doesn't have the guts to do it. So I'm going to maintain that position if John Hoops ever manages to pluck up the courage to actually come on the Joe Rogan experience and sit opposite me and debate me. I'm ready to debate him at any other time, but no other archaeologist is going to get that space. John Hoops has to man up. Hoops, stretch out your colon. It's time to go on and debate Hancock. You've got to do that. And also I think that saying that what you're doing is metaphysics is deceptive and ridiculous. And to, and even if it were metaphysics, wouldn't it actually be easy if you had some kind of unprovable, untestable, unquantifiable data set that you were claiming to be real, but we can't find it? Wouldn't that be the easiest thing in the world to shoot down? I mean, isn't the problem that what you're presenting is... Exactly. I mean, John and I gave him the opportunity, you know, to win his argument against me on, you know, the biggest podcast on Earth. And he declined. Wow. And he declined for totally bogus reasons. So I just think that the archaeological community is full of shit, frankly. And the more this goes on, the less respect I have for them. This seems to be something that is happening across the board right now. It feels like everyone is getting a really dark lesson in how naive we have been in ascribing, you know, some kind of extra power, some extra information, some kind of weird, I don't know, academic authority to people who maybe don't have it quite right. And it's not just in archaeologists, it's happening in science, it's happening in politics, especially in all of this. We've had it over too much of our power to people who claim to be experts in one thing or another. Of course, there's a place for experts, but they should never have a monopoly on knowledge. And, you know, this is where the human race needs to grow up. So many of our problems are caused by bad leadership, really lousy, shitty, uninspired, greedy, selfish, stupid leadership. Yes. So many of our problems are caused by that. It's time the human race woke up and minimized the power of these harmful individuals that are destroying the world, by which I mean the politicians and their friend. That's it. That's it. And because of the internet, it seems like being able to hide some of the things that used to be a lot easier to hide. Everybody is having to sort of looking at each other, and we really don't know what to do. I mean, I don't know anything about evolutionary biology, but I would bet that it's at some genetic level, we're set up to need a leader to have the best in the tribe, to have the best in the group that you turn to, or at least a few of the best that you turn to when you're young and you don't know what's going on. And maybe that's carried over into an age where people are aware of that and have figured out how to hack humans, to psychologically hack humans in a way that makes us believe, oh, look, he talks like a leader. They dress like a leader. They're surrounded by other powerful people. So I guess that's who we listen to. That's who we obey. Part of a huge confidence trick. I mean, there is a place for leadership of some sort or other, but it needs to be completely with the agreement of the people, not the kind of overlordship, which it is at the moment, which we see in, fortunately, it is changing a little bit, but the war on drugs, that incredible invasion of individual adult privacy by the state. There's just so many places where these people should not go. And if you look at the state of international relations today and the way the world is being stirred up into endless hatred and fear and suspicion, it's all being done in the interests of leaders. So I think we need to, perhaps we can never get rid of them entirely, but they definitely need, as I always say, 12 doses of ayahuasca first. And they need a bit more humility. You know what? I wish I'd screen grabbed it. I was on a message board the other day and I wanted to, for a second, I'm tweeting this because it's like, it refutes the dream all of us psychonauts have that if we gave psychedelics to sociopaths, there would be some healing. Because this person said something on the lines of, I have now taken three mega doses of mushrooms and am certain that black and white people need to be segregated permanently. That was what the mushrooms did for him. And I was like, no. Oh, my God, you know, that's it. Oh, no, yes. I mean, they, in a way, they tend to reveal what is in the person already to a large extent. This is the problem. I mean, you know, the, the, the Mexica, the Aztecs in ancient Mexico where we're performing human sacrifice at an almost industrial scale. And that was, and that was being under the influence of mushrooms as well. So it's not all sweetness and light in the, in the psychedelic garden by any means. At the same time, I feel compelled to say, while it is true that the Aztecs were carrying out human sacrifice on an industrialized scale. So was the Catholic Church at that time, which was burning people at the stake in the name of their God, which is purely an act of human sacrifice and nothing else. Right. You know, so, so the West is nothing to teach anybody in this area. Yeah. And human sacrifice continues to this day. I mean, anytime you drop bombs on groups of people and make money doing that, you've transformed that life into money, essentially, it's human sacrifice in a different way. And especially when the war is being waged over ridiculous, stupid reasons, things, reasons that might even be more idiotic than believing in offering a human heart to a deity. I think that people just the way we're sacrificing people these days might seem a little more chaotic, but it's human sacrifice nonetheless. It is exactly, call it exactly what it is. Yeah, I agree. I agree. So I have to ask, because you are, and as you should be invested in your theories regarding human history, let's imagine a scenario where hoops, hoops, the nemesis somehow recovers something that absolutely disproves what you're saying. I don't know what that thing would be, and I don't think it's out there because I subscribe to your theories for a lot of different reasons, not just your writings. But let's just imagine as a thought experiment, this does come out and now suddenly with all your belief and good intentions and all the data and all the connections you made, you realize, oh my God, some fundamental aspect of this is flawed. What are you going to do? What would you do if that happened? Oh, if there were absolute disproof that I'm wrong and I've spent the last 30 years of boots on the ground and detailed research pursuing a fantasy, well, I'd have to just accept that and admit it. There's no other point. I'll then go away to my other pursuit and write novels. I really enjoy writing novels. I have much more fun writing novels than I do writing nonfiction books, but it just happens that I feel the nonfiction work is important right now. There's so much going on in this field. I actually got out of it completely after 2002 after I'd published Underworld after seven years of scuba diving, looking for submerged structures on the continental shelves. I published Underworld in 2002, and then I thought really I was done with the lost civilization. I wrote Supernatural, which was a book about the role of psychedelics in, well, a very complicated story about psychedelics and cave art and aliens and all sorts of things. And then I wrote a series of novels. I wrote Entangled, and I wrote three novels about the Spanish conquest of Mexico. I loved doing that. So if I turn out to be proven wrong about the possibility of a lost civilization, then I shall gently retire to my novelist's garden and write novels. But I'm not sure that's likely to happen, and this is why I think what's needed is a more cooperative relationship between those of us who think that there may be big missing pieces in the past. And those of us, mainly archaeologists, who are convinced that there's not much more that they need, or let's put it this way. It's not that archaeologists are saying that they know everything about the past. No, they're not saying that. What they're saying is they know enough about the past to be sure that there was no lost civilization of any kind. And I'm not at all persuaded by that argument. God bless you, Loomie Labs, for supporting this episode of the DTFH. God bless the chemists at Loomie Labs who went through whatever they had to go through. I can't imagine what it was like trying to dial in the perfect dose of an edible. I imagine that for science, for all of us, there were chemists at Loomie Labs who ended up curled up in the fetal position. But at last, they did it. In the same way Oppenheimer discovered how to split the atom, Loomie Lab scientists figured out the perfect micro dose of edible THC, and they now offer it to all of us in the form of an edible. Loomie Lab scientists figured out the perfect micro dose of edible THC, and they now offer it to all of us in the form of their delicious micro dose gummies. It's the perfect dose. It gives you that nice, warm feeling as though a hobbit created a cozy home inside your heart. Even better, microdose is available nationwide. You can get it anywhere. You can fly with it. To learn more about microdosing THC, go to microdose.com and use code Duncan to get free shipping and 30% off your first order. Links can be found in the show description. But again, that's microdose.com code Duncan. God bless you, Loomie Labs. God bless you, microdose gummies. I'm not at all persuaded by that argument, partly on the grounds that I laid out earlier, that there are so many areas of the world that have never been investigated by archaeology at all. And partly because of the refusal of archaeologists to look open-handedly at evidence like the precipitation-induced weathering on the body of the Sphinx, for example. This is something that really should be taken more seriously by archaeology than it is, and which speaks to that ancient time between 12,800 and 11,600 years ago, like the astronomy of the Giza Plateau, like the equinoxial orientation of the Great Sphinx and the constellation of Leo. There's just so many things which our archaeologist friends just dismiss and say, well, that's not evidence, so we don't need to look at it. I mean, therefore, I've spent the last 30 years, you know, written a series of enormous books, many of them with as many as 2,000 footnotes, carefully referencing everything. And they just write me off as a pseudo-archaeologist and won't even look at the evidence that I present and say, I should present peer-reviewed papers. Well, who are my peers? I'm not an archaeologist. I'm never going to be an archaeologist, so they're not my peers. I don't know who my peers are. My peers are the public. I write my books for the public. The public are grown-ups. They can make up their own mind, you know. Well, have you been following any of the controversies surrounding the James Webb telescope? Have you noticed that there is a strange synchronicity, a connection between the pushback that you're getting regarding the origin of human beings or the age of human culture and the age of the universe? I don't know if you've been following any of this, but... No, I haven't. I've been so absorbed in my own corner of the universe that I've missed this. Tell me about that. Well, it's, you know, again, not a cosmologist here, but I do love this sort of thing. And apparently there is a few articles have popped up in this regard, which has something to do with a problem in what the James Webb telescope is picking up. The idea being we're going to look back to the beginning of time, meaning that we should be looking at, you know, preformed galaxies. We're looking far enough back. We should be seeing the soupy. I don't know what the stuff is. I don't know. But the images that are coming back seem to be fully formed galaxies. Now, this, based on the 13.7, 14 billion-year-old time frame, based on the... This is the supposed big bang, yeah. Yeah. This kind of messes up the whole potentially, like, our idea of what the age of the universe is. We know it is. Now, Anne, when this... I love it. People are pushing back. You know, obviously there's a really vitriolic, controversial pushback from, you know, physicists and cosmologists saying, no, no, no, you got it all wrong. It's just... It's something to do with the telescope. Yeah, because they're invested in the old model. They're invested in the previous model. Right. That's where the parallel... I absolutely see the parallel with what's happening here. So, as above, so below. Yeah, exactly. It's interesting that the implication is that the universe is just older and older, because that's my sort of pet saying, my kid's made a T-shirt for me. You know, stuff just keeps on getting older. I love it. And that is, you know, the point about that is that as we push these horizons back further and further and further, it becomes more and more ridiculous to suggest that civilization is just an artifact of the last 6,000 years. You know, we've got these vast expanse of time. Anatomically, modern humans have been around for more than 300,000 years. You know, why did we take so long? And, you know, secondly, the other thing I think it's important to be clear on is, I don't think we're looking for a civilization like our own. I think it's different. I think they were masters of geometry and of astronomy and of particular spooky kinds of construction, which we cannot replicate today. They navigated the world. They explored the Earth. They understood the shape of the Earth. They understood what the Earth is. They understood the place of the Earth in space. But they, you know, they weren't making cell phones and flying around the Earth in airplanes, in my view. It was more a spiritual-based civilization, I think, that we're looking for. And that's not just an intuition. That comes from years of research into the sacred literatures of many, many different cultures. Do you think that, you know, whatever the academic competitiveness is or whatever weird points I guess some of these archaeologists must get for, like, feeling like they got one over on you or whatever that may be? Isn't there something deeper that makes people recoil a little bit from that possibility? Isn't there, and this is what I, you know, there was, maybe I was like, I don't know, maybe I was too relaxed when I was watching this, taking too much medicine when I was watching your incredible documentary. But I found there to be something so sad, especially in the last few episodes, something so poignant and so almost unbearable about the reality that here were these beings, these people who spent so much energy erecting these incredible monuments, aligning these monuments with, you know, the Pleiades and the clearly in tune with the universe as a whole, clearly sending some kind of message. And all that's left are these barely discernible etchings on these ancient ruins. I just, it was sad to me. Do you think some of the pushback is that that there's something tragic about the reality of where we are as humans in the universe? Yeah, although the phrase is borrowed in part from Velikovsky's Mankind in Amnesia, I kind of adapted it in Fingerprints of the Gods and spoke of humanity as a species with Amnesia. And I think it's characteristic of Amnesia to have trauma. You know, there's a trauma at the heart of the Amnesia. And I think we are, I think we are, this is just my personal view. I can't prove this, but I think we're a traumatized species. Something really bad happened around 12,800 years ago. And that's just a blink of an eye ago in the human story. It's just not that long ago. It seems like a long time, but it's not. 12,800 years ago, something really bad happened. And we know it was bad because we can see from the climate records that the radical things that happened on the Earth, the sudden rises in sea level, the plunging global temperatures, everything is very, very weird. The extinction of animal species, those great megafauna of the Ice Age, all die out at this time. There's evidence of massive disruption of human populations. Clearly something very, very bad happened. And the evidence is that it affected a very large proportion of the Earth's surface from North America down as far south as Antarctica and as far east, at least as Syria. So you've got this huge swathe of the Earth's surface that was subjected to a catastrophic event. And I think that the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis, which is a mainstream hypothesis, although it's a hotly disputed one, put forward by about 100 leading scientists, that this hypothesis best explains what happened 12,800 years ago, that we ran into the debris stream of a disintegrating comet. And there were multiple impacts, some of them on the North American ice cap, which was then about two kilometers deep. There were multiple air bursts, objects that weren't big enough to hit the Earth, but that exploded in the sky, maybe 100 meters in diameter, all over the Earth. And this caused that sudden radical shift in climate, sudden rise in sea level, and all the extinctions that took place at that time. And if there was ever a moment when a civilization could be lost from the human record, that's it. That's exactly the time. And it's a time that then goes, it lasts for 1200 years, it's not a moment, it's an episode, and it ends equally suddenly, equally cataclysmically, 11,600 years ago. And that's when sea levels shoot up even faster than before. It's called Meltwater Pulse 1B. And I've made this point many times before because people, archaeologists, roll their eyes when you mention the word Atlantis. I have no idea why that eye-rolling reaction has come into place, because Atlantis is one of hundreds of stories that have come down from us, to us from the ancient world of a great global flood that destroyed an advanced civilization. And the story of Atlantis has a peculiarly excellent pedigree, since it comes down to us from Plato, who said he got it through his family line from his ancestor Solon, the Greek lawmaker who visited Egypt in 600 BC and was given the story of Atlantis there. And the bottom line is that when Solon in 600 BC asked the Egyptian priests, when did this happen? When was this great civilization submerged beneath the sea? And they pointed to inscriptions on the pillars of a temple, and they said 9,000 years ago. So that's the date. That's 9,600 BC. That's 11,600 years ago. That's Meltwater Pulse 1B. That is the cataclysmic end of the Younger Dryus and of the Ice Age. And it's also the date that Gobekli Tepe is suddenly created in Turkey, just pops up out of nowhere, the largest, most sophisticated megalithic site on Earth. So, you know, I think for archaeology, just to ignore all this and say, actually, we don't accept any of this as evidence, we have nothing to discuss with Hancock. It's just metaphysics is really slippery. What is the explanation for that? This is one of the thoughts that popped into my head watching your show is, why do we suddenly irrelevantize what cultures are saying by saying, oh, that's myth. That's not real. Those are folk stories. What is that? How do they rationalize that? Why does that make sense? It's incredibly arrogant. And it's, again, because they can't sort of weigh it and measure it and count it in the way that you can a pot shirt or a fragment of bone. There is really no archaeology of ideas and myths have traditionally been not taken very seriously by archaeology and often completely ignored by archaeology. And yet, they're really the only memory we have of the time of darkness out of which civilization emerged. We have no other memory apart from these myths. And these myths universally speak of a global cataclysm. They speak of an enormous flood. They speak of serpents in the sky. They speak of huge fires of earthquakes. These are very excellent and precise descriptions of what happened to the world during the Younger Dryas. And I have no doubt in my mind that the myths have a bearing on that and that they are a memory of that. And that certain sites, like Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, were designed to preserve that memory in stone and to pass it down to the future. Our next partner has created a wonderful supplement that my body adores. I started taking athletic greens because I'm not a vitamin person. I just can't pull it off. My wife can.

I have no doubt in my mind that the myths have a bearing on that and that they are a memory of that. Certain sites like Gobekli Tepe in Turkey were designed to preserve that memory in stone and to pass it down to the future. It's really, I don't want to say criminal, but it's really a vile thing. When you think of these, you know, these sites is like a message in a bottle floating across the temporal ocean and landing to where we're at. And then to say, it's almost as though to take the last bits of data from a lost civilization and say, well, they're all like babies. That was just baby talk. Like when my kids make stuff up, that's not real. That's just baby talk, the whole civilization. And yet somehow you have to square that with. But these people who are doing baby talk were building these astounding structures that we can't replicate today. But they were basically human babies, making no sense babbling about the stuff in the sky, spending countless years constructing these things, putting these petroglyphs in. To me, that's where the two, I don't understand how archaeologists square these two things. I don't get it. It doesn't make sense. Part of the mission of archaeology, and perhaps there's some reason for this. I don't know deeply ingrained in the DNA of archaeology, but part of the mission of archaeology is to drain all mystery out of the past. To leave the past completely empty of mystery, like a husk of an insect that's been sucked dry by a spider. So there's just nothing left at all. Just stuff that you can weigh, measure and count, deprived of all meaning or purpose. That seems to me to be part of the mission of archaeology. And it may have something to do with a sort of early rejection of superstition or religious ideas. I don't know, but it's got ingrained now where the project seems to be, let's demystify this in any way we can. Rather than saying, actually, this is an extraordinary mystery. Let's try and understand it and see what's going on. The Great Pyramid is an example. The Great Pyramid of Giza is an incredibly mysterious structure. Nobody's ever successfully explained how it was built, or even what it is. It's amazing precision, the scale of the structure, the mathematics within it, the geometry, the astronomy within it. It's never really been explained, and yet archaeology just wants to reduce it to the tomb of a megalomaniac pharaoh. It really has no more to say about it than that. Because somehow that's considered more, I don't know, safer and more reasonable than saying, well actually, would they really have aligned a six million ton monument with a 13 acre footprint within three sixtieths of a single degree of true north to make the tomb for a pharaoh? And by the way, no pharaoh was ever found in there anyway, or in any of the other Egyptian pyramids. It's this tendency to deprive the past of mystery. And I think archaeologists are also losing contact with the public in this way. Because we all know in our hearts that the past is mysterious, that there are huge unsolved issues in the past. And we cannot accept this so-called scientific priesthood. Again, I hesitate to call archaeologists scientists, but I don't hesitate to call them priests. They're a sort of priesthood of their discipline. And they are supposed to be the sole guardians of the past, and we must have their permission in order to speak about the past, and we must speak about the past in a way that they tell us to speak about the past. And if we don't do that, then they'll do their best to inhibit us from doing so. The recent example of that is that I and my film crew were banned from filming at Serpent Mound in Ohio. Unbelievable. And I've seen now that the Ohio History Commission's connection is trying to deny that and say that we weren't banned. But unfortunately, they put it in writing. They sent us an email banning us. And the email banning us states the specific reason for banning us is not to protect the site. It's not because it's a sacred site. It's because my ideas about the past do not conform with those of mainstream archaeology. So I've had to put that because there's so many lies being told about this. I've had to put that email up on my website. It's the latest entry in my blog on my website. It's called For The Record. And it shows the email specifically banning us from filming at Serpent Mound. If anybody hears a rumor that we weren't banned at Serpent Mound, just go check out that email from Serpent Mound itself. From the Ohio History Commission, which runs Serpent Mound. Unbelievable. And also, I'm sorry, but that's a really cool thing to be banned from Serpent Mound by scientists because they disagree with you. I'm sorry. You can't get cooler than that. Like, I can get being banned because you're some drunk. I wasn't able to stop us completely because there are such things as drones, you know? Yes. So we were able to do quite a lot and people have adjoining properties where we could fly the drones from and we managed to do quite a bit. But it's nevertheless, it's just a feeling of this censorship of ideas that's taking place. Of course, they can't stop me talking about Serpent Mound, but they wanted to inhibit the manner in which I could talk about it by making it as difficult as possible for me to be on site and to be there, which is what I like to do. So it is definitely a form of censorship and rather an effective one, actually. Okay. My final question for you, Mr. Hancock. And I'm sorry if this seems a little too woo-woo-wee or whatever. I'm sorry. And again, you can shoot it down. All right. Okay. So I'm watching this and realizing in the face of all this adversity from, you know, the priesthood of archaeology. That there's an intensity to your work. And to me, it feels like a sense that these people, whoever they were, that they just need someone to be their voice, someone to be their mouthpiece, someone to transmit this information that they were trying to encode in a way that it would last for as long as it possibly could. Yeah. Now, that might just be in my head. I don't know if that's in yours, but if you were that or if they had a message for us. Well, first of all, I'd like to say I'm not that. I've had the privilege to be one of a group of people who've spoken up over the last 30-plus years about things that are missing in the story of our prehistory. And so I want to pay tribute to John Anthony West, the late, great John Anthony West, who was the first to draw attention to the water weathering issue on the Sphinx. Professor Robert Shock of Boston University, who cued us to him for speaking out, even though he has an academic position and confirming that the geology of the Sphinx makes the Sphinx 12,000 plus years old, not 4,000 plus years old, as archaeologists claim. Robert Boval, whose great work on the astronomy of Giza should never be forgotten, the Orion correlation, the connection of that to 10,500 BC. John Major Jenkins, who worked on the Mayan calendar, who sadly passed away, I think is heart broken by the attacks on him by archaeologists. So many of us have worked in this field and are trying to at least put another narrative in front of the public, rather than this dominant monolithic narrative that archaeology has stuffed into our heads from the moment we go to school. And every moment we watch a historical documentary on television. So I'm glad that Netflix broke with the mold and we're willing to broadcast a series with an alternative take on the past. But if these people, and all the people you just mentioned, if there were the ancients, if there was a sort of collective message. Let me mention Randall Carson. I'm sorry, I need to say this as well. Because Randall Carson. Randall is a classic example of, you know, a man whose boots on the ground, he's taught himself everything. He's a master of his subject of the cataclysmic geology of North America. He can take on any PhD any minute in any debate. And again, you know, he's also out there arguing that we have not understood the human past properly, that there is something missing. And we will not be shut down by a bunch of hysterical archaeologists. Hear that hoops. Now, if these people had a message, and I don't know, maybe there isn't some singular message that they have. I don't mean to be that ridiculous, but certainly based on watching your show, they were connected. There is some kind of transfer of information happening among them. What do you think they would have to say to us? What do you think this fabulous interconnected civilization that got wiped out by some kind of cataclysm, what do you think if they could see our culture and what we've achieved? What message would they have for us? I think that message is very clear. I think it's be careful, or you're going to be the next lost civilization. Because we tick all the boxes in ancient mythology for a civilization that the universe cannot abide. We are filled with pride and conceit. We impose our power upon others around the world. We sit back in our arrogance and comfort and ignore the beauty of the planet upon which we live and the universe in which it floats. Ringing phrase from Plato, we have ceased to wear our prosperity with moderation. These are all of the boxes that lost civilizations tick. We have fallen out of harmony with the universe and with one another. That is the message from the past. What has happened before can happen again. We still pass twice a year through the debris trail of that same disintegrating comet. It's called the Torrid Meteor Stream. There are huge objects up there in it. If we were a collective human family and could put our heads together in love and care for the future of our children and our children's children and generations and generations into the future, one of the first things we'd do as a human species would be to sweep the Torrid Meteor Stream clear so that it doesn't any longer pose a hazard to civilization on Earth. We're too busy hating each other and fearing each other and suspecting each other and being wound up by our leaders to all kinds of horrible actions against one another. I think that's the message of the past to us today. Wake up or you will be the next lost civilization. Graham Hancock, I love you. I love your work. I hope you keep making more shows. You're very photogenic, sir. I don't know if you've been getting that message, but you're great on camera. You're riveting. I hope you keep making these shows and keep writing.

Go to meundies.com forward slash Duncan to get 20% off the softest para underwear this side of paradise. Hello friends. It's me, Duncan Tressel and you are listening to the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast and for those of you who are new to the podcast, the Duncan Tressel Family Hour podcast is also known as America's number one math podcast. I hope you're a fan of math because that's all we do here, math talk all day, all night. We love math and today we're going to be focusing on the strange thing that happens when you put a nine at the end of an imaginary number and subtract it by 7,000 over the root of said number. How when you do that, it opens up a portal to the math realm where for a few seconds you can actually witness the Lord of math plaud, a trembling maggot like larva thing that howls numbers out into the void. These are the numbers that land inside of scientific calculators and if it wasn't for the anguish of plork, we would have no math. Let's get going with the show. Trumbling Lord of maggots, screaming numbers in his mind. If we do enough calculations, our souls will never die. These are the only truths in a world of lies, every number of another name, Lord of flies. Friends in truth, we have such an incredible show for you today that I've actually had to add a synth track underneath me talking about the upcoming show because this show that you're about to listen to is steeped in the occult, one of my favorite topics. This show is not only about the tarot, but about the way ancient symbols imbued with mythical power have made their way into every aspect of modern society. If you're allergic to the occult, my friends, I recommend that you rip those earbuds out and replace them with cloves of garlic because this son of a gun is going to make your occult phobic skin break out in stigmata. Otherwise, stay tuned. We're going to jump right into it after some very quick business. What do you guys think of my new sound bed technique? I was listening to podcasts and realized that a lot of podcasts are using sound beds because when you have a sound bed, it sort of creates the impression that you're on the precipice of some monumental epiphanous moment, some revelation, some new thing, kind of tells you like this is where you should definitely be listening. The sound bed is to a podcast, what the underline is to a book. It's a way to really emphatically declare that this is it. This moment right now, this thing you're hearing at this very moment is supremely important. And if you're a person who has genitals and likes to wear underwear, then this is going to be the most important moment of your life. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by meundies.com. If you go to meundies.com forward slash Duncan, you're going to get 20% off of your first order, an order of the softest underwear that you've ever felt in your life. If you ever wondered what it might be like to be laying naked in some mythological grove and taking a nap and to have a unicorn wander into that grove and wrap its unicorn tongue around your buttocks and groin, then you're going to love meundies because it feels exactly like you are being held in the firm yet mystically soft grip of a unicorn's tongue. I've never felt anything like this before. I'm wearing a pair of meundies right now. They're made from Modal, a fabric that's three times softer than cotton. Cotton can kiss your ass friends because your ass is now being embraced with Modal. If you don't like your first pair, meundies will pay you back and you can keep it for free. Do you realize what that means? Right now, order a pair of meundies. They send it to you. You send them an email or call them say, I don't like these underwear. They feel too good. I'm a puritanical Quaker type and I like my genitals being a constant state of agony, which is why in general the kind of underwear that I wear is made of fire ants whose antenna have been glued together so that they're especially angry and they sting me all day long. I do not want soft, luxurious, king-like or queen-like underwear gently caressing the most sensitive parts of my body. I want to hurt meundies so I don't like these. Meundies, they don't even need, you don't even have to send your underwear back. They don't even have to box up those sweaty, oily things and send them back. You get to keep them, no questions asked. It's essentially a free pair of underwear, but you're not going to want to send them back because they're awesome. I actually know how many pairs of meundies I own because I like them that much. I own four pairs of meundies underwear. Wish I had more. Wish my entire body was constantly covered in meundies underwear. I wish the entire planet was wrapped in Modal. I wish the whole planet was wearing a beautifully designed paisley pair of meundies underwear instead of the current conglomeration of water and gravel and mountains. Make sure you go to meundies.com forward slash Duncan, you'll get 20% off your first order. Friends, I don't recommend stuff that I don't like and I really do like this stuff. If you want to get a great present for somebody or if you just want to get a great present for yourself, meundies is where it's at. A big thanks to all of you who continue to use our very important Amazon link, which is located at DuncanTrussell.com in the comments section of any one of these episodes. It's happening, man. Whether you like it or not, you're about to get sucked into the materialistic updraft of the consensus reality known as Christmas. That means you've got to get some kind of plastic configuration to show people that you love them. And the best way to do that is by going through the Amazon link located at DuncanTrussell.com. Anything that you buy on Amazon, they will give us a very small percentage of and it costs you not a thing. It's a great way for you to support this podcast while stocking up on bits of stuff to give to people and show them that you truly love them. Because you know what? Doesn't show someone that you love them doing something nice for them, calling them, giving them unconditional love. Not anymore, my friends. The only true way to express love in this world is to hand someone something they're going to forget about in a few weeks. That's called materialism and that's the religion of the day. So make sure you go through our Amazon link and celebrate materialism, such a beautiful and wonderful way of life. We also have lots of t-shirts, posters, pins, and I've got some very special limited edition thing coming into the shop. You know what? I'll just say it, even though it's not up there yet because it's getting handmade right now by a genius friend of mine. But we have these new DTFH. It's a limited edition. We only made 10 of these things so far because they take a long time to make. They're handmade. But we have these limited edition, beautiful LED, Duncan Trussell family hour logo lamps that are the most incredible things I've ever seen. I have one sitting here right now. I'm gazing at its beauty, but they take a long time to make. Wanted to get them up in the shop sooner, but keep your eyes peeled for that because we're only going to have a few of them on sale. And here is a big, big announcement. As many of you know, I am moving to New York City and to celebrate that, I'm going to be doing a live DTFH podcast at the Bell House in Brooklyn on January the 17th. If you go to dunkintrussell.com and scroll down underneath upcoming tour dates, you will see a link for tickets there or you can go to the Bell House's website. Today's guest has been a writer on many seasons of adventure time. He also has an incredible graphic novel called forming. He is a brilliant artist and not only that, and he might not like me calling him this, but he is an expert on the tarot and the occult. He's an amazing human. And this conversation is the reason that I love doing podcasts. Everybody please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell family, our podcast, Jesse Moynihan. Maybe it's like too many conflicting ideologies. Jesse, welcome back to the podcast. Thank you. Uh-huh. Thank you. So we got in a phone conversation, what a week ago, a week and a half ago, and we started talking about the tarot and the occult. And I realized that you are someone who is been, apparently does more than dabbles in this kind of stuff. You seem to have a deep understanding of the tarot and how did this all start? Well I'd say, I don't know if I have a deep understanding of the tarot, but I would say that I have an active curiosity in the tarot and in the occult and how it informs my story telling, I think. Ah, okay. So a lot of people say that's one of the main uses for that, is not casting spells or like doing Dr. Strange stuff, but is a kind of way to tune into your creative self. Yeah. Although I am into the casting spells part, but I think it started, my interest in the tarot in particular started because I had a conversation with a friend of mine who's also a comic book artist named Dash Shaw, and we were at a book, LA Times Book Awards or something. I remember it was at this award ceremony. He was a nominated and for some reason he brought up tarot cards and I was reading Manly P. Hall and stuff like that at that time, and Jodorowsky's books and stuff, his like memoirs and that kind of thing. He brought up the tarot and he's like, are you into tarot? And I was like, I mean, I read about it sort of, but I didn't know what it was really except I wasn't familiar with it deeply, and then he explained it to me in this way that made sense to a person who does comics, and he was like, I think if you do comics, this is my memory now of our conversation, but he was like, I think if you do comics, you should be interested in tarot, because it's this like 78 card system that anyway you configure it, it tells a story, and it tells a new story every time, and it gives you insight into yourself, and I think what I got out of from that conversation was that there was this system that was so, it was like created by some insane, you know, collective genius, and it never been accomplished before, and has never been topped since, it's just this amazing work of art that is able to tap into your subconscious understanding, you know, it's like just, I don't know, I keep exploring it and keep trying to learn more and more about it, because the more I learn, the more it blows my mind. What are the theories about the origination of the tarot? There's a lot of theories, and there's a lot of people disproving those theories, so it's hard to know exactly for sure. All I know is that I think the first recorded, the first like record of tarot cards being used or requested by the bourgeois, like, you know, aristocrats being like, make me a deck, whatever, to the local artist, was somewhere in the, I think, either the late 1300s or the early 1400s, and then there's theories about people saying it originated in ancient Egypt and all that kind of stuff. Yeah, that's what I've heard. There's all these theories about that, but those theories were based on a untranslated document. Once the, I think, was it the Rosetta Stone? Whatever, when people were able to translate hieroglyphics, all of those theories sort of like went out the window. Now, some people might be like, fuck you. Like to me saying that or whatever, but that's just based on my research. So all I go with is, my thought is, well, tarot evolved from playing cards, playing cards emerged in that documented, probably have been coming around for years and years earlier, but documented, I think somewhere in the early 1300s is the first someone talking about playing cards and using them and gambling and being like, don't use those things, or whatever. And then after that, tarot emerged. But the imagery in the tarot is based on ancient concepts or ancient archetypes. So you could say, yeah, maybe the cards came into existence around the 1400s, mid 1400s or something, but the ideas within those cards are ancient. And someone, I mean, the interesting thing about you, I wish that we were filming this, you, Jesse brought over one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight decks of tarot cards. And what's interesting about it is there's pretty much in every single deck, the exact same symbols emerge pretty much like variations on them. Yeah, except for in this, this grand Atiello deck, the Egyptian Gypsies tarot. Yeah, that one, that one was developed by this sort of enigmatic character. There was a bunch of people that appeared around the same time who I think this was in the mid 1700s, who sort of reignited interest in tarot cards, not just for card games, because people are using them as card games. And maybe sometimes some people were using them for Carto Manzi. But that guy, the Atiella, who is just his name backwards, that was his like alias. Oh, okay. He, he, him and this guy, Pappas and this guy, what was his name? Court de Goblin, Court de Goblin, I don't know how to say his name. Yeah, they pushed this theory that the tarot was this magic system that could divine the future. And, and so he reinterpreted those cards to, to, to, um, to work in conjunction with the cabala and all this, the grand Atiella, this was for Carto Manzi. Yeah, that was for dividing the future. That, you know, he became a superstar in that, in that scene, you know, or he created that scene. Well, what, okay. It's when I've heard, this is what I heard about the tarot, uh, at Burning Man. Yeah, sure. So what I heard is that, and I thought it was really cool is that the idea is, so there was this, the library of Alexandria. Yeah. And there's all this information in there. Yeah. Or like ancient wisdom traditions that no longer exist on this planet. And there was a, has been a concerted effort to wipe this information out of the popular consensus reality for some reason or another. It's, because it's too powerful or it, it takes your eyes away from the king and turns your eyes in the direction of the transcendent or something. Who knows the varying reasons. Yeah. Just control its power. So they wanted to figure out a way to take the information that they could remember from the library of Alexandria, from this world religion or world philosophy and condense it down and hide it. And so they thought the best way to hide it is make it seem like a card game. Yeah. So then people would just think, Oh, people are just playing cards. It doesn't really mean anything, but embedded within these cards is the wisdom of the ages. That's not what I heard. You don't think that's it? I mean, that goes back really far. I don't know. Uh, I think, I think the images, I mean, the image, those images have, uh, have, have, have lasted the test of time. You know, the images that are in there are, are these eternal today. You look at these old images that, you know, of popes and of death and, you know, towers being hit by lightning and stuff. This is all these ancient, old, old images, but today we still identify with them for some reason, right? You don't have to update them to be like computers or whatever. Like your iPhone is a new, I mean, people do, do those cards. I don't like them. Yeah. Yeah. I usually don't like the modern tarot cards. They're annoying. Like I prefer the, what I love about, I mean, let's just grab the card on the top of the deck here, the chariot. Yeah. And that's the Arthur Edward weight deck that you're, which is that this seems to this version of the Arthur Edward weight deck. This is, I've never seen this. It's a different back than what I've seen. I don't know. Usually, but so this, um, the chariot card, what I love about it is, yeah, I can kind of intuit from looking at it, maybe what, what the card means, but when you start reading about it, I mean, I'm sure you could tell me, can you talk about what, can you describe the card to the listeners and then talk about what all the different pieces mean? Yeah. There's a guy, there's a knight and he's, he's got this armor with two moons, um, on him and one is, one is usually one is frowning and one is smiling. And, and he's coming out of a block of concrete. He's not sitting in the chariot. He's like a part of the chariot. So he's like emerging out of a square, basically. And his arms are on the square, like a triangle. So that's the, the, the symbol, you can read into it as a symbol of the triangle over the square. It's, it's sort of like spirit trying to move away from the material, material world or like having the ambition of high, this high minded ambition of transcendence, you know, and he's being his, in the, in this deck, it's, it's ambiguous what the wheels are doing exactly, but in the Marseille deck, the older deck, the one, um, that emerged in around the, I think 1500s, the wheels are basically embedded in the ground. And, uh, so that's supposed to mean, well, or it's not supposed to mean anything can mean whatever you want, right? But to me, that means that the chariot, the groundedness of the square in the earth and his move, his movement isn't determined by the wheels of his own chariot. He's actually a part of the planet, the planet's moving in the celestial sky, you know, so his energy is the grounded energy is like planetary, you know, so it's a really powerful car. The chariot is planet earth. Yeah. Uh, or moving with the cosmos, you know, you're, you're, you're not, it's, it's not like a guy, it's a much more powerful than an individual, uh, single individual. I never knew that about the chariot. I've always thought that as a guy riding a chariot, I never noticed that, that, and that's what's, so to me, this is messy. The car, this is what's so beautiful about these things is that there's also, he's being not to interrupt you, but he's being pulled, but in that car, he's being pulled by two Sphinxes, right? Yeah. And who are sitting, they aren't, they're stationary. So they're not going anywhere. And one is black and one is white and you can interpret that as a passive and active, uh, principles, uh, you know, the decision you have to, decisions you have to make in life, being either a witness or a participant or, you know, both not value judging either of those things, you know, but it depends on what the question is and all that kind of stuff. There's a sort of like, what is that called? The, the flying eye, the side of the globe and the, the wing globe. Yeah. That's it. Like an ancient, uh, Egyptian symbol right above this top, this like, yeah, that's like the, um, what I understand that is, is a sexual, uh, unity of like man and women, like, uh, I forget the name of it. I forget the anima and the lingam. Oh, okay. Okay. And what, did they say anything about the city behind the, I can't, I can't remember what the deal is with the city behind it. I, it really depends on, you know, you can look at these cards and not know anything about them and be able to read them, you know, depending on your intuition and the, the questions being asked. So you don't have to like know everything about, but, but every card is a meditation. Like what's cool about it is it is definitely condensed data. Like every single card, these are, you know what it is? These are like the old punch cards that people used to put into computers. You know, it's like, that's what it does for the human mind when you start just that idea of like the passive, the active, don't value judge either one of these. This chair, the chair, it's not even moving. Then you get into like the illusion of movement, like the idea of like what, cause I already, the, the, the card already tricked me for my entire life. The cards been tricking me. Well, me too, man. The more I, I do research on these cards, I've been cross-referencing, referencing a little, cause I'm working on my own deck, right? As a means of understanding the cards better. And so each deck, I, I have a bookshelf of books that I cross, reference all the different theories about what the meanings are, what the origins are of the images and like how they developed over time into the, that rider weight is, is a far development beyond like the original. They call that the esoteric deck and the original like Marseille deck, or it's not the original, but it's like the first mass printed deck. They call the exoteric deck. So it's, there's all this stuff on the surface. It's less imbued with occult imagery, you know, the Marseille deck. Whereas the Arthur weight deck is, has so much like the, um, the cherry deck in the Marseille is just two horses. It's not two sinks is like, for example. Um, but you can still, I read, I personally read from the Marseille deck because I feel like it's more open. Um, you can, there's a lot more freedom to interpret for, for me, for me anyway. Oh, that's cool. So you don't like the, the, there's too many symbols in this deck for you. To me, I think some of the, there's too many esoteric symbols in the deck and that, and if you're like me, like a book nerd or whatever, then I get so, I just want to know what everything means and, and, um, and I get bogged down in that kind of thing. I think, uh, it's, it's more fun for me to read from the Marseille deck because there's, it's, there's less, there's less information, but there's more you can, no, I won't put a value judgment, but, um, I will say about the, when I was researching the Chariot card, what I found really interesting, I got fascinated with the, the, his armor and he's got these two moons on his, um, um, shoulders, uh, one frowning one smiling. And I read in Arthur Waits book, um, he compared it to, um, the, uh, he called it about, wait, Jason and Boaz, Boaz and Jason. The pillars in Freemasonry? Yeah. Yeah. And also he compared it to the jeweled, uh, chest piece, chest plate that the old, um, Jewish priests used to wear when they would consult God. And I got really fascinated with that because there's only one mention of it in the Bible and, and, and, but I remember when I was a kid, it's hard to go off on a tangent, please, when I was a kid, my parents used to read to me, um, Christian fables and stuff, although we're illustrated, you know, and they would show the Pharisees, uh, with these chest plates. And that to me was the most interesting part of the story. I was like, what is the deal with those chest plates? Is that armor or is that a computer? You know, and, um, and, uh, it turned out that there are these jewels on this plus dress, um, chest plate. They used to consult when they'd ask God a question, depending on how the light shown through the jewels, it would be a yes or no answer. Right. And, uh, so that, uh, he was equating to those yes or no on his shoulders, but also I heard recently that Darth Vader, then maybe this is why I connected with it, because I liked Star Wars when I was a kid. Yeah. Darth Vader has that chest plate. Whoa, shit. That's cool. Right. Darth Vader has that same, it was intentional. So what I heard is it was intentional. And there's actually Hebrew on his, if you look at the costume now, maybe, I may be wrong. Someone told me this recently. Yeah. Whoever designed his costume designed him to be like a Pharisee. I love this. Yeah. No, this is to me what my, what I'm not even, I, you can even say I dabble in this stuff, especially after talking to you. I just think it's cool and like I love to look at tarot cards and think about it. One of the things that makes it so attractive to me is that this, these symbols have every single one of these symbols is like a fine wine that's been sort of fermenting in stories and philosophies for so long. And we don't know exactly what vineyard these grapes came from is what's interesting and then to make it even more mysterious, it continues to get threaded in to every piece of popular culture. It's, if it's in Star Wars, it's everywhere. Right. Yeah. So that to me is really curious that it's, this is, and this is in the satanic panic, this was what they said was happening. The satanists are putting their symbols inside every motherfucking thing. Man, you know, of course, I don't believe that this is evil at all. But I do think that it has a personality, right? Whatever it is, it has a personality and its personality is to hide. Its personality is to hide and plain sight and plain sight. Yeah. That's the thing. What was I going to say? Oh, that reminds me of when I was working on Adventure Time and someone wrote me an email, a guy who was a mason, free mason, or he was part of, no, he was a ross accrucian, I think. And he wrote me an email because I was putting a cult symbols in Adventure Time and he told me to stop and he was like, don't share this stuff. And it's sacred and dangerous. Can you hold on a second? Yeah. You know, man, that's such an interesting thing that there's somebody out there. Number one, it's cool to know that Rosie Crucians are watching Adventure Time. I think his kid was watching Adventure Time. He's watching it with his kid. He's wearing some like a robe in a chamber with incense burning and he's like, wait, Joshua, turn away. I must write. Did he write it like, is the letter? He wrote it in a very, he wrote it in a very heavy handed way. Tipped or handwritten? No, he wrote me an email. Email. Yeah. And I told him, I told him that all that stuff is there. It's already there. Everyone can has access to it. There's no secrets anymore, really, as far as I know. Did he write back to you? No, he didn't write back to me. I said everything I, you just found like a dead crow in your car seat. Everything I put in Adventure Time, you can find on the Led Zeppelin album cover. You know, it's already been exposed. Well, I'm sure Led Zeppelin got in trouble for that too. Yeah, they did. And that is the other app that, I mean, one thing that you hear again and again when it comes to this stuff is, keep a secret. Don't talk about it. We don't talk about it because something about in the old days, there was power in that. And I think a lot of it's probably, they don't realize why the element of secrecy is there. But I think a lot of it had to do with self-preservation. I mean, these cards survived through a time period where they were incinerating people for talking about this stuff. There was a, one of the, in this book I read about Genghis Khan, they talked about how the Mongols, when they finally made it into Europe, what they found shocking was that people were forced to worship one religion. They thought that was the weirdest fucking thing. And that's Genghis Khan. You know, this is crazy. So this is a, so I think maybe a lot of the secrecy comes more from a kind of evolution, a survival mechanism that happened. Maybe I've been really struggling with this idea of secrecy for about maybe two years. And the value of secrets and whether or not that has value, or whether or not you use, I think it did have value at some point and whether or not it has value now because guys like Arthur Edward Waite, so full of secrets, he writes whole books and you don't get anything out of them because he's so secretive and so frustrating trying to read his material because his books are just criticisms of other people's research and almost no insight into his own thoughts. It's just purely outward. He's like, if you know me, I might let you know what I know. You know, that's sort of his attitude. You know, in the Bhagavad Gita, there is a, one of the verses is don't disturb people with this information. It's just the, I can't remember exactly how the verse goes, but the idea is, look, if somebody isn't ready for this, don't bug them, don't become a missionary. Don't like blast them with this. That's true. But if you are going out of your way to read their book and their book gives you nothing, what is the deal with that? That's what we call a rip off. But I've read other people analyzing his books and then I get illuminated. You know, then I, then I understand where he's coming from, at least in part. I'm reading this guy. What's his name? Robert. It was in a book with Joseph Campbell and him. Shoot, I can't remember his name off the top of my head, but they wrote, they co-wrote a book on the tarot together. And his breakdown of Arthur Edward Waite's ideas is really helpful because if you just read Arthur Edward Waite's books, they're impenetrable. Well, do you know, um, for me, another way to look at the idea of like keeping some of this stuff secret, uh, you know what just happened in Yellowstone, right? No. So in Yellowstone, they have signs that are like, don't go off this path. Yeah. If you go off this path and you stumble in one of these pools, you will die in the most horrific way, the most horrific way, one of the most horrific ways you can on this planet, being boiled alive by nature. Yeah. So recently this kid with his sister, they wanted to do something called, there's a name for it that doesn't sound entirely pleasant called hot. Oh, it's a weird hot poppin or like, uh, hot potato in or something. It's where you go to unauthorized hot springs and sit in it. Yeah. Yeah. So they wander off the trail at night, they go to this, they find a pool, he's standing at the edge of it and there's signs everywhere. Yeah. He's standing at the edge of it. I guess he like wants to see if it's how hot it is to see if you could sit in it. Yeah. Puts his hand in it. Yeah. Stumbles in to boiling water, boiling acid. Yeah. She's filming the whole thing. Oh my God. What? The video is not out there. I look. Thank God. But he, and she couldn't get his body out. Yeah. And so she went back and's like, yeah, you know, we went in and you know, you've got to like, as you're going out, you've got to pass signs. Right. You probably pass a hundred signs that say, don't go here. You'll die. Yeah. So she finally gets to, to, to whoever the park ranger or whatever. And they're like, yeah, it's, you know, we're not going to get his body out tonight. Cause a snow storm had kicked up. Yeah. They came back the next day and he had completely dissolved. Yeah. Nothing left except his flip flop. Jesus. He had turned into Brian. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So there are signs everywhere. So in the same way, when it comes to this stuff, yeah, people say that if you get to the, that if you start spiraling into the singularity of knowing what this is about, you will begin to decode the fundamental, you know, fabric of the universe and, and, and, and, and as you do that, since you're made of the universe, you'll start to unravel yourself and then you're gone. Right. You'll just end up decoding yourself. That's it. That's the goal though. For many people, that's the goal. Yeah. For many people, that's the goal. Yeah. Is that your goal? Uh, I think, well, I think that is the goal of eliminating your fear of death. Right. So you probably want to accomplish that at the end of your life. So you don't go too early because you want to experience fun shit while you're here. You know, so you got time at right. I mean, it's a good trick. If you could do it, it's really cool. And, and, but it is a, I mean, magic will drive you crazy. I know I've, I've come, I've been on the edge of that a little bit. Talk about that. Um, just, I was doing, uh, actually it was a really simple, uh, Kundalini meditation I was doing, uh, for a while because I was going through a heartache or whatever. And this, my healer person gave me this meditation to do, breathing in through one nose and doing this mantra and breathing out the other. What's the mantra? Uh, waheguru, waheguru, wahegiho. And you just, you do it three times. Waheguru, waheguru, waheguru, waheguru, wahegiho. Waheguru, waheguru, waheguru, wahegiho. And you do that before that round four times while you're holding your breath and then you breathe through the other nose. And, um, I did that, I was doing that for a bit until, um, it really like, uh, clears your brain out. So it was helping me a lot because I was like really heart, heart broken, heartbroken at that time. And, um, so I would come out of that meditation feeling like I was riding the crest of a wave, you know, everything was blank, but I felt a momentum underneath me and, um, after I did that for a while, um, I actually had a hallucination where I, um, was surrounded in golden light and, um, I was having two perspectives at the same time. I was a caterpillar and I was hatching out of my, uh, the golden shell. I was like this golden caterpillar and I was also seeing the golden caterpillar at the same time. So I was that thing hatching out, seeing myself and also seeing it hatching out at the same time, my hands were folded like, uh, you know, Egyptian Pharaoh or whatever. And I was like, just experiencing this for a while. I was like, holy fuck, like just, um, this was so cool. You know, I was, I was really like, um, dazzled by the experience. And then as soon as I uncrossed my hands, um, the vision, uh, went away and I was just, um, normal awake, you know, and, uh, that actually, it was a really beautiful hallucination, um, which I've never, I've never had that before, but it also freaked me out. And, uh, I didn't, I never did that meditation afterwards. It was too much for me. Too much. Yeah. See, there it is. Yeah. That's the thing. Cause you realize like, Oh, I only wanted a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not ready for that. Yeah. Yeah. And that's, I think that's a very, you know, that's one of the curious things about being a human being is we don't want it all. Yeah. We, uh, many people say they want it all, but when you start seeing things like that and it fucks with your reality, man, and like it really, um, and you want, you think you're brave enough to handle that, but I, uh, you have to work up to it. I think some people are, they're like, you know, take me out, but I'm not, I'm, I think I'm a, when you earth sign, you know, I need, like, I need to be grounded. Yeah. Well, I mean, you, we, we need to function in the world. Yeah. You know, you can't cross your arms and turn into a caterpillar and, and at Bank of America for some reason. Yeah. But we're, but what starts happening is you, it's kind of, I think a little bit of what virtual reality is going to start doing for people is it's going to give them a lesson really too quickly about the, uh, subjective nature of reality and like, look, instantly you're in another place that isn't real. Now you think this place is real. And I think that, so you sort of, through magic, you're starting to see this, um, you know, you start seeing through consensus reality and you start realizing like, Oh yeah, like, for example, a couple of days ago, um, I got stoned and went to eat ramen down in Pasadena. Have you been to this ramen place in Pasadena? Which one? God, it's called. I haven't. Totsuyotu, new Toto, or it's like, there's lines in front of it. Okay. And I made fun of it before. Like I might, my girlfriend loves ramen. I love ramen. I'm never going to fucking stand in line for ramen. Yeah. Like a fool, like thinking about ramen that you get at the grocery store or whatever, the shareable, like, sure, poverty cubes or whatever. College student. Yes. Yeah. But, uh, so anyway, I'm stoned and I'm like, you know what, I'm going to get some ramen. I don't know why I'm adding the ramen thing in. I guess just cause like I, as I'm eating the ramen, it's so good that it's like making me even more high. And I'm in here. I'm basically entering into this like very powerful altered state at this ramen place. Yeah. And so, but then, so I'm in this great mood and then right across from the ramen place is an, I didn't need to tell the ramen part of the story. I could have cut that out completely, but God Jesus, I'm really in a ramen kick right now. I love ramen, man. The best and the synergy between ramen and edible marijuana is anything on it. So I decided to cross the street to an anthropology for no reason. I'm just going to walk into the anthropology. So talking about like the weirdness of consensus reality and manufactured realities, a store is a man, a manufactured reality where some corporate psychologists have gotten together to try to create a temple of capital. That is a temple. When you go into a store, you are entering into a temple that worships a God and the God, the temple worships is whatever the particular name of the store is. So anthropology is a God that's been summoned up by a corporation. And the form the God takes is the various products. You could say the God of anthropology is the sum total of all the fucking lip balms and little floral baggies and candles that smell like pumpkin pie. And like it all adds together. And then you, so you walk in to this reality bubble. That's what a store is. It's a fucking reality bubble. The music, the way that the people in there are being forced to act, the way they're being forced to dress, the people who work there, those are the priests. When you walk into a retail store, you are in the presence of high priests who are worshiping an entity that they summoned up through their shared attention. And it takes the form of a fucking anthropology, right? And you can feel the spirit itself in the same way. If you go to a Hare Krishna temple, you can feel the spirit of something. And I feel that when I go to moon juice, what's moon juice? It's a juice and other stuff. Everything's super expensive. And the people treat you like you just walked into church. Yes. When you go in there. I've heard of this place. That place in Venice. Is that moon juice? It was one in Silver Lake. This is what is, so you start getting into this stuff, hidden in plain sight. And you begin to realize, well, I mean, this is like one of my favorite, Daniel Johnston lyrics. It goes, there are strange secret cults in every town. I don't know that song. It's a great song. Do you know what song it is? God, I think it's either don't play cards. It was say, Oh yeah. So, but you, so anyway, it's a long way of getting to a point, which is that we think we're living in a normal mythology, mythology free, non occult world. Right. We think in the old days, sure, there were like people in robes and incense and worshiping weird gods in the days of Babylon. But that's all gone now. Yeah. No. Go to downtown Pasadena, walk into an anthropology and you have entered into a temple, a temple where a magical ritual is going on from probably 11am, 10am to 9pm. And that magical ritual is the conversion of your life energy in the form of money in exchange. You get scented candles and like, not only that though, you get a chance to experience the perfect life, right? You know, when you walk in, it's also mundane at the same time, you know, that that's the way that I think about Catholic Church. When you go to a Catholic ceremony, it's so mundane. You go, I'm bored out of, bored of tears when I go to one of those things. Yes. But at the same time, it's so right beneath the surface, it's fucking insane. Well, that's why you got to get stoned when you go to church. And I don't mean that. It's like, yeah, stoner talk, man, let's get stoned and go to church. Really. I mean, that's probably the way they used to do it. It's like you need some kind of psychedelic as the sacrament when you enter into the space to open your mind. And then you really will start picking up, but you don't have to go to Catholic Church. We are living in an age of, you could even say, this is the most occult. This is the, we are in the most occult laden. I don't know how you'd say it. We are in an age, a cult imbued age. You're putting symbols into a cartoon that we don't know their origination point that had been used in secret rituals for thousands of years to the point where Rosie Crucians are writing you emails. Right. Well, I felt like I had a duty to do that actually. It was this opportunity that I couldn't pass up. I felt like I had to put magic in that show, like real magic. Things that you could do. How many seasons did you work on this? I worked from the end of season one until season seven, end of season seven. So any opportunity I had to put something in there that would make a kid think, like maybe that could be real. Maybe I could really do this ceremony or this kind of thing or put symbols in there that had deep ancient meaning. You're not worried about saying, I mean, this is going to end up on what you're saying will more than likely end up on some kind of. That's fine. That's fine. I think I've said, I've said this before somewhere, but I, because I was reacting. I felt like maybe I won't have a chance to do this again. Work on a hit show, you know, everything I do after adventure time will be some underground thing, something, you know, a cult, more cult niche, you know, because I feel like I'm a niche person. I don't feel like I have, I feel like I shouldn't say this if executives are listening, but I feel like, which I don't think they are, but maybe they are. I don't know. But I, I think of myself as a niche person. So I had this opportunity to work on this accidentally hit show. And I was reacting against the materialism that I felt was so prevalent in my circle of, of people I associate with the people progressive left basically is the, that's the people I hang out with. And within that community, I felt anecdotally, I don't think this is always true, especially not so much in LA. I think LA is more a weirdo place where people are allowed to believe weird shit. Yeah. But everywhere outside of that, if you tell someone, like my friends back in Philly, I tell them about five years ago, I, I started getting into tarot and they just give me a weird look. Like I'm crazy, you know, like I'm wasting my time basically. And that's the attitude, this materialist, uh, what do you call it? Not anecdotal, the opposite of an empirical, uh, belief system. And I was using this cartoon in part to tell funny stories and stuff, but also to push my, my personal agenda of pushing magic into the world. And, and, and that people assume that magic is real in this world. It's an example of, uh, something in adventure time that has its roots and magic that you put there. Um, just there, uh, oh, there was a location spell that a peppermint butler used to travel through, uh, the astral plane to find his nemesis or whatever. And I based, I based his, um, I can't remember the quote exactly, but I based his spell based on an Aleister Crowley quote, you know, you know, something he was like really like saying some statement about, um, uh, you know, above and below and all that kind of stuff and as above so below. Yeah. I don't know if that was in there. Oh, I've had magic man say that, uh, you know, the old hermetic idea or whatever. Uh, so things like that. I just wanted to put in the show casually, not call so much attention to them, but have this magic there that kids could take for granted and not, you know, question because I think that magic happens all the time and we are so cynical of when those things happen, when those moments happen that we brush them aside as soon as they happen, we might have an aha moment, you know, this magical moment. I can't explain what just happened. Some phenomenon that just happened and then I immediately go back to that consensus materialist reality and just treat that like a dream. Man, I'll tell you what just happened to me because I think that's an important thing that I think didn't Crowley say you should talk about it. If it works, like that's the one thing you shouldn't keep a secret or you should, you should announce that this spell has worked or that an experiment has worked. Maybe I'm mistaking something. I read somewhere else, but I think that's a good, a friend of mine recently, yeah, uh, needed, needed to borrow like 1500 bucks. And so, uh, I'm like, yeah, that's cool. Cause this is somebody I love and like, yeah, no problem helping you out. So gave him 1500 bucks and then the next day I went to my mailbox and there was a completely unexpected check in my mailbox for $1,498, almost the exact amount that I'd given to this person and to me, that's like, that's magic. That's in that, that's, I know, I mean, it's not that I don't get checks in the mail sometimes, but it's like, certainly not the exact amount that I just gave to somebody. You say that to the materials and I'm like, you remember the hits. We remember the hits. Think of all the times you've given people stuff and you've never gotten the exact same money that you just remembered to have a fucking coincidence. Yeah, and it might be a coincidence, but it's, I really think it all depends on how you think about that stuff. Like it, it comes down to, I, I've been trying to do this, not just study the tarot, but slowly trying to radiate that out into the real world. So I, I don't know, it's not an original idea, but I think the world, I try to think of the world as a living tarot and interpret everything that's happening around me as symbols, you know, and the one moment that really sticks out to me was this moment when I, this is some Hollywood shit, but I like went to an agent. I was thinking about getting an agent and I went to this big cartoon agency and I had a meeting with these two guys and they were selling me on stuff I didn't want. They were saying, we, you can make the next, you can make the next cloudy with a chance of meatballs. I was like, I, you know, I enjoyed that movie, but that's not what I want to make. You know, I don't want to make cloudy. I want to make weird, weird shit that shocks people or whatever, you know, and, and, but I was giving that to myself and the whole time they were like, we were such big fans of, that's what they always say. We're such big fans of your work, blah, blah, blah. And, um, I had this weird feeling in my stomach and I didn't know how to interpret it because I felt like maybe these guys could help me and maybe they wanted to help me, maybe they really liked my work. Yeah, I don't know. And so after the meeting, I sort of felt good about it and sort of mixed, but cautious, you know, and then I got in the elevator and this is right when I was really starting to get into researching the tarot and thinking about the idea of the world tarot or whatever the world around you being interpreted as symbols. And I went down a floor to the lobby, but for some reason, the elevator stopped and I guess maybe someone there had accidentally hit a button or something before me. So I stopped on the floor below their level and the doors open and it was a black hallway. It was all the lights were out and I walked into the hallway and well, immediately I was like, what's going on? Like this is like, I'm, I felt like this was a magic moment or something. I walked into the dark hallway and then the light sensors turned on and there was a huge roach on the wall. And I immediately was like, I'm not working with these guys. And I got on the elevator and went home and I just never called them again. Cause that symbol, something about this, um, that David Lynch blue velvet, you know, when it goes into the grass in the first scene in that movie and there's like this idyllic suburban place and then it goes deep into the grass and there are these insects like fighting each other. And that's how I felt. I had gone the level below them and saw like this underbelly, this toxic underbelly, you know, something like that. I don't know. I mean, I don't want to rip on those guys. Maybe they were nice guys, but that was my interpret that activated something that I already felt in me, but I wasn't acknowledging. Yeah, right. And so it wasn't like it was, it was illuminating something that was already there and that's how I, that's how I also feel about tarot cards. I don't try to read the future or anything like that. I just try to understand myself through them. Right. Yeah. And that is the, you know, we were talking on the phone about this, the, the, you know, if you want to change the color of a fountain, you don't try to die the drops coming out. You would start at the base of the fountain, which is the present moment. The future comes from the present. So yeah, shining a light on whatever the particular pattern is that you're really, you're, you're, it's more like you're shining a light on the, I guess you could say the, the window or the lantern that is yourself that's, you know, projecting a world into this dimension and seeing, you know, what the formations are at that moment with tarot, you know, cause yes, something's going to stick out with every single card. Like I could just randomly pick any card at all. The two of, two of swords. Tell me what this means. I mean, it really depends on the question. You know, just the symbols. What are the, I mean, there's like two is duality, you know, so it, it, it could be about a decision being made, you know, between choices or something or, or split or it could also mean two people coming together, you know, to the opposites. And there's a, um, this one is interesting because it's the weight and I don't read from the weight, but it's like a blind lady sitting on a bench and I'm sure this is imbued with tons of meaning. There's a moon, so that means like, uh, sort of like a more, uh, receptive intelligence and, uh, I don't, I don't know. It really depends on what, what the question is. Well, I would think just from what you're saying, it makes me think of like what an impending thing I'm doing. I'm moving to New York. So like I will apply that stuff like, oh, decisions and dualities and like to, um, the unknown herb, she's blindfolded. I don't know what's going to happen, but, um, the point is like any, any of these things can like help you begin to excavate and then you can get even lower and deeper and then you start hitting, you know, the, the fear place through these cards, you can start like banging up against the thing you're trying to ignore with the cards, which is always uncomfortably awesome. Actually, that makes me remember now that the reason why I started doing, doing that world tarot kind of like, um, idea was because actually was influenced by my parents who were super, were super Christian when I was growing up and they were always communicating with what they, what they called God and God was giving them signs all the time. They would see signs on, on a license plates and stuff like that. And they would make their decisions based on those things, you know, like where to move her that in my mom, remember almost got hit by a car one time and then she saw a license plate that was like a vanity plate or something said blue something and she was like, Oh, we got to move to the Blue Ridge Mountains. Something like that. You know, that was God telling me that I love that. Yeah, I love that too. That, you know, that's, I grew up with that. So that, that way of, that way of logic makes sense to me. It seemed to work for my, I could see it working for them in a practical way, in a pragmatic way. And so it's that thing where if it works, just do it, you know, you don't have to, it doesn't have to make sense within your peer group, you know, depending on who your peer group is, well, then if your peer group is the one that you're using to make your decisions, then your peer groups of fucking vanity license plate, you know, if that's what you're using, if, if like, you're, then that's your God. I mean, this is a, um, this is one of the, uh, in the, in the Bhagavad Gita, this is, uh, one of the verses actually was going to put into the last episode. It's one of my, it's for chapter seven is my favorite chapter in the Bhagavad Gita currently. And chapter seven is Krishna saying those who worship the demigods go to the demigods and whatever it is that you place your attention upon that thing, I will become basically is what God says. So I, I will, your, your God, whatever it may be, is like a swimming pool inflatable raft and what it gets inflated with is the energy of Krishna. And so the form that it takes, whether it's a fucking statue of, um, Buddha or whether it's, uh, Ananth, Ananthra, or whether it's your lover or your job or your career or your fear of death or your identity as an atheist or your identity as a theist, the energy in what it's holding it up is Krishna taking off. Like, Oh, you want me to wear this costume? Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So it's cool. And I think that when you begin to, um, free yourself, like you're saying from this, the terrible manacles of worrying about what you're fucking intellectual, goddamn intellectual friends think, whether what they think is for better or for worse, that's their thing. And it's fine. But Jesus God, God help you. Yeah. God help you if you're letting, if you're letting the opinions of people around you, because you know, the thing is like, look into yourself. I mean, you, you might not be a confused person, but I'm fucking a lot of the time. Oh, me too. Yeah. Unbelievably confused. Yeah. I'm confused a lot. Just confused. And like, and then when, and when I contemplate like notions of myself, who am I? What am I? What, what's going on here? Yeah. Like, who do I think I am? Right. And then that always gets very confusing. Yeah. So that's how I feel. And when I've talked, and now you say you're confused sometimes. Sure. Yeah. Deep confusion. And then when I talked to him, to like some of my closest friends, they are definitely fucking confused. I think people are, there are people who are much more confused than me, but yes, like to a debilitating degree. So, so when you realize that the odds are pretty good. Yeah. To that person who's like laying, laying down the materialist POV on your ass secretly at night, as he's falling asleep or she's falling asleep or whatever. She's freaking the fuck out too. Right. I don't know what I am. I'm, you know what I mean? I'm, I know I'm depressed. Yeah. I know I have to, I'm not this, I'm not, I don't feel depressed, but a lot. Like, I remember just talking to a materialist friend and I'm not saying there's any kind of correlation here, but you know, we got in this whole conversation about the validity of science versus what we're talking about. And like, you know, the usual, it was exciting for me. I like getting smackdowns from the materialists. I got, I got smacked down from materialists quite a bit. Yeah. But then towards the end of the smackdown, you know, yeah, he was talking about how many fucking medications he's on because of his terrible, terrible depression. Yeah. Yeah. And it's like not to say that your materialism or atheism is making you depressed or whatever, but the, whatever the thing is that you are worshiping is clearly maybe not creating the kind of harmony in your life that you would, you would like necessarily if that thing that you're worshiping is the very surface level of the universe, which is a quite beautiful thing. Yeah. The atoms, the deepest levels, the, the quarks, the, then this fundamentally mysterious things that are underneath the quarks or whatever. Right. That's cool. But yeah, I like to romanticize that. I mean, I think they should, but they, a lot of them, them, sorry, but they, they, I hear a lot of scientists who put those, I, those, they're, those investigations into a sublime context, you know, in order to replace the revelation of, of religion or spiritual belief. And I think it's a noble effort, but I, I don't think that it is a direct replacement. I think that those things can exist. Those things need to exist. The material investigation is totally valuable and very, you know, I, I value it highly and I respect the people who that's their thing. You know what I mean? But I think that it can't replace revelation. Can't replace the, that energy fill that you get from having a transcendental experience. You know what Alex Gray calls it? Yeah. I'm going to say it wrong. A theophany. Okay. Yeah. You know, like a sudden realization of God or a sudden realization of a, of a, of a spirit that is not impersonal. Yeah. Oh, wow. There's nothing better than that, man. There's nothing better than we're even fraying as fraying is that, or, or as, you know, I mean, as an ultimate awe inspiring as, as, as that, you know, well, it's a game of hide and seek with Krishna. Yeah. You know, that's why I love the, the symbol of Krishna because it's a little, you know, it's a boy most of the time, a little kid and you're a little kid too. And this whole thing is like a, a fantastic game of hide and seek with the unit, with the, with that, which all things originate from, and it's hiding inside itself right in front of you and your friends and your dogs and your cats in moments of intuition, where you have some great realization. I love that. That makes me so happy. And then I love praying to it and I love thinking about it. And I love, wait, you know, I've been doing this so much more lately too. Um, going to bed, praying, waking up, praying, and then doing prayers for the confusion. You ever do that prayers for a confused, not for the confusion, but when you're in the midst of like, so, okay, so I've, I mean, like in my most desperate moments, yeah, saying thank you for the, so like, you start getting into this place, realize like, okay, the process is this, we'll just make it up. Let every phenomena that comes into your life is like a cube of energy or something, right? It doesn't have to be a cube. You make it whatever shape you want. Sure. So here comes, I think I'm lazy. Yeah. Okay. So I think I'm lazy. He's coming down the conveyor belt of the mind and you as this alchemist, as it comes down, can actually instantly transform it by being like, thank you God for letting me have a mind that can be aware that I think I'm lazy. Thank you. Just for that experience of being able to think that I'm lazy. Thank you. Just for that. Thank you God for this experience of when you get paranoid, thank you God for this experience of paranoia for giving me the ability to protect myself in this way or to think, but you just start focusing so it takes, immediately takes your mind off the weighty, always ever changing, never ending like a cat with a laser light being shined at you from the universe. It immediately moves your eyes from the laser point to that, which is shining the laser, right? I've never done that. It feels great. It's a really, you'll forget to do it. Yeah. But because I had this dream where I was, um, I was in, it was a really cool dream, but in the dream, I was like just walking in a field or something and some dream place and I started that like saying, it's like weird gratitude prayers. And when I did that, this energetic form would like appear over my head that looked like the top of a mosque or something. Like just like, you know, archetypal, like sacred geometry. Just like immediately just forms like, oh, like whenever I say thank you to the universe, it makes these things appear in dreamland. So anyway, I've been doing that experiment with some, um, with a lot of success. And when you don't feel like saying thank you, you even say thank you there too. Like you can just start thanking the universe for every single thing. I think I forget to do that a lot actually. Easy to forget. Yeah. I think cause I'm on, I'm in a, I'm in a constant state of, uh, protecting myself, you know, so it's, it's hard to, when the, the hits come, it's, it's hard to turn that around and, and, and like you do, like thank your, your consciousness for being able to even register that kind of stuff, uh, paranoia and that anxiety. Yeah. I was reading in this Houston Smith book, there's like all these, I guess. Aspects of God are, are perfect aspects of God. And one of them, the, the, the things which are good, fundamentally good. What is fundamentally good? And one of the things in, according to this, that is fundamentally good is existence itself, fundamentally good to exist. It is better to exist than not to exist. So it's fundamentally good to exist. So just that creates a baseline to give thanks for it. Just, okay. I just get to feel this now. This is incredible. You know, can I read something to you? Sure. Yeah. Have you ever read, um, Victor Frankel's man search for meaning? No. Okay. Check this out, man. I'm going to read this to you really quick. The, so this is like a guy who is in Auschwitz and he's being, um, he's being like marched in the morning on some kind of death march. And with, and he's like standing next to somebody else. They're being marched to do work. And the uphold by fucking Nazis, a man marching next to me whispered suddenly, if our wives could see us now. I do hope they're better off in their camps and don't know what is happening to us. That brought thoughts of my own wife to mine. And as we stumbled on for miles, slipping on icy spots, supporting each other time and again, dragging one another up and onward, nothing was said, but we both knew each of us was thinking of his wife. Occasionally I looked at the sky where the stars were fading and the pink light of the morning was beginning to spread behind a dark bank of clouds. But my mind clung to my wife's image, imagining it with an uncanny acuteness. I heard her answering me, saw her smile or Franken encouraging look. Will or not, her look was then more luminous than the sun, which was beginning to rise. A thought transfixed me for the first time in my life. I saw the truth is it is set into song by so many poets proclaimed as the final wisdom by so many thinkers, the truth, that love is the ultimate and highest goal to which men can aspire. Then I grasped the meaning of the greatest secret that human poetry and human thought and belief have to impart. The salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world still may know bliss, be it only for a brief moment in the contemplation of his beloved in a position of utter desolation, when man cannot express himself in positive action. When his only achievement may consist in enduring his sufferings in the right way, an honorable way, in such a position, man can through loving contemplation of the image he carries of his beloved, a chief fulfillment for the first time in my life, I was able to understand the meaning of the words, the angels are lost in perpetual contemplation of an infinite glory. Yeah. That's a, that's how I've been feeling a lot lately about, you know, all the shit that's been going on with, uh, no, I don't want to get too deep into the, it's okay. Go ahead. No, I feel like I'm going to dig myself a grave because you're going to talk. Everyone's been talking about Westworld on the podcast. Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, I really think that, that dude is a robot. That cowboy. No, go ahead. Go ahead. It's that this is that, that thing that he's talking about is the thing I've been trying to achieve in myself for as long for, I guess, since my mid 20s is this, and in the Bhagavad Gita, they, they, they call it the, the three gunas, right? Yes. Is it gunas or junas or, uh, I've heard it pronounced goons. Yeah. Yeah. But I always say goonas. You could say, okay, but you know what I'm talking about. The, it's probably junas. Who knows, you know, whatever three modes, the three modes, one being chaos, right? And like being lost in the tides of your environment, like how being completely affected by everything that happens around you, being like having no power. Motive ignorance. Yeah. And then the other one is being, um, being on the roller coaster of life, having those highs and lows, and which is in the state that most people are in, right? Yes. Um, that are like normally, normal functioning people mode of passion. Yeah. Mode of passion where, uh, and then the, the, the highest mode, which is you're easily toppled from once you acknowledge that you're in that mode or whatever is goodness, right? Is, is being this, that Buddhist, whatever, compassionate detachment where you're not affected by the, the, the, the hurricanes of life, yes. You know, and to me, like that third one is the one I, I really try, uh, have been working slowly, working towards, uh, in order to tame my reality, you know, and not be bolder when, when, uh, when a guy, you know, horrible, like homophobic, you know, like Mexican hating president because I'm president. I'm not walking around, um, completely fucked. And surrounds himself with like a cabinet of just monsters. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, so I've seen, like this is just this thing that I've seen for my friends as an example of, of that description, you know, of where you walk into a cafe and you're like, how's your day going? And they're like, how do you think that? Yeah. And then you have to, you have to, um, you, you have to participate in that drama. Well, you have to help them not worship the demigod. It's like, cause when we worship a demigod, we don't just worship the demigod through like giving the demigod flowers or pouring honey on some statue. Well, the way we worship the demigod that is Trump is with our fear, our anxiety, our terror, right? You're feeding that fire. You're feeding your, you are, you are, so you're, what you are doing every single moment of your life that is clouded by fear, you are sacrificing that moment to Trump, you are giving that moment on the altar of time to the, to this being that you've created in your mind that you think Trump is, whatever he may be, doesn't seem like a sweetheart. A lot of what he's doing, he fucking assigned, uh, the attorney general is this like rabid hater of marijuana. It was really, you know, and all the other things. Okay, fine. But this is, so to get back to the idea of the goonas. Yeah. So the idea is these, these three modes interact not just in, within a person, but in nature too. So this is a constant dance that's happening between these three energetic states essentially. Uh, and the idea is that even the mode of goodness is still just a temporary mode and that it is the transcendent fixation on the thing behind the modes that is the true pathway to liberation. So even being in the mode of goodness, you know, sitting on drinking green tea in your cabin, in your sustainable cabin with solar panels and your beautiful garden, compost pile, no waste, even in that place, if you have not connected to the transcendent, then you're, then you're still going to be in a, uh, you're still in a bit of a precarious position, but it's the, so it's like seeing as, as, as, as absolutely blasphemous as the thing is, is to say Trump is Krishna. Yeah. Trump is God, his cabinet, you know what I mean? This is a manifestation of the divine on earth and then, and then within that, you know, and you've been, we've all been given a wonderful riddle. Crack the code. How do you love him? You know, how do you figure out? Sure. That's, I think that's, I, I really think like everyone's coming out. I mean, everyone in the echo chamber of Facebook echo chamber is coming out. Everyone that we know who, who we all talk to and all interact with who ignores it completely ignores the other side. We all just riot in, in, in anger, you know, and we don't participate in the other side of the coin, you know, and our anger is scared anger. So it's, it's the worst kind of anger too. A lot of the anger that people are displaying isn't Martin Luther King anger cause his anger was filled with love. Yeah. And they talked about Neem Karoli Baba when he got angry, it was just love. It was like his anger was love. This is a scared petty anger where people are holding up signs that say, you know, rape, uh, Melania Trump or like, you know, I didn't see that. Yeah. That people are doing that. Or people are like, you know, uh, some people are, are making up fake stories about attacks is an attempt to like, uh, in some way or another demonstrate the world that we're now entering into. Now I'm, I think they're real fucking attacks that are probably happening too. But we, if we, when I say we, if there's a sum total of humans on the planet, who's ideas, let's figure out a way to create a more perfect union, right? And that's a beauty. That's a, that's a really beautiful idea, a more perfect union. How can we harmonize in an even better, more accelerated and advanced ways with the people around us? The way to do that is not to lie. The way to do that is not to, uh, become the thing that you hate. So anyway, and also the way to do it is like, come on, man, we got to see past this too. It is to love Trump. Doesn't mean you don't fight every step of the fucking way with this. If his assholes start doing stupid things, there's so many beautiful, um, methods in place, you know, the, the, to help, to fight this, you know, there's lots of ways that we, that if stuff emerges that we need to fight, that we can fight. Yeah. So that's there for us. It's just, and, but as we're doing that, I'm doing the thing where I say we, uh, I hate it. Why do I do that? I think there's another thing is this fucking collectivization in language where you start doing like what we must do. Yeah. Honestly, I don't know. That drives me crazy. I feel so conflicted about that actually, because I guess I'm supposed to, I'm supposed to share, uh, like be empathetic and, and less individualistic or something. I'm supposed to, uh, be communing with my fellow brothers, you know, but also I'm like, at the same time, I'm, I'm like, you don't represent my nuanced thoughts. Like what you say isn't exactly me. Right. That's how, that's how I felt about, um, that's how I felt about, uh, because I'm half Japanese and there was this thing, not to change the subject, but there was this thing on Twitter when I was actually paying attention to Twitter a long time ago, there was this thing, um, where, where this lady online was saying, um, cancel Colbert or whatever. Do you remember when that happened? She was an Asian lady because Colbert made an Asian joke that actually, um, was making fun of people making Asian jokes, but within the context of context of an Asian joke, that's my memory of it. And so she tried to start this Twitter, online Twitter, uh, thing against him to get him fired. And, uh, and she said, um, you don't, I forget what it was, but it was something like I'll say, cancel Colbert and I was like, why are you representing all Asians? Like I'm not you. You're not me. Like you're not speaking for me, but you're acting as if you are by saying we and this kind of stuff, like saying all Asians, uh, feel this way. I was more insulted by her assertion that she spoke for me. It's obnoxious. That's crazy obnoxious. I was like, I got so angry at that. It's the, the, what I love about what Victor Franco wrote about, and I love about the concept of theism or God is that it gives you this blasphemous ability to, in the face of whatever the horror is, because Victor Franco, it can't, you're getting marched by Nazis and you can't get much worse than that. Yeah. That's the worst. And even in the midst of that, he's feeling this trend, transcendental love for the beloved, and the beloved doesn't act for him. It was his wife, but this is, I think one of the gifts that this stuff that we're talking about gives you, is it lets you lift your eyes from the human level to something far, far greater and something that will last, something that won't go away. Now, when you do that, the idea is like, okay, from this platform, I can really do good in the world. Yeah. If there's a fight against Trump or whatever, I can, from here, I can react with confidence, whereas from the human level, it becomes so frightening and pointless and ridiculous. And repetitive and, you know, redundant, this redundant, uh, drama that, that keeps happening over and over again. And that, what that book that you're talking about, that's sort of, for me, that, that the highest goal of like where I want to be able to get to, to be in a situation of pure horror and be calm and, and, and be observing the sublime in that moment. Like if I can get to that courageous point, that's where, that's where I wish I could get, you know, uh, could get to. And that's, I don't know. Yeah. I don't know if I will or not, but, um, well, the next time you, what I do, what I'd like to do is when I am in a particularly shit spot throughout the day, whatever it may be, that's where I'm like, Oh wait, can I find, if I can remember? So, so I have a mnemonic trick. So the, if I'm really feeling bad, I ask, well, what, wait, what am I forgetting? What am I forgetting? Cause most of the time what I'm forgetting is that God is inside everything. So when I'm feeling really bad, I'm like, what am I forgetting? What am I forgetting here? And then it's like, Oh shit, I forgot again. I forgot again. Okay, okay, okay. Can I find it here? Can I find it in this moment here with the, like with a pulsating doom hangover? Yeah. Can I find it here? And then you start doing the, so now at least it gives you a game to play inside the horror, because instead of being in the horror, which is to react to the whatever the thing is, right? And then you're reacting to it. It gives you a mini game to play inside of, which is like, wait a minute, wait a minute, like what you said, where is the, in this tarot card, where is the wisdom, where is the love or the, for me, it's God. And I, you know, and if you find it, then bam, instant transformation of the experience and that's also going to affect the way you interact with other people. I hope, you know, the way you treat other people who, who have different opinions that you have had different experiences than you, who have different things that they're rallying against, you can find that common light and they can feel it. Yeah. And then it doesn't, then they don't give a shit about what you, what you think about some material world drama, you know, they acknowledge you as a human being, as a living, living being. They know you're seeing past whatever the thing is, into the deeper thing. And I like to make, I like to make friends with those people, people who have really different views for me. Yeah. They're the best. I have a friend Seth who's like a conservative Republican and I love talking to that guy. They're the best to talk to. Yeah. Cause you learned that you can't be in the filter bubble, man. You got to get out of the filter bubble. If you get stuck in that fucking thing, you will get so lost and it doesn't, it doesn't matter because you're not doing it. It's from that. I saw the preview of that movie. You were talking about what it's called. Oh, hyper normalization. Yeah. Where it shows all the computer, computer servers that, and you know, like the, the, the stock footage that always represents tweets coming into a server, flickering lights that are, it's like you've transformed your outrage into flickering lights on a server somewhere. Then those flickering lights are being filtered so that your tweets are only going to people who agree with you anyway. So who fucking cares? Right. Go yell your outrage in a hole might as well. Yeah, go dig a fucking hole and scream about it feels good. It feels good to do that. Cause it's like you're, you're getting feedback from a mirror. You're just looking at yourself and screaming and feeling, feeling good about it feels great. Yeah. The likes feel good. Yeah. The likes feel good, man. That's how we're going to end right there. Okay. That's our final, this is the final. Give me some likes. This is the true realization from the great esoteric wisdom of the ages. It's nice to get likes on Twitter. This is nice. Man, this has been, although I had to quit Twitter because I couldn't take, I couldn't take it. Dude, have you been watching black mirror? No. Okay. You got to watch the first episode of the latest season of black mirror. I'm not going to go, but the premise is it's a world where you can, rate every interaction you have. Oh, Jesus.

85^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - JOHNNY PEMBERTON IS GOD'S FATHER Transcript and Discussion^2015-06-02^This episode of the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Harrys.com. Thank your father for blasting your genetic information into your mother's egg folds by giving him a nice shave, Harrys.com. Hello my sweet babies of the night with your darling little feet pedaling on your dream bikes down into hell. It is I, Dunkin' Trussell, and you are listening to the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. I gotta read this to you. I'm sure if you're someone who, like me, stays online for 95% of your life, you already read this incredible weird report coming from the Scientific Universe. This is from ScienceDaily.com. I'm just gonna, I'm gonna read parts of it to you, and then I'm gonna tell you how crazy it is, even though you're probably already gonna understand how crazy it is. Experiment confirms quantum theory weirdness. The bizarre nature of reality is laid out by quantum theory has survived another test. Test, with scientists performing a famous experiment improving that reality does not exist until it is measured. Physicists have conducted John Wheeler's delayed choice thought experiment, which involves a moving object that is given the choice to act like a particle or a wave. The group reversed Wheeler's original experiment and used helium atoms scattered by light. That's a good choice. I would have done the same thing. The bizarre nature of reality, wait, hold on, shit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Common sense says the object is either wave-like or particle-like, independent of how we measure it. But quantum physics predicts that whether you observe wave-like behavior or particle behavior depends on how it is actually measured at the end of its journey. This is exactly what the ANU team found out. It proves that measurement is everything. At the quantum level, reality does not exist if you're not looking at it. Despite the apparent weirdness, the results confirm the validity of quantum theory, which governs the world of the very small and has enabled the development of many technologies such as LEDs, lasers, and computer chips. The ANU team not only succeeded in building the experiment, which seemed nearly impossible when it was proposed in 1978, but reversed Wheeler's original concept of light beams being bounced by mirrors and instead used atoms scattered by laser light. So I won't go into the details of the thing. You might already understand that I certainly don't, barely, but here's the gist of it. If one chooses to believe that the atom really did take a particular path or paths, then one has to accept that a future measurement is affecting the atom's past. The atoms did not travel from A to B. It was only when they were measured at the end of the journey that their wave-like or particle-like behavior was brought into existence, he said. Wow! Wow! Now, I'm no physicist. As many, I'm sorry to disappoint many of you, probably based on my deep understanding of physics and math, I've probably thought I was some kind of PhD in physics. I'm not. I'm just a guy who likes to eat marijuana and play Witcher. But I will tell you that this experiment validates my understanding, not of physics, but of magic and prayer and all the, quote, woo-woo stuff that I like talking about on this podcast. Because here we have reality, this sort of non-existent blast of phenomena. And then we have the expectations of the scientists shaping that reality at the fundamental level. That's all magic is, friends. That's all prayer is. That's all any of this stuff really is. It's learning how to focus your attention in a very specific way so that you can shape the field of phenomena around you to match whatever it is that you desire. That's the idea. That's it. So this is working in the tiniest level. It's got to be working all the way up to the top as the emerald tablet of Hermes Trimestigerius says, forgive me if I fuck up that name. It's fun to say. Emerald tablet of Hermes Trimestigerius says, as above so below, which means as below so above. So if at the very fundamental, deepest, smallest, tiniest, pixelated version of this strange dimension that we're existing in, the expectations of scientists is actually forming reality, possibly even forming reality in the past that it must be happening right now. You understand? You're like a lighthouse. Your sensory apparatus is like a reality shaping lighthouse and whatever particular light that you're casting out into this great nothingness, the void surrounding all of us is literally bringing it into existence. This is the breath of God in the book of Genesis. This is the breath of life. You still have it inside of you. The exhalation of the divine is rolling through you at every moment. And when you look out at the world, you have to do what God did in the book of Genesis, not literally you fucking assholes. I'm not saying it really happened. It's all symbolic. It's all deeper than you can understand. So don't clench your assholes, you atheists. I don't mean it literally happened. But in the book of Genesis, it says that God looked out upon the world and it was good. I don't know. It says something like that. Basically he said, it's good. This is good. It's good. This is good. And it was. That's what you've got to do when you wake up in the morning and you look at yourself in the mirror and you see the effects of aging or booze or eating too many calories or sadness. Or all the grief or all the whatever you've been through. You've got to figure out a way to look at that reflection and say, it is good. This is good. This is good. And you do that because at the fundamental level, you are affecting yourself at the quantum level. You are changing yourself every time you do something like that. Every time you have an expectation of people around you, that's better than whatever it formerly was than you are shifting reality. Now look, I sent a DM to a scientist friend of mine who's also a skeptic, Cara Santa Maria. Unfortunately, she wasn't able to get back to me so I could talk to her before this. I'm sure she's going to take some wind out of my sails here, but I'm going to try to record a brief conversation with her about this very principle because it's super important. And it's the essence of magic. Magic is just focusing your will, focusing your attention out into the world so that instead of looking out into the world and having an expectation that everything sucks and the world is a cesspool and everyone's an asshole and everybody's going to hurt you and everyone's just out for their own good and everybody wants to stab you in the back if they can and people are going to lie to you and people are going to cheat and steal and the whole thing ends in just a grim, seizure-like death moment as you look back on the rubble of your crap life and thank God that the whole thing's fucking ending. That's just magic, friends. If you look at it, if you look at things like that, that's what you're going to get. All the cliches, all the aphorisms, all the trite sayings from crystal-gazing new-age cuckoos have been confirmed by scientists. Our observation of reality brings reality into being. Your very attention shapes reality. There's a theory behind sigil magic where you create some event that you want to happen in an encoded way on a bit of paper and you stare at it and you manifest that reality. Sometimes you stare at it and you actually masturbate. That's sex magic. You create a heightened state as you're peering at the sigil which represents what you want to have happen. You're affecting reality at the fundamental level. That's what that's all about. And it also is kind of sinister when we think about all the corporate logos floating around us at all times. And how these corporations probably understand this very simple principle that if they can get enough people to turn that lighthouse, that reality-shaping lighthouse in the direction of their corporate symbology. Is symbology even a word? Then they can harness the power, the creative power of all mankind to bring their company or business or whatever it is they want into existence and keep it there by holding it in the visual field. That's why corporations pay so much fucking money for these billboards. This is why when you're watching something just for a second and you think, why would they even pay for that? Maybe they understand this stuff in some subconscious way. Maybe they have a different way of saying it. They're not going to say, oh yes, we understand that the human force of attention is one of the most powerful thing that exists in this dimension. And if we can turn enough optic nerves in the direction of our symbols, then we will actually summon a kind of money-making spirit that exists in the world. We can actually convert that attention into dough. They're going to have different corporate ways of saying that, but it's the same principle. You've got to bring it back to yourself, which is every single day when your mind, like some awful, stubborn mule, starts pulling the chariot of your life in the direction of hell by talking shit about friends or hating yourself or contemplating suicide or considering how miserable your life is or turning towards the hopeless. When it starts pulling the chariot of your life toward the fields of desolation that so many other lives have been yanked into, you've got to grab the reins and use your will. Consider this scientific experiment and recognize that the untrained mind that is running amuck through your life is actually summoning demons into your very existence. You've got to turn your gaze in the direction of the good, no matter how absurd, ridiculous, or absolutely insane it may seem. Because you are, as far as we know, the most intelligent, sentient being that exists in this dimension. And your attention appears to be shaping reality at the fundamental level. And if you let your mind go nuts, if you allow those old habits and patterns that got injected into your brain by the terrified freaks who raised you or educated you, take control, then you are going to get pulled into the land of demons that will fist your life until it is just a puckered, exploded rectum. Sorry, I don't know what was happening there, but you've got to turn your eyes to the light. It's so important. It's really crazy to think about it. I'm going to quote, I'm sorry if I've said this before, but one of the most profound things that was ever said to me when I was in high school was by my driver's ed teacher. I believe his name was Teeter. He said, the car tends to go in the direction you're looking. He didn't know that he was summarizing quantum physics. He didn't know that he was just trying to teach me to drive, but that's the way it works. You got to really take a real long look at what you've been contemplating. You've got to take a long look at what you've been thinking about. You got to take a long look about how you expect the universe to act. And then just as a thought experiment, imagine that the way you're looking at this motherfucking entity that we happened to have incarnated into is actually causing the entity to act in that way. There seems to be some strange procreative relationship between human attention and phenomena. And when the two come together, phenomena gives birth to whatever attention has injected it with. That's right. Your attention is the penis of the universe humping the phenomenological field and impregnating it with the seed of your expectations. And it's blasting out temporal babies into your future, laying temporal landmines into your future. You got to be careful. That's all. Spend some time over the next few days playing around with the concept that you are actually forming and shaping reality by your very expectation of the way things are to be. And then just for fun, see if you can trick yourself into imagining that you are in heaven, that you are existing in some kind of heaven state. You might have a little amnesia. You're like an angel with amnesia. You don't really understand what this is or where it is. Throw all your expectations away and just play around with the concept that you are in heaven and start expecting great things to happen. Do this as a form of scientific experiment and then get back to me and let me know what happens. Do the affirmations. Oh God, they're so cheesy. It really does give you the willies to imagine standing in front of the mirror and looking at yourself and saying to yourself, you are beautiful. You are perfect. You deserve love. You are made of love. You're made of light. And this universe is yours to enjoy. But it's worth a try. It's better than standing in front of that fucking mirror and doing the habitual affirmations that you may have been doing for the last many years where you look at yourself and say or thank God, you look like shit today. Another day. No. Don't be a lazy magician. No matter what you're doing, magic friends. And if you've allowed the imp of your uncontrolled mind to grab the steering wheel of your life, then you can be certain that that motherfucker is going to drive you home and home for the imp of the mind as hell. Just wants to go home, wants to drive back to sit on its daddy's lap and suckle at its billion nipples and drink poison while watching demons gouge the eyeballs out of those who have sinned. Don't let an imp control your mind. You have to take control. You've got to grab the reins and you've got to steer this life of yours into the direction of paradise. Science is backing this stuff up. Also, I guess stop watching Fox News or any news for that matter. I've got to yank my eyes away from that because possibly if you start digesting their apprehension of reality, that very thing might come into existence. We've got to be careful friends. We might have underestimated the potency of the human attention here. We might all be like toddlers carrying M16s, accidentally blasting temporal bullets into the future and blowing up all chances of happiness. Got to be careful. Turn your eyes towards the light. Do as an experiment this week. Just do it. Do the cheesy affirmation. No one has to know that you're doing it. You can make it a secret. Go into the bathroom, look in the mirror and tell that reflection just how beautiful it is and just how perfect it is and just how incredible it is that it's managed to pull itself from a nothingness into a somethingness that all its atoms are harmonizing in a perfect way, that it can balance itself, that it has an optic nerve that can transform photons into visual form. There's so many beautiful and glorious things about the human body. You know that. It's incredible. Do that. Do that. Do that. Do that to your life and then let me know friends. That's my rant for today. Thank you for listening. I love you guys and I am visualizing that every single one of you are going to have the most incredible week of your life. That this is going to be the big one. This one. This week. This is where it happens. This is the beginning of the snowball effect that moves you in the direction of a wonderful existence. This is it. All the other stuff from the past. That's just because you let that loathsome bucktooth, horn, multi eyeballed imp drive you into hell. Johnny Pemberton is our guest today, but first some quick business. Math trick you can do is to take your age and subtract it by that exact number in a few extra months and you'll come to a special day when your father shoved his throbbing member deep into your mother's flowery vagina. I don't know where it was. Shopping mall, picnic, late night boat ride, sand castle building session got hot. Whenever it was or wherever it was all that matters is that very moment your father signed a contract with sperm that guaranteed that you would be blasted out of a vagina into this dimension where there's gravity, time and space. And for that we owe this man our lives. Sure, you can go down to the local bookstore and get some crap book on barbecuing and give it to your progenitor, the man who created the ability for you to have orgasms and experience love. The man who, like some master fisherman, used his rod to yank you out of the ocean of your mother's vagina. You can go buy him some cheesy hat and he can wear it around for the next year and all the other dads with their clean shaved faces are going to know that that's a sad dad. That dad's sad because you didn't do the right thing. Go to harrys.com and order him a father's day set, limited edition set of wonderful razors. Your dad's the person who taught you how to shave, guaranteed. I'll never forget the time my dad yanked me out of bed, pulled me onto his lap and using a straight razor, shaved my hairless face, mascara running down. He said to me, this is what a man does boy. It was a touching moment and that's why I'm going to go to harrys.com and I'm going to use offer code family hour to get my dad a father's day set which includes a razor, three quality blades, harry's shaving cream and a brand new razor stand. A limited father's day set comes in a sleek box with a customizable card and you can go the extra mile this year and engrave both the razor and the razor stand. This giftable set is shipped directly to your door. This is a really nice thing to get your dad guys. You can actually engrave a razor. That means you could have engraved in the razor some little saying if you wanted. You could have his initials in there and on the card you could have written thanks for coming inside my mom dad. If not for you I wouldn't be alive or way to go mother fucker. You could put anything you want there to express your love for this man. He made love to your mom. Think about that. Your dad made love to your mom. He touched her in a way that no other man could and because of that touch he made you father's day. That's why we celebrate it. You don't have to freak out. I know a lot of you guys out there probably for the last three months you've been stressed out thinking what am I going to get my dad for father's day? I know I have. Everybody's pacing around these days. What are we going to do for this man who had the courage to insert his erect cock into our mother's vagina? What do we get for a man who surmounted countless obstacles? Probably bought concert tickets and shots of tequila just so that he could do that which no other man could do. Ejaculate inside of our sweet sweet moms. It's the hardest thing. A lot of people say that a woman gets pregnant and carries the baby and has to breastfeed the baby and blah blah blah blah. But we all know that the hardest thing is to come inside of a mother. It's hard and that's why I want all of you guys right now to go to harrys.com and harrys will give you five dollars off your father's day set with code family hour. This is just in time for father's day. Harrys is giving listeners five dollars off their father's day purchase with code family hour. Order by June 17th to get your set in time for father's day so hurry. Do it now guys. You only get one dad unless your mother divorces a bunch and then you get step dads. But you know what I'm saying. You only get one genetic progenitor. That's harrys.com enter coupon code family hour and check out for five dollars off. This is a great gift. It's simple. Go and do it. Your dad's going to appreciate it. You want your dad to have a smooth dad face. You don't want your dad to look like he's in the Taliban. You don't want your dad to get stopped when he's coming in to when he's flying on a plane. You don't want people sitting next to your dad to feel like they're sitting next to some scruffy sailor. This is the man who made love to your mother and continues to do so. Hopefully. Give him a nice razor. Your mom's going to appreciate it. You don't want to think about your mom with all over her upper thighs, scratches and irritation from your dad's unkempt face scraping against her soft sweet thighs. As he filates her in the morning and afternoon and night. You don't want that. You don't want your mother to get pure burns because your daddy's face is like the underbelly of an Australian weasel cat. As he laps at the nectar of her flower scraping and scratching her. It's not cool. Make sure that your mom's inner thighs are not scraped with the bristles of your dad's unshaved face. This Father's Day. Get your dad the gift that counts most.

Big announcement. Big announcement. We are doing a surprise show. I guess it's not literally a surprise show, but a last minute show. We're doing a last minute show in Austin, Texas. For those of you who are in Austin, we are going to be doing a Duncan Trussell family hour taping this Friday. This Friday. It's happening this Friday. So that is Friday, June 5th at the parish. We are going to be doing a live taping of the podcast. This is a mega Duncan Trussell family hour podcast because we have Derek Waters, the creator of drunk history and Dan Harmon, the creator of community, as well as a million other things. They're going to be together and we're going to be doing a live show. I was going out there to do a drunk history panel and realized that it's a perfect time to record a live taping of the show. So go get your tickets. They're going fast. Ticket links are located at dunkintrussell.com. Finally, we are also brought to you by amazon.com. Pals, you don't have to go to the store anymore. There's no reason to do it. You can go to amazon.com and you could buy what I recently just picked up, which is these new fancy ass Fitbit, the Fitbit Surge. I'm wearing it right now. It's pretty cool, man. It's a little bigger than the other Fitbits and I guess I've gotten used to it. It kind of feels like I've got one of those sci-fi tracking collars on that explodes if you go outside a perimeter of wherever you're being captured. But other than that, it's pretty awesome. It checks your heartbeat. So you get a constant sort of read out of what your heart's up to these days. Like right now, for example, I can look and see what my heart rate is and it is 290 beats per minute. So that's pretty healthy, I think. You can find these things out and then it's got GPS in it, which is pretty cool. So that if you start going on jogs, you can actually see how far you ran. It's cool. I like it. Get one of those. Go to amazon.com. Go through our portal. If you go to the comment section of any of these podcasts, the Amazon portal is there. They give us a small percentage of whatever you buy and it costs you nothing. Also, I'm sure you guys have heard me talk about this before, but there is a new podcast network called the MindPod Network. There is a spirituality podcast network that I've been helping out with a little bit. They've got a lot of great hosts, including Krishnadas, Jack, Cornfield, Sharon, Salzburg. This is a place you can go if you want the full consciousness download. They are doing a fundraiser right now because they're trying to expand that network. You can have a link at DuncanTrustle.com. If you feel like donating any money to get a badass new podcast network going, then do it. All right. That's it. Enough of that crap. Let's dive right in to the podcast. Today's guest is the host of a wonderful podcast called Twisting the Wind. Links will be at DuncanTrustle.com. He's also a brilliant comedian and actor. He's been on the show a few times before, and I love him. Please welcome Johnny Pemberton. It's the DuncanTrustle family. Johnny Pemberton, welcome back to the DuncanTrustle family. I realized something that we've been doing all these live podcasts together. In the midst of that, I haven't been putting you on the regular podcast. It's basically like I've removed you from what I consider to be my roster of glory. It's sad because I've got all these beautiful casts with you just in my vault, unreleased. You're not getting out there like you used to and it's fucked. It's so fucked. I can't believe it. It's so fucked. I've just been spinning around in a small hole I dug with my feet. Just dancing upside down until I get enough dust to where it makes it hard to breathe and I just cry out the dust and sneeze. Man, that dance that you're talking about there is the dance of the dooms. The dusty hole dance? That's the dance of the dooms. That reminds me of an old school thing that coal miners would do. The shuffle. Yeah, when you're really depressed. It's like the story of Johnny Cash going down into the coal mine. To die, yeah. Yeah, I just went on down there. The dust shuffle. Johnny, happy birthday. Thanks, Duncan. Oh yeah, that's today, yeah. I'm so happy to be sharing your birthday with you. Today we went for a jog. A run? Was it a jog or a run? I always say a run. Yeah, it was a jog. I think I've read that the difference between a jog and a run is the jog is between two and four miles per hour and a run is between four and six or not that's miles per hour, but it's on the treadmill. It's like, you know, you type in the numbers on the treadmill, it's like three to four or two to four or something like that. Now that I have this fancy ass fucking Fitbit, I can actually go in and see where my heart rate during the run was the most. Where was it? For one minute, I hit what is called fat burning. What is it? 200? It's when your pulse goes to like 160 or something. Okay. Now you're fat burning. Yeah. But apparently if it isn't hitting that, then it's not the same somehow. Really? I didn't know. That's why I gotta do hills. That's why you gotta push yourself. The hills. People don't understand. I don't think I didn't understand back in the day that if you really want to exercise, you gotta be out of breath. You've gotta push yourself really hard. It's gotta hurt. It's gotta hurt. It's gotta hurt, but then you get that download, that beautiful liquid wet juice that just spills down the back of your head and it hits the spine, the top of the spinal column, the cervical vertebrae, and it's just like, all of a sudden you hear these locusts and you think about cardboard. You turn it blinding on fire as you flap your way. You know what they call that? You know what they call it in Dune? What? In the Dune trilogy, those great books. What do they call it? The Juice of Zafu. Do you know the Juice of Zafu? Is that connected to the spice? It's a different, it's actually a different, it's actually kind of like I guess what you consider to be the, it's the mentats. Let me see if I can actually find the Zafo prayer. Hold on. There's a guy named French Cash. You ever heard of him? French Cash. He's a body mod expert and he's a SSRI expert. No, I've never heard of him. French Cash. Is that real? No, it's a commando, right? Here, listen. This is the mantra for the mentats. The mentats say when they take this stuff, this, I guess you'd call it a new tropic called Zafu juice. Zipper juice. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. It is by the juice of Zafu that thoughts acquire speed. The lips acquire stains. The stains become a warning. It is by will alone I set my mind in motion. That's the, that's they would drink this like crazy shit and say that mantra as they were saying it, but I love it is by will alone that I set my mind in motion because that is the essence of magic or yoga. It's nothing. You're not doing anything but thinking about it. But this is, we are just talking about this in the rant in the beginning of the podcast. I don't know if you have heard about this, but they did another of these bizarre quantum physics studies based on the weird idea that it is the expectation of the observer that appears to be shaping phenomena at the fundamental quantum level. Really? Yeah. So the expectation being if you expect a particle, you get a particle. If you measure, they say your measurement, what you're measuring. So if you measure for a particle, you get a particle. If you measure for a wave, you get a wave. And that's like an old, isn't it? There's an old phenomenon that has to do with the way people document things. I can't think of what's called something's law or something's principle about how once you observe something, you change the nature of the thing you're observing by the act of observing. Yeah. That's it. Yeah. And they did some kind of bizarre experiment with helium atoms and random number generators and because it was a thought experiment, some physicists came up with and the end result is, yeah, it looks like our expectation of the particle appears to be, you know, shaping the particle. There seems to be a not just an observation of is not just a kind of outside thing. It's actually the observation. The field of observation is seems to be like the potter's hand affecting the clay of phenomena. But it's not expectation. I think there's like a difference, right? Because expectation is different than will, right? There's something that Rhonda talks about, right? About the difference between wanting and the idea of you want something and the idea of you, the difference between the desire and want. That's the thing he talks about that the desire versus want. Like want is sort of shallow and immaterial and based on not only based on anything, but desire is like a whole body, whole mind sort of thing. So you're willing and willing into existence as opposed to like, I expected it to be more fun than amusement park. Yeah. Right. To be like, Oh, it's going to be so much fun in the park because you'll be there. This ride will be there. It's going to be great. Yeah. I thought I was going to go faster. Right. That's the difference. It's the difference. Yeah. It's the difference between lazy magicians and magicians who have begun the true practice of magic. Right. No matter what you're doing magic, no matter what you are shaping your reality, it's just one group of magicians likes to pretend that they're not. And that group of magicians is called the victims and the type of magic they practice is called victim magic. Right. And victim magic works via, you'll hear a, you'll hear this kind of magician casting the spell where let me think of a good one, a good victim magic spell is here's a parking tickets are a good one. A good here. I'll give you a classic victim magic mantra. If you're a victim magician, you've probably said this mantra before. Here it is. This is one of the classic victim magic spells. Man, you know, things are going pretty good for me right now, which means something's about to fuck up. Right. That is a classic victim magician spell. It's one of their primary spells. Whereas when you have like an a magician who doesn't practice victim magic, who practices actual like the magic of what you could call, um, fuck, uh, Theergy, uh, which is the Thiergy. Theergy. T-H-E-U-R-G-Y. Thiergy. Thiergy. I think it's pronounced Thiergy. Thiergy. Thiergy. When you practice Thiergy, then you might hear this one of the great magical spells of all time, uh, which is, uh, thank you God. That's one of the great spells. So like you'll hear these like, everyone's doing it. I do it. I've done it. I've definitely done it. Oh God, me too. Yeah. That's like, even though I always used to quote that grateful dead lyric. I don't know what it is or something like, uh, the first days, the worst days, blah, blah, blah, but when life looks like Easy Street, there's trouble at your door. Don't do that spell. Oh, mama, don't. I can't do it in person. When life, there's danger at your door. So take one more strip of acid and put that blotter on your tongue. Run out the door. Don't pay the check. You're banned on the run. Take one more red. You got a banana peel to eat. Smoked those banana peels. Take more acid. Take less showers. Just run around in circles. And that, um, not exactly, that's, so that's, that, so you're do it. So when you start playing like right now, you just start playing around with this awesome concept, which is that you are a magician and that you have lost yourself in an amnesiac state due to a series of failed experiments. And now just like a magician who was in the, his summoning chamber in the inner sanctum of his magical laboratories and he did something fucking weird, manifested himself in a dimension where he was completely in control, but got amnesia. And then the end result of it is that his power, his incredible power is wreaking havoc on his life. And instead of recognizing that he's the one who's creating all these circumstances, he has begun to think that the outside of him, it's a terrible predicament to get into. Yeah. It's easy to though. It's super easy. It's like, like a little, um, it's like a gravity, gravity tractor beam kind of thing. Cause you don't see it. You don't feel it pulling on you. It's like a thing where a lot of times you just don't realize that it's happening, but it is happening. It's like when you, it's like the same with negative thoughts. It's like a, it's like a slippery thing where, oh, you just, you don't realize it until it's just, it's like, what is it that people always say about, there's so many things that you don't realize, you know, about the rear view mirror effect. That's like a scientific thing to talk about. There's a lot of phenomenon they don't know has happened until years after it's happened, because they can't tell until they're looking back on it. So sometimes you're in a situation like, oh wow, I didn't realize it, but I've been in this badness because I couldn't see, you couldn't contextualize it or step outside of it. Alcoholism is a classic example of that where you've been festering in booze for, for years and you don't even realize that your, your life is being shaped and formed by the addiction to this chemical. It's like having a break. Like having like a little, like a light break on your bike or something. Yeah. What do you mean a break? It's like slowly, it just, things like that just slow you down. Oh yeah, right, right, right, right. Yeah. So you can't, you're working hard. Like, I'm working so hard, but it's hard to go. Oh, it's because there's, you have to break some. You got to fucking break some, man. Yeah. It's fun to, all these are just thought experiments that are designed to move your life into the direction of existing in heaven. That's all this stuff is. We're just trying to come up with thought experiments to move your life into a better direction. That's all magic really is, but if you pretend that your most negative reoccurring thought patterns are actually demonic forces and that you have been possessed by demons that in the midst of like, you're casting some spell, who knows what you're doing. Maybe you were creating an entire universe and you accidentally fell into the universe and forgot you were creating the universe and somewhere in the midst of this, you know, in the classic style, if you step out of the magic circle, you get attacked by demons. The demons got into your fucking head and they started telling you really fucked up things like, you're always going to be fat, you'll never get in shape, you'll never find love. Why are you doing this to yourself? Yeah. Why are you doing the thing that you're doing? Yeah. That's that thing where you get in that cycle of, I get in that cycle sometimes with negative thoughts where you get mad at yourself for something and that just increases it because you're angry with yourself for the thing that you're angry with yourself, for the thing that you're angry with yourself. So you have to like, if you talk about it in the demon mentality where it's like, oh, it wasn't me that did that. That's this thing that's apart from me because I'm no one. I'm really nothing. That's it. Yeah. You're not anything at all. You're just nothing. Well, you're nothing, but you are your will. You're your will. You're both. It's the duality. It's the great duality of being everything, being unique, but also being nothing at all. Being, yeah. And nothing is everything. Right. And what you're talking about there is proliferation. You're talking about, in Buddhism, they call it proliferation, which is the endless echo that happens after some specific event. And wherever your mind lands during this echo, that's going to create even more proliferation. And the whole time, all you're doing is burrowing deeper and deeper into hell. That's all you're doing. And you just say, all you have to do, it's so weird. But at any second, you can completely change your focus. You can change your mentations. You can change your habitual thought patterns. At any second, it's really kind of cool. Just disengage from it, disengage or engage with a better version of things. Yeah. Because it is weird to think you're always like two months away from a completely different life and two months goes by real quick. If you start working out. It's two months a specific number. I'd say I'm thinking like, OK. I think more like six weeks. All right. Let's say six. I think six weeks. But if you for two months straight start exercising, or if you for two months straight start eating right, or if you for two months straight start meditating, or for two months straight. Sister life then. Everything changes. And whatever you are doing before that two month period will seem like a weird dream. Like you'll look back and be like, what the fuck was I doing that for? I can't believe I was drinking that much and not paying attention where I was eating. Just getting shit food or. Yeah. Yeah. Like getting mad at yourself for waking up, please. Yeah. Yeah. And it's weird. You look back and you're like, what? Wait. Oh, fuck, man. I was sleepwalking. That's all. I was just sleepwalking. Yeah. Two months. There's a two month membrane separating every single person on the planet from a completely different existence. It's just about a two month, maybe not even that long, but two month membrane that you got to push through. There's a. There's something like that. There's something like statistic about what it takes, the length of time it takes to form a habit. Right. Something like that. Like six weeks or, I don't know, a hundred repetitions or something like that. So you can look it up. Look it up, guys. Go to frenchcash.net. I can't think of that name. I was coming over here. I am French cash. Man, I am. What do you think about this, uh, this stuff in SA? What do you think about the shit going down the NSA right now? What is it? Honestly, all that stuff lately, I've just been, I just stopped caring about it because I feel like there's so many things people talk, I heard some people talk over talking about, I overheard people talking about, um, technology like drone technology and surveillance technology about, oh, this is coming, that's coming. When the reality is that anything we're talking about coming is definitely pretty much here. Right. Like if it's not here, it's like months away, not years away. It's just the matter of the time it takes for it to infiltrate mass media and societies is a little bit of ways away. Right. So all that stuff is inevitable, right? The ideas of, uh, robots being able to compete with humans, all of a sudden it's just inevitable. So sometimes I, lately I just sort of been disengaging from it because I find it's like, there's not really anything to talk about. It's like talking about the sun, is the sun going to come up tomorrow? It's going to come up. Right. It's just how you deal with the inevitable change. Right. Yeah. I don't know what the new NSA stuff is though. Well, it's the, so it's basically, um, the NSA has been gathering phone records of everyone. But that's nothing new, right? No, nothing new. I mean, it's, but it's relatively new. Right. But we knew what we've known about since Snowden, right? Since Snowden. So here's the NSA, uh, collecting all this fucking data on every single person. The idea is that if they identify one person who's a potential terrorist and they can look at who that person, the link, who that person's talked to, and then look at all the people who that person's talked to. How many steps down the way can you be connected? Is it like, is it like Kevin Bacon kind of thing, seven degrees? It all leads to Kevin Bacon. That's what, that's the one who's behind getting this shit overturned is Kevin Bacon. Because from somehow, no matter what, you end up, which seems like Kevin Bacon keeps popping up. But yeah, it is like that. But the main fucked up thing about it is that the government cannot collect data on every citizen. Yeah. You can't do that. You mean like physically or not allowed to? You're not allowed to constitute. You're not allowed to. You're not allowed to. No. You can't do it. It's a, it's a spy state. It's a spy bureaucracy that we're paying for. And so Rand Paul, who I don't know too much about. He's a weird guy, man. He's like so polarizing. He's polarizing. Some stuff he says. I'm like, you're a fucking asshole. Yeah. I have stuff I'm saying. He says like, like, why, why are you saying this? Does it make sense coming from you that you're, yeah, he just, he's very much that weird thing where he, you hate him and love him at the same time. Well, he, it looks like this son of a bitch is making a run for, is going to like really is going for it to be president. And so this is all part of that. But what he did is he somehow managed to obstruct the Senate from, and forgive me, you guys, if I'm miss, if I'm saying this the wrong way, I don't know the exact process that he used, but Rand Paul managed to keep the Patriot Act as it's called. From renewing. From renewing. I didn't know that. He got in the way of that shit. Cheers. Cheers. He got in the way of aspects of it renewing. Yeah. That's a big deal. It's a big fucking deal, man. And he pulled it off. Now they are apparently this week going to try to get the thing back into place with something called the, guess the name of the new act. Guess the name of the new act. Oh, it's probably something really, some of this is called like a definitely if you don't vote for this, you like to touch children's genitals like that. The Children, the Children Protection, the Children, the Children General Protection Act of 2015. That's what it's called. It's called the freedom act. Okay. There you go. The freedom act. Okay. It's the opposite of the freedom act. But that is some Orwellian shit, man. They've got it. They've got it. They have no problem taking a thing that has nothing to do with freedom at all. Like completely not. It's like you might as well call it the volcano act. It's just branding. It's classic good branding. How dumb are these, how dumb do they think we are? Well, they know we're not dumb. They know we don't care. No one gives a shit because no one reads, no one knows about anything that's going on. And if they do, they don't care enough to do anything about it. And if they do care enough to do anything about it, they can't do anything about it. So every window down the line becomes like, at the end, it's like 0.5% of people actually even know, care, and are willing to do something about it. But then it's like, they just, they know because there's all this government things that they've created over the years, since like, you could say it's been going on forever. But there's this thing that happened a few years ago where they passed this restriction to bar congressional voting records and the congressional voting records and also investments of Congress members, they're supposed to be made public, so you can check for conflicts of interest. Right. It was an old thing. And what they did is in a no contest Friday vote where they, you don't have to, the senators don't have to be present to vote, overwhelmingly passed to not make these available. And the only way you can view them is if you go to the fucking White House library and the very limited hours they're over, they're open and specifically request certain pages from certain senators documentation in paper format, which you can view and photocopy at the library. Wow. So basically no one has access to this stuff and it was a no contest vote, because they're all like, it's that same thing where no one, I hate you, you hate me, but we even more, we hate the White Walkers, which is like the citizens, we don't want them to fucking know about us. We're the White Walkers. Yeah. The humans are the White Walkers. That's a Game of Thrones reference for those of you guys who don't know. So yeah, that, and that's kind of the cool thing about what Rand Paul did is that what it forces now, it forces whoever's for the goddamn thing to come out and say they're for it and whoever's against it to come out and say they're against it publicly creates a debate. And the debate makes it so that any of these fucking loons who come out and they're like, listen, we need to monitor all civilians at all times. That's on the record forever. And so in campaign commercials, their adversaries can play them on the floor talking about how they want to monitor everybody and they're going to seem like fascists. And that's what they didn't want to have happen. Right. Because people actually do hate that. You can talk to dumb idiots in the street who don't know who the fucking vice president is. I'm pretty sure no one here you're talking to my grandma. Yeah, I'll say that in Times Square. Yeah, I don't. Yeah, we don't want that. And that's like a base. That's that's like we have been, you know, born into that. That's a deep seated American. We don't get monitored by our government. This is not a fucking. This is like the Putin level shit and and and we don't do that. The fact that fucking Obama is I heard the creepiest Obama did a special message. Is it backwards? Yep. Yep. It's just, you know, that weird way as of talking or he's just like he did, you know, to the American people, we've got to keep the fact is we got to keep things safe. We got to keep things safe for you. Talk to a guy just yesterday, Jim, Jim Stevenson, hardworking guy, constituent, working hard to farm. We've got to keep him safe because the thing is, folks, uh, better one get bombed. I don't want to get bombed. Michelle's going to get bombed. Leah and their child don't want to get bombed. Let's keep us. We get bombed. We're going to monitor you at all times. We're just going to take a look at your phone. Look, we can't tell you. We can't tell when we can't tell the content of the call. But if there's a JPEG in the text, we can look at it and look at it and I have no reason to look at any of your emails or texts don't want to don't want a lot of time. But we need we need that ability. It's like, it's so creepy and it was so funny hearing him come out and that's why, you know, I don't know. The problem is I don't know enough about Rand Paul's politics outside of this. I've heard controversial shit, which I can't recall, just, uh, I'm not sure what his policy on marijuana is. I'm not sure what his policy on, um, the prison industrial complex is. I don't know. I don't understand his drug policy. I don't know anything about it. I think a lot of that stuff, you're talking about the prison industrial complex and the marijuana stuff is pretty should fall in with typical libertarian stuff where it's like they don't care because they shouldn't care. Like maybe he has an opinion about it, but that's what Ron Paul used to always say. Like Ron Paul obviously had his own personal opinions, but he'd say my personal opinions don't matter. How I feel about abortion doesn't matter because it's not for me to decide. It's for you to decide. Right. It's not, it's not my judgment. Right. Well, hopefully that's the way he sees things. I don't know, but I do know that whatever he did, it created a little, you know, bump in the, in the way things are going. And you know, a lot of people, I tweeted something about it and a lot of skeptics are like tweeting back, don't believe that. Don't believe this. It doesn't matter what they say. It's still going to, they're still going to do what they want to do. There's nothing we can do about it. Don't fall prey to this. It's, it's, it's wrestling, man. The whole thing's fake. Don't get sucked in. A wrestling, like, like professional wrestling, professional wrestling, you know, you're falling prey to it. Don't fall prey to it. These guys are all bought and sold and blah, blah, blah. Okay. Maybe so, but Ram Paul created enough turbulence that it's on the headlines of all newspapers, all newspapers. And he's a senator, right? Is he a senator? Yes. And that's a big deal. Cause most senators are just camp their money jockeys. They don't, they vote, they vote exactly by whatever their, whatever their, um, their donor base tells them that. Yep. Without a doubt. Without a doubt. It's like, oh, you can have the most glorious, like freedom enhancing, um, fucking money bashing bill you ever could design and it passes in the house and it goes to the Senate and it just like, it's like throwing a fucking, like, like a, I don't know, it's like throwing a rock on the ocean expecting it to float. Yeah. It's not going to happen. Not going to happen. Yeah. You build a stone boat and send it over to the Senate. Well, you know, man, and that was the other weird thing in Obama's fucking creepy ass address to the American people was he's like, you know, people are using this issue for politics. You know, he's trying to, he's basically saying the reason Rand Paul is doing this is because he wants to get elected president, but it's like, it seems that there, that maybe that's the case, but if, if disrupting a surveillance state gets him elected president, that means that we don't want people monitoring us, which is why we would vote for him. That's why. Yeah. That's the whole point of it. It's the whole, it's the whole point. So it seems very, very, that guy, man, I mean, there's so many things that have happened during Obama's presidency that I love the marijuana becoming legal, gay marriage, healthcare, healthcare to some degree. I know that's a controversial subject matter, but it shouldn't be controversial. I like the healthcare stuff. There is nothing cooler than after I had had cancer, calling up a fucking, I remember like calling my insurance insurance company to sign up for insurance and, and they were, they were just like, yeah, here's the plans. Which one do you want? I'm like, don't you guys, aren't you guys going to check out my medical history or whatever? Or like, and the guy allowed to in a very grumpy way, the guy's like, we don't do that now. I mean, there's nothing I used to love more than looking up someone's medical history and giving them a big fat no, as I sit on my hemorrhoid donut shitting into a bucket and oh, I've cut out of this chair that I live in. You're going to die. I'm sorry, but we can't help you or your kids. That stuff's cool, man. But the, this other stuff, the kind of like background monitoring, that kind of shit gives me the heebie-jeebies. It does. Yeah. And I got nothing to hide, man. I mean, everything that I, I, I say everything on this podcast, it's not even like I've got anything to like that isn't complete public knowledge about me. Then you have nothing to worry about, Duncan. Right. But except the fact that you're monitoring me. Which just gives you a bad feeling. Yeah. It's like, don't go through my shit. There's nothing there, obviously. It's not like I'm a fucking terrorist. You're not a terrorist. I'm not, I know, not at all. I have some sympathy, you know. Hello. You what? I'm a terrorist. I'm a fucking terrorist. I'm a fucking terrorist. Yeah. A terrorist. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. A terrorist. Yeah. Oh. Yeah. I am a terrorist. I can't do it right now. I am a terror. No one's a fucking, just stop all that shit. Well, that's the thing about terrorism now is it's kind of a slippery slope, right? Who is a terrorist? Who isn't? It's like, if you're sympathetic toward ISIS, you're a terrorist sympathizer, which makes you a terrorist. I mean, how are you going to be fucking sympathetic towards ISIS anyway? People are. Who? No one's sympathetic towards. 16-year-old girls who are pissed at their parents. Yeah, right. Yeah. I don't, I know if I was in high school right now, because I used to be a very pissed off young man, like drawing like, you know, bloody car accidents and shit like that, shit that's like, if, if it was, since it was pre-columbine, I didn't raise any red flags, but if I was doing that stuff now, people are like, we need to get them in something right. Me too. Yeah. You definitely would have been. Me too. I thought about doing terrible. I didn't do anything terrible because there's like that separation in your brain that allows you to not do the things you think about. Yeah. That's what kind of, what makes people not murderers and things like that. But to an outside observer, I'm sure it probably would have looked pretty bad, especially given the things that happened after we got into high school. When I was in, I don't remember which class it was, but I remember like, my overwhelming feeling every day in high school was one of dread and resistance. Resistance, yeah. Because I felt that, I didn't want to be stuck in this maze of bullies and I- Just bureaucratic bullshit. Sitting and listening to people tell me facts in the most dry way. The whole thing sucked. Asking for permission to use the bathroom. Oh yeah, that kind of shit. Yeah. Like, I'm a fucking human, man. I've got a piss. I've got a piss. And being forced into this dreadful situation, you would go and visit with the career person and take this ridiculous test and at the end of it, they would be like, oh, you should consider a job. Public relations. That kind of shit where you're just like, well, wait. So you're saying that the life that I have to look forward to is one of sitting in an office doing public relations work or like, even in my college that I went to, there was a careers class you had to take where they taught you how to fill out resumes and shit. And I can remember like, just sitting in this class and the guy's teaching it is just a true fucking American pig. And you like, you know, he'd wear a suit to class and he'd go through how important your resume was and how to dress for the interview and how to do a fucking interview. All this cow-towing to a hierarchical crap structure. And I can remember like sitting there and he's like, I don't know, I'm being obnoxious or whatever. And I think like I, on my resume, because I just had already decided at that point, there's no fucking way that I'm gonna, that if this is the fucking system, I guess I'm gonna get ground up by it. But I, like, I gave, I've made a fake resume form that was just full of bullshit because I thought it was funny. And I remember in class after he looked at my resume in front of the class, he's like, Oh Duncan, I just want you to know that when you graduate, if you ever wanted me to give you a reference for a job, I'm not gonna do it. So he's like, yeah. Did you know that just happened just now? Yeah, it's cool. Our sine waves, they passed in the middle and there was a, what's that called? It's called something. It's called a phasing. That's a, I was, that was a natural sine phase just now. That was kind of cool. Phasing. I hope that picked up on there. But yeah, that's, I mean, it's normal. It's like, so the translation of that, the translation of that is, I, if I can damage your future for not bending down to my authority and pretending that my paradigm is the right paradigm, then I will hurt you if I can. Those are always people who are damaged people. You look back on it now and you think like, it can't help but feel bad for those people because you know that they're angry about all kinds of things because they're doing something that they don't want to do and sad because you are. No, this guy was doing just what he fucking wanted to do. I don't think so. This purveyor of a doom paradigm. Yeah, but he's sad because his life sucks. Well, no, I don't think his life sucked. This guy, like every morning it pretends he's fucking, what's his face from Wall Street? He was unhappy. He's like somebody giving fucking lessons to baby pigs about how to fight off other baby pigs to suckle at the nipple of Satan. Fuck these career people. Fuck your career and you're teaching me how to fucking, you're not teaching me, you're not teaching me how to do a job. You're teaching me how to manipulate people. How to be shitty, how to be hateful, how to not do what you want to do, not be happy. Teach me how not to be happy. You're putting me in a fucking thought prison, man. In high school, this paradigm is being espoused again and again and again and again about a certain way that you're supposed to live and if you don't live in that way, then I can remember when I was in high school, there was a mural on the wall of one of my teacher's class. She taught history and the mural had been painted there years and years and years ago in the glory days by students and it was just like in the 50s. Nothing spookier than an old mural, man, an old muddied, kind of dripping mural. Like when people's faces looked like they kind of been injured in an accident and reassembled. Poorly done. Poorly done mural, horror movie level mural, the kind of mural where you had the pasty feet. The kind of mural that's at the Hollywood Improv. Yes, which is weird because that's a brand new mural and it already looks spooky. If you guys want to see a spooky mural, look up the Hollywood Improv mural. That one's going to take you down a rabbit hole, man. That's some gender-bending shit. It creates some severe cognitive dissonance because you don't understand why because the Improv's a great club, man. It's great. And you look at the mural and it's like, well, I want to love this. I don't, though. I kind of love it because of what it is. You know what I mean? I love it because it's like the same reason you love folk art. Maybe that's, maybe, you know, who knows. Maybe that's why the artist did it, but there, you know, a guy managed to get some dolphins into a goddamn... What's the dolphin doing there? I think it represents the... It's a dolphin with sunglasses. Yeah. Yeah, he got a dolphin with sunglasses. He managed to get, he managed to get, like, it's like he went down to Venice Beach and like took a picture of the, like, a pithy t-shirt with a dolphin with sunglasses on it and put it on the Improv mural. But anyway, this woman, she, yeah, somebody broke into the fucking school and just erased her mural. What do you mean, erased it, painted over it with white? No, like, used something to, it was a chalk mural. Like, somehow they preserved it, Johnny. I don't know how. Okay. They preserved it there and dissolved the mural. So we come to her class, I was in the first period class with her, we come to her class, we sit down, you look over, it's just like that mural would mock you as you're sitting and listening to a dry recitation of American history and an uncomfortable chair and a way earlier than you need to be taking in information. Probably with a boner, too. Yeah. With a morning, a hard high school morning boner that you don't even want. Some fresh bruises flowering on your arm from where some asshole punched you because you're a weirdo. You got punched? Oh yeah, I got bullied. I think it punched you. See, you're sitting there just like kind of like in it already, just like, well, another day in the fucking penal colony for teenagers and you look over and the mural has been defaced. And everyone in the classrooms looking around, they're like, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. And she comes in, she gets right into the whatever the fuck she was teaching and it takes a few beats and she realizes the feeling in the class is weird and she looks over and God damn it if that mural isn't defaced. And she starts crying. It was very sad. That is sad as hell. It was sad. It was sad. Nobody deserves that. Oh, and a teacher, an older female teacher, it's probably just a, you know, but it's like, come on, man, you're teaching about American history. You know that things in this country tend to fall apart, including your mural. Abruptly. Yeah. It's like you're attached to this mural. Hey, how about you let it, how about you put a fucking mural, a new mural up? Yeah. How about you put some colors on the fucking wall instead of us having to sit by this dreary old fucking creepy mural? I want some progress instead of gripping onto the past as tightly as you possibly can. It's not the goddamn 70s anymore. God damn it. We're human beings. We deserve a new mural. But anyway, so, you know, whatever, everyone's sitting there. They don't know how to react. And what happens is she apparently gives her list of suspected mural defacers to the principal and you're on it. And I'm on it. I knew it. And I get called into the fucking principal's office and I'm sitting there and he's like, did you, did, were you Duncan Tressel? I have here on good accord from Miss McClatchy that you are suspected to have defacing. Now I won't even call it defacing because it's much worse. I'm destroying the mural in her classroom. What do you have to say for yourself, Duncan? I didn't do it. Okay. Is there a reason you can provide some sort of proof about that? Because it seems to me that you've been saying some things in class and acting in a way that Miss McClatchy can't help but feel like you're a prime suspect. You're a smart boy. We know that. We know you can probably figure how to get in here and leave no trace. He even did one of these. He did one of these where he's like, Duncan, we know. That you are a part of the people who defaced that mural. Duncan, look, Duncan, Duncan, I like you. Your family's been in this community for a number of years but we know you defaced the mural. And there's two ways out of this. You can be hard about this and deny it all you want or you can just confess it up and talk about it and we'll figure out an appropriate punishment for an action of this sort that it's uncalled for. So Duncan, tell us why you did it. I didn't do it. Duncan, look, I don't have all day. There's a couple other people on this list but I know who's doing it. I know you work with some people. Look, you don't have to blame me. You don't have to tattle. I know you don't want to. I bet they twisted your arm into doing it, didn't they? I bet they twisted your arm. It's like, Duncan, I know you're a good boy. I know you probably got twisted into this. That is exactly what happened. And the final thing that he said to me was, he goes, Duncan, when he realizes I haven't done it, he can tell, he goes, Duncan, it looks to me that your life has gotten off on the wrong track. Now, this was, is like stuck with me ever since then because it's, I remember leaving there and thinking, is my life really on the wrong track? Oh, it's so influenced. Like, is it on the wrong track? Is it, is it, now he, now the truth of the matter was, I mean, I was taking LSD whenever I could. Really? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, it was one of our favorite pastimes was you would acquire LSD and you would take it in the morning, go to fucking, go to school on acid. Oh man, that's cool. I didn't do that. You would do that whenever you could because, you know, it was like, otherwise you're in this. Yeah, it's a way to get out. And you're seeing all this stuff, you know, that you normally wouldn't see. Those of you who are in high school, I'm not recommending that you do this. I'm not, it's, I'm not, I recommend you don't. I recommend you do it on Christmas break or some shit and do it at a river. We do, we do not know, Johnny doesn't recommend that anybody who is under the legal age do any kind of illegal anything. We're not saying to do it because in my old age, I've learned that you can get much more out of that substance from a very responsible usage of it, but, but we, we, this is how we used to spend time back in the, in the, in the, those days. And so anyway, the, the, the, the fucking, the, the, the fact that our children are being jammed into these goddamn hell mazes with their minds being infected with these kinds of like darts, these toxic darts, like that, that principle really could have, I bet you, if he'd wanted to at that moment. Got you to suck his dick. I would have, I did suck his dick. He could have easily got me to suck his dick. I bet that he could have though, he could have like done a lot of good for me at that moment. Like he could have really just been like, well, I had teachers that did both. You know, I definitely had some teachers that did a lot of good and I felt like I owe them a lot of stuff. It just, it's always that there's always both. I feel like most schools, I think most schools are both, well, these days, teachers are in hell. These teachers are in hell, man. I mean, these are, these teachers, these days, they're underpaid. Oh, they're all severely underpaid. Yeah, they're just, yeah. It's, it's fucking. They're not getting enough money, man. These teachers should be getting. They never have, though. Dr. Salaries. I don't think it's ever happened. It's never, it'll probably never will, it never has happened where teachers at that level get anything what they're probably deserved. No. They don't get paid what they deserve. But to be able to spend money on shit like $80,000 radar flights to check on a bomb site for a fucking drone strike at a wedding. That's it. That's the guy spending, I guess, spending a $5 million drone recon strike. That's it. Yeah, we, because that's, you know, and really that's where the, the, the horror, the secret hidden horror of it all comes, really comes into play, which is that every time you hear about a drone strike or every time you hear about how the United States is dropping bombs on ISIS or every time you hear about any kind of military action that the United States is responsible for in any part of the world. You are hearing money being removed from the bank accounts of teachers and placed in the bank accounts of weapons manufacturers. We would rather pay our weapons, we would have teachers are sculptors of life. Weapons manufacturers are sculptors of death. And we like to give money to those sculpting doom instead of giving money to those sculpting our children. That's the thing is we don't like to, it's just we, the powers in the hands of so few and everything's obfuscated to the point where you can't see what's happening. Like the best thing to look up right now is I think it's the F 35, the new fighter jet program that right now is a black hole of such significant proportions that anyone, even the most lightly educated person to read it would read about this shit would just be like, you're fucking kidding me. They have spent something like, I don't even know, I want to say a hundred billion dollars. Some astronomical amount of money on a jet that literally does not fly at all. It's not to supply keeps starting on fire and they keep ordering more of them. Why? It's like this thing where like, you know, remember they're trying to fix that oil well problem. The, the one in the, the one in the Gulf of Mexico recently, I kept doing stuff where it's like they would do something that wasn't working and they thought if you do more of what's not working, it'd make it work. So it's the same thing where they're funneling more money into this program thinking it will fix it when it's just making it more of a boondoggle and it's such an extreme amount of money for this fucking fighter jet that doesn't even work that to read about it, you just like, you can't help but be flabbergasted at the, the disparity between like that money. If you took like a 10% of that money and spent it on schools, you would have fucking like the best schools in the entire world 10 times over. That's all it take all because it's fucking fighter jet that came and fly. That, see, this is, this is the, it's like, it's just maddening. This is why we've got to turn our attentions in the direction of what, and this is a fun thing to imagine. And no matter how, like, because a lot of, it's really interesting how the power of imagination in your own mind has security guards that if you decide to imagine something that's too ridiculous, you'll actually get an alarm system set off in your brain, which is like, that'll never happen. So don't even bother thinking about it. And it's funny if you really want to get in a deep woo, woo shit. It's funny if the great architects have already recognized the fact that the force of human attention is so powerful that it tends to shape reality and they've managed to condition the human mind with these internal force fields to keep all of us from imagining these kinds of utopian societies because they know if enough people did it, it would move in that direction. But just for fun, if you just imagine somehow by some miracle, all war ends, right? All that money goes into the schools. Now imagine what a high school would look like if it had added to its budget the economy of the military industrial complex where kids are sitting in these like really nice fucking chairs. The teachers are getting paid $200,000 a year and it's a very competitive, competitive, competitive industry where people, where if you get hired as a fucking public school teacher, it's the same as like getting, getting in at like a Harvard or Princeton or something. Or working at Northrop Grumman as a fucking warhead designer. Yes, yes, yes. Where these fucking teachers who are teaching these classes are so smart and they've, you know, they've really, really had to like just go through a billion interviews to get into the fucking job and now kids are getting these incredible educations. Imagine that. Imagine what that school would look like. What the bathrooms would look like. Imagine what the lockers would look like. It would be great. But there's also a think about that. I also think about the opposite of it is like some of the things that I like more than anything in the world were created in the most difficult of circumstances, right? Like like reggae music or any music for that matter. Yeah. If you think about any music you like, chances are did not come from a person who had a lot of money to spend. And that's true. It's the opposite. Like there's always like things that happen. So I like you're saying my favorite flowers are the ones that grow from the sidewalk cracks. Yeah. But it's true. Cause like you think about anything, any type of repression has always created the greatest art. Yeah. But let me tell you something. Not that we need to. I want to test that fucking theory because I think that if we like, if we started treating kids in high schools and junior high schools like they were human fucking beings and not like cattle that were moving into the goddamn corporatocracy slaughterhouses. If we, I don't even know if that made sense at all, but it makes sense. Slaughterhouses, the corporatocracy, the mind slaughterhouses, if we start treating these fucking kids with the respect that we would give goddamn Napoleon, who wasn't much older than some of these kids, if we recognize that these, these fucking kids have just as much potential as the Steve Jobs and treat every single one of them with the same respect and care that we treat our warheads with, then I think that we, this within a few fucking generations, this country would invent teleportation or a time machine or who knows what? That's all. It's fun to imagine. It's great to imagine. I think it's all, it definitely makes sense. It's about respect. It's about respecting. Instead of telling someone what they could do, it's telling someone, oh, you can do whatever you want to do. And we're treating you like that. Yeah. And the food. The food, yeah, that's a big thing. Imagine how good the food at high schools would get if we had the military industrial complexes money, where these kids are getting fed four-star meals. The chefs there are like incredible chefs. It's all sustainable. It's all local. Everything is run on solar or like, run on like minimal programs that use renewable resources. All that stuff. Delicious food, entertainment, during lunch, that stuff kids would like. It's happening in certain places. It is happening in certain places. And I feel like as much as it is disheartening to learn about the disparity in money being spent for education versus military, to all these places now, they're really successful smaller charter-type schools that are having that, implementing that type of thing. And I feel like it's something that will, if it's an idea that's good, it will spread. It'll spread. I sure hope so. I think I'd like to hope it will spread. If you think about it, it will spread. That kids need, and with the continued legalization of marijuana, a reduction in the prescription of ADD medication, they get to get prescribed powerful sativas so that you could, instead of getting the shitty goddamn pharmaceutical dreck in your brain, you're getting to enjoy getting the best information that we have, that's being given to you in an entertaining way by super trained teachers while under the influence of super potent strains of God bless America, marijuana. That, and also just, here's what we saw of everything in an instant. All you have to do is in every school, all you have to do is teach meditation, that we fix everything. Yes. If you teach meditation to kids, it is, it's like fucking, it's like the cure-all. That needs to be at least two hours of the day or dedicated to meditation and relaxation. There needs to be an every, I mean it would be an explosive reaction. It would be something where it would fucking burn the goddamn world down with this wild fire of the kind that doesn't burn things. You know what I mean? Like, like a positive fire, I don't know what that would be about. That positive, well we don't know, but it would be something that would be very healing and everyone's like, oh we gotta compete with fucking China. Yeah. No we don't. We don't have to compete with shit. We've gotta make our kids happy so that they can be happy adults so that our society can prosper in the way that it needs to prosper. That, that's, if you wanna compete with China, that's how you do it, just get the kids meditating. Yeah. You'll be on the same wavelength and we'll all be on the same vibrational frequency where there is no competition. Yes. So this is one big push forward, this big oof. You poor kids out there, man. You guys need spas in your school, you know. They need spas. Like there needs to be. I'll tell you what I could have used. What? This little place to go and get an anonymous hand job as a 16-year-old just to blow off that steam, man. There's so much building up in that steam factory now. All the fucking, get it out of me. So that's another thing, man, you know, cause maybe with like, get it out as we develop robotic technology that could be in the spas. Just dump that, just pump and dump. It's funny how like, you're like a printed one with breasts, you don't have to know up, you have to pump your breasts if you're pregnant. Yeah. Right? Cause it's like, it hurts. It builds up and it hurts. I mean, I remember being in high school and just like, I don't want this boner. You're right. It was a nightmare. God. Cause that was an inevitability in high school. Get this rock hard sword away from me. You're right, man. That's so, I like that our high school rant started off with like something that kind of makes sense. Teachers get paid more. Let's, let's. Teach meditation. That's what we ended with. Let's get the marijuana and hand jobs and all the things fell apart. Well, you know, if they meditate enough, they'll get their shit together and they can figure out a way to make everyone happy. Meditation makes sense. Uh, I could, but the, but yeah, I don't know, man, but you know, the, um, the, it is possible though. All these things are possible. Yeah. We don't have to torture our children to make them better people and we don't have to make our teachers this whole fucking thing where you, the government decides what teachers have to standard. I don't know what it's called. There's a name. The standardized testing thing. This whole bullshit where the teachers are forced to teach specific things at certain times. No. I haven't seen the John Oliver show much. No. It's pretty great. I got to say, I watch it every time I'm like, wow, I didn't know that about that thing. And now I wish I didn't know about that because it's maddening. You talk about that whole issue of standardized testing how this teacher is like, I have a, I have three graduate degrees in English and I got a bad score on this English test because it's the same thing where all the companies are in bed with the people who are paying them. So it's just this, this is a classic case of, uh, everything like the same way everything is bought and paid for. So they're, they haven't, they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo. Well, listen to this, friends. We got to go. It's heating up in my podcast studio, but my dear darlings, you can change the world. All you got to do is start with yourself and then the flowers of paradise can grow into this country. I'm trying to throw it sing. Yeah. Let's, let's both throw it sing. Thank you, Johnny.

Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Here's some more. This is day five and I did a copy in Emma and it released a bunch more of this plaque from Michael and it's like rubber literally. This is clogging up our digestive system and it's what is being absorbed into our blood. Toxins. Creating cancer. Here's some more. Look up how to give yourself a copy in Emma and then give yourself a copy in Emma. That is my opening monologue. The Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast is going on tour. I'm going to be in San Francisco on the 30th of September with Chris Ryan, the author of Sex at Dawn. Also going to be in Portland in October 1st with Chris Ryan. Then off to Seattle with Johnny Pemberton on the 2nd of October. And finally in Vancouver at the Northwest Podcast Fest with Daniele Bolely. I'd love to see you guys out there. You can go to DunkinTrustle.com and get tickets to any of these live podcast recordings. I'm also going to be in Calgary on October 5th at the Laugh Shop doing stand-up comedy. You can get tickets at DunkinTrustle.com and for God's sake, don't procrastinate. Go get the tickets right now. There's no sense putting it off and then not being able to get tickets if the show sells out and they're moving really fast. So go do that now. The Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast is brought to you by Amazon. You can go through the Amazon portal located at DunkinTrustle.com. Anything that you buy, they'll give us a small percentage of whatever that happens to be. So instead of risking getting Ebola or getting beheaded by someone from ISIS or running into an old friend from high school the next time you are thinking about heading down to the drug store to get paper towels or toilet paper, go through the portal at DunkinTrustle.com and let those sweeties over at Amazon deliver a nice, gigantic, cargo-sized box of toilet paper. Why buy one toilet paper roll at a time, especially if you're going to give yourself a coffee enema, which, by the way, will transform your life. It probably will have the same effect as sitting down and reading Alan Watts for a year and a half. Just one simple coffee enema. Blow out all the chiba-choo crust that is accrued inside of your colon. If you're somebody like me who enjoys eating edible marijuana you will be shocked, horrified and somewhat delighted to find that the stuff that comes spraying out of you smells like edible marijuana and you'll realize that that has been caked inside of your large intestine for countless months. So buy your enema bag from Amazon. Go through the portal located at DunkinTrustle.com. Transform your life. Avoid Ebola and support the DDFH all at the very same time. We're also brought to you by Audible. You can go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour. If you sign up for a trial membership, you'll get a free audiobook. You can cancel at any time. You still get to keep the audiobook. That's an incredible deal when you think about the fact that these audiobooks are upwards of 30 hours long. One of my favorite things to do is to listen to a Michael Beckwith audiobook while running on the treadmill. The combination of the two things make you feel as though you are evolving to become some kind of superhuman godling. We also have a shop located at DunkinTrustle.com. Go there if you want a t-shirt or a cool poster. Alright, that's it. Today's guest is a brilliant comedian and a friend of mine from the comedy store. His name's Nick Youssef. He's got a new album out on iTunes. He's not owning this. You can also get that at All Things Comedy. You can check him out at his website, NickYoussef.com. These links are going to be up at DunkinTrustle.com. If you want to go see him live, he's going to be performing September 26th to the 28th at the improv with Bobby Lee in Washington, D.C. If you're out that way, go see him perform. Say hello and tell him you heard him on the DunkinTrustle Family Hour podcast. Give him a big hug. Pull his lips down and lick his gums. Flick your tongue against the whites of his eyeballs and use that glowing black skull you keep in your purse to open an interdimensional portal. Carry him there into the land of gargoyles and introduce him to the great Dark King so that he can know truth as we all know truth. Everybody, please welcome to the DunkinTrustle Family Hour podcast, Nick Youssef. Welcome to the DunkinTrustle Family Hour podcast. Here's some more. Nick Youssef, welcome to the DunkinTrustle Family Hour podcast. Hello. Hello. It's good to be here. It's good to be here. Yeah, you know, man, I'm excited to have you on the show because you actually outside of, like, Ari, are one of the, and I haven't had Ari on forever, but you're one of the only people from the comedy store that I've had on the show yet that I can think of and only roll through my head. Yeah, for some reason I haven't had a lot of people from over there on the show. Really? I got to start doing that, but that's, for those of you listening, I never say that. You know, I came up at the comedy store and I still perform at the comedy store and Nick is what they call comedy store family. Yeah. Which is an actual thing because it's kind of a community and you get to know people there in the same way you get to know members of your family, you get to know everybody's ups and downs. We see each other probably, or for a while we did, probably more than our own actual families. Absolutely, yeah. Me and you, it was five days a week. Yeah. Every day in the phone room, you were upstairs as the talent coordinator. Yeah, that's, oh my God. It was every day. Every day. Yeah. And the place is like a fascinating place because it's so sticky, isn't it? Oh yeah. It's a sticky place. People, you get to see like not just comedians come and go, but you see some people who've been there forever who show up and will probably be there as long as the place exists. What's your prognosis? How long do you think the comedy store is going to be in existence? That's one of those questions where every guest you have is always like, well, I was wrong about that because every time something happens, like Mitzi is, you know, ill. You're like, oh, she's only got a few years. It's going to be shut down. And then it, like it goes another four or five years. Right. And then it ends up like, it starts doing better. Like business is good. And then comedy in general is good. So business there gets better. And you're like, is this place just going to keep going? I don't know. Nobody knows. People try to predict this. Now, here's what's interesting about the comedy store. I think it's a fascinating thing. It's a bubble. It's a, it's a bubble of power. And for people who haven't been inside a bubble of that, a bubble like that, you don't, you can't possibly understand the level of drama that is always seething through that place. And I can remember when I was working there talking to my brother as the talent, I was talking to my brother. I'm the talent coordinator. And something had happened where Joe Rogan, they were going to reduce the amount of time that he was going to be able to work out there. Yeah. I remember talking to my brother and with this kind of like furious intensity, being like, Jeff, I don't know why they're doing this, man, but like Joe, like, bought a sound system for the place and they're going to, they're going to, they're going to fucking, they're going to take away some of his time. And I was like really caught up in the temporal drama that was happening to my brother. I remember that I still remember this long pause and he's like, Duncan, you got to quit that job. Yeah, exactly. He's exactly right. Yeah. He's exactly right. You can't, and it goes with almost everything. If you can't let yourself get too emotionally involved with just one aspect of, of the, in this case, like the entertainment industry, which is something you're, you know, you're trying to get into at the time, you know, you're younger. You're like, I need a home. I need somewhere to work out and develop my craft, but you can't just spend all your time focusing everything just in one place because it only is one place. You know, like if you only live in one city and you think that city is everything and the culture of that city is, is everything, you start to travel a little bit and you go like, wow, there are people that have never even been to Los Angeles. Right. The lives are all here and there's a culture there and then they have friends here and, and people that they know and places that they go to and like, to them, that's, that's, you know, the world, but it helps to just get a little bit of, of everything. You want experience and whatever you're doing, like, everywhere. It can't just be one place. No, I mean, absolutely not. And it's, and it's important or real because, you know, these, it's like in every single little, every place is a bubble of drama. A Starbucks, the White House, whatever it is, raging within that place is a life and death struggle or what people perceive as a life and death struggle because I know that not, not even at the comedy store, but other jobs I've had or other situations that I've been in. My mind will focus in on this one point of self, which is usually identified with your home life or relationship, your job. And it's so easy to forget what you're saying, which is right now all over the world. There are these wildfire drama is burning at all the different jobs and homes across the world, but none of it is really that important. Yeah, it's all just like, it all just exists in that bubble. That's right. And the more you travel around and talk to different people and see different places, you get to like peek into those different bubbles and you go like, oh, that's just as important. Your problem here is just as important as mine there in that bubble. But like the more I've just kind of traveled all over the country, for example, and met different people and performed in different comedy clubs, you realize that like, sure, those things are like, they're kind of important because they do involve your friends and people that you've developed. Like emotional connections to on whatever level. But to take it that seriously, like your brother was sitting there going like, wow, this this moment right now where where they're taking away this person's stage time is not that big of a deal for you. Right. You know. And also, and it all completely worked out for the better anyway, because I think Joe is completely happy. Oh, yeah. It's just like a nice little ice house and like selling out whatever shows he does there. All over the country. Yeah, all over the country. I think for him, the drama in his mind was probably less than the drama in my mind, my mind had just decided to fixate on that particular thing. But from a bigger perspective, like, I was just reading this book Cosmic Trigger by Robert Anton Wilson. You ever read that? No, no. Fucking cool. But he writes in the book. Spoiler. I don't know how long, but he writes about how his daughter was murdered at the store that she worked at. And how as he was meditating on suddenly losing a daughter, which for a parent they say losing a kid is just nothing like that, that you can experience as far as pain goes. He was still cognizant of the fact that all over the world in every moment people are losing their children, their daughters, their sons. They're constantly kids are constantly dying, but those deaths seem irrelevant to us compared to the deaths of our own children. Like, we can't spread our minds out enough to feel the pain when, you know, when you hear like a airstrike accidentally kills 20 Palestinian kids. Yeah. You don't feel anything more than kind of a nausea or like your God humans are fucked up, but there's your, your life isn't crushed. Yeah, it's too distant. Too distant. But like if you're, if your dog died, you would feel the pain you probably should feel for 20 humans. Yeah. You'd feel that same pain. We're like, Oh, it was my dog, though, it was part of my bubble. You know, I had it for 12, 13 years and that's like emotionally devastating. But when, you know, people die because of missiles falling out of the sky just by accident or, you know, for whatever other reason, you're just like, man, this world's cold. Yeah, that's it. And your reaction is cold. Yeah. You know, it's like, wow, but it's hard to feel that that same level of, you know, emotion for literally everything that happens. Like I think like in a way there's a part of your mind that kind of like that blocks that out because it's, it's too much. It's too overwhelming. If you actually did feel all the pain in all of the world, like you would never get anything done. And that's a funny thing, you know, that idea of productivity being the most important thing, you know, like productivity being more important than empathy. And I think that is a kind of part of the programming of the industrial revolution is that the most important thing is to tighten up your belt and you're put on your tie and don't feel for the next 30 years. Yeah. If you're still feeling tighten that tie a little tighter. Yeah. Don't feel produce production over empathy always because it's true. If the world began to feel true empathy or began to really connect to the terrible truth that all beings around this planet are suffering in some way or another. And if you could tune into that and survive whatever that felt like, then yeah, you would probably, it wouldn't be important anymore to go to work. Yeah. Or you wouldn't really probably want to do anything for yourself anyway. You'd probably get into a place where you just wanted to start doing stuff for other people. Yeah. I mean, it would be hard to, yeah, it would be hard to live the like the life you're supposed to live, you know, where it's like you look out for yourself, you make money, take care of yourself, buy nice things, you know, get a, you know, raise a family and all this other stuff. But if you did put all, yeah, all that time and energy into thinking about all the pain and suffering in the world and how it's not fair and how it's, it's, it's a terrible way to exist on a planet, you know, we all share. Like you would, you would either never get anything done as far as like, you know, productivity over empathy goes. Or you hopefully would just like realize like, you know what, all this, all this time and effort I'm putting into like making all this money because money is important and buying a nice car is like, maybe I'll just buy less things and donate more. Maybe I'll just give to others, but it's hard to find enough people around you that are like even supportive of that. And, you know, to do it with you, it becomes just like, I'm, I'm doing this on my own or like, where, where should I do it? Should I physically go to Africa and like help people or do I volunteer for a habitat for humanity? Like what, what direction do I lead? I know. Like my, my life. And then it just kind of becomes easier to be like, you know what, there's too much, there's too much going on out there. I'm only one person. I can't make a difference. So I'm just going to try and like be a good person in my bubble. In my bubble. In my bubble. Yeah. Or in the bubble of this, of conditioning and whatever society that you're in. Because what you just described is going, it's like going outside the safety of the campfire light that is whatever the particular operating system you've been assigned by the culture you were born into. Yeah. And your wheel, like, yeah, same here. When I started thinking about that idea of like, well, yeah, okay. So what would it be like if suddenly I only took what I needed to barely survive. And then the rest of it, I just started giving to people who desperately need food, regardless of where they're at. Yeah. Just start trying to feed people. When you start thinking about that, you're like. It's overwhelming, right? It's overwhelming. It's like, well, how would I, like, how, you know, how would you be doing a podcast? Because you'd have to put money into that. You'd have to put money into driving places. How would I buy thermal imaging fucking cases for my iPhone so I could see my dog's heat signatures? Right. You know, this is the, this is a very curious place to get your mind into. And I think it's a place a lot of people don't like to spend much time in is really considering that kind of like the idea that when you, if there is an afterlife, which maybe there isn't. But if there were, people are just going to look at you like, well, you got to go back into the training academy again, because the only thing you're supposed to learn here is that you help other people. Yeah. Maybe that's the one big lesson of this human incarnation is the only important thing is to give more than you receive. I don't know. I don't know about it. I think guilt starts coming then. Then you start getting into a guilt place. And there's some people who say, okay, well, great. Now you're just a fucking, now you got white guilt. Don't you? You've got just a honky guilt right now because you're upset because you're, you're, you're doing great. That's even worse. That's the worst thing you can do. It's like, so now not only do you have more than like say people in 90% of the planet that we live in, which if you live in America, isn't the idea that you're better. Okay. Isn't the idea that you basically have more than like, or if you live in the, what they call the, what the first world, isn't the idea that we have more than more material luxuries than the majority of the planet. Like there's, yeah. The rest of it combined. Or we also consume more of the earth's natural resources than I think all the rest of the world. Was it maybe not China at this point, but there was a time where America consumed more of the earth's natural resources than like all of Africa and, you know, parts of Asia and South America combined. Because there, a lot of those countries were living with nothing. Right. Some were oil rich and they would be able to, you know, pull that out of the ground, but we would just, we'd buy it. We'd take it and we'd use it because we, you know, we need to be on top. Yes. We have ourselves to take care of. Right. You know, and then that trickles down into like, you know, teaching your children the same exact thing. Right. Just like, you need, we need to be on top. You need to be number one. You need to be making money. You need to be successful and wealthy and immaterial. You need to be productive, motherfucker. Yeah. You need to be productive because I don't want no scrub. A scrub is a guy who won't get no love from me. Yeah. You need to be taking out the passenger side of your best friend's ride, trying to holler at me. Yeah. Are you fucking serious? You don't even, you're not even in debt to the banks for the car that you're riding in. Yeah. You need to be deeply in debt to some kind of bank and paying them a high monthly rate on the thing that you don't even own. If you want to put your cock in my pussy. Yeah. That's sad. And it's all part of this conditioning. Have you ever gotten into that place where you find yourself not doing something and then are immediately assuaged by guilt? Have you ever felt that? Not doing what? What type of thing? Anything? Laying in your bed. You're laying in bed and there's nothing to do and you're not doing anything. You're not sending emails. You're not doing anything. You're sitting down for a little while not doing something and then some part of your mind starts attacking you. I feel that feeling from the moment I wake up and then intermittently throughout the day until I go to sleep. Wow. Because you are, you're supposed to and now more than ever with what we do. It's a do it yourself. Yes. Industry. Yeah. It's like you got to be out there. You got to be making shit. If you're awake, you better be writing something. You better be recording a podcast. You better be filming a video. You better be doing stand up. You better be taking an acting class. You better be auditioning. And that's, those are all like supposed to be the most important things. And then it's all the other stuff like, well, what if I just want to read for enjoyment? What if I want to hang out with friends and not have it be because it could be some opportunity that I could be, you know, it's, there's so much going on. And there's so much you're supposed to be doing. It's hard to like find time to actually just sit down and be like, well, what just makes me happy right now? What do I just want to do that brings me enjoyment? Because those thoughts and like that, that mindset is actually what will bring you long term happiness. It's not just what you're supposed to be doing because you hear these stories all the time where it goes, well, millionaires aren't happy. The most successful people in the world are actually miserable. And I always hear those stories and I go like, I mean, it's got to be, there's, there's truth to that. There's these people that sacrifice literally everything in their life just for success. All their friendships are based on, is this going to make me successful? Everything they do from the moment they get up until they go to sleep is just because they need to be successful. And then they get all that money and they have the cars and they have all their debts and they have all these other things. And then they're not happy. And I think like the guilt that I feel comes from that kind of thing where since I was younger, I'm like, I want to, I want to do this for a living. I want to be an artist. But at the same time, you're like, I also want to be successful because that way people will know about you as an artist and you'll be allowed to continue to do more of what you want to do. But over the years, it's just like one starts to take over the, like how much of this work work am I supposed to put in for something I just wanted to do for the love of it? Yeah, there's a great, I can't remember who wrote it, it's a famous short story. And it's about this rich guy who kept saying like after he gets, when he gets some time, he's going to start buying some pagodas. And I guess it's like some rich guy in a Buddhist country and buying a pagoda is like a kind of like charitable thing that you do. And he's always putting off this time when he's going to do, you know, start, it represents a true spiritual practice. And always putting it off, always putting it off. And then he just dies. But yeah. Oops. You never got, you never got around to that, did you? Yeah. You never got around to it. And it's one of, maybe one of the satanic aspects of being an artist in Los Angeles is that you actually, this terrible helix emerges where there's the thing that wants to express itself, which is your stand up, and then there's the business side that gets wrapped around it. Yeah. And you can actually, you know, look at every single comedian and see the balance there of like some comedians are all business and a little bit of comedy and some comedians are all comedy and no business. Yeah. And there's everything in between, but the two get mixed together so much. And, you know, that this is the, to me, like that, you know, that song, Jen and Juice. Yeah. It's almost describing paradise, rolling down the street, smoke and endow, sipping on Jen and Juice. Layed back. And then what's the next line? With my mind on my money and my money on my mind. What the fuck? Yeah. That's like almost paradise. And then that lyric comes and just shits all over it. It's like you're driving down your street. You've managed to feel okay drinking fucking booze while you drive. That's cool. I was doing that. Whenever one of my friends jumps in my car and they have a beer, I'm always like, you got to go to fucking AA right now. If you got to drink beer while you're driving. That's how neurotic I am. I can never do it. Much less smoking at joint. At the same time. At the same time. I'm getting fucking wasted. Layed back. He's relaxed. With my mind on my money and my money. And now it's, wait, you're just thinking about money, you dick? Yeah. That sounds stressful. Yeah. Yeah. The next verse was like. Retired. Retired. Yeah. You're like, oh, okay. Well, that's fine then. With my mind on Picasso and Picasso on my mind. Yeah. Anything. There's a cool quote about him from him actually that says sometime it's something that the effect of sometimes it's just better to lay down. Which I always found, I always found reassuring because of a guy like that who's a world renowned respected artist. Yes. Right. He did it all. One of the coolest people on earth. Yeah. So if he can say something like that, well, you know what? Sometimes it's just better to lay down. Okay. Maybe I don't need to be just clawing my fucking eyes out all day going, what do, what am I supposed to do next? Sometimes you're like, you know what? Just I'm going to put everything down. I'm going to clear my mind and just lay here and just let whatever comes to my mind. Yeah. Surface. And then I'm just going to think about that and then think about something else or just nothing. Yeah. And then like you kind of, you kind of like spiritually recharge. Yeah. I feel like, because then you're like, you know what? I'm going to take it easy today. I'm going to like, I'm going to write whatever I feel like. I'm just, I'm going to watch a movie. I've been always meaning to watch. Yeah. And then like later that day or sometimes the next day you wake up and you feel a little more centered. And you're, you're just kind of reminded a little bit of what is actually important to you. You're like, you know what? I'm not going to perform anywhere tonight. I'm going to hang out with a friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while and we're just going to talk. We're just going to laugh and talk about something funny, sad, serious. We don't report for a podcast. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. See the, what you're talking about, I think is the, is what's considered to be the, the state mystics are in all the time, which is they have identified that money or the pursuit of material success is or not the pursuit, but the, but material success itself is a byproduct of a deeper connection to a thing that is primary to whatever particular way that the culture that you're born in during whatever part of the time space continuum you got shot out of a pussy into whatever way that they're using it, which right now are these like rectangles and not digits. That's how we're representing this stuff. And so your mind getting caught up in rectangles and digits as a way to make you happy is like trying to get a tan by looking at pictures of the sun. It can't possibly work because these are symbolic representations of potentialities. That's all money is, is a potentiality. It's nothing else. So this is like Meister Eckhart talks, he was this Christian mystic. He talks about the idea that your boss, I'm putting this into my own words, but you're job is an intimate deep connection with God. Now, if you're an atheist, you don't like that term. You could say it's a connection with the life force. It's a connection with universal consciousness or it's just the, it's waking up to the fact that you are literally the entire universe or one will piece the quadrant of the universe experiencing existence. And if you make that your focus, then the other stuff naturally starts coming. You know, it's like the other, then that's when you'll get the big ideas. I have, man, I have noticed again and again and again, the most success I experienced in my life is happening in the moments of least activity in my life. Really? That's when phone calls come in. That's when like suddenly job opportunities pop up is when I loosen up and relax. That's by the way, sex, sex. Think about the difference between sex when you're thinking about either making her come or you coming versus sex where you're just thinking about the moment itself and the experience of that moment. It's two different fucking feelings altogether. Oh yeah, absolutely. There's way less stress in the latter. Yeah. You know, you're just, you're, you're just experiencing each other and nothing else. You forget the room is even there. You forget that you're on a bed. You're just involved with one another. It's like, it's like the one of the most when done right, you know, it's not just like, I'm wasted. I want to get laid. You know, when done right, it's like one of the more spiritual experiences you can have with another person without having to be, you know, praying or doing anything like directly spiritual. It is praying. I think it is praying. I think it is spiritual and I think it is a meditation and there's, in fact, it's more, I mean, like, yeah, that is literally a meditation. You're connecting to another being and you're creating a circuit that your life energy is rolling through and that, and it's one of the most powerful things is when it's, it's you're creating like a love echo chamber where like love is like being amplified and amplified and amplified. Yeah. That's a whole different thing. It's just like that idea of if I, if we go to a nice restaurant together, there's this great place, man, in Culver City called In Naka. It's the nicest place I've ever eaten. You got to get a reservation. They only let people with reservations in. You can't even walk up. See, and the reservations are sometimes like months in advance to get a reservation. I went to this place. It's like ridiculously expensive. Like you really have to have had some kind of big payday to make sense of it or just be a rich person. Yeah. Or recently like robbed someone. Yeah. But you go there and they bring out these tiny little portions, but I don't remember how many courses, man, so many courses and every, every bite that you take is the most incredible, perfectly balanced mixture of flavors that you've ever experienced. Now, if you were rushing through that, I mean, what, what are you doing? You're just wasting the whole point of the experience, you know? Yeah. And I think that this disease that people in the West have, this sense of like, fuck, man, I got to keep going. On to the next one. I'm running out of time today. This week's almost over. I can't believe it's already September. Yeah. What did you do this year? What did you enjoy this year? Like I remember last year, I, I had wanted to do this, this charity bike ride, right? And I was like, I need to, I've been wanting to do it for like a few years. Yeah. And I usually use this as an example for like when I feel like I'm, I've been living a life that's, you know, too selfish, too self-involved and it doesn't make me happy. Yeah. So what can I do to feel connected with other parts of the world or other groups of people that I, I'm never in contact with? What are other people experiencing and feeling and, and, you know, how can I help? How can I do something that just isn't for me, you know, just, it's just giving. It's just putting out into the world, you know? So I wanted to do this, this, uh, this charity bike ride, right? It goes from San Francisco to Los Angeles and it's all for charity. You ride your bike for seven days. It's badass. Yeah. So I wanted to do it for years and I was like, you know what? I keep noticing with myself is that, and it reminded me when you told me the story of that guy who was going to get that, whatever you call it, that thing. Pagodas. Pagodas. Yeah. And he died. Um, I keep telling myself, I'm going to do it. But you know what? Not, not yet. Cause I have this other thing to do. Yeah. That's supposed to be important, but I could do that whenever, you know? Yeah. This is only going to take seven days. One week. How many weeks are in a year? 52 of them. All right. I can't just, I can't put aside one week out of the year to help other people. When it's something that deep down inside, I keep telling myself, I need to do this. This would bring me fulfillment because it, I want to help other people. I really want to. It's not just, and this, it's the argument that people make with charity all the time. Well, no charity is ever selfless. It's always a little, but those are usually the people, by the way, that aren't charitable, that don't want to do anything. So they, they find a way out. They go, you know what? It's never selfless anyway. So what's the point? It's like the drudge report always posts stories about how exercise is somehow harmful. Like any kind of anything like that. Cause the people who go to the drudge report are all fucking fat, lazy shit. And they know they'll click the link. Like, I knew exercise was bad. And they go like, well, you spent all your time at the gym. Like, yeah, you know what I'm doing? Fucking reading. It's like, you can do both. Yeah, no shit. You can do both. No shit. Especially since after you exercise, you're more mentally alert and you feel good. And that's just more time for reading and doing other things. Yeah. So anyway. Yeah, we live in a fallen world. So no matter what you do, there's going to be a little bit of the contaminant of greed on it. I don't know of any way to escape from it because that's, we are selfish because we're a self. And there's no way around it. Go on though. Yeah. So I decided, I was like, you know what, I'm, I'm going to do this. I'm going to sign up and I'm going to raise money like as much as I possibly can. And I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this bike ride and it's going to be great. And that's what I told myself. And then I did, I spent like two months training, going all these like training rides all over LA and just really like pushing myself physically to these limits where I was like, this is going to be difficult. But it's like, you know what, just, just get out there and do it and try. There's no failure in this. There's no failure. None. You just try and if you don't do it, it's like, well, then tomorrow, the next day. And I trained and I trained in between that you're, you know, raising money, you're calling people, you're emailing people, you're asking for money and help. And then I raised more money than I thought I ever could now. And it was a feeling of like, it brought me like the satisfaction where I was like, I actually, I never thought I could raise this much money. You set a goal at like, it's going to be 3000. And then you're like, you get to that goal and you're like, wow, and you keep raising it to five to 10, higher and higher and higher. And, and it just felt good and you'd get phone calls from people that you've never met saying like, thank you for doing this. Wow. And you're like, wow. And you, then you have conversations with people that you already know that are like, Hey, you know, HIV has affected someone in my family. I think it's, it's great that you're doing this and more people should be doing things like this. And you're like, all, all this time I could have been, I could have done this three years ago and then two years ago and last year. And what, what, what has it done to hurt my life? Nothing. There's people that like, I have no time for anything else except moving upwards in my own life. And it's like, I, I was able to do this and it's brought other people happiness and joy and me as well. And nothing has changed. I only feel better about living in this world. Yeah. And it's like, and I've been putting it off for, I've been putting off the feeling of making the world in even the tiniest way, slightly better. I've been putting that feeling off because I'm like, I should be going on stage more or like talking to the right people and hanging out with the right people and going to certain parties. And I couldn't just put seven days off. And this was before even the bike ride happened. Then we're driving up to San Francisco and then you're riding your bike in, in, through the, in, in road, back roads. I'm sorry, through wineries and mountains down through the coast and back. And every day you're stopping at a different location where they'd set up all these like tents and like, it was basically like this tent city. Sounds like heaven. And you're meeting people and no one, no one has their phones. No one has computers. You're just, They tell you no phones. You're not allowed to have your, your, uh, headphones on while you're riding. Wow. And there's really no charging stations. So you're, you're basically have your phone off all day. You take a few pictures here and there that you could post at night if you want or just to have, but you, you realize, well, I, I need to obviously save all my battery just in case of an emergency or whatever else. So you're just not using it. So then you get up at five AM and then you're out just smelling fresh air, riding through farmland and winery, stopping at little random places where people, this ride goes through every year where people are just out on the street side, giving you free food. Like here's free strawberries that we grow. Have like, here's little sample sandwiches cause we grow avocados here and here's like an avocado or whatever sandwich. It sounds literally like heaven. Yeah. It sounds like an surreal experience of being in heaven. Yeah. And that's an idea, you know, this, that's like an idea that is in the, the really mysterious thing in the New Testament that Jesus says, which is the kingdom of heaven is at hand and is, it's here, the kingdom of heaven is here. And that's the idea that there is a frequency you can tune into and the dimension that we exist in right now that is paradise. Yeah. But you can't tune into that fucking frequency as long as you're serving yourself. Somehow, the moment you start serving other people, immediately, it's as though somebody put or took off shitty glasses that you'd been wearing, like you've been wearing fogged up craft glasses. With the dollar signs on them. Yeah, you've been wearing those shitty dollar signs. That's all you see is the fucking shadow of a dollar on all things. In the moment. There's money there. There's some more there. You'll get it. Yeah. Then you take it off and then you see, you're like, oh, the world isn't tinted green. There's many colors. Yeah. There's red. There's blue. There's yellow. There's white. There's, there's many colors. And the feeling, man, there's a feeling that suddenly you begin to experience and it's a brand new feeling and there's nothing better than a brand new feeling in a world where most people think they felt everything. So many people think they felt it all by the time you get to a certain age, you just know everything, man. Yeah. This is that concept that Zen, the state of enlightenment or awareness is, it's the beginner's mind. It's the feeling of not knowing anything for the first time of suddenly being like, oh, shit. This is a bigger universe than I expected, but you can only do it, man. The only way into that motherfucker is by helping. Yeah. Somehow. It's just a simple thing. It seems kind of obvious. Like it really doesn't seem, I mean, it seems pretty much like the most obvious thing ever. If we're, if there's a house fire, you, if you saw a house on fire and you heard kids yelling inside, what would you do? You'd go in there and help. Well, you're a pussy. No, I'm just kidding. Yeah, yeah. That was just a dumb. You idiot. Trick question. No. You'd go in and help. Yeah. No, it's a no brainer. Anyone would do it. Right. If you were at the beach and you saw somebody drowning, if you were a strong enough swimmer, you'd go and try to save them. If you were in any situation where a person needed help, and I think this is for the majority of people, though I'm sure there's some pig shits out there who wouldn't do anything, but I think the majority of people, if they see suffering in front of them, they're going to go and help the suffering, the majority of people. But somehow, if the suffering is one state away, or if the suffering is just something you read about, but you don't see it, that's when you're like, ugh, I just don't have time to do that kind of shit. I just don't have time to help. I really don't. Or you write it off as like, well, there's people out there that are there to help. There's something in place. Yeah. Someone will help. Or some people even think like, well, America is going to go help. Do you still do that bike charity? I did it last year. It's just once a year. Are you going to do it this year? It just happened in June. I might do it next year. What's the name of the charity? It's called AIDS Lifecycle. AIDS Lifecycle, guys. Why don't you sign up for that? Because there's some people I know who listen to this who are serious bike riders because I yap about it all the time because it's paradise, man. That's great. It's a, but you're like a hardcore cyclist. I try to be. You are. Like you are, man. You're, you're a fucking like, you could tell you, you obviously are like constantly right. How many miles a week do you think you're right? You're right. Um, if I'm not on the road or something, I try and do like 10 miles a day. Wow. Which is not a lot. It's, it's. On a bike, it isn't. That's a, that's a, that. If I remember the first time I rode 10 miles on a bike, I felt like a goddamn Lance Armstrong. Yeah. I felt like a bad ass. You're like, I can conquer anything. Yeah. I remember I did like 14 miles one day and my legs were sore and I got home and I'm just like, well, this is all that life is. This is all I'm, I can do. I want to do. Um, yeah. I, it's, I think that that's, there's, you don't have to like be high. You don't have to be highfalutin. You don't always have to. You don't have to be going, bringing food to the poor or whatever. I think you can serve yourself too in a non-selfish way and that's by exercising, doing stuff like that will give you experiences outside the, uh, green shaded life that so many people live. Right. You know? Cause come on. Where is the energy coming from, man? Where is the energy coming from? Is the energy coming from the banks? Is that what we want to believe? Cause if you're somebody fixated on money, then you might as well just kneel down in front of Bank of America and just start giving it a big fat, wet, sloppy blow job. Right. Cause that's what you're doing. If you think that money equals, if money's what you're out after here, then you are a slave to the banks. Yeah. You're, you're not serving any higher power other than something that's clearly fragile, temporary, and destined to be forgotten. Yeah. I mean, you leave it here. It doesn't do anything. Unless you're one of those people that uses all the money to, to help others. If you're like the most charitable millionaire or billionaire in the world, like you can, you can take all that money and do some good. Like Gates. Yeah. Gates and Warren Buffett, I think is, is pretty charitable. Yeah. All those people, but I'm, I'm thinking about like, you know, like if you flip God, man, Jesus Christ. My, my wonderful girlfriend flipped to the iTunes popular music to listen to what's, what music's popular right now, just cause we both thought it, like we'd get a kick out of it. Yeah. And it was, it's horrifying. Oh yeah. But when you listen to the lyrics, I would much rather the popular music be songs about throwing babies off of cliffs, you know, or like dark slayer style lyrics than singing about money or singing about anything to do with like the obtainment of wealth or the, or things in the material universe. It's terrifying to hear the kind of hypnotic anthems that are rolling out of radio stations that are inviting people into a life where what you own is the thing that defines you as a person. It's scary to think about that. That's what turned me off to hip hop years ago when it was all, when it was every, back when there were music videos on MTV, it was like you turn it on in every hip hop video or popular hip hop, at least it was like, it was, it was cars rolling down the street with, you know, huge rims and like money being thrown around and women and all the lyrics were about those things. And I was like, I'm like, I cannot, I can't identify with that. I don't have all those things. I don't want all those things. And I'm like, what, I don't know what I'm listening to. I remember me and a friend, Emil Amos, who's on this podcast sometimes took some LSD. Is he the musician? Yeah. Yeah, listen to one of those. We took some acid and like watched MTV. This is years and years and years ago. And I remember tripping on acid watching, because we just been watching an HBO show about autopsies. I can't remember what it was. It's a series, but they had shown, we're on acid, we're watching a show about autopsies. It shows some woman's limbless torso rotting by the side of a river. And we're both like, oh, that's fucked up. Yeah. Then we turn to this fucking hip hop video. And it was five million times more horrifying than the limbless torso. It was just because you're seeing these people covort around holding gold and paper. And like, they're so, they're so clearly believing that this is the most and this is it. They're at the top of Pleasure Mountain. Yeah, we've arrived. We've arrived. Yeah, we're done. We're rich now. But you know that they, the musicians themselves, the artists themselves, when they're sitting alone, all they feel is that same aching emptiness that all human beings must feel if they haven't faced the truth of their predicament on this planet. The moment they're no longer distracted by the illusion of wealth. And by the way, none of those guys were that rich anyway, because I'm sure MTV isn't like pouring money into their coffers. The majority of them are fucking broke. It's like when people think that, when you see a comedian have a Comedy Central special, you automatically assume that they're like... He's a millionaire now. He must be a millionaire. He's on TV and he had a special. He's broke. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Probably broke. Yeah. They've passed that long and half of it goes to the agents and the feds. They're broke. Yeah. They're broke. So it's a lie that they're spitting out and they don't even know why they're spitting it out. But they've become the hypnotic spiral eyes of whatever reptilian system is currently making people run on this ridiculous treadmill and smack them. Yeah, they get up there. They get... That phrase, it's lonely at the top, has to come from that sort of attitude where you just claw your way up and the people that do that the best are usually... As far as humans go, pretty shitty. Shitty. They just are stabbing people in the back on their way up and just clawing their way through everything and fuck you, fuck you. I got to get there first. I got to get there. And then you get there and you've just destroyed relationships and friendships and business opportunities because you're like, this is the most important thing and it's for me. So fuck everybody else. I got to get there. And then you get up there and you're like, it's only a small group of people that have made it to this level, that have this much success and they're all alone too. Yeah. And then you're just sitting there at the top with your Rolls Royce and your gold chains and your giant house that you're alone in and then you just sigh and go, well, now what? Well, don't forget the very beginning of the neurological disorder, the weird tremble in the tips of your fingers because you're at your nervous system short wiring. Don't forget that. Don't forget the fact that you're actually melting down a little bit. No amount of anything is going to help you because you're experiencing a psychic disease. You're experiencing something sick. Now, here's the coversely, the illusion of this person that we just invented. Thank God. I don't know this person. I've never experienced it. It's a bit of a stereotype. I do know they must exist. Generally when I meet very wealthy people, the most wealthy people I've ever met are always the most generous people that I've ever met and they're always the kindest people I've ever met and they're always like really fucking cool. I can think of one person, but I'm not going to fucking say who it is, who I ran into once, who was this person that you're talking about. It was so entrancing to be around that finally, to be like, oh cool, you're the disease. It's badass. I get to sit down with a fucking walking cancer cell for a second. You really do think this stuff matters. You really do think this car that you have matters and you really do think that where you're at is a place you deserve to be. You really do think that people who aren't at the place that you're at just aren't doing the right thing. Right. Oh, it's so fun to be around that person. Oh God, it was fantastic to be mutually judging each other. Right, right, right. Because I know they were judging me as much as I was judging them. They were looking at me as some kind of like stoner, drug addict, commie and I was looking at them as some kind of shield of the fucking corporation. Yeah, some giant piece of plastic. Yeah. And they were melting on this rotting on the inside. So we are both guilty. We're just guilty in different ways. We're both guilty of the same kind of thing, which is creating a hierarchical system of ethics that ignores the true identity, what we true, what we are, which is one consciousness expressing itself in a bunch of different meaty tendrils. Right, right. Yeah, I mean, I feel like the best way to, if you are looking for success and you do want a lot of money, it's like sharing it is the best way to do it. It's like it's more fulfilling that way. When you meet or hear about those people that do do that, their lives seem more fulfilled. Then you're not lonely when you get up there, because on your way up, you're bringing other people with you and then you get to the top and you're like, there's a community up here now. Suddenly you get to the top and you're surrounded by your friends who are having success that you were part of getting for them. And then those people are always like, I have people like that who mentored me and my success is directly related to their presence in my life. And whenever I tell them, man, I haven't forgotten that this life that I'm experiencing is because you gave me my start. They're always like, no, it's not because of that. They will always deny that they even did that. So that's the other part of it is they've become so part of the flow that they're not caught up in the fucking like, yeah, you're right, I did do that for you and you owe me forever. They're never thinking that. They're never like writing down like, all right, so I helped this guy and if he doesn't acknowledge this at some point or do something for me, then you know what, fuck him. They're not thinking, they're not, because it's not for that reason. It's just a part of their nature where it's like, oh, he's my friend. He looks like he needs some help or I would love to have the world know about him too. I enjoy what he or she does. Let's let others do the same thing. It's fucking cool, man. I think what you're seeing there is the recipe for true success in this universe is counterintuitive to the way that you might think that you get success because one version of how to get success is what a lot of people think, which is like stab a bunch of fuckheads in the back, climb up that bloody human mountain to get to the top, lonely peak, and stare out over you. And piss all over it when you get there. Piss down. But when you start realizing that you are part of a unified whole and whether you want to get spiritual and say it's one universal soul or whether you just want to look at the fact that we're in an ecosystem we're all inextricably connected, then you look at successful people and what are they? Always generous. They do a lot of the, no, I'm sure there's people listening and thinking they're a fucking uncle dick who is like a greedy shit head and like splits tabs all the time and stuff like that. I'm sure they exist. But I think that there is a metaphysical principle in the universe where the more you stop caring about yourself and trying to help the people around you, the more amplified your own material success becomes and that what you will actually get into experience is such an acceleration in your material prosperity that you will lose track of how you got there and get greedy again. Like that's one of the road bumps that can happen is you hit this accelerated place and suddenly you start, you get to a point where you're so fucking poor that you don't care anymore and in that place you might accidentally start becoming very selfless because you've hit the bottom so much that you really don't care anymore and you do start doing stuff for other people just because there's nothing else to do and then all of a sudden you start getting weird phone calls that are coincidences start happening and all of a sudden you start getting this weird success and you don't really quite understand it and then all of a sudden that hits and you start, that success starts amplifying and somewhere along that way you might suddenly be like, shit, I'm going to lose all this shit and be poor again and then you clamp down and stop giving anymore and you start giving out more than you're getting and sure enough you spiral back down to the bottom. But if you can maintain this state of constantly expanding and amplifying the amount of, that you're helping people around you, that's when you get in the big updrafts and end up in the- You stay just as open and just as generous no matter what level you're at. No matter what, you just are a goddamn cave. They say that like the poor are more generous and charitable than the wealthy by like what they, comparatively speaking, like what they make, they give more than the wealthy do. Yeah, I've heard that. I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised. I wouldn't be surprised. I don't know. I mean, no matter what, you can't, the idea is you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. The action itself is where the glory comes from. The moment where you like, oh man, there's so many chances to do this, man. The whole like you get bad service at a restaurant and you tip them double what you would have tipped somebody else, shit like that. There's so many stupid chances to play these little alchemical games to play around with the energy of the universe where you start doing shit that you normally wouldn't do to see the results. You know, Alistair Crowley would consider that stuff a kind of magical practice and a cult practice and he recommended keeping a notebook where you would record stuff. So like with your bike ride, not only would he say, yeah, do the bike ride, but recognize that you're working magic here, that what you're doing is not just, you know, you're calling it charity, it sounds really boring, but that's what you're really doing is casting a spell by putting out a new signal into the universe to see if you get an answer back. It's like right now, you know, we're like listening for radio waves coming from other planets and the way we might transmit messages to other planets to see if there's alien intelligence is based on our technology that we have right now, but that's one signal we're sending out to see if we get an answer. Alistair Crowley was all about send out a signal and then see what answer you get from the universe. Echo chamber. See what happens if you yell in this direction or that direction, what comes back to you. So this thing that you did, the bike ride, it was casting a spell, that's a spell. And he would say, he would add to what you did, maybe you did keep a journal, but he would say keep a journal and write down everything that you felt on the bike ride, write down everything that you felt leading up to it, write down everything that happened afterwards. Were there weird synchronicities, strange coincidences, did stuff come to you afterwards that you can't explain? Was there any kind of, was there a new response from the universe that you normally haven't gotten before? And if there was, record that and then see if you can amplify the signal that you sent out to get more of that response. That's magic. That's really all magic is. Yeah. It's like, you know, did you see that video? I'm sorry to keep, I'm sorry for this rant. Did you see the video of the guy calling to coyotes? No. So badass, this guy's in the woods, hunter, he does a coyote call, nothing, does another coyote call, nothing, does another coyote call, and all of a sudden, man, it sounds like a hundred fucking coyotes are around him. They all just start howling back. Yeah. It's fucking cool, man. It's fucking cool. That's what magic is. Magic is, this is what Timothy Leary, which is, Timothy Leary was really just a Alistair Crowley meet science. He was just as much a necrol as anybody else. In fact, he considered himself as maybe some kind of reincarnation or part of, oh yeah. But the, his thing was like, what signal are you putting out? What signal are you putting out? And then can you change the signal that you're putting out? And if you can change the signal that you're putting out, what responses do you get with a change in signal? And that's all we're talking about here, which is like try sending out the signal that is called charity and watch where the response you get from the universe. It'll be fucking insane. A big part of it too is looking for it, because some people just do things. Some people are charitable in whatever way, just because they think they have to be. So they all do it. And then they shut themselves off from a response. They just go like, okay, I'm going to do this, good, I feel better, now to go focus on other things again. But you, in order to get, because it's like, it's a cycle, you know? You put something out there and something will come back, but you have to like remain open to the possibility. You got to catch the boomerang, motherfucker. Don't just throw it out. And that involves a lot of like, you have to come at it. You have to go into whatever you're doing, like with a positive attitude and an open mind that like, I'm going to do this and it will make the world a better place. Yeah. And they think like, well, I'm going to make the world a better place and change it. They immediately think like, oh, you're going to be like a Martin Luther King or Jesus or Gandhi or something. It's like, why does it have to be on that level? No one's thinking that. No one's like, I'm going to change the entire fucking world. It's like, no, I'm going to do a little thing and it's going to change something. It doesn't have to be to a large degree. I'm just going to do it and then watch the return. And there will be. Yes. Those three people you mentioned were assassinated. Yeah. Let's skip being there. Yeah. Try not to get assassinated. If you want to get fucking shot, get shot. If that's a signal you want back, that's a signal that the people at the very top will get back. I mean, that's a curious thing is along the path, you'll receive all these beautiful, beautiful signals. But if you start sending out a big enough signal that it actively begins warping civilization to make people more loving and peaceful and kind and gentle, then you will get a signal back in the form of a fucking bullet. There's all these signals flying by me right now. No, no, no, this is what people learn and people are evolving and the smart people, the smart people are real, you know, the smart people watch what's going on in the world and they see what's going on and they evolve just like anybody else. And they're very good at strategy and they're recognizing at this point that they don't need to put their faces on the front page of newspapers anymore, but it's the little behind-the-scenes stuff that will create the great acceleration towards what could potentially be a transformation in human civilization, unlike anything ever experienced. But you don't need the big, the mascots anymore. And I think people are recognizing that, that the mascots are no longer necessary. It's behind-the-scenes work that is where the work is to be done, I'd say. You do have to realize that if enough people just start doing charitable bike rides, if enough people do just start doing little things, then there is the potential for the planet that we're living on to experience a shift in the direction of something that's incredible. I feel like it's more possible than ever given like, that's one of the good things that things like social media have allowed us to experience is other bubbles in other parts of the world where you're like, oh, other people do think this way. And there are people in these countries that aren't for whatever dictator is running their country and they don't all think this way. And they're not all terrorists and they're not all backwards and they're not all misogynists and homophobes and this and that and this and that. And that kind of thing creates empathy when you look at these countries that are like, Israel and Palestine are constantly destroying each other and you think when you don't know the information, 100% of Israelis think this way and 100% of Palestinians think this way and that's why they're fighting. But then when you when you look into it enough, like you get user accounts instead of just like, here's what the news is telling you. These two countries are just going at it and that's just the way it is. And you're like, well, that doesn't seem right. And then you see you watch videos and see pictures of people's actual Twitter accounts or their own like websites or whatever. And you see like, there are Palestinians that don't think this way, that want peace, that want to broker negotiations. And then you think like, is it the people in charge that want war to continue? Is it is it all political? But it's whoever's making the fucking bombs, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think that's sadly what it all boils down to is it's like a little political and a lot of people who fucking make a shit ton of money every time the bomb gets dropped. You know, we can't. I don't know what you could do about that. I mean, either I was just using that as an example of like, like going behind the scenes which is something you can do now with, with, you know, having access to the internet. You can see what individuals think. By the way, man, what was the name of that really powerful and famous weapons manufacturer who got assassinated for manufacturing the weapons? What was that guy's name? You know what I'm talking about? He was like a billionaire and he like manufactured tons of weapons and came up with new weapons systems and got assassinated. What was his name? What? When was this like before the? Never happened. The fucking weapons manufacturers never get fucking assassinated. It's only the humanists. It's only the people giving things to the world. There's no Martin Luther King's of weapons manufacturers. Why are those guys fucking taking bullets when they go to the goddamn park? The people who are like actively taking shit with bombs on cities all over the planet. They're fucking fine. Why? Because no one knows who they are. You never, you wouldn't, as far as I know, no one's, there's no famous, like the guy who invented the fucking hellfire missile. What's his name? What was the team that worked on that? You never hear about them, do you? The last team you heard about was the guys behind the Manhattan Project. The guys that developed the nuclear weapon. That's it. Yeah. Those were the guys. And then after it became like the source of all evil, it was like, yeah, let's not talk about the weapons manufacturers anymore. Let's just keep those guys quiet. Let's stay quiet. Yeah. Let's pay them under the table. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we got to squeeze those bitches out. I'm not saying, obviously, I'm not recommending shooting anybody because that just keeps the cycle of violence going, but there's got to be a fucking, I don't know, man. Don't you feel like there's something in the air, man? Don't you feel like there's like a positive shift happening or am I just like at the phase of my like aging hippie life where I actually believe that there's some kind of global transformation that's happening? I mean, I feel like I feel that way more too, but I also feel like maybe I'm at like entering a phase where I'm less about myself and more about like how can I just live a happy life and help make the people that I love and care about around me happy too. And then I think when you start thinking that way, you put yourself on a path where you try and see those things more. Right. You know, when you're younger and more idealistic, there's a lot of anger that comes with that where you're like the world's a terrible place and fuck this and fuck that and fuck this and fuck him, fuck her and you're just angry. So that's all you see is the war and the devastation and the hopelessness and you're like, you know what? Anarchy is the only answer. That's what you think when you're younger. And then when you're you're older, you understand the world as like there are problems, but there's also there's a light that comes with the dark and you focus on a little more on the light and you try and you try and just bring a little more, you know, a little more light into the world. And in that way, it reminds you that there is, I think, for the most part, a lot more good in the world than most people think, especially when you open a newspaper or turn on the news. It just all seems bad, you know, but when you you actually go to these places or talk to someone firsthand, again, like when you go on, you can go on Twitter and like see what people's lives are like in Israel and Palestine, how they feel about the opposition. You go like, you know what, they they're not all full of hate from one another. A lot of people do want peace. A lot of people have friends from the other side. A lot of people just want to be happy. I think the majority of people, I think the majority of people want that. Yeah. I went to New York this last week for like two weeks and I hadn't been there in almost a decade, right? So a lot of the things you see and hear about New York are like, avoid all these places. Don't go, you know, walk around at night and you're going to get mugged and there's all the subways late at night or like this. But I get there and I'm walking around and I'm like, there's no, I don't feel unsafe anywhere at night. And people are nice. It's not like in a movie where you're constantly being elbowed by people trying to get somewhere and get the fuck out of my way. Subways are crammed and there's crazy people on everyone, you know, there's someone pissing in the corner of a subway car and everything's expensive and brutal and everyone's out for themselves. It doesn't work. It never sleeps. It's overpriced. It doesn't even want you there. And then I'm there and I'm like, this isn't, it's nothing like what you hear on the news and on TV and depicted in movies because they're looking for emotional responses, even with just a city. Right. You know what I mean? So of course, like when you, when it's like the rest of the world, when it comes to like war and devastation and there's no news out of like, well, everything's pretty cool over here. But it also could just be that you're putting out a nice signal into the world and you're getting that signal bounced back, you know, cause I imagine that like right after you walk through that place, some, somebody embroiled in some tiny drama in their own little comedy store, whatever their life happens to be, probably walked through that same place, followed your path and all they saw around them was depravity and shit and horror. And that person was me because I was in New York recently. And that place was a nightmare. But that's it, man. It's like, you know, this is the whole thing. We carry that place with us. So if you're sending that sweet signal into the world, then what you're going to get a response, the response you're going to get back is all going to be reflections of that signal. And that's the essence of magic. And that's why magic isn't such a mysterious thing. It's just like, what signal are you sending out? Figure it out. What's the signal? Listen to yourself throughout the day. What are you saying the most? Are you saying, do you hear yourself saying this a lot? I love you. I'm so happy that you're here. I'm so glad that you're in my life. This is a beautiful day. I love my dogs. Do you find yourself calling people and when they fuck up being like, no big deal. I get it, man. Shit happens. Or do you hear a lot of like, that motherfucker, did you talk to, did you talk to Paul? Yeah. Have you talked to him? He's such a fucking dick. Yeah. He's a piece of shit. What a dick. Why is he happy? He shouldn't be. Fuck him. Is that the signal you're putting out? Because I hate animals. They're annoying. You might as well be finding a passage from the Necronomicon and summoning demons because it's the exact same thing that you're doing. Every time you hiss and mutter about the horrible world you're living in, that's an incantation and through it, you're summoning spirits. Yeah. You're only seeing the darkness. When that's what you're putting out, you only see that in return. If you're flying into New York or you're headed to the comedy store or you're going on vacation and all you're thinking about is like, oh, there's so many fucking terrible things about this place, when you get there, that's all you're going to see. Yeah. You summoned it, bitch. Yeah. If I went on that bike ride and all I thought was like, oh, 545 fucking miles is so long. I'm going to be so tired. There's all these hills. I would have had a terrible time. I would have had a terrible time. It's like, aren't those like the fundamentals of karma, essentially? Yeah. Yeah, karma is another name for it too. It's the fundamentals of resonance. It's the fundamentals of ... There's lofty ways to put it and there's not so lofty ways to put it. I like to call it magic. It's just people want to think that magic involves finding secret spells where you say the names of the Inokian spirits to try to cause some of the friction. You need witch hazel and the thumb of a rabbit's foot. Those aren't the spells. But if you think that about karma too, they think that's also magical. They think like, oh, yeah, if you do something, then like something magically is going to happen. It's like, no, it's the simple action of walking down this path instead of that one. It's the positive path versus the negative path. The longer you walk down the positive on a long enough timeline, you will lead a more positive life. Another way to put it would be, if you fart, you will smell something bad. It's as simple as that and it's like it's not a metaphysical principle. It's because some foul gas has emerged from your anus and is now in the air in the same way. If the energy that you're outputting verbally, linguistically into the world is the equivalent of a fart, or if another way to put it would be, if you're an asshole, if you've decided to make what you are a series of habituations that as there's some total equal one asshole, then probably everything you do is going to smell like shit. Don't be a fart cloud is what you're saying. Yes. Don't be a fart cloud. And you can reprogram and retrain those habituations so that you begin to start playing around with putting good stuff out into the world. And then once you get good at that, then start intoning the names of the great Anokian Spear, is that a good word, too, but first start with like before you get into that shit, just worry, you know, just make sure that you're like in tune. Yeah. Man, I am sorry, this took so long, I wanted you put an album out not that long ago and I wanted to get you on right away to help plug that album, but it's fine, it's only been out a month, like six, seven weeks, which like nowadays seems like forever because everything's happened so fast, but it's like still, it's pretty new. Yeah. Well, no one, now you, people only want to buy out now it's probably like it's the sound has gotten bad. I know, I know. It's because it's like. I didn't use the new technology that came out two days ago. Yeah. And now an iPhone 6 can record a better album than all the equipment I use for mine, probably. That's so weird. This sounds like garbage, dude. Well, it doesn't matter if this sounds bad, man, because you're a funny motherfucker and you got a great album out there and everybody listening, please go immediately to iTunes and download this amazing human beings comedy album and check it out because I've, Nick is a peer of mine at the comedy store and he's brilliantly funny and you can tell from listening to him, these are super smart guys. So this is a comedian that you should be aware of and a comedian that you should be supporting and as part of the signal that you're sending out to the universe, why don't you drop? What is it? How many? What is it? It's a 999. 999 for literally an hour, 52, 53 minutes, 52 minutes, which equals countless years of a person working on it. I know. I know. That's fucking cool, man. Yeah, that's my first one, too. So yeah, it's like if it's years of material, anywhere from like six months old to like three or four years old, the material varies from there. What's the name of the album? It's called Stop Not Owning This. There you go. That's brilliant. I like it. And where can people find you on Twitter? My Twitter is at NickYusef, N-I-C-K-Y-O-U-S-S-E-F.

We've got a great podcast for you today. Mitch Horowitz is here. But first, a word from the Highwayman. The Highwayman. Highwayman, keep on doing the best you can. Hey there. It's the Highwayman here with an important safety message about fighting. It doesn't happen often, but sometimes you might be a witness to something bad going down, like maybe a teenager trying to steal an old lady's groceries, and you might feel like you need to jump in and help. Well, here's a tip from the Highwayman. Don't do it. It's not worth the risk. Most of the time, you'll only wind up escalating the situation, and you might just end up with a black eye, or worse. Here's a better way. Try to find a nearby tree or some shrubbery that you can hide behind so you can scope out the situation from a safe distance. From there, maybe you can get a good description of the perpetrator that you can later give to the police. Then once things clear up, you can safely approach the victim and find out if they need any help getting to their car. Maybe give them some encouraging words or moral support. They'll appreciate it, but the important thing is to keep yourself out of danger. And if you ever see someone that has a gun and they threaten to shoot you, just let them do it. This is no time to be a hero. Believe me, you'll thank me later. So stay smart, stay safe, and don't forget that the Highwayman is always the best way, man. The Highwayman. Helping people all across the land. I love you, Highwayman. The Highwayman. That was The Highwayman, AKA Henry Phillips. I've been following that show for a while, and I've learned so much from it.

Thank you, Squarespace, and we are back, and here's the answer to that question. How do you get rid of the obnoxious demons that you accidentally summoned using the grimoire that you found in your grandmother's attic? The answer, you sell them at demonmeets.com. I run with a wonderful group of people, and many of them are into meditation and magic, and every once in a while, hanging out with these people, some of the weirdest stuff happens that is completely impossible to explain. I know you've heard me ramble about this before. I'm not gonna bore you with it, but for me, someone who has directly experienced some of this stuff, it's always obnoxious when the possibility that human beings have abilities that maybe haven't quite been figured out or quantified or documented is shut down by skeptics. And then I think, why wouldn't they shoot it down? Some of these stories, some of these things are actually incredibly strange. In fact, I'm not gonna go on and on about them, but I've had a lot of weird experiences working with my meditation teacher, David Nickton. Speaking of which, he's offering a wonderful course. It's called Become a Meditation Teacher. You can find out all about this at darmamoon.com. It starts October 15th to the 17th, and it's a great chance for you to begin working with somebody who has made a huge difference in my life. And actually, I turned him into a cartoon on the Midnight Gospel. It's David from the Midnight Gospel. So check that out. Hey, listen, you don't want commercials in the DTFH, I get it. All you gotta do is go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and you will not get any more of these annoying commercials along with access to our weekly meditation group, our weekly family gathering right now. The community is working on a book of erotic, cryptid short stories. I just read one today in the family gathering and it was brilliant and wonderful and fucking hot. Super hot. Never thought praying Manus Cox could be hot. All you gotta do is sign up at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. You'll have access to our Discord server where you can participate. It's not too late. I'm being part of this anthology. All right, friends, without further ado, I am thrilled to offer you this conversation with Mitch Horowitz. He's got literally has too many books to name in this intro but if I were you, I would start off with The Miracle Club. It's fantastic. Occult America is really, really good. He is a brilliant mind and I feel so lucky that I got to spend an hour with him talking about one of my favorite subjects, parapsychology. Now, everybody, please welcome back to the DTFH, Mitch Horowitz. Good evening. Welcome, welcome, welcome to you, that you are with us, shaken, nothing to be moved. Welcome to you Welcome, welcome. It's The Duncan Trussellwater bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon. Mitch, welcome back to the DTFH. It's great to see you. Thank you, my man. Great to be here. You look great. Let's go. What is your accent? I always, anytime I see, every time I see you, you're like, you're like, what are you doing, man? You've got some kind of like, are you doing yoga or something? What's going on? I don't sleep. This is an ongoing experiment for two years. Maybe that is something to do with it. I do like what I do and I don't sleep. And those are my fitness tips. Ah, are you glad, man? That's my wellness protocol. Look, man, I think you've got your next book. Don't Sleep, Love What You Do. That's great. Mitch, you know, I know today we're gonna talk about parapsychology. And I thought I'd share with you, you know, when I was in college getting my, I don't know if you knew this about me, but I have a bachelor's degree in psychology. Not to blame. But I did do a, I did a, I tried to recreate a parapsychology experiment using those awesome psychic cards with the triangle, the circle, the square, the wavy lines. And you know, it was fascinating because at one point someone was calling every single one of them in a way that was completely improbable and really freaked me out. It was this one girl and it was like, we kept doing it and she wasn't getting any of them wrong. Is this, when you mentioned parapsychology, is this what you were talking about? Yeah, actually, J.B. Ryan, the Psychological Researcher at Duke University who pioneered the use of the Zenner cards that you were using, he had one such experience with a subject named Hubert Pierce. And the amazing thing about J.B.'s card experiments is, I mean, the man just did tens and tens of thousands of trials and when he would pool the data, what he would find is that he was constantly getting a blip that went several points above statistical average. So if you're using a five suit deck of cards, over time, over time, the so-called law of statistics says that you're gonna get 20% hit rate or a guess rate basically, over time. And what J.B. would find is that over tens of thousands of trials with certain individuals, you would get a hit rate that was not 20%, that might be 25%, might be 27%, might be 28%. And when you keep doing that and when you jury the data and when you subject it to total transparency, ensure against any corruption, you include the null sets, you include everything, something is going on. You know, you're in front of a magnificent, strange question, you know, either there's some break in our statistical models as we use them or there's an anomalous transfer of information going on in a lab setting. And the wrap that you'll read, if you put the Ryan experiments into Wikipedia, if you put the Ryan experiments into Google, you'll find that they weren't repeated, that there were null sets that weren't included. None of it's true, it's a modern mythology. It's a modern mythology. The fact is the Ryan experiments were repeated for decades. They are still repeated from time to time today. There are exemplary standards where you can take a certain protocol, repeat it, show the same results, same results, and it is a break in our understanding of sensory perception. It puts us in front of an enormous question and this is stuff that by this point is 80 years old at its inception and there have been many things that have surpassed the Ryan experiments again, subject to repeat analysis, a level of jurying, a level of criticism, transparency that exceeds by many degrees the kinds of scrutiny that are most of our pharmaceutical experiments are subjected to. The repetition is there, the data transparency is there, the lack of corruption is there. The fact is we have statistical evidence of some anomalous transfer of information, which you can call ESP, you can call non-local intelligence, but you can't call it a mistake and it just puts us in front of the question of what it means to be human because we're raised to believe that the mind is an epiphenomena of the brain and the mind is like the bubbles in a glass of carbonated water and when the water is gone, the brain, the bubbles are gone, but that's not the case and we have generations of experiments that provide statistical evidence for that. Why the severe pushback do you think? Why is this something that gets just instantaneously dismissed by scholarly people? It's a wonderful question and I've pondered the question myself, the truth is I seek out skeptics to debate with, I seek out constructive skeptics and it's very, very difficult to find folks. I mean, I've had people, I was having a dialogue not long ago with a social sciences professor about a series of experiments that were conducted in the 70s and 80s called the Gansfeld experiments and these tested in short for telepathy in conditions of sensory deprivation. Similar results to the Rhein experiments, over tens of thousands of experiments you're finding hit rates that go beyond average and he acknowledged to me, yes, those are remarkable and the pioneer of those experiments, a guy named Charles Honerton who's now deceased, he collaborated with a well-known skeptic Ray Hyman who's a psychologist from the University of Oregon on a joint paper and Hyman said he didn't believe in the ESP thesis, but he did agree that the data was uncorrupted and that it required more research, which is great. You know, that gives us all common ground. Let's just pose the question. But, you know, in as much as I can get skeptics in private conversations to acknowledge to me, yes, you know, that data is remarkable. Literally the next day when they get back into their peer groups and social groups, usually, you know, on some social media platform and other, they start saying, oh, it's all baloney, it's all bullshit and I don't know why the reversal is always there. I suspect they fear that if there's an acknowledgement of the ESP thesis or anything that comes close to it, they're afraid it's gonna unlock this wave of irrationality of so-called magical thinking. And I'm not so temperamentally different from them that I can't understand that, but there's a point at which, you know, skepticism becomes ideology and then it's no longer skepticism. Yes, and we're, you know, I think some people aren't aware of the fact that scientists are just like anybody else. Like, you know, if you wanna publish a book, you've gotta get a publisher to fund it. You know, if I wanna make a TV show, I've gotta get a network or somebody who likes the idea enough to fund it. If scientists wanna run experiments, somebody's gotta fund that. So then that funding is not gonna come to someone who has been labeled as a quack. So they have to be very careful not to seem like that. I've heard this is one of the reasons why the subject matter isn't explored more is just because the presenting the possibility that you wanna look into this stuff, you risk your reputation. I've heard, so. Without question. Yeah. In fact, a recent case of that evolves a psychologist at Cornell named Daryl Bem, who some of your listeners have probably heard of, Bem conducted a series of precognition experiments in 2011. And he was subjected to just withering criticism. Absolutely withering criticism. And he published in a very prominent journal, the flagship journal of the American Psychological Association, and there was enormous pressure on the journal to rescind the paper and so forth. Couple years later, The New York Times ran a front page article about a spate of fraudulent experiments in the social sciences. In the first paragraph of the article, they referenced Bem's ESP experiments without ever referencing the experiments again in the article, without ever referring back to why the experiments were considered lumped in. Why the experiments ought to be contextualized with fraudulent experiments. I've published a number of things on controversial topics in The New York Times. I reached out to people there. I reached out to the editorial on Bootsman, a position that no longer exists. Total silence, total silence. Now, whatever spoke to it. Now, the rap on the Ben experiments is that they haven't been replicated. Not only have they been replicated, but in fact, Bem took the unusual step of making all his data, all his software, all his notes, all of his material, positive sets, null sets, et cetera, available to anybody. And there was a meta analysis published in 2016. It was updated as recently as July of 2020, in which his experiments were replicated. Dig this. 90 times at 33 different laboratories in 14 different nations. 90 times 33 different laboratories in 14 different nations. We don't do this for aspirin, you know? Yeah, and we don't do this for pharmaceuticals that many of us listening to this podcast are taking. And that's the depth of the vetting. But I will tell you, if you put Darrell Bem's name into Wikipedia, you put Darrell Bem's name into Google, you will see the information that this hasn't been repeated. If you put the Gunsfeld experiments into Wikipedia, you will see them referred to as a pseudoscience, even though they have been vetted according to the highest clinical standards. And so it's not only a problem in terms of skepticism, morphing into etiology, but it's a problem in terms of who has influence over forums like Wikipedia. Wikipedia does lots of great things, but in fields of parapsychology and esoteric subject matter, it's profoundly flawed. There's people who police that stuff to the point of, I would say almost a materialist fundamentalism. Wow, materialist fundamentalism. That is incredible. Here's another sinister problem, which is if this depression is happening, and I believe it is, then theoretically, well, I guess to put it like, okay, there was a time, and some assholes still do it, where people would say in comedy, they would say women aren't funny. And it was this fucked up thing that was happening. But what was really happening was that it was really hard for women to get stage time. And there's no way to get better at stand-up comedy, except by going on stage over and over and over again. So what was happening is men were getting like way more stage time, and so they were able to develop the ability to do stand-up, and thus it created this bullshit idea that, look, women aren't funny, men are funny. And one of the realities is it's like saying, I don't know, somebody who has access to a gym and someone who doesn't, it's going to be more in shape. So this was the similar thing seems to be happening in the sense that these abilities, whatever they may be, and again, we don't know, because this information is being suppressed, they might be things that could be developed, right? And so the act of suppressing the information simultaneously, implicitly invites people, don't explore these in your own identity, don't explore these possibilities in your own life, meaning that if there is some, I don't know, for lack of a better word, some psychic appendage that we're not even aware of, then it's going to be atrophied in anyone who hasn't actively been exploring it in their own consciousness, right? I mean, you know, and the field itself has been stymied because of a lack of funding. We've probably lost a generation of progress in psychical research in the United States because the professional skeptics, they're so adept, they're so media savvy, they're so skilled at sound bites. And, you know, quite frankly, and I hope I don't sound prejudicial when I say this, but it's just simply been my experience. They are willing to reverse even their own concessions. There is, in many cases, and I don't like saying this, I don't revel in saying this, but in many cases, there's an intellectual disingenuousness where, you know, I've seen people concede things in private conversations that have been really constructive and helpful that they will literally reverse, you know, at some other time or date or, you know, in a paper. They're very ideologically dedicated to, it's not so much they want to win the debate, they don't want there to be a debate, and that's a real problem, you know, and that becomes anti-intellectual, and they've been successful because parapsychology labs that have existed at Duke, Harvard, Princeton are closed. They can't get funding, you know, so people have to go off campus. There are a couple of independent institutes like the Institute of Neurotic Sciences in Northern California where scientists like Dean Raiden, for example, who studies precognition, they simply write their own grant proposals. They have to drum up private money, and anybody who writes a grant proposal knows that's a career effort in and of itself, and there was a statistician. Wait, what do you mean? I'm sorry, what do you mean? A career effort. Oh, like a scientist who's working on a grant proposal from private funding and has to do this as a matter of his or her air supply, that can just suck up all your time, you know, grant proposals to sort of stay afloat, to have no independent entities funding you, no departmental funding, nobody, you know, paying the electric bill, it just sucks up so much of your time, and there's a statistician at UC Irvine named Jessica Utz, and she's crunched the numbers, and she has basically determined that for the past century or so, the grand sum total of inflation-adjusted dollars that has been spent on parapsychological research in a century is the equivalent of two months, two months of spending in the United States on ordinary psychological research. That's how miniscule the funding has been. It's absolute peanuts, and these experiments, whether it's cards experiments, that's a little fashioned or flashing images or attempting to convey an image or something like that, it's very inexpensive stuff. I mean, this is very, very, you know, from a clinical standpoint, this is very no-frills stuff. It's not expensive, and yet the skeptics have succeeded in cutting off the funding and the air supply of a lot of the key researchers.

And, you know, anytime you look at the fine print when you're browsing in incognito mode, it says that your activity might still be visible to your employer, your school, your internet service provider, or your school, not just your school. How can they even call it incognito? To really stop people from seeing the sites you visit, you need to do what I do and use Express VPN. Think about all the time you've used wifi to coffee shop, a hotel, or even at your parents' house. Without Express VPN, every site you visit could be logged by the admin of that network. And that's still true, even when you're in incognito mode. I mean, do you really want your parents to see what you've been looking at? I want them to see it. Maybe you don't. What's more, your home internet provider can also see and record your browsing data, and in the US, they're legally allowed to sell that data to advertisers. Express VPN is an app that encrypts all your network data and reroutes it through a network of secure servers so that your private online activity stays just that, private.

Like in clandestine laboratories? Because clearly, it would produce an extreme advantage in espionage if these are built through. It's interesting. For many years, the CIA had a remote viewing, or so-called psychic spying program, called Operation Stargate. And during the first year of the Clinton administration, there were budget cuts due to the Cold War petering out. And Stargate got cut. It was about $20 million a year, and it got eliminated. I know some of the researchers in that program. Their outlook is that there's no secret remote viewing research going on right now, although they have explained to me that other nations are doing it. The Russians are certainly doing it. And what will happen in the Russian military apparatus, for example, with regard to remote viewing, they will, typically speaking, they might take five different sources of information. They might take some verbal testimony from some informer who's on the other side, whatever the other side happens to be, some kind of electronic surveillance, something else. They'll pool the so-called psychic spying or remote viewing with that information, and they'll see if they get a hit. If you get a three out of five hit rate, for example, they might say, OK, that's a legitimate piece of intelligence. So they're not relying on that in some exclusive way, but they pool it with other sources of data, which is what the CIA was doing for many years. And during the Carter administration, this is something Jimmy Carter has spoken about publicly, for many years, there were a couple of remote viewers who were successfully able to identify the coordinates of a crashed Soviet spy plane on the African continent. And Carter regarded that as a real win, which he got made fun of for, and Gary Wills and other writers ridiculed him for it. And the fact is, you don't exactly view Jimmy Carter as a man of occult passions. He was speaking about what occurred. And to my knowledge, the program hasn't continued. I mean, who knows? But the researchers have told me they think it's dead. Well, I mean, yeah. And just like they thought the UFO programs were dead, they thought that too. There's a lot of programs they think are dead that aren't dead at all. And this is one of the things I love about the CIA's website is that you could just, the Freedom of Information Act stuff, it's just there for you to go check out. And the Project Stargate stuff is so fucking weird, man. So weird. I mean, that's where people talk about encountering lizard beings and stuff. And I don't know if you've seen that stuff. I mean, this is the freedom. This is the reason. Oh, it is weird, man. It's so weird to be on the CIA's website reading testimonial from some of these psychics talking about encountering reptilians on the astral plane, which kind of lines up with what people talk about when they take ayahuasca, meeting these weird super advanced lizard beings. So to me, obviously, my personality is such that I want there to be DARPA initiative clandestine stuff happening from our country. But I mean, if I had to roll the dice, I would say, of course, they're still investigating it. Because you have to. If it's true that the Russians are still involved in any capacity or any other state entity that we're competing with, you don't want them to get ahead of the curve and suddenly discover whatever it may be, if it is in the human brain, or whatever it may be that's letting people do this stuff. Because once that happens, and who was it that just won the Nobel Prize in biology? Do you remember his name? I don't recall. Because I don't. But he won it because he was interested in, I think, pressure and maybe heat or something like that. What is converting the experience of heat in our brains? What is the process where that happens? Any identity, identified parts of the brain responsible for that. And that might not seem like a big deal. It's a huge fucking deal. Because that means just in the realm of virtual reality, that dream is some way of stimulating those aspects of the brain to replicate experience. I mean, that would be an incredible leap forward for all kinds of things, training, whatever it may be. But similarly, if these remote viewing experiments are true, if it's just not a fluke that's psychics, and this has also been documented from time to time, will take cops to a place where a body is, how the fuck do they do that? If we could identify these things within humanity, then it would be the equivalent of when pre-eyeball would be the equivalent of our species growing a new eyeball or something like that. Oh, absolutely. And if even the most rudimentary of ESP experiments place us in front of a legitimate question, and I'm playing it very, very conservative. I see that. That opens the door to everything. I mean, that opens the door to extra physicality. And suddenly, we're no longer functioning within a strictly materialist paradigm. The philosophy of materialism says, matter creates itself. That's basically the outlook. That outlook no longer holds up in our generation. We've seen way too much in terms of quantum theory, string theory, relativity, not to mention what's going on in the outer regions. It feels like neuroplasticity, where the thoughts themselves are changing the gray matter of the brain, the neural pathways through which electrical impulses travel in the brain, the outer reaches of placebo studies. We have evidence on the books for a generation of successful placebo surgeries. And if you throw psychological research, good, solid clinical, psychological research into the mix, which we now have in terms of modern science, 80 years, 90 years data of, updated data of, replicated data of, repeated experiments, every possible null set being counted, and so forth. You get to the incontrovertible conclusion that the mind is extra physical. The mind is non-local, not exclusively so necessarily. It may not be the only thing that's going on. But the problem is, within the materialist mindset, when they get one correct hit, they decide, that's the whole story. That's what's going on. The placebo effect, they'll say, is nothing but endorphins being released by the body. Nothing but? Nothing but? There could be a dozen different things going on, of which that's one. That could also be what the prayer response, or what hopeful expectancy looks like in the body. But in any case, when you open the door to these questions, and you can state them in the most conservative terms, but when you open the door, you're opening the door to extra physicality, which gets to the heart, I think, of why some of these guys push back so vociferously and so emotionally. And you've raised a good question, too, when you were talking about, what does a person want to believe? And I have to watch that in myself, because I'm very open about my sympathies in this area. So am I being prejudiced? What do I want to believe? I don't want to just become some guy who's on the other side who's arguing with skeptics. I mean, what does that accomplish? No, me either. I'm trying to be legit about all this. I just want to find people to debate with who want to get somewhere. I'm happy to be wrong. I just don't want to close down the question. Well, look, I appreciate your, I can see how careful you're being with it, and I really appreciate that. I'm not careful with it. I like not being careful. And I don't mind if, in the end, it's like, you are a fool. But I have to, anecdotally, I've had my own experiences that are just impossible. And any time I've thought, OK, this is confirmation bias or things like that, it's like, that's not fucking confirmation bias, because it's like me interacting with people who have been meditating their entire lives, and who very casually and gracefully display some of the things that in the East, they call cities, you know, just like these are the potentialities of human beings. And so I would have to discount all of those or just replace my own experience. And I understand this is why we have sciences, because our experience is very seductive, and it can make you believe a million things that aren't true. But then I wouldn't just have to throw out my own experience or just say, well, that was a fluke. I would also have to, like, a lot of people that I'm friends with, I would have to say, you are all insane. That's all a fluke. Just to adhere to whatever the particular current standard is regarding what humans are capable of. And what was it they used to say, Mitch, about how humans can't run faster than what was it, like a five-minute mile or something like that? Oh, the four-minute miracle mile, yeah. Right, right, right. It can't happen. And then one person does it, and then everyone suddenly can do it. It's bizarre, right, and every record is consecutively being shattered. The funny thing is, you know, you use the term confirmation bias. And confirmation bias is a term that social scientists use. It gets thrown around colloquially too much. It's basically just a fancy term for prejudice. And we all suffer from it. Every socialist, the most materialist scientist on earth, is embarking on a study, and he or she is suffering from confirmation bias. It's a facet of human nature. Yes. And one of the problems with the social sciences in general is that it may be the one branch of the sciences that consistently overturns its own data generationally, because methodology gets better. So whole generations of experiments are overturned or overturned. So methodology questions, questions of bias, these things are always at play. But in terms of public perception, like you were referencing, experiencing things in connection with meditation that you know are profoundly meaningful, that has to be taken very seriously. Testimony has to be taken seriously. Dig this. In the year 2014, a professional skeptic named Michael Shermer, who writes a column for Scientific American, he wrote a column in October of 2014 talking about a really bizarre uncanny event that happened on his wedding day involving what seemed to be communication from a dead relative. And so Michael wrote, listen, I'm a skeptic for a living. Statistically, I understand you could kind of crunch these numbers, and maybe it wouldn't seem too far out, but crunching numbers doesn't measure the emotional impact of an event on the life of an individual. That starts to get into stratosphericly rare numbers that are very hard for any actuarial table to get at. This was in October 2014. That same year, January 2014, I had a book come out called One Simple Idea, which was a history and analysis of the positive mind movement. Unbeknownst to me, I learned this only a couple of weeks ago, unbeknownst to me, I had made exactly the same point in that book. I wrote an essay called The Bucket List, where I had this bizarre experience where I was given a task by a spiritual teacher of mine of finding these little pink buckets in New York. And it was fucking hopeless. I mean, fucking hopeless. And at the last minute, in the strangest place, in the most dramatically unexpected way, I found a cache of little heart-shaped pink buckets. It was the craziest fucking thing that's ever happened to me. And I said, again, you could come in and you could crunch the numbers and say, well, it's not really that unusual because of x, y, and z. OK, but you can't fully, statistics don't fully get at the emotional impact, the stakes, the meaning, the drama that an event really has in the life of the individual, which is critical testimony. Michael and I, who are considered to be opposite polarities, were making the same point. We were making the same point. So what is it that divides us? What is this ideological divide that can't be crossed? Mitch is a believer. Michael is a skeptic. Call it whatever you want. We're both making the same point. We just got to get beyond this. We, as a human species, got to get beyond this encampment. It's just not necessary. Is the problem one of individuality gets challenged to some degree with this stuff? If we're talking about non, and individuality is the anchor, it seems, that holds the ship of society into whatever fucking harbor we're currently floating in. It's like everything is all about the individual, the identity. When we're talking about non-local consciousness or the identity, and we run into this in Buddhism, and it's something that my teacher and I go back and forth on all the fucking time. The idea of the skandhas in Buddhism, right? The piles, heaps. You're not really a person as much as heaps of all of this stuff that converges into this thing that you call your identity. But try to boil your identity down to one point. Like, this is Duncan. This is Mitch. You can't do it, and maybe you can do it. I can't do it. I can't. It's impossible. And so is it just that because we live in this hyper-materialistic capitalist society that's designed on amplifying the illusion of that identity, that in some subconscious level, there's pushback or something that if we start playing around with the idea, we share a mind, we lose what we're going to lose everything when it comes to literally, it would cause an economic crash if suddenly we were able to disentangle ourselves from our obsession with the individual, right? It's fascinating. I mean, people get very, very upset when you begin to challenge so-called commonsensical experiences. And yet the ultimate materialist, Karl Marx, said common sense is a terrible means of measuring and understanding reality because it's a fount of prejudice. And you've got to peel the onion back. So the whole project of modernist philosophy is to peel the onion back. What's the antecedent cause? Marx, it's economics. For Freud, it's trauma. For Einstein, it's time and relativity. From my story, it's germs. But the whole modernist idea is there's some antecedent. So why can't psychical research be fitted into that? And it does rattle people. The idea, for example, that time is illusory, that linear time is illusory. It's inescapable. I mean, Einstein's own relativity theories and experiments that followed from it demonstrate to us that people's experience of time is different based on gravity, based on speed. We know this shit. And this has also been demonstrated in quantum theory. The thought experiment called Schrodinger's Cat demonstrates that there's an infinite series of concurrent outcomes co-existent, co-existent. So we know that what we experience as orderly linear time is a necessary illusion. It's necessary for us five sensory beings, so-called, to navigate through life. But it's not real. It's not real. It's not ultimate. I'll put it that way. It's not ultimate. We experience all these different laws and forces, and they're mitigated by different things, like gravity is a constant, but you're going to experience gravity differently on the moon than you would on Jupiter. And everybody accepts that. So if anomalous transfer of information, or ESP, or call it what you will, is real, is there, it's also going to be conditioned by circumstance. So we're not all just going to go floating off into the stratosphere, like the people in that weird vacuum tube in Logan's Run, or really long in the chocolate factory. We're not going to go floating up toward the fan. Don't worry. But we got to know what it means to be human. We just got to know. Yeah, but you, I mean, so much of your writing has impacted me, along with a lot of other people, because you're so good at articulating like other possibilities involved in humans being more capable of things than materialism seemingly wants us to think. I mean, I'm implying a conspiracy here. Maybe there is one. I don't know. Maybe we're being sprayed or something with bad data intentionally, like some like, you know, some like like bonsai tree or some shit, some special bonsai tree that for whatever reason, you know, people who understand this stuff as real wants to keep localized in a little like nice maintained garden of experience that we call society. Because a lot of what you write about, which I think people who have read your writing about this stuff have experimented with and have incredible results, is the possibility that our minds can not just like, you know, know what's on a card that we can't see. But we are literally sort of, we are creating our universe. Like we can actualize into our lives things purely by not allowing ourselves to be tethered to whatever our own perceived limitations are or what we're being told our limitations are. I mean, am I misinterpreting? No, I think it's absolutely true. When you're traveling to a destination where you don't know the language, it can be challenging to accomplish even a simplest of tasks.

The philosopher Guerta made the point indirectly that what happens to us, what we wish for when we're very young, comes upon us in waves when we're old. So be careful, be careful. And it's interesting to test that personally. I mean, I've looked upon and I asked people to look back on what are their earliest cognitive memories? I mean, early stuff, going back to like age three, four, whenever we really begin to retain memories. And personally speaking, I found an uncanny congruency in the life that I'm leading right now at age 55 with what I used to fantasize about very, very, very privately and intimately at age four or age three, or as early as I can possibly recall. And these have been memories that I've been cognizant of for a long time. So it wasn't something I just started telling myself last week. And it's difficult to face that, you know, because a lot of times, and there are countervailing factors in life, you know, I don't subscribe to that. There are no accidents thing. You know, there's lots of countervailing factors in life. But barring some really, really epic countervailing factor, and those things do occur. A lot of what occurs to us in life bears the mental stamp of things that we thought about of our earliest cognition, of our earliest, earliest cognition outlook, fantasies, dreams, wishes, you know, just peel back the onion and look for it. And it has to be within the realm of the individual to make this inquiry or testimony doesn't exist, you know. So it's an experiment that I really ask people to participate in. We have, I do believe that there are causative qualities to thought. There's no question about that in my mind. And we have, you know, we're afraid sometimes to carry forth the implications of, you can call it hard sciences experiments that get cleaved to that. But we also have to honor the testimony of the speaker. I mean, you know, look, when somebody goes to a hospital and they're experiencing pain, you know, we have no way of measuring pain. They show them a chart with those little smiley faces on it. Are you a frowny face? Are you an indifferent face? You smile. What is that? You know, it's testimony. That's what the individual is experiencing. We don't know how SSRIs or SNRIs work, you know. We have all these psychopharmacological drugs we're describing them by the millions. We're really not sure how they work. And anybody listening who's taken one of these, as I have, has the experience of sitting down with his or her therapist and saying, well, how do you feel? Do you feel better? Do you want to just, you know, I mean, it's testimony. You know, so we can't exclude that from the experience of the individual, including the extra physical. Wow. Yeah, that's so brilliant. It's like all the testimony where someone is like, no, I actually did see a spear in the sky when I was camping. No, actually, I was thinking about someone I hadn't talked to in 20 years. And within three seconds, their friend reached out to tell me they had just died. All that testimony just gets thrown out. But the testimony of, no, this is how much pain I'm in, which those charts are actually how many drugs do you want charts? Really, if you think about it. But like all that testimony is completely accepted and upheld. And so, yes, I think that's a very brilliant point that you're that you're making. There is that almost that's all we've got at one level is shared testimony regarding these things. Absolutely. And over time, testimony becomes a record. So if you've got centuries of people saying, I'm really seeing funny lights in the sky and I'm just not crazy. You know, two centuries of that testimony, you know, eventually results in a Pentagon UFO report that won't rule out UFOs. You know, and this is this is how it works. This is how the human story works. But added to that, this like the whatever it is, the miracle mile, the four minute mile, whatever it is. Yeah, yeah. So that so it's not just that. It's the the the the realization of this possibility actually seems to bring that possibility into focus. Then you run into one possible explanation for why this data is being suppressed or ignored. Because if it is true that OK, wait, when we do when enough people see that person perform an athletic feat that was formally considered impossible, it becomes possible in the minefield of so many people that it begins to replicate itself in that regard. It's it's fascinating. Probably every Olympic record that was said in the 1930s, you know, has been has been broken several times over. And, you know, I'm sure everything, the pole vault, the high jump, you know, sprinting, all this stuff has been repeatedly surpassed. So, of course, you know, why wouldn't that happen with the mind? And, you know, the question of why this stuff, you know, is it suppressed? Is it prejudice? It's it's it's so hard for me to get at even as much as I've tried to make myself on intimate terms with this material and its critics. About a year ago, I wrote a contrarial obituary for a professional skeptic named James Randy, who was a stage magician. I know, the amazing Randy, you know, the amazing Randy. So he was like a psychic buster and he did some good things in his career and he also did some terrible things in his career. And one of the things I write about in the article and it's very detailed. It's up at Boing Boing. It's called The Man Who Destroyed Skepticism. And, you know, one of the things, you know, James did. And this was just I'm sorry, can I pause you? The idea of you writing a negative obituary about me is chilling. Please, please, please. You're like of all the people I would not want to do that. That is so cool, man. I cannot wait to read that. Go ahead. I'm sorry to cut you off. No, quite all right. So, you know, and this is a this is a very small example, but, you know, this is just kind of what happened on Tuesday afternoon. You know, James issued a classroom guide, helping guide teachers into instructing kids that ESP is garbage. And so in this classroom guide, which was issued by the James Randy Educational Foundation, a foundation that I researched and found that there was very little evident educational work that it was doing. And I go through the numbers in the article as well. So James issued this PDF teachers guide on ESP. And in this PDF teachers guide, he said falsely that J.B. Rine, who who died in the early 1980s, did not report null sets in his experiments. So he would only report successful sets. That is patently false and has been false since the 1930s. Not only did J.B. report all his sets, but J.B.'s parapsychological lab at Duke University was one of the academic pioneers in pushing the social science field to expose, to report all data. So there's no so-called file drawer problem where you're leaving the disappointing data, you know, in the file drawer. And, you know, I've spoken with friends and colleagues about this. I've spoken with J.B. Rine's daughter, Sally Rine, who's a psychologist, who's now 91 years old, brilliant woman. And I said to her, you know, James has to know that this isn't true. James just has to know that this isn't true. I mean, it has been public knowledge for literally decades that J.B. Rine and his parapsychological experiments reported null sets and, in fact, was a pioneer in pushing the social science field to follow ethical practices. And since that time, all legit parapsychologists, people affiliated with universities, people affiliated with places like Institute of Neolithic Sciences, they've all published their null sets. And yet he states this in a teacher's guide, and it seems so convincing and so persuasive. And you encounter this stuff all the time. It's everywhere in Wikipedia. It's everywhere in the top five Google search results. And people think, oh, I don't have to worry about this. Daryl Bem's experiments were never replicated. It's been proven. But, you know, people won't hear the compelling follow up data that, you know, is on the next page of search results or didn't make it to Wikipedia because those pages are getting ideologically influenced. And so anyway, I digress. I have to believe that James Randy knew that J.B. Ryan reported all this data. And yet I cannot tell you why he would state that in his PDF guide. I simply can't. So is it suppression? Is it prejudice? Is it ideology? Is it emotion? You know, it's it's very difficult because these things are out there. They're stated in a media savvy sound by way. And there you can't dedicate your life to policing these kinds of comments because it's otherwise it's all you'll do. Right. And then you just become this bobble head on the other side saying, no, that's not true. I encounter things on Wikipedia all the time that I don't touch because I just don't have the time. You know, if somebody calls the Gunsfeld experiments a pseudoscience, which is what you'll find out there on Wikipedia right now, or at least, you know, two days ago, I can't dedicate my life to becoming a counter bobble head. You know, right. And so it's hard to put a label on it. You know, what do you call that? You know, is it prejudice? Is it suppression? Is it is it fear? Is it corruption? It's a prep. I call it suppra. I mean, it's like it's not the effect of suppression. It's the effect of suppression. And, you know, especially with people like Randy, the amazing Randy, who is brilliant, you know, you have to. I love the theory about the amazing Randy, which again, I'm I feel I don't have to like. I love how careful you're being. And I'm so glad that you are because we need that. We need that. But I love the theory about the amazing Randy, which is he's actually a wizard, like a very powerful sorcerer who is like that's his city is muting other people's psychic abilities. And so like that's what he does on purpose. And again, when when I'm speculating about these things and you know, like, I don't know, you will be able, obviously, you'll be able to like describe this better than I can. But in my recollection regarding Young's idea about this shadow, the way that they're repressed, the sum total, the repressed stuff in a society will appear in the form of like a world leader, right? So like whatever human like in the same way that your shadow is going to appear, whether you like it or not, you know, when you're drinking too much or when you get angry and that thing pops out similarly in a society, that repressed shadow is going to show up as a Hitler. That repressed shadow is going to show up as like whatever the fucking like awful leader thing may be. And so in this case, and that's not an intentional thing. In other words, when you're like deciding to like when that thing pops out of you, you might not have one of those things I do when the jack in the box comes out and suddenly you're like fucking screaming or pissed or whatever. And you're like, what was that? It's not like I chose that. It just pops out. Same thing happens with a society, too. And so this, if I'm not saying it's an intentional conspiracy, yeah, but it's if. Or an intentional suppression, like people are meeting in boardrooms and being like, we can't let people know that there's this ability. It's more it's something deeper than that. Something built in like a kind of subconscious knowing that if enough people realize, no, you know, your potential as a human goes so far past what you think it is that a kind of apocalypse will happen, you know, a kind of like or maybe a less intense way to put it is we're all playing this weird game of make believe where I've decided to be a podcaster and some people have decided to be presidents and some people have decided to be authors and some people have decided to be cops. And we are committed fully to this game. We've committed fully to this game, to the point that if we all stop committing to it, holy fuck, people are going to die. The whole thing's going to fall apart. Right. Yeah. So maybe there's some subconscious understanding that if the cat gets out of the bag in this regard, humans are capable of, you know, extra sensory perception at a level that you couldn't possibly imagine that you can, you know, astrally project, literally send your consciousness out to other planets, alternate dimensions, your experiences on DMT, where you ran into that advanced being that was like healing your energy body. That wasn't just what happens when you mash a digital watch and you see the funny colors. It wasn't like you were fucking with your brain. That's real. If we all simultaneously come to that conclusion, society as we know it kaput, it's over, kaput, it's, it's, it's wild. You know, and there's a spiritual teacher named Vernon Howard, who I really love. He died in 1992 and Vernon, you know, spoke to something that I think supports your point about suppression. He would say, look, you know, you could spend all day long trying to analyze why somebody does something, but you have to ultimately get down to the effects. You know, so if the effects are intimidating another person, you know, it's hostility. You know, the effects are squelching information. It's suppression. So in effect, you know, that's what's going on. You know, everybody thinks they have a good reason for throwing a rock at somebody. Everybody thinks they have a good reason for, for, you know, getting angry and making somebody frightened or whatever. You know, everyone thinks they're on a good guy, but the effects themselves are what really matters. So in effect, yeah, it amounts to suppression. And it's not something I'd want to dedicate my career to. No. And, but, you know, like also, I love that you mentioned getting like stuck on the sticky trap of pushback to the suppression that you can just get just as stuck there, you know, whereas you spend your whole life as the reverse amazing Randy and then instead, instead of, you know, I think the logical conclusion to reach with this, right, is, is to begin to explore these own potentials in yourself, to begin to see what is possible within yourself. Could you, you know, I just love your writing on Ernest Holmes, who I've loved a lot and that entire like philosophy, I have used that and it has worked again and again and again and again and again to the point where I would be so disingenuous to not say, I mean, I don't think that I would have successful podcaster be living the life that I'm living right now, if not for running into the science of mind and these philosophies. And because you've written so much on the topic, I wonder if we could kind of wrap up on you, maybe giving people some ideas of how to explore this stuff in their own lives. Well, let me attempt a unifying point between the science of mind philosophy and psychical research. Cool. You know, the researcher, JB Ryan, who I've been mentioning, JB was so conservative in the way he pursued his ESP studies that he really hesitated to extrapolate implications from the studies. In fact, there were some mathematicians who said, JB, your material is never going to get taken seriously with a mainstream science until you come up with a theory of delivery, a delivery mechanism. You know, how does ESP work? And, you know, JB would always beg off about that. And, you know, I've spoken to his daughter about it and, you know, he felt that his job as a statistician was to provide evidence, leave it to the philosophers and the metaphysicians to come up with a delivery mechanism. I'm not sure that was correct. I think every generation has to at least make an effort to come up with a delivery mechanism for how something works. I try to do that for positive mind philosophy in my book, Miracle Club, for example. So I'm not sure JB was right about that, but he was a hero to me and a huge influence. And one of the things that I always noticed about him is that he was so dedicated to his work that he wouldn't get into extrapolations, but he did make one note, one note in the British edition of his 1934 monograph, Extrasensory Perception. He writes an appendix where he makes the observation that in trials where the researchers are getting results, they find invariably that the results, the hit rates, seem to dip when the subject is fatigued or bored or distracted. And if they stop what they're doing and have a cup of coffee, have a conversation, go outside and have a smoke, whatever it is, you know, and then they come back to the table and there's a mood of conviviality. There are good spirits that prevails. The results invariably spike again, invariably spike again. And JB said that the, the, the correlative factor seems to be hopeful expectancy. Wow. Expectancy. Yeah. Wow. Can you dig that? Yeah. And Jung made this observation too in his own analysis of JB Ryan's experiments. And he said, you know, hopeful expectancy or a spirit of conviviality seems to be the factor that needs to be present if there are going to be any results at all. And I thought to myself, how much does that unlock that this man, this conservative man relegated to an appendix in the 1934 British edition of his monograph, but it's monumental. You know, he would put something in a footnote that would be an epic observation. Hopeful expectancy is, is the key, is the turnkey behind everything that we're talking about behind placebo studies, behind, you know, all kinds of psychological possibilities, whether one, you know, sees them from a cognitive or a metaphysical perspective and why can't it be both, you know? And if you can learn how to catch that lightning in a jar, and that's what I've dedicated all, you know, the, the, the practical versus the historical side of my writing to, if you can learn to catch that lightning in a jar, the experiments and the possibilities that unfold from that are extraordinary. But that's what JB saw as, as the critical key, the skeleton key to whether they were going to get results. And it unifies both science of mind philosophy and psychical research. You've just answered a question that I have wondered about ever since I read. I, I love, there's a Buddhist teacher, Mingyir, Mingyir Kinsi Rampashe. And he's so good. And his books are just wonderful. But one of the things in the books that I found really weird was the advice that when you're meditating, if you start having wild, transcendent experiences, stop meditating for a little bit. And I was like, what the fuck? Wouldn't you want to continue the practice if you're having these experiences? Now it lines up with what you're saying. The idea is like, yeah, but the next time you sit down, you're going to have this thing in your head that you want that experience. You're going to like, I imagine in the Rhine experiments, you're getting these results, you're going to get this kind of fatigue. And then somewhere in there, you lose the hopeful expectancy. It's the same with meditation. It's like the advice that sounds counterintuitive. OK, we'll stop for a little bit is actually would amplify the effects based on what Ryan is saying. The yes, yes, take a break, take a rest, take a breather. And then so that when you're going into your practice, you're not going into it with a stern, like, I don't know, Shaolin monies, like I'm going to fucking eat a nail or some shit, but rather it's light, open and empty. And in that, that's where the magic could happen. That's really cool, man. That's really cool, hopeful expectancy. Wow. Yeah. And one of the things I'm trying to experiment with in my work right now is what a person can do who's in a situation where they're unable to summon hopeful expectancy, like let someone is suffering from a crushing anxiety or grief or depression. It's not always fair, you know, to ask somebody to use that as the royal road to mental causation, because there are people who are in emotional anguish, and we all are, you know, from time to time, where sometimes they perhaps are unable to access that at a time when they're in deepest need. So I'm writing a new book called Daydream Believer, where I'm trying to get down to the question of whether there are other ways as well to summon mental possibilities, mental causative possibilities, whether maybe just understanding, as people sometimes do in transparent placebo experiments, just understanding that your mind has causative properties that in itself may be enough to help actualize. So I'm asking the question of whether the wish itself, even in the absence of the emotional state, may be sufficient. OK, OK. Now, that sounds awesome. But, you know, especially for folks like me who have anxiety, that that notion or the whenever I'm like in a particularly contorted anxious shit state, then, God forbid, I remember, you know, your mind has causative properties, then sometimes they can have the opposite effect where it's like, oh, no, it's like my fear is going to produce more fear. And now I'm afraid of my fear because it's making more fear. Then you go into a fear neutron star condition. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Yeah. I'm the same way. I suffer from anxiety and, you know, but but that helps me in a certain sense, because it allows me to say, OK, so if I'm not temperamentally hopeful, if that isn't who I am by nature, yeah, then that's good, because that at least helps me, you know, feel a sense of solidarity with the person, you know, who's also not, who is suffering from depression or grief or whatever it is. But, you know, the program in placebo studies at Harvard Med School has has done a couple of experiments in transparent placebos where they found that they get significant results among patients who are told we're giving you, in effect, a sugar pill. This is an inert substance. And again, the Harvard researchers like J.B. Ryan have been very conservative. They haven't extrapolated from their own research, which I honor because they're really trying to play this as strict as they possibly can. But the results they're getting are incredible. But it seems to me that the very understanding that a placebo is effective in itself is enough so that you don't need the so-called decoy pill or the deceptive pill or whatever, you know. So could it be could it be that a new thought that in science of mind, the very understanding that your mind has causative properties is enough just as it is in placebo experiments so that I don't have to necessarily go into the mental scenery or the emotive state that I might not be able to access in a state of anxiety at 4 a.m. But could it be that the understanding itself is sufficient and and how does one attempt to harness and use that? Oh, I love that. I love that because, you know, this the domain of the of the fucking con artist healer is that they I think they tell themselves that they're bullshit ritual or whatever the thing it is that they're doing, even though they might in their own hearts know this is nonsense. They think, well, this helps induce the placebo effect by deceiving the client or patient or whatever you want to call it, when in reality is like, no, you don't need to do all the smoke and mirror stuff. You don't need to do any of that. Right, exactly. And what if that's true within the structure of your own psyche, within the structure of your own psyche? What if just the understanding of what we're talking about is sufficient to heighten these abilities? Mitchell Horowitz, always blow in my mind every time. Thank you so much. I'm pleasure. Wow. Yeah, that's incredible. That's free base. It's like every time I talk to you, you're like learning how to cook this stuff down into more potent yet simpler forms. It's really an intense thing to watch your process. How can people find you? My website is Mitch Horowitz dot com. I'm on Twitter at Mitch Horowitz and Instagram at Mitch Horowitz, 23.

88^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Christina Pazsitzky Transcript and Discussion^2014-11-04^"Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Hello my dear sweet, sentient bubbles of meat floating down the time-space continuum. It is I, Duncan Trussell, the Skrillex of podcasting and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, welcome. We've got a wonderful podcast for you, but before we get going I wanna talk a little bit about some experiences I had over the weekend. This weekend I volunteered at one of the quarantine clinics that is popping up where people who have been infected with the new Taylor Swift song, Shake It Off, are being observed and kept out of the general population. The first thing I wanna say is there is no reason to stigmatize or reject these people. There's no reason to be afraid of these people. There's no reason to treat these people differently than you're treating anyone else. They can't help that they got infected with this terrible sonic parasite called Shake It Off. It's a very interesting form of parasite because in the history of science, it's the very first time that a parasite has transformed into music. This has never happened before. Hopefully it will never happen again. Also, let me make sure that you guys understand that I'm not trying to be a fear monger here. I'm not trying to scare you guys with what I'm about to say. It's just that I spent the weekend watching people in varying stages of this brand new disease and it was one of the most terrifying, scary things that I've ever seen in my life. And that doesn't mean you should be afraid. It just means that you need to do what you can do to protect your family and your friends and yourself from listening to this song, which once it gets into your head, that's it. It's got a 80% chance of never leaving your consciousness according to the CDC. They say that 80% of the people who come into contact with Taylor Swift's song, Shake It Off, will spend the rest of their lives hearing the chorus of that song over and over and over again. And these folks that I saw who are currently in quarantine, I've never seen people so desperate. I saw a man use his car keys and try to scoop his temple out. He took his keys and just started cutting into his head, right above his eye and nearly smashed through his skull. He was screaming that he would do anything to stop the song. They had to restrain him, put him into a straight jacket. It was a horrible thing to watch. I saw someone jam a chopstick into their eyeball to try to lobotomize themselves. Another person desperately trying to stop the song, but every single doctor that I have talked to has said that there is no way that you could physically cut this song out of your head. Once you hear it, it's there forever. So all I'm saying is whatever you do, if you go out into public, just put in earplugs. Don't go to places where there is even the slightest chance of hearing that song. If you're driving, keep your windows completely rolled up and play loud, loud music so that you can't hear anything outside of your car. This is all coming from the CDC. These are the only ways that we know right now to keep ourselves from being infected with this song. Do not go into any public mall. Do not get around teenagers. Do not get around high schools. Do not get around anyone who has ever told you that they like Taylor Swift or they enjoy her music. They're doing studies on Taylor Swift fans and they've actually found that these people have embedded into their neocortex a very small, mollusk-like creature. It looks like a coiled up elf penis. It's got tiny barbs that inject this neurotoxin into the human brain and it somehow creates the acceptance of Taylor Swift's music and it allows people to like it. It's been compared to the toxoplasmosis virus which as many of you know when a mouse inhales the toxoplasmosis virus which can be found on cat shit, then the mouse is no longer afraid of cats which creates a kind of evolutionary advantage for the cat. In the same way, many people who have come into contact with the vomit and diarrhea of teenagers at Six Flags have inhaled this terrible parasite and it is embedded into their brain and makes them into Taylor Swift fans. You guys can find all this stuff on the CDC's website. I'm only talking about it because I spent an entire weekend watching people desperately trying to rip their own ears off, begging to be shot. I saw a man throw himself in front of a bus. I saw three suicides, five attempted suicides, and countless cases of self-mutilation as an entire clinic filled with people who can't get the Taylor Swift song shake it off out of their head, did everything they could to either end their lives or to knock themselves out or to make themselves go deaf. If you've been infected immediately report to one of the nearest quarantine clinics, there is nothing that you can do by yourself. Go seek help. They will sedate you, they will restrain you, and hopefully over the next few months we will discover a way to erase the song from the minds of those people who have come into contact with it. Again, if you're gonna go into public, wear earplugs, you can wear a full helmet filled with toilet paper, and in the extreme cases, if you really wanna avoid being infected by the Taylor Swift song shake it off, then you can actually go to a doctor and have them remove all the bones in your inner ear. Which will make you deaf for the rest of your life, but some people are saying is preferable to hearing that song. So be safe, stay optimistic, but be smart, avoid exposure to that song, keep America safe, keep this the best country on earth, support the troops, and do everything you can to keep things green. All right guys, we're gonna dive right into the podcast, but first some quick business. Here's a big important announcement. We finally have restocked the store over at DuncanTrestle.com. That means we have got brand new Enneagram T-shirts designed by Ron Regi, lots of other stuff there. Go check it out, we're also getting some ladies' shirts and stocks soon, and I will make an announcement when that happens, but if you've been waiting to get one of the Ron Regi Enneagram T-shirts, they keep selling out, they are now available at DuncanTrestle.com, and please forgive me for pulling the Christmas card, but for those of you guys who are overseas, there is a cutoff date for when you can order shirts, and I think that's November 15th, just because it takes that long to get shirts over there to you. So if you wanna get shirts by Christmas, now is the time to order them. Oh please God, forgive me for even mentioning Christmas right now, I beg your mercy, please, oh great Lord of the Universe, it created jellyfish and sperm whales and sperm. Please, please, please forgive me for mentioning Christmas, but if you wanna get one of these badass Christmas gifts and you live somewhere overseas, you gotta order one of these shirts now. But if you've been waiting for these shirts, go get one now, cause they always sell out, even though we try to keep them in stock. Why do they always sell out? Because Ron Regi embedded them with deep metaphysical super potencies that make it so that whenever you wear that shirt, you radiate a force field that keeps all negative energy from entering into your consciousness and draws to you beautiful things. I've gotten letters from people who say that whenever they go out with the Ron Regi Enneagram T-shirt, they literally have to beat puppies off. You just get sworn by cute, furry, delightful little puppies who just wanna climb on top of you. I've gotten pictures of people just covered in brown, sweet puppies. Butterflies land on you. It can be embarrassing if you're at a business meeting and suddenly a swarm of butterflies lands on your head. It's not good if you're trying to get a high-paying corporate job if all of a sudden woodland animals start dancing around you and singing about how beautiful life is and how the only important thing that matters in this dimension is love and that this is a university where we are being taught to open up our hearts and to abandon fear. That's not gonna get you that Wall Street job that many of my listeners so desperately want. So there's a disclaimer. Don't wear the shirt if you don't want fairies to climb into your window in the evening and serenade you as you're making love to your brand new girlfriend or boyfriend who approached you randomly because he saw or she saw the shirt and said to you, I think you're my soulmate. Don't do it. Don't wear the shirt if you don't want people who have canal canoes to invite you on canal rides. Don't wear the shirt if you don't want the moon to wink at you or you're not interested in being abducted by aliens who rather than probing your anus will induce six-hour orgasms while injecting high-powered alien level dimethyltryptamine into your juggler vein. All these things are possible from wearing this shirt so don't get the shirt but those are the experiences you're trying to avoid. Also, thank you guys so much for everyone who's subscribing who is bookmarking the Amazon portal. If you go to dunkintrustle.com, there is an Amazon portal that you can go through the next time you're buying anything on amazon.com and I really appreciate all of you who have been using that. That actually generates a lot of money for this podcast and it's a great way for you to support the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast without donating what you can do to or buying a shirt. So please, if you're doing any kind of shopping, do go through our portal, bookmark it and a few things that I could recommend picking up. I'll tell you the newest thing that I bought from Amazon is this really cool card game called Dominion and I just figured out how to play it yesterday. I've played a couple of games and I'm hopelessly hooked. It costs 24 bucks and if you're looking for a really fun game that isn't as nuanced and complex as Magic the Gathering, it's like somewhere in between Magic the Gathering and shit, I can't remember the name of this awesome board game that I played with a friend of mine. Fuck, what is it? Anyway, it's a great game. So it's called Dominion. That's something cool that you could order through the Amazon portal. Another thing you can order and I'll keep tooting its horn even though we're not sponsored by them is a Fitbit. I know you guys have been hearing about all these fitness trackers and many of you are probably rolling your eyes at them but I lost my Fitbit. I don't know what happened to it. I was trying to charge it and I lost it and ever since I lost it, I have not been exercising but prior to losing it, I was on one of the top health kicks of my entire life, running every day, exercising every day. I guess because we've all in our own ways been conditioned and brainwashed into wanting to have compensation for every single thing we do that it somehow plays into that part of your brain and gives you the feeling that you're getting paid every time you go to exercise. I don't know why it works like that. It feels like some pretty adept corporate psychologist studied what makes people exercise and figured out that somehow just knowing how little you exercise and having a daily report of that is enough motivation to get you out there. So if you're wanting something to kickstart your exercise regimen, I can't recommend a Fitbit more and you can get one by going through our Amazon portal. So won't you please do that? All right, we've got an incredible podcast for you today. Today's guest, Christina Pajitsky is one of my favorite comics on planet Earth. We talk about that a little bit as I'm interviewing her. She's also the host of two awesome podcasts. One of them, Your Mom's House, she does with Tom Segura, another genius comedian. And the other one, that's Deep Bro, she does on her own and she actually just had me on that podcast and we had an amazing chat. And so then I invited her to this podcast and we had another awesome chat. You can find Christina's upcoming dates by going to ChristinaComedy.com. She's also got links to all her podcasts and everything that you might need to connect with her. So now everyone, please open your third eyes and send as many thunderbolts of love as you possibly can in the direction of today's guest, Christina Pajitsky. [""Welcome To The Dugget Trussell Family Hour""] [""Welcome, welcome to you, that you are without shame and glory to be blue. Welcome to you, welcome to the Dugget Trussell Family Hour."" Christina, welcome to the Dugget Trussell Family Hour podcast. I'm so excited. I'm so excited. I got to tell you, man, there have been, I've had a few comedy moments that I'm going to remember forever. And one of them was the time I saw George Carlin perform. Love him. And the other time was when I saw you perform, not even joking. Stop it. No, I saw you and guys, she's not going to listen to the compliment, but you will. In stand-up comedy, sometimes you see a comedian who is really doing it. And when you see that, it is, as a comedian, it's amazing because it teaches you a lot. But you are so incredibly talented. And the thing that you're doing on stage is so unique where you realize it's like some people, they're taking the form and trying to fit into it. And then some people are making the form fit who they are. They're taking the form of stand-up comedy and warping it and using it to bring this new, unique thing out. And that's what your performance was like. Oh my God, Duncan, I can't, don't start like this. I can't take this much of it at all. Well, I want to start like that. So folks. I'm a fan of yours and I can't believe I'm here. This is like the best podcast ever. I've been listening to you and I'm like sweating. I'm so excited. What are we going to get into? Are we going to get weird? Yeah, we can get, yeah. I mean, yes, I would like to get weird. Yeah, man. I, you know, the, here, how about we start with how fucking impossible it is to take a compliment these days? Well, yeah. Listen, I have approval issues. I know your mother was a therapist. Yes. What kind was she? She was, well, she would call herself an eclectic therapist, which meant that she would just do whatever she wanted. She had, you know, a spiritual bent to the stuff that she was doing, but she wasn't like a Jungian or Freudian or a Rugerian or anything like that. She just would sit with people and I love them. And I think she was really good at it. But I don't know, you know, that part of her life, I wish I'd asked her more about it or get, but you can't. You can't watch someone practicing therapy because it's confidential and private. I know, but she obviously taught you to accept yourself because you, you seem to have that part down. Accepting myself? Yes, which is part of taking a compliment, which I have a very hard time doing because I don't accept myself. So that's the point. You know, I saw Paul Mooney was performing in the original room and he came out after his performance and I said, that was really great. And he goes, I know, wasn't it the greatest thing? Oh, wasn't it wonderful? It was just wonderful, wasn't it? And I remember the way he did it was so honest. Like he was observing himself and was pleased with whatever it happened. It's like an audience member. Like he was not even commenting on Paul Mooney I was talking to in the hall. He was talking about whoever that Paul Mooney was on stage. So he could leave it, he could look at himself objectively is what you're saying? That's what it felt like. His love of himself did not feel corrupted. It just somehow and it also made me feel like, oh, cool. I guess I have good taste because he believes he's good too. Right. Oh, right. You know, so it's kind of that thing where, you know, when people compliment you, you get a decision. You and I do. I mean, generally I try to defy. It's awkward. Yeah, it feels. Yeah, it's weird. Why? Because some part of you rejects you, right? Isn't that the reason? Oh my God, what's moving around? Oh, it's that lady. Yeah. Guys, I've got somebody cleaning my house right now. Judge me for it if you want, but I don't claim very well. Can I tell you that if you got the 50 bucks to spend on that, it'll save your life. If you're married and people complain about, oh, my husband leaves again on the floor. Why don't you just hire someone to do 50 bucks? It'll change your relationship. It'll change your life. It'll free up your time. Exactly. Love yourself. Love yourself. And it's an incredible thing that you could do. But to get back to the idea of accepting love or accepting that affirmation from the universe, it's a very curious thing that we block that as much as possible. And that we insult ourselves so much and accept all that. But what is that? What a strange thing that is, isn't it? Yes. Well, I watched this documentary on Netflix about this performance artist. Have you seen it? It's called Marina. Her name is Marina Abramovitz. Yes, that was that ass where she sits and looks at people. And why is that so challenging a thing to do to just sit and look at somebody and just be and just be still? But she said this really neat thing where she goes, I'm three people. She goes, I'm the person that my mother doesn't love enough. I'm that child that didn't get the love. I am, oh, something like a product of communism, the rigidity that she grew up in, the disciplined self, and then the transcendent self as well. And she likes being the higher self the most. That's the best place to be. And I was like, yeah, man, I get that. Because my parents are from communism and my mother was a nutcase. And I go through those. Your parents are from communism. Yeah, they grew up in Hungary. And they escaped from communism in 1969, on foot escaped. Yeah, dude. You think life is hard in America? I complain about, oh, I didn't get my ketchup for my hash browns fast enough. My parents had an orange for Christmas. Or they were eating horse meat during the Hungarian Revolution. Just crazy stuff like that. Or so what are their thoughts on communism? Not fantastic. I think that in theory, it was a great idea and then executed. Not so fantastic. They hate it. Yeah. Really ruin people's lives. I mean, to see your neighbors get murdered in the middle of the night for speaking out about the government, stuff like that. Not so great. Having to sing hymns to Mother Russia when you're a Hungarian kid. They forced my parents to learn Russian. Yeah, not so great. That is so crazy to think that that happens from time to time. The power manifests in that way where you actually end up in an Orwellian universe where you can get murdered. And can I tell you, my father loves America. Like, he's loved America since he can remember. All he wanted was to drink a Coca-Cola. That was his big aspiration. And he came to America and he just fucking, he loves it. But he says stuff to me now. Like, he's like, you know what? This is kind of how it was before the Russians. Yeah, I think he senses the surveillance is going on. You're never really off the grid. That's right. And it is getting scarier and it is pervasive. The surveillance? Yeah. The NSA, the new disclosure about there looking at everyone's mail. They're watching everyone. You know, it is similar in one way, but in another way, it's marijuana's legal. True. People are not, they're not getting arrested for talking about stuff. And people are actively railing against the government on the mainstream media. Fox News. That's true. Fox News, it's number one topic is how fucked up Obama is. All they do is talk about how shitty Obama is. That's their favorite thing to talk about. And nothing happens to anyone there at all. They just get rich. They just get rich and they're talking shit about the most powerful, one of the most powerful humans on earth. And they're just making tons of money. Whereas in other countries, if you do that stuff, they drag you away and arrest you. And I'm by no means, I'm not like, it's there for America's great. I think that there's this kind of like, it's a different kind of horror, which is that instead of having this wonderful central evil figure who is like actively executing people, we get this diffusion of responsibility. Yeah, that's interesting. We're nowhere like there. It's like, who's doing, why are we even monitoring? Yeah, it's like the Panopticon. What is that? It's kind of similar, not really. Okay, so, you know, even heard of Foucault, he wrote Discipline and Punish. I have to stop you for one second. Okay, Foucault. Yes. Here we are. So you're talking about the localization of evil. I'm sorry, like the centralized idea of evil versus kind of now or power rather, like the exertion of power from one place opposed to the many like ubiquitous power structures kind of. Right. So Foucault had this theory. It's actually based on Jeremy Bentham, the Panopticon. In prisons, there is, the rooms are, it's like circular, right? Yes. Okay, let's say this theory. There's a tower in the middle and then all the cells around the center tower. And the theory being that people behave because there is somebody in the tower watching you, the Panopticon. So the power structure works, whether or not somebody's actually in the tower, as long as you believe somebody is in the tower, that's how that works. But anyway, that's not the point I wanted to make. Just love that idea. I love the Panopticon. But there's the idea in discipline and punish where we used to make public executions well, public, we would punish out in public. The theory being if you see some motherfucker get their hand cut off for stealing, it's going to deter the masses from stealing. Right. Doesn't really work. People still do shit. So now we've taken punishment behind closed doors and we do it, quote, humanely with lethal injections. We're still murdering people. But now it's sanitized and it's all lovely. And it still doesn't fucking work. In fact, the prisons are more crowded now than ever. But execution isn't the reason we execute people not as a deterrent as much as a kind of compensation to the victims or some sort of... That's such a crazy idea. Human sacrifice to pay for the... For the pagan thing. Yeah. Yeah. I always thought that's what it was because no one obviously execution doesn't stop people from doing crazy shit. But yeah, I always just thought it was like, oh, well, the person killed your family or killed someone that you know. So we're going to kill them in front of you and then... You're going to feel really good about that. You're going to feel great about it. Watching someone die, someone in a pathetic situation who had a horrible life and made a stupid decision when he was super eye on PCP, you can watch him go out in a kind of moaning, drooling, frothing whimper. Right. Because if you're going to kill... If it's an eye for an eye, if we're doing the biblical, then you should be able to kill that person, old school biblical style. Right? Like you should be in like, we'll use Dodger Stadium as an arena and then the lions are released and you get to take your rock like David and Goliath and just slingshot it or whatever you want. Well, you know, the new Texas style of execution where you use like experimental poison cocktails that take six hours to kill somebody and leave burn marks running up their arms. Have you heard about these botched lethal injections? So the United States is... There's countries that no longer will sell the United States the lethal injection chemicals or the chemicals that go into it because they don't support execution and companies don't want to sell poison to the United States because it's like, if you live next door to a witch and you know that the witch is using things that you sell her to kill people... It's tacky too. It's just tacky. It's tacky to be a poisoner. So we've been cut off from this chemical like someone at a bar. We've been cut off from the poisoning chemical and so we have to come up with our new ways to kill people because it's not so easy to kill. It's not as easy as you would think to kill someone with poison apparently, which is wild. I thought it was so simple. Give them cyanide and they just die. But for whatever reason, we can't give them cyanide. You don't do gas chambers anymore. It's lethal injection, an injection of a sedative that knocks them out, then an injection of another drug that stops their heart and that's what that's supposed to be humane. But what's been happening with these new chemicals is you inject the sedative and then you inject the other drug and the poor son of a bitch will wake up. One of them woke up in the midst of it and said, this is nasty because whatever is running through him is so disgusting. You can feel it burning in his veins. So really it's almost worse than getting eaten by a lion because a lion will bite your head and suffocate you, bite your neck so that you can't breathe and you're gone. It's pretty quick. Yeah. It's quick. I think if I would not be surprised if these people knew in advance that they were going to have to undergo five hours of boiling from chemically being burnt on the inside or getting eaten by a lion for two minutes, I bet they'd pick the lion for sure. Yeah, that is an interesting point. I wish we could ask people. I would probably take that. I've always wanted to do this thing with my husband called your last cruise. Like if I were to find out that I was like terminally ill or about to die, like we just get a cruise ship of like whoever else is dying that week and then we just do a bunch of heroin and smoke crack and have crazy orgies and just eat all the gluten. Only gluten, only gluten, heroin infused gluten. Yes and egg yolks like so many of them. Yeah, what a great idea. And then yeah and we party and then at the end of the week I bring out the catapult or whoever brings out the catapult and then we catapult ourselves into the ocean and then you're just getting my sharks and you die. What do you think? Love it. It's a great idea. I mean especially if you remove the catapults or the idea that you've got to be dying to enjoy a cruise where you just eat gluten, heroin the whole time. Why can't we just do that? Why do you have to be dying? That's true. I like the idea of the best cruise where it's just orgies, gluten, heroin and no shark catapults though it's there for you. Like if at the end of the thing you decide you want to get catapulted into the sea and devour by sharks you're totally allowed. Dude aren't those like I think gay cruises are like that which is awesome. Gay dudes just party like those guys have the best time. They sure do. Well anybody who's fought for their identity or anybody who's had to struggle it seems like they're anybody who's overcome the awful tyranny of cultural expectation always has that kind of gleeful Dionysian aspect to them where they're just like I'm just gonna have fun man. Yeah fuck you I've earned this. You ever do that where you get where you're like you know you're feeling gloomy or dark or shitty and you get around somebody who's wrenched from the universe that right to be happy and they've fought for it and you start lamenting about whatever in front of them and it's like it's like water breaking on a rock and you can't change their mood. They're like no asshole I'm gonna have a great time. You know after this awful breakup that I had I can remember riding with Joe Rogan up to his house because he was letting me stay there because I was homeless and I was playing Elliott Smith on the radio as we're driving up there and he's like what are you doing. He's like why are you listening. He's like don't listen. He's like this is dark. Why are you listening to this. I'm like just listen man it's beautiful. He's like no I'm not gonna listen but it was really cool what he was I mean what he was doing was very sweet and kind of the last thing you want to hear from someone when you're super depressed and heartbroken and just trying to get all emo over Elliott Smith but it was really cool though he's like I'm not gonna let your depressed paradigm infect my universe. I'm gonna have a good life. I'm happy I'm gonna have a goddamn great life and that's how I choose to live. I'm gonna enjoy existence and no matter how much you try to infect me with your darkness whether intentionally or unintentionally fuck it. I'm just gonna enjoy my life whereas you know I don't know about you but what I do is I tune into a person's mood state and I become like that when I'm around them. Yeah that's what okay that's what I do too because my mom was a crazy person and they say that that's what children do that had to adapt to their parents as opposed to their parents adapting to them but what you're just saying about Joe Rogan everybody's hero and who's fucking amazing yeah is that he's a transcendor he's a transcendent type of like being where he can rise above shit and I think that's what he teaches all of us and I sound like he's like he is kind of is yeah like but that is what I've learned watching him and you have that where you tune into a frequency that is not not not of what's happening in this quote-unquote real world you almost kind of have to that's kind of the essence of being a happy person right is that you tune into the frequencies of a higher frequency we're not gonna go down here where shit's chaos we're gonna go yeah damn yeah man yeah you can do that you can do that and people don't even realize that you can do that they you know some you might be in a shit you know when you're in a shit mood yeah you're walking around in a dark awful mood and if you're if you just change the way you look at that mood state and start coming up with fun words for it recently I've been thinking of the next time you're in a really shitty mood what you can do is pretend that the mood is a demon and that you've been possessed by a demon and that there is an actual demon living inside of you it sounds really intense it's a thought experiment yeah but what so the idea is in magic is that you're invoking entities to try to you know change the universe so in the universe inside of you as much as as much part of the universe outside of you so if you are experiencing a dark mood state it's fun to imagine that you've inadvertently summoned a demon into your into your you know whatever you want to call it your body temple and the the reason that's cool is because if it's a demon inside of you and everyone listening it's not like I literally believe in demons but if there's a demon inside of you you know you don't now you can you maybe can exercise the motherfucker where if there's just a bad mood state and you're feeling awful oh right the tendency is to like wallow in it and just stay in it and just like you have no control like it's yeah it's the weather like your mood is the weather like your mood is the you have as little control over the mood as you do over a gloomy day and it couldn't be truth is it's the opposite of that you can invoke and tune into higher frequencies theoretically that can um sorry I'm wagging my I'm wagging my finger I agree with you you can do that you can transcend shit through music even yes that's powerful that's so crazy what let me hear myself echo do you hear are you really yeah oh it's coming through my headphones hold on a second I was like let me fix that right now yeah that's the idea that you sort of there's actually a buddhist term called noting which is n o t i n g and when you're sitting and meditating or not sitting and meditating you begin to note the different thought patterns and feeling states that most frequently emerge into your consciousness and then he compares it to like naming like the top 10 songs that play on the radio because you know like the inevitably like a lord song will come on and then inevitably some shitty Katy Perry song will come on and these will repeat over and over again and so you start naming the different songs that your mind is playing over and over again which is you know whatever your you everyone will have some the the dog that exists in our mind will have like six toys it likes to chew on or play with and like it's you know quite often they're not great it's like why did this person say this to me at this point or I can't believe this happened or what the fuck is wrong with me or whatever the the the story is so you start watching it and then when it comes you're like oh there it is there it is okay now I'm doing I can't believe that guy said that to me righteous indignation it should I can't control yeah so so and so cut me off and also um like shame is a huge one like to process shame for things maybe you've done or you feel or you think and then um I had this epiphany today actually where I was like I'm really ashamed of like like I fucking banged some dude in my 20s that like you look back on you're like oh my god I can't believe I left that person penetrating my vagina and do you have anybody and you're you're just like oh my god yeah so disgust I'm such a pig and then you go wait who am I afraid of my husband knows everything I don't like besides him who's gonna give a shit about Christina Pajitzki doing x y or z like who's approval am I so afraid of losing you know I'm saying yes nobody gives a shit and I mean that in the most positive possible sense we're also wrapped up in our own stuff like I don't if you were Duncan trust what it tell me like I love I put my dick in Twinkies I fuck the shit out of Twinkies yeah that's awesome dude like I wouldn't even wouldn't bother you maybe you've got shame around fucking Twinkies and it's eating you alive and right yeah that's amazing when you realize you're the thing sitting in the center of the tower the prison oh right yes isn't that wild you're the one you're the one no one cares no one cares about the guy you bang no one cares about putting you when you put your dick in a Twinkie no one cares you could say that to almost anybody and they're gonna like hey what's his dick in Twinkies right and then it's the end of the conversation that's it because even when you hear good gossip about someone you're like oh yeah Duncan fucks Twinkies great what are you guys doing tonight like it doesn't even doesn't matter no it just just drifts away into time it's gone and that's an amazing thing when you're asked oh fuck I'm the tyrant I'm the goddamn communist government shooting people behind the barn I'm the darkness I'm the one who's like constantly at war with myself and that is the demon and what a glorious thing to realize that this crazy amalgamation of all the awful behavior patterns inserted into you by your mentally ill parents formed this being that is constantly trying to shake its fist at you force you into shame states because now you can now you have in the same way that the moment there is a tyrant now you have a tyrant to fight now you have a tyrant to transform now you have a tyrant to whatever you want to whatever kind of internal revolution you want to wage you can't wage a revolution until you identify the main root nucleus core problem so I think my brain just exploded yeah my mind just exploded man you got it how do you know all this well how do you know this oh god I you know I I don't know I love I think I get I've gotten to talk to a lot of really smart people on the podcast who nudged me in this direction of thinking and then once you find this little breadcrumbs trail that leads you to that realization that you're the darkness in your own life it's pretty cool it's exciting when you realize that yes yes and I love I love exploring uh just getting to the truth of it all you know I I like this journey I do is painful and as confusing and awful as it is sometimes you're like oh I gotta go there because if I don't what's the fucking point what's the point you gotta do it wait can I ask you that I have written down some questions oh my god I'm supposed to be asking you questions no you trust me you're far more uh I'm so I'm love talking okay what's the meaning of life go there I don't know start off easy I don't know that's something great I this is a great thing that I've learned to do and what I'm trying to learn to do is to say I don't know when I don't know because it's so easy to not say that and I like I ask the ramdas people stuff like that all the time and it's so nice when they're like I don't know it sucks it's great no they don't who knows I don't know and and the question itself is uh composed of so many goddamn the horrible the terms that are symbols that who knows what any of those symbols even mean anyway that it's like a really hard thing to figure out but um I don't know I don't know I look I like existing I know that I'm a big fan of existence and it's pretty great it's great sandwiches to eat and movies I watched the movie speed last son I like doing dumb things now a lot dumb shit's my favorite stuff oh lifetime network lifetime network on apple tv man that is a glorious thing the the way they title their movies is so funny it's like they the laziest person on earth right like they go to them like well this is a movie about a teacher who in a stall molester kid in a high school and it's molestation issues so what should we call this dirty teacher they have a there's a movie on lifetime called dirty teacher of course so it's great yeah so yeah and dumb stuff is fantastic you know I that whole hierarchy of like oh i'm gonna sit and listen to classical music and read some kamu come on you could it's all beautiful it's all yeah abundance all of it it's all sides of the same stuff right but like okay so here's one theory though meaning of life stuff okay like you know i i studied philosophy right and um i don't think there's an adequate answer to to it in philosophy meaning per se but there's have you heard of martin heidegger he's uh yes yeah recently here's what's weird about that because just on this last episode i did i was talking about martin heidegger and i had to uh tell abri i had to clarify i read one essay years ago so that i didn't seem like i knew anything about him but go on please well here's the thing is that i've read heidegger and i still don't know what the fuck he's really talking about like how much heidegger have you read well i tried getting i took a class on um existentialism right oh sorry phenomenology and i read i was supposed to have read all of being in time but it's so dense it's like you know 500 pages so difficult and his sentences are really difficult because they're translated from german and german itself is a complicated language right there's no sound who fucking knows what they're talking about the one idea i just try to glean good ideas i can't i can't do people's whole opuses i think uh he said the meaning of being capital b is located in care meaning uh the care that we lend two things the care it the essence of like i lend my care to this cup right now and right now that is the meaning of being oh i love it right like wow kind of eastern huh yeah very eastern yeah it really is and and that connective i guess the connective tissue of care is a kind of medium that you can transmit your whatever your specific uh what is it what's it called the uh is i'm gonna fuck up the word what's it called da something design yeah what does that mean that's another hour on your student but you're sort of like connecting through care yeah does sign is the i right but does sign is being i guess you would say yeah the the the manifest but he still never defines being you who knows what being what is that even but does sign is yes the i the the perceiver i guess you would say you can like to like you know i was i when you're doing any kind of work and especially if you're doing like construction work you're trying to build something then you realize that you're the momentum of your entire life is actually in a kind of fractal way shaping your ability to hang a shelf or to i just hung a shelf and for the first time i pulled it off man i'm such a half man thing because i'm not good at any kind of construction and i i was like god damn it i'm gonna hang this fucking shelf and it's i'm gonna make it look good and i'm gonna do it right so to do that i had to subvert all of my um habituations and behavior patterns that usually involve i'm gonna fucking just get this over with fast fuck at the screw i'll just hammer the goddamn screw in the instructions can't totally be right i'm gonna use a dumb template just put the fucking thing up and drill it in try to get past the rules but this time like i'm gonna go very slowly and carefully through the whole thing and bam i got a shelf on the wall and it looks fucking cool so that care thing that you're talking about it makes a lot of sense because if in the moment of drinking tea uh doing some kind of work uh you know hanging out with a person if you do apply just a modicum of care if that's what he even meant if you do apply a modicum of i care i care what's the worst thing you can say when somebody says they love you oh i don't care yeah i know in difference yeah oh wow yeah care attention you're lending yourself to be you know they use all these wacky German phrases and shit i love that caring because when you're the opposite of caring is when you're driving down the street completely numbed out trying to get home in that weird fuzzy in between state you're not caring you're just anesthetized or something yeah but i mean is it possible to be fully present and cognizant all the time like there has to be there has to be moments where you're like i'm just gonna fucking you know you've had sets i'm sure where you're like i just got autopilot this to get through you know i've never had a bad comedy set i'm just kidding i thought i looked at you and i was like wow you're like uh i've seen you perform at all you got to blow my mind even more what no i heard some comics said that i can't remember what it was but some comic comic in an interview actually had the audacity to say that they i think it was forgive me for saying this i could be wrong i'd not positive that it was sin bad but somebody told me sin bad in an interview said that he'd never had a bad comedy set hilarious i my favorite is steve harvey right now like i saw he was on an opera special it was an hour of like ask steve harvey anything do we really have to does anyone haven't we heard enough oh steve yeah there's a great montage somebody put together of his just disgusting weird outlook on life that all seems to rotate around the very real probability that from time to time and i'm not i'm not saying he does this i don't believe that he does it i don't know if he does it so i'm not but it it does feel like there's the potential there if you're a woman around him on the wrong day that it's not going to be a really great day for you you think yeah it seems like he's just like you know there's like somebody called and they're like i want to watch football i want to learn more about football so i can watch it with my husband and he's like oh you don't really want to understand football that's your husband's day he needs to focus on the game because when he's at work he's gonna be around the water cooler talking about that game and he needs to know everything happens so just leave him alone it's like that anyway we don't need to ask steve harvey but to get back to the concept of caring yes the concept of uh being fully present or the concept of the weird wave form of life where sometimes you're there and sometimes you're not yeah i don't i don't know if it's capable if you're if it's possible but in a lot of different texts there is the idea that you can truly wake up and you're not going to go back to sleep like this bro like your ultimate neem kerali baba like maharaji people say that he was an awakened being and i think he was and you know like okay somebody in a bad relationship right when you're when you get around somebody who's having a very difficult relationship or even a better example would be abused children so when you get around an abused child what you're seeing is the thumbprint of their parents on them so you could just see the impact their parents have had in the way they act or an abused dog for example you know if you a rescue dog what you're seeing you don't know what happened outside of the way that they're acting whatever the energy was they were around the most was hurting them right so when you get around disciples of maharaji they all have the same kind of energy that they're putting out which is this sweet buoyant funny sardonic interesting energy and from that you can experience a kind of temporal echo of that guy's vibe still bouncing off of them and so that's how i feel like i know what that guy was like and he was really really funny and he was really really i'm gonna say edgy but he was very he wasn't like always embracing people in the way that looking at me he's laying down he's cold chilling yeah and you know not to throw stones but he's he's a little husky for a guru he was a big big big body because what he would you know as part of the being a guru people always wanted to feed him so he would go to all these indian homes and people would want to give him food and he was always caught now i'm not saying that he didn't enjoy the food i'm sure he did but uh he ritualistically as a guru people will like you're just eating food and he was feeding people all the time and they ate sugary food and stuff and i wish that he back in the time when he was wandering around they understood how deadly sugar and gluten was because i think maybe he wouldn't he would have lived a little bit longer but the so i don't know what he was like exactly but i have seen his imprint on people and it's amazing it's amazing now whatever that is they all just say well when you got around him all you could do is love like when you were sitting around him or near him you just felt love coming from him and all you could do is feel love but it wasn't always like that he'd send people away there was a i can't remember the word for it but people would come to him who'd heard about him from ramdas and he would just once he saw them like you have to you can't stay that's rad like get out of here like nah dude not you not you not yet you're not here yeah you're not on the same level not yet you gotta split man and because not everybody not everybody uh that's so funny but then that's a very loving thing to do because i wish i could do that with people at shows you know you're like clearly you got a free ticket you're not allowed in here you can't watch me before it's such an important thing to do i didn't get it bro do you so it seems like you've been reading stuff about him or yeah well here's the the struggle is okay i got into ramdas and then i interviewed you for that's deep bro which i haven't aired yet but and i just didn't even know that dude was and i had heard about maharajit through listening to ramdas and the struggle with knowing your dude maharajit is that there's no there's no like youtube videos of him talking nope you have to like hear about him via what other people know of him stories of him is that accurate because i don't i can't find a book that he wrote there's a great video i saw of him that's on youtube uh and somebody's sitting around him oh there is a video yeah i've only seen like heard audio i'll show it to you there's only there's only but it's a quick video it's just him sitting there in this i can't you know these are hippies i couldn't tell if it's a guy or a girl but there's a person sitting in front of him putting their head down kind of bowing to him a little bit but he keeps put he's like almost he's not slapping them but he's pushing their head up in this really sweet way where he's like no like he's not telling them no but he's like come on like the thing that you're doing he's like pushing them out of this like kind of uh what's the word affected thing that they're doing he's just kind of like come on just be here with me just be here and that's what's beautiful about him is that there isn't like a scripture based on him there's people who will tell crazy crazy stories about things that happen when they were around them like people who swear that they saw him bring a bird back to life and that people who like saw him like he was telepathic for sure like he could yes i've heard stories yeah he could tell you exactly what was going on with you he knew everything about you he could like when you were around him but what's so funny is when i was talking to the people from the foundation about that that aspect they were like ragu marcus the guy who was like runs the ram das's foundation was like every third person in india's telepathic that's not what that's not a big deal really really many he's like whatever tell telepathy who cares it's not a big deal it's a rudimentary thing anybody can develop you know like it is just like yeah okay but what was incredible about him was not so much the magical things that he would do as much as when you were around him you were able to feel complete love for yourself because he knew everything about you and all the parts of yourself that you were ashamed of somehow from his complete unconditional love for you and his weird connection with the deepest darkest part of yourself that combined to let you forgive yourself and then because you could forgive yourself then when you went back out in the world you could give that love to other people and how do you write that down do i think you just did i mean i think you just i mean yeah what a great way to articulate that whole wow dude yeah it's pretty crazy it's so crazy sorry i'm like blown away by how you just said that because i've never been able to articulate thoughts that you just did it's sweet oh yeah it's kind of the reason people love their dogs i'm i'm obsessed with my dog he's a rescue and you're right when they come to you you're like what happened to you like tom and i can't high five in the house because the dog starts going crazy barking yeah he was assaulted by high fives and then uh but um oh people love their dogs because uh dogs are complete acceptance yes they don't judge you they don't think anything of you other than like hey you're here this is great i never thought you'd come back you're the greatest thing i've ever seen yes yeah and and that is i i often think of my dog as a guru to me and i and the uh i think that they are like that and that's called unconditional positive regard where they just like it doesn't they don't care what you just did if you just came home from a night of fucking twinkies yes your dog's gonna he's gonna love it he's gonna want to wake the twinkies off your cock yeah but he but you're you're right yeah that is that's the most potent force is that is uh like if you know the idea of turning lead into gold and alchemy which is the like that was a people still if anyone could figure out a turn some base metal some less expensive metal into a more expensive metal yeah then they would well they would completely devalue gold they want to give a fuck it would be useless but before they got devalued you'd be a very wealthy person as you were producing gold and so that was the dream and alchemy is how do we figure out how to turn lead into gold and a lot of people say they weren't really trying to turn lead into gold because they began to understand that nothing in the material universe is of any real value what's the most important is transforming the essence of yourself into a higher state or going from a lower frequency to a higher frequency and so if human beings are considered lead then love would be the thing that transforms the human biomass into a kind of egotistical shitty swarm of locust like super advanced monkeys into something beautiful and that's why there's no more powerful ability than to love someone fully there's nothing more powerful levitating bricks or setting buildings on fire with your mind even though that's incredible it's just gonna change the material universe and make people scared of you or worship you but if you can get around somebody and fully embrace them completely and love them and recognize everything about them and know that just in the same way your dog barks because people high five that doesn't mean that the dog sucks and you still love your dog just because somebody does shitty things around you and they are defensive around you it's because they were around who the fuck knows where they came from yes it's so hard to remember that when people act like idiots like god i don't know if you've ever been in legal problems before oh thank god no i mean i'm involved with something now where i i'm reading the letters being sent back and forth from attorney to attorney and you're just going like what evil way of thinking what flawed can you talk about what this is i shouldn't i don't think i don't talk about it yeah it's not smart but uh it's not that i have nothing with it's just a contract it's a contract dispute that i'm having with somebody right and uh you go well i'm trying to be loving i'm trying to stay in a place of love and acceptance at the same time it's like how do like how do you accept bad shit when it does come like how do you how did you not get angry with god when you had cancer how do you not let go fuck this i'm out it's you know when you get cancer you you it's you do i mean it does like it's really intense and it rattles you but it's it's nothing compared i'm it's nothing compared to some of the other shitty things that can happen in a person's life like cancer is like oh fuck i'm mortal and i could die and uh um somehow in that realization it's like god is like throwing cold water into your face or like giving you a chance to live because a lot of people aren't even alive so you feel resurrected by your own mortality weirdly whereas like so yeah i don't know i know i didn't get there were moments of like where i realized oh shit i could i could feel myself like sinking into terror or horror or something and and sometimes i i still get scared but no cancer doesn't do that a lot of other things will are way worse like a bad relationship worse than cancer oh yeah you think so oh yeah but you can you can extract yourself from those and sometimes it's easier to cure cancer don't think well you've had some pretty horrific relationships then well i've i i've seen i've i've seen them and i've seen how much i'm lucky because i never got uh handcuffed genetically to somebody which can happen like you know so many i've heard of comics who on the road hook up with somebody that person gets pregnant and they have to marry them or they have to start you know what i mean like that can happen where you're deeply deeply sucked into a thing and there ain't no there's no getting out there's no getting out so that kind of the my point is that it's like that's true if you look at the in cancer you could say well there's no getting out but there is getting out because you're gonna die or if you if you're set if you have a certain certain type so with a relationship i mean that could go on for 30 years 20 years of trying to ignore somebody if you decide not to get a divorce or you just like stick it or even worse like you don't even you pretend it's okay yeah i i agree i life is so short to do that like i say that in my act even like don't if you're with somebody that you fucking hate and you're married and even i know you have kids it's a different story i don't have kids to worry about if you don't have kids and you're married and you you just you hate that person just go just go you'll find something i promise you it'll be better and i know it's terrifying the prospect of what's what's gonna be like outside of this i don't know it's easier said than done i guess well you got it you can't be in a rush i mean you you you have to extract yourself in the same way you got into it you can't get out of it but the but again how do you deal with that how do you deal with the you know everyone's gonna have their own personal horror story that they have to confront and i think that the advice that the ramdas people give is recognize that where you're at is perfect right it's exactly where you need to be you are in a school that is makes getting into harvard look like driving to the glendale galleria it's so difficult to get a human incarnation it's so incredibly rare to get one of these things you are in the ivy league here right of the universe you're in a kind of like godling training school where you are being given an entire universe that is teaching you uh and the way that it's teaching you is not through great things but it's also teaching you by giving you challenges to overcome and so when you see that whatever the thing that is that you're dealing with you recognize oh it's you the guru has come i'm so fortunate because here's the guru disguised as my cancer here is the guru disguised as my lawsuit here is the guru disguised as disguised as my mentally ill mom here is the guru disguised as my depression you know whatever it is just that changing what it is from something that's an impossible situation to a initiation ritual that is being offered to you by the universe so that you could graduate and move into the next phase of your incarnation and whatever the simulation is can give you the traction you need to get through it instead of like falling into a whimpering mass yeah because that is not the point that we're supposed to learn these lessons and like i don't like that the people often miss uh what am i looking for they don't they don't define karma properly like it's not that you're you're punished for your sins necessarily but that you're working out something right like like human incarnations you're supposed to work through is that what it is like you work through your karma you work through your bummers and you figure out here but you need to improve on to become like a being of love and light is that the point that's what they say they just say that whatever's going down is exactly what you need that you're getting this awesome simulation experience that's teaching you all this valuable stuff and that if you approach it with that intention we're like okay okay i got it it's a class i forgot it was a class i thought it was an accident a catastrophe or some kind of ridiculous thing the simulation's a little more realistic than i might like but i'm gonna deal with it in the same way i might deal with a flight simulator or i might deal with any other video game that's teaching me and i'm not gonna treat it as though it's uh it's anything more than a really wonderful wonderful class with people who are that these teachers man they are dedicated to like when you go to disneyland and you get around mickey mouse and the mickey mouse suit they might be committed to the character but eventually you can get them to admit they're a human but when you get around some of these humans here they're devoted to being assholes they're working so hard playing the part the universe is like really like not gonna break character no because it's so powerful to think that you are defined by your past that you're defined by your awful mother by your yeah the you know the suit that i'm in what a fun thing that is to i i know people like that i i know people who cannot get past the abuse and they cannot get past the trauma that happened from the mentally ill parent yeah and so every single thing that they do they always revert back or refer back to remember what you know what my mom did to me and it's a victim thing too it's really easy to get caught up in the victimhood of your story and of who you were what happened and blah blah blah which is really i get i i yeah i i work a lot to get over that oh i hate that and i'm not i am not my story nobody is their story oh it's the worst i sometimes find myself telling like oh this is such an embarrassing confession but i'll like be telling my just do it like telling a girlfriend just like being like you know my my mom was um you know she was she would go into some sometimes she would go into some depression and she would sometimes is a very cold person unexpectedly out of the blue and so i have a really hard time with this because this is anyway i'm saying the reason i'm being an asshole is because in the the part of the universe that has been completely obliterated by time these things happen to me instead of being like oh i'm being an asshole because i am not allowing myself underneath the defense mechanisms and that's a fucking cool thing that pima children who you would love says which is the next time you're feeling like angry or whatever the negative emotional state is strip the narrative away about why you got angry the story away about why you feel bad whatever it was that happened try to remove it and just feel the feeling oh yeah right man because then because that but that's why you get triggered right it's because you've got this emotional mapping your mom's issue she was cold to you and now whenever someone does that they reactivate the old wound so then do you go when i get into this old wound let's really i'm gonna stay in it or just go oh that's the old wound that's i know this i know this but i've been here here's where it gets wild this is where you dive into the buddhist idea which is like in fact not a wound but the experience of being human in fact it's not that you're wounded it's that you're actually experiencing the universe and the you know and life is suffering why is it suffering because of attachment and when they say life is suffering the first noble truth of buddhism they really mean life is suffering and so this is what chogym trumpa who is pima children's teacher says is that we literally or that idea is so repugnant that we are existing in a state of pure unadulterated suffering that has no basis in history but it's just like the way fish are always existing in wetness that that's just what we're in he compares it to standing on razor blades in a room that idea is so awful that we construct fantasies to try to explain while we're feeling the way that we're feeling and those fantasies are the past fantasies the narrative that we're living by i feel awful because i was dumped hurt have cancer my government sucks i came from a communist country i didn't have what i needed i had too much of what i needed so you come up with all these stories to try to explain your poor desperate mind is trying to make sense of the fact that you're boiling in the fiery waters of the material universe and so it because if you can create a reason then there's hope because if you oh they did not yet and someone else can take responsibility for it too because i think that's a conception of westerners we don't like the thought that life is suffering why because at one time shit was great we were in the garden of eden everybody was naked we were chilling out we were fucking and then the snake comes along talks eve into eating the apple right yes wait it now we're being punished but there's this idea in the west that there was once a great place and we've fallen from grace yes and it's the same ethics of sitcoms and this and that like why isn't my life like this and it's always the idea that yeah that there there is a perfect and somehow we're deviant from the perfect and i think that's the flaw this is why everybody's all fucked up and this is why it's never enough no matter how many selfies you take and i love that girl you made that video of uh oh thanks how can i have like 1.9 million followers and feel so alone i it's great she's a professional twerker and she was lamenting the fact that she can't overcome but i love it because it really does sum up the christ experience and we're all jesus being crucified even if you're a twerker and so that the crucifixion represents exactly the first noble truth of buddhism it's supposed to represent humans trapped on the time space continuum past present and future and infinity meeting former crucifix and humans are that matter with sentience trapped to the goddamn thing and it's suffering because you're being crucified and i don't mean it i'm not relishing the suffering right but the moment you realize like if we're standing on a room filled with razor blades uh with bare feet and our feet are constantly getting cut the sooner you just accept the fact that that's what it's going to be like walking around and stop resisting it maybe maybe that's when things can start really changing but before you can like uh before that can happen you just got to accept that that feeling of shittiness that you have been blaming on the traffic the weather the job the mother the father the lover or the kids is always the same feeling it's just different gradients of the same have you ever noticed that of course it's suffering it's that low-grade misery that we're supposed to always have right because we're you know we're we're that dignified westerners supposed to be miserable but you strip away the the the symbol structure to try to explain the fucking thing and now it's just this feeling this aching fucking horrifying feeling now now sit with that just sit with that feeling and forget the reason that it's there sit with the feeling stop resisting it just for a second just for a second and then suddenly that feeling isn't quite as bad like why wait wait this doesn't feel as this actually doesn't feel very bad at all and if it does feel bad it seems to go away and then right what what it seems to come and go i don't know that's as far as i've gotten with the thing but according to buddhist scripture you can actually there is a kind of hope so to speak there is the chance for rebirth there is the chance to get off the floor of razors or to dissolve the ego mechanisms that are causing you to resist truth and that's just drinking a lot of wine right that's what they say eating getting hammered getting hammered his ego dissolving drugs drugs help a lot medicating see oh one thing though okay the feelings thing if you don't feel those feelings by the way that's what leads to compulsory behavior right if we don't just sit with those shitty thoughts and feelings and let it get through you that's when you pick up things like eating yes drugging whoring boozing whatever all those compulsions and they're all we're all hardwired for addiction oh and that's what makes for the bad trips too but that's the bad fucking trips i almost said that's what makes the bad trips baby very much fucking embarrassing sunglasses what came out of me just then uh oh god i should kill myself but the the the bad trips usually are a result of not being in that state of consciousness just a lot like going with it you mean because i've been on acid and had bad trips you know and yeah and it is because like you're in your head about it right and you're not like just kind of going with the flow of of life and stuff yeah and the preceding months or years leading up to the trip you are ignoring the fact that you feel awful all the time and trying to pretend that you didn't feel awful and so then the trip comes and it's like hey i'm not gonna let you ignore that you feel horrible 99% of the time but you're walking around with a big grin on your face like you don't when inside you feel like shit all the time let's do the work you hoarder you fucking hoarder let's do the work stop ignoring the fact you have 7 000 taco bell bags shoved underneath your mattress connect collection and that's what people do i know people meet that's what i did on the road 20 2013 i was eating bowls of macaroni and cheese in my hotel room at two in the morning alone and you're like this feels great and then no but you don't feel good you feel bad you gotta admit that you don't feel good for a second i have 1.8 million followers why am i so alone are you know the thing like where you're like just want somebody to love you but instead of saying to them i really don't want to lose you yes you say to them are you fucking cheating on me right right you know instead of saying to them i want you in my life more than i love you i'm afraid i'm so scared i'm a scared person this never happens to me and i really really want you here because i just think you're wonderful you're like let me look at your twitter dms you know i learned that lesson with my husband it took i've been with him like almost 10 years and to have that ultimate um to to truly be vulnerable with another human being and really be honest and naked about stuff it's it's to soft it softens the relationship it softens your your your bullshit when you're just like look you're right i'm not people are like how do you guys stay faithful how do you hold it together you're both on the road and i go well first of all i have no cause to doubt my husband's fidelity and i don't cheat on my husband either but we're super honest about those feelings of like i'm terrified of losing you i love you so much you are yeah like you're so important oh god it's but it's so scary to be vulnerable with another human it's terrifying but those are the breakthroughs man the moment you do that with someone then all of a sudden it's like the angel starts singing the whole game that was you were playing falls apart and now you're just going to end up crying on each other and like embracing each other and it's sweet and romantic and beautiful but you don't get that until you tell the truth you won't get that until you just drop the stupid game just like god i love you it hurts and it's beautiful and man isn't that the ingredient for the whole for for all of it for the whole thing you just start trying to do that with yourself in the world and then something shifts right away it's just it's it's it's cowardice versus being a hero you know it's such a it's so easy to be a coward and yeah it totally is it's easier to just be like fuck that i don't even shit i'm fucking but go home get drunk watch tv blah blah blah next next day next day next day next day but man it's so cool to just like sink into the this is what chogium trumpet calls the rocky soil of your life the rough rocky soil that's where you start your practice he says the best way to start your practices well not the best way but he says hopelessness is one of the best places to start a spiritual practice where you've given up the idea that you're gonna get out of this goddamn thing by climbing over the wall that surrounds it but you're like i'm just gonna go into the center of hell and yeah it's so crazy because i it's actually literally what happened to me i uh i was on the road a bunch and i uh i was in a city in a hotel room during the day i was daytime drinking alone in my room crocheting i decided to take a crocheting like that that was gonna save this right just crochet through this and i was crying just like why am i uh wait a minute something's wrong here and it was a breakdown and i came home i got real high and i laid in bed and i was like hmm i guess what being a comedian is not all there is there's something yeah wait am i this person and if that if that's all there is like i oh boy i'm i'm sick and tired of being sick and tired and that's when you break and that's when you break open and you're like i gotta do i gotta maybe not do something about this maybe i need to sit in this for a minute yeah maybe i need to not be on the road so much a yes and b i gotta figure out like what is this and that started back in like april and i've been on this vision quest and now i'm here with you man and this is breaking my shit open even more love it that is so badass man i love that that is such a and when you record okay so that thing that happened to you crying in a hotel room crocheting and getting drunk and then coming back and having a breakdown yeah that is a thing that if somebody came to you with a menu of experiences and said how about a lonely breakdown in a hotel room where you're drinking and you're crocheting that's like not going to be the experience you pick on the menu of experiences you're like no i'll skip that i'm going to take a 45 minute orgasm and after that being entertained by a great movie if i could have that please but weirdly those two things are going to give you this temporary fleeting experience which is a blast whatever the sense gratification you're engaging can be quite fun but the fucking breakdowns those are the things that are actually the best things and those are the things where it's like okay you're ready congratulations we've you've moved into the next grade the thing you're running away from is actually the very thing that contains within it everything that you need to really wake up and when you start approaching that those moments from that place instead of resisting them it's weird then that they stop bearing their teeth and growling at you and they're like okay okay and it's also what am i avoiding right now like why am i being avoided of talking to so-and-so or what am i what am i terrified of right now and that's the heart of darkness that you got to go into like straight away what's terrifying and there it is man face it dive in dive in because it's so great on the other side and it's just a trick that some maybe well you know you can even make up a story let's pretend we're on a spaceship let's pretend that this is a spaceship filled with survivors from an alien apocalypse on a planet where the environment went away because people were polluters and so as part of the plan to move to a new planet where we're all going to exist in peace we were placed into hyperspace chambers where projected into our minds were very specific universes that were designed to teach us to be loving and pathetic compassionate connected people so that when we finally get to the destination that we're going to where the thing's going to open up and we're going to be ready to live together in a way that's not going to destroy a planet and so then when you realize oh it's just part of a simulation and these things that are coming to you that seem so severe it's just a hologram it's just coming to you but it's going to keep coming to you and the program's going to keep repeating until you fucking learn to love and that's what they call samsara the endless cycle of birth and death it's just going to keep happening the thing is going to loop and maybe this is a prison maybe we are in a super advanced alien prison whereas part of our imprisonment holographic universes are in projected into our minds that are designed to allow us to overcome whatever the crime habituation was that made us get in here in the first place and until we learn that until we have true rehabilitation we keep repeating again and again and again and again that's called reincarnation that's the idea of reincarnation and do you know if you ever heard the concept for how long you've been here for figuring out how long you've been here no i'd like to know that they say yes imagine a dove flying over the himalayas holding a silk scarf oh in its beak and it flies over every hundred years and the very tip of the scarf brushes the very top of the mountain the amount of time it would take for that to erode the mountain into a valley is the amount of time that you've existed over and over and over again reincarnating in the specific dimension no i want out man oh it's a lot it's a long time it's a long time but it also when you wrote that's that's a thought experiment you use to slow you down so instead of being like i'm gonna wake up in this life and get nice and reincarn or nice and you're like okay i'm not gonna be in a rush anymore i keep doing this thing over and over and over and over again i'm gonna take it easy on myself and in this incarnation i'm just gonna try to you know finish it out by telling eight people how much i love them yes and that's what actually helps about this thought practice uh is that once you realize hey man it's not just this time around relax you don't have to do everything because i put a lot of stress on myself to be a certain way to do everything just relax man you're gonna come back again you're gonna get a few more shots at this thing it doesn't have to be perfect all the time yeah it takes the pressure off the now and it frees you up because then you're like oh oh none of this is real oh wait you mean it it doesn't fucking matter if i say blah blah blah to so and so or if the stakes aren't this high like it takes the stakes off of stuff it releases a pressure valve for me anyways to think of myself as an eternal being and not as a limited uh isn't that fun wow carbon based yeah yes exactly you're like what oh shit and my ego i think having that breakdown what it was is going like i am not wait a minute if i'm not the comedian if if all these things and if money don't define me and if my career goals don't define me well then who am i what am i and who the fuck is saying all of this like you go oh the eye is separate from that something there's something else and it's terrifying to think that you're not the things that you thought you were that's the beginning of the like the the crisis the existential second existential crisis first one i had i was 13 years old i was smoking cigarettes and i was like oh i'm alone in the world yeah i remember realizing aloneness and crying that's an intense moment yeah that's an intense one and then the moment that you're talking about where you realize you're like a a doll that the universe has been holding and playing and gotten so convinced that in the game of make believe that that the universe was the doll that it really believed that you you know you believe it you believe you're this toy that you're not you're a you're a you're a kind of security blanket the universe is using to give itself form and when you start realizing that every single aspect of yourself is just an impermanent fleeting well and also because other people define you in terms of your gender like we were talking about this when i first came to your house that you know i'm a female comedian and that that's always a it's always a thing you know and i didn't know i was limited i didn't know i was this thing called a female comic until other people told me that term's got to get right that we've got it we've got to get that fucking term out of the vernacular it's like black comedian or mexican yeah like do we qualify the other but the point is i i wasn't aware of my limitations until i was told them actually i had thought of myself as an infinite being or whatever the fuck it wasn't until other people went yeah but you got tits yeah but you're blonde and you're cute no one's gonna listen to you and the people said that to me in my 20 yeah you're too pretty to be chmi and your block of butt not that i'm fucking listen i'm not tooting my horn to your horn you know what i'm saying like people make assumptions about you based on the package you come in on that's right and i was like but i'm not that being i know that i am not and i let it i let that take over well yeah that's called getting cursed and oh is that right that's what i call it it's getting cursed it's a good curse to have in terms of uh you know i could be a paraplegic in india you know well no i but i know i'm wow the pretty girl you know or you could be a just because your body isn't you know malfunctioning or you're able to walk around doesn't mean that psychically you're not a paraplegic and when you realize that like when you get it so what you're talking about there is like so here's a what robert anton wilson calls a reality tunnel that you were existing within where you were an infinite being unaware of the fact that there was some limitation based on your gender so there's the universe you're existing in then you get around a wizard who puts a curse on you by saying as a matter of fact your paradigm is limited by your gender and so now they very convincingly will weave a spell of words and tell you why or the sum total of all these awful shitty misogynistic wizards will do whatever spell they're going to do on you and the next thing you know you're cursed and you start living according to their paradigm instead of your paradigm that's the danger that's the danger because you were around a more powerful wizard than you were and you allowed yourself to be cursed by them instead of doing that thing that when you get around an adept a true initiate they don't let your fucking words spell do anything to them no they're just there man they're not going to like suck get sucked into your paradigm or they're going to more than likely what they're going to do is try to expand your paradigm they're going to try to open you up as much as they can because that's the kind of magic some of these people like to do not all wizards like to curse in fact them really good ones like neem kerali baba they don't they they like to do the opposite for some reason the spell that they like to cast is one where they help free people from the oh most definitely and there have been dudes that are like i'm not saying everybody out there is that for sure there are even guys like you and joe and like joey d as my husband enlightened beings that have always helped me transcend that fucking bullshit world you know i but it is out there and it is sick man it is right but everybody has if you're not a white male i shouldn't even say that i feel like everybody comes to this earth with their own bag of bullshit no matter who you are right my bag of bullshit happens to be x y and z your bag of bull everybody comes nobody comes here perfectly well i take that back maybe the johnson and johnson heirs like people now but even those people have their own traps being a multi-millionaire heiress or whatever has its own trappings we all come here with obstacles and trappings it's all a trap at first yeah but the trap is actually the teacher and that's an important thing to realize is that the trap is the thing that's there that that's your that's god in your life that's the angels in your life the very thing that you're looking at is that is the trap the more you focus on it and sit with it the more you realize that it's the key simultaneous to being a trap that's so fucking weird but it does seem to be the way it works and ps any misogynistic asshole antiquated backwood shithead out there who feels okay uh supporting uh ancient stereotypes about women who do comedy please watch christina do stand up and then shut the fuck up for the rest of your life because you are legendarily funny i really mean that i know you do thank you you know i don't

89^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - RON REGE JR. Transcript and Discussion^2014-03-26^You're gonna love this house, Sergeant Riley. Just look at these high ceilings. The upstairs is even better. You can read the Constitution from your window. Upstairs? I don't see any stairs. Just strap on this harness and climb right up. Up this rock climbing wall.

U.S.A.A. means United Surfaces Automobile Association and its affiliates San Antonio, Texas. I'm not aware of the fact that there are Ebola outbreaks happening all over the world at this very moment. Maxim magazine voted Ebola the number one worst way to die in the United States today. It's a terrible death. Your underarms fall open like meaty trap doors. Your lymph nodes collapse out like old rotting beets out of a burlap sack. Your nipples spray volcanic ooze consisting of your lung and heart tissue. They spray all out of you. Everything just explodes out of your body. Your body essentially turns into a blood sprinkler and it happens quick. Once Ebola climbs into one of your greasy, mucusy holes, it's only a matter of hours before you're just geysering blood out of every orifice. Stinky, farty blood, smelly blood and everyone around you will laugh at you as you roll around in hemorrhagic seizures. Liquifying on the floor of your living room. It's an embarrassing, sticky, grotesque death. Essentially, you become a human water balloon that just pops. If you've ever watched The Walking Dead and you see what happens when one of the zombies falls off a building, it's kind of like an old rotting bit of fruit that just oozes out. That's what happens to you. You become a human rot fruit. It's a bad way to die. And listen, one surefire way that you can almost guarantee that you're going to catch Ebola is by going to one of these chain stores out there. These various stores, targets and CVSs and Walgreens and Walmarts. Look, I'm not saying for sure that you're going to get Ebola by going there. In fact, I can't say at all that you're going to get Ebola by going there. But maybe somebody from Rwanda confused the blood pouring out of their vagina with an early period, not knowing it was the beginning phases of hemorrhagic fever and went to a CVS or a Walgreens or a Walmart to buy tampons and left a little chunk of Ebola on the shopping cart. And so then out of anxiety, you start sucking your fingers, not knowing that you have sucked into your body the Ebola virus. Cut to six hours later, you're playing Titanfall on your Xbox. You look down and it looks like chunky beats are squeezing out of your nipple. You only have one nipple now. One big fat pink sausage like nipple right in the middle of your hairy chest. That's what happens when you get Ebola. Your nipples fused together. They form one meaty thick pink thing right in the center of your chest. And then the thing grows a mouth like one of those alien mouths. It opens up. That's the Ebola virus sticking its head out of your fused nipples. And then it vomits out everything inside of you. Happens quick. And it's a sad way to go, people. You don't need to die that way. Go to our Amazon portal located at Amazon at DuncanTrustle.com. In the comments section of this podcast. If you go through that portal the next time you're shopping at Amazon, and I honestly don't know why you would go out into the world. If you're driving in the world, if you're driving your car somewhere, you should be driving to a park or to go have sex or to buy drugs. Not to go to some horrific labyrinth of plastic so that you could inhale doom farts from conditioned zombies who don't understand that we are existing in a world where time is precious and every moment should be spent either having orgasms or serving our fellow man. Go through the portal located at DuncanTrustle.com the next time you shop at Amazon. They have everything you could possibly need. Pins, socks, combs, body groomers. I just bought a body groomer. You could trim down your bush. You don't have to have a big hairy crazy bush, guys. A lot of guys think that it's just the girls are the only ones who are supposed to be trimming their bush. You should trim your bush too. You don't need to have that poof of pubic entanglement rising up out of your, above your sweet genitals. That's bad news, man. Clean that thing up. Order a body groomer and some toothpicks. Whatever you need, it's located at Amazon.com. Go through our portal. Bookmark the portal. It's a great way for you to support this podcast.

On May 17th, I'm going to be doing a live Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, Spectacular from the Hollywood Improv. I invite you to come. We're going to have some amazing guests still in the works. It's going to be big. It's a spectacular. This isn't just a regular show. This is a spectacular. And for God's sakes, God's sake, not God's sakes. I guess it depends on if it's one God or multiple gods. Whichever you believe in, join the forum, won't you? Go to DuncanTrustll.com, join my forum, buy some t-shirts, buy some stickers, posters, and more than anything, love yourself, because God damn it, if you don't love yourself, how are you going to enjoy those orgasms and fried chicken and waffle pancakes you love to eat in the mornings? Today's guest is Ron Regi Jr. Ron is an artist. He's a musician. I've known about him for a long time. He's always been out in the periphery. He's friends of mine, and I love his art. I've admired his art for a very long time. I actually saw him perform once in the band Lavender Diamond. Saw him play live, and that's a great band, Lavender Diamond. Check him out if you've never listened to them before. But recently, I came into contact with this amazing book called The Cartoon Utopia. And I'm so happy that this was sent to me. I'm afraid that I don't remember who sent it to me, and in fact, I'm not really sure how I got it. I don't know if someone gave it to me at a show or if someone sent it to my PO box. If you're out there and you're listening to this, thank you. The book sat around my house for a really long time. I didn't open it. I thought the cover was super cool, but I didn't even know Ron Regi had written it. Then over the past few weeks, I've been opening it up and looking at it, and then it's been dawning on me that this is a work of supreme mystical genius. I put it on the level of be here now. I invite you to buy a copy of this book. After you listen to this podcast or before you listen to this podcast, I cannot emphasize enough just how incredible this text is. It's really great. It's everything that I love. It's a lot of things that I think about, and it's articulated in a form that is graceful and psychedelic and fun to read. After spending some time with this book, I managed to get in touch with Ron Regi, and he agreed to come on the podcast, and I'm very grateful for that. So now, everybody, please open your hearts and send all the metaphysical love energy that you can summon in the direction of the very sweet genius, Ron Regi Jr. Ron Regi, welcome to the Duncan Trestle Family Art Podcast. Thank you so much for coming to be on the show. Thanks for having me. Man, so I want to share how this ended up happening first, because it fits in perfectly with this beautiful genius thing that you've created here, which is this book which I'm going to be obsessed with for the rest of my life called The Cartoon Utopia. Now, what's weird is I don't know how I got this book. This book ended up, I think someone sent it to my PO box when I used to have a PO box. I don't remember. It just was one of these things that was around the house, and I really like the cover of it, and I remember like just every once in a while opening it up and looking at it and thinking, man, that was psychedelic, but I didn't really spend much time with it, you know? And I didn't know you had written this book, which is fascinating for a lot of different reasons. And then one day you open up the front page, and what does it say? I open up the front page and written on the front page. It says that you've signed it, and it says for Duncan by Ron Regi Jr. Now, the fact that it's by you, Ron Regi is really mind-blowing in a lot of ways that we can't even talk about on the podcast just because you're connected distantly to friends of mine, and I didn't know you'd written the book. There's secrets, people. Yeah, there's secrets, but it's so, so suddenly I was like, what the fuck? Then I start reading the book, and then I realize what I have in front of me here is for Western, I guess what you'd call for alchemy, for occultism, for Western esotericism. Is that how you say it? Esotericism? I think so. This is be here now. This is be here now for Western philosophies, and it is just a work of genius, not to freak you out or anything, man, but wow. How long have you been studying these kinds of philosophies? Not long. Like maybe like five or six years or something like that? Over, but pretty much over the last decade. It was very slow for the first five years, and then like, yeah, about five years or so. What started it? What got you into this in the beginning? I went to, I have a friend named Maja Dao. She calls herself the White Witch of LA, and she was giving lectures at the Philosophical Research Society, which is not far from here, where we are right now. And I had known her through zines and comics, and I went to see one of her lectures, and it was on alchemy and relationships, and I don't know, I had been slowly, ever since getting to LA, I had been slowly kind of like, in parsing LA history, I was finding all the weird funny little like religious things and stuff like that, and kind of, you know, came across Manly Pee Hall. It was like I was kind of discovering theosophy and Manly Pee Hall, and all those people, I was reading books about them, and then realizing that there was stuff right here in my own city. But once I started going to Maja's lectures, and she was a friend of mine, and a lot of my friends from the music community, when I walked into the first lecture, were all there. I didn't know what I was going to. I had been to the Gnostic Society. I thought it was going to, you know, I didn't expect to see other people I knew there. Well, a lot of people listening to this don't know about Los Angeles' rich occult history. Can you talk about that a little bit? Because I'm actually pretty foggy on it myself. I know about Manly Pee Hall, but my dates are all confused. Yeah, well, there's just like kind of in the, I think it's everything about this city, the way that everyone was so optimistic that came here and built this city. A lot, you know, like the way, everyone knows about how Hollywood got made, and then the oil companies, and it was all, you know, very like idealistic people who even made this place. There were spiritual people to go along with them. Yes. That were centered here and kind of ended up here. And a lot of people have a lot of theories about it, even in kind of the occult and esoteric circles. The idea of California as this weird, like golden manifest destiny place is like even in with a lot of the stories. So all the stuff that you didn't, we didn't know how it was going to work out. Things like televangelism with Amy Semple McPherson or just like the films and TV, nobody knew. There was a lot of spiritual stuff that nobody knew what was going to happen with it that was here. And that's why we have Scientology. Yes. Here and like all these different things and a lot of Eastern centers here. But like, there's also a lot that we don't remember, like the whole spiritualist movement and how large it was in the United States. That it was like really, really, really big I am movement, which the cover of my book is based on some of these. I am. I am and quotes was an enormous, enormous thing in the United States all over the United States in the 30s. What is it? What is the cover of your book? Can you describe what's on the cover of your book? It's this cartoon image of this kind of like figure in the center that's rising up out of these two lower figures that's got all this light shining out of it. I don't know what people think it is when they initially see it. It looks like astral projection or some kind of Godhead kind of thing. Yeah. But the I am presence movement was very was a kind of I guess it would be a religious movement that delved into the aura and astral projection and all that kind of stuff. A lot of which I think Americans first understood through spiritualism, like before that, but they also were super patriotic way into America. Yeah. It was most likely conservative minded people and it was this is before the health movement. It's before any kind of like positive thinking. So it was like all mixed up together in early times in ways that things have been so polarized now. A lot of it kind of just all got mashed together. Wow. So you're saying sort of like conservative, like Bill O'Reilly types were actually Ronald Reagan got his astrology done every day is chart. It's not a secret. Is that true? Yes. Wow. I remember it's funny when you said like things that are like I remember I kind of remember that. I feel like it was in the pair. I was just a kid in the 80s, but I think he was a Californian. Wow. So that was so it's a part of being in California part of what was happening is we're just inundated in in this this these these new. And if you know anything about Isotera or the occult a lot when you're reading a lot of the things you're like this guy's not a hippie. He's just like don't do this. Don't do that. You got to do this to make the magic work. You know. Yeah. So exactly kind of the opposite of being a hippie. A lot of these people are really a lot of it's not permissive. Yes. Yeah. Well, okay. So this book I read this interview that you did on a and I don't know what it is a blog or a zine called the comics journey or something. The comics journal. Yes. The comics journal. Yes. And man, I got to tell you that interview really pissed me off because in the very beginning of it because I've been reading this book every day. This is the kind of book where you can, you know, open it up to just any page and you'll get an idea out of it that will give you something to think about for a week and or longer because you're incorporating not just your own philosophy into this but you're also mixing in. A lot of other sources. Yeah. So, he was in a room dusted with be here now, but he did it with Buddhism and Eastern wisdom. This is, this is, you've got, you've got stories of Mesmer and Carl Jung and so many luminaries in here that are from the West. It's so good. But this book, this interview that I read, it starts off with this guy, this asshole saying like, Oh, maybe he's gone crazy. And then, and then in the interview with you, he has this like shitty audacity to kind of ask you like, Have you lost your mind that you've created something so beautiful and wonderful. And he's like the only way this dullard can assimilate what you've done is to think like, Well, he's must have gone nuts. That really was infuriating. I couldn't believe it. Like I just, I couldn't fucking believe it. That's really funny. But you said in this interview, it's something that I thought was really interesting, which is that you said, you said that you channeled this. You felt like some of this had been channeled in a certain way. I was talking about my previous book, actually. Oh, you were? You weren't talking about. I think, yeah, that interview probably could have used some editing. It was very long. It was a little bit too long. And there were things that were like kind of like went off in tangents. I felt like in it. I'm pretty sure I was talking about my previous book called Skibrabi by, which is more of like a, it's 300 pages, but it's like a fictional story has fictional characters that go through a story. Right. And that I didn't really quite realize it because I had no, I know, like language or tools to know what channeling would have been when I made that book. Right. Because I wasn't exposed to anything really spiritual in this kind of way at that time, but that book was kind of channeled. Like, I don't feel like I wrote it or anything. It just came through you. Yeah. Yeah, which I think I carry into a lot of my work. So there's probably a lot of stuff like that, but I definitely didn't channel this the way that like Blavatsky or Manly Hall did with their big books. And they said that they channeled their stuff. Their stuff was both both the secret doctrine and Manly Hall's secret teachings of all ages are were written by people in their twenties that it seems like it's almost impossible. They could have amassed all that information and they both say that they pretty much channeled it. Wow. Yeah, that see that that I that word channeling is like such a loaded word. Now it's scary to even talk about it because it brings to mind people with their eyes rolled back in their heads and living rooms and Pasadena. You know, kind of telling people what they want to hear. But the best moments that I've ever had creatively are the ones where I'm not responsible for whatever is coming through me. Probably most artists can relate to that. What do you think that's coming from? Oh, where do I think? I don't know. That's one of the great mysteries of like being a human. I think it's definitely like a very like there's nothing else to say about it besides being spiritual. The idea of like inspiration, you know, or I don't know where it comes from. And it's like an idea that it's kind of like, you know, it seems like it comes from the most back part of your brain that you don't understand. You can't look at it. You can't look at it. So it just pops out of you. And there it is. Yeah. The other thing I like that you said in this interview was the he, of course, did the thing where you're like, how many drugs you take to make this book? You must take a lot of drugs to do that. Yeah. And I love your response, which is like, I've never taken a psychedelic. That is such an inspirational mind blowing thing because I'll be honest, when I was looking at this book, when I look before I read that interview, my brain also went, how many drugs was he on when he did this book? Because it is so psychedelic, man. And for me, that's a, I like when people to sometimes people say, your stuff looks like I had this friend that was on speed. That looks like, and it's funny, like all the little scribblings, it looks like I've had people like say that kind of just like a compliment or like a curious thing. I'm like, that's very strange. But that's just, but that that's just hardcore. I grew up on hardcore. What do you mean by that? You grew up on hardcore. Hardcore, like music, I think, because it was really fast and energetic. I think that went into my drawing as a very young person. So it's punk. So it's punk rock. That's where all the kind of like a lot of the energy comes from. Oh, wow. So are you listening? I'm not like a straight edge guy or anything. But do you listen to when you're when you're drawing this stuff? Are you listening to music at the same time usually? Probably, but it's not like a vital part of doing it. This. So this. Okay. So this book is the reason that I'm asking these things. Where does it come from? Where was it channeled? Are you on drugs? And I think the reason people ask you these things is because it feels otherworldly. When you read this book, when you go through it, you realize you feel like it reminds me of the feeling that I that I get when I read the Frank comics, you know, Woodring. Yeah, that's a great compliment. Where you feel, you know, Tolkien, when you read Tolkien, your mind is trying to like come up with a way to explain how something that doesn't feel quite like it belongs in this dimension, got into this dimension. So that's why we say to you, were you on drugs? Have you gone crazy? Because the real question that we all want to know is what is this? It's kind of a textbook. Yeah. Is it a grimoire? Does it classify as a grimoire? Is that the right word for it? Am I pronouncing grimoire right? You're pronouncing it right, but I don't even know exactly what that is. Like a book of magic. Yeah. I don't think so because I don't have any like instructions for spells or like in like intentional kind of like stuff like that. I think of it as being my intention with making, I was fascinated with a lot of it. It's kind of like a textbook for my friend's Maja's magic classes. She does them once a month and it's called magic class and it's kind of like the cartoon textbook. A good 50% of it is notes from her lectures. Cool. And then basically it was like I was going and like taking notes from her lectures and then just kept reading more and more and more and more things and I was very like probably at a stage in my life where like maybe I could have gone to grad school. I have a BFA. I could have gotten an MA. You know like instead I made this book. I just studied on my own and I did just like go through a lot of years where I was just like super fascinated with like what about this dude and then I'd hear about this thing and like her lectures are very like that. She kind of like pulls very like obvious stuff out of like science in the like history of the occult and stuff like that. And it was like oh what is up with William Blake really? Like I was like I hadn't read those books completely. So now that I've read about this, who is Swedenborg? Right. You know like Blake was a Swedenborg? Who is Swedenborg? Oh wait a minute so Rudolf Steiner did what? You know it was just like one thing after another. And so much of it is like the background of things that are all around us you know. Yes. Yeah right. Like Waldorf schools. I'm like I know what a Waldorf school is. You know it was just. And I think it came in a time and maybe it's my internet thing. It's like a lot of it I was able to like go through sacredtext.com. Like every weird book in the world is on this one website. You know like you can read all this weird stuff. So basically it was just like I had a few years of going through all that stuff. I was very frustrated with the medium of comics. I don't write jokes. I didn't want to make characters or stories. I wasn't feeling like doing any fiction. And I had been doing a lot. Yeah I'm like oh maybe I'm just going to do art shows. And that's what a lot of these started off as is pieces for art shows. Right. And then eventually I was like oh I'm doing comics and then if I'm a cartoonist I couldn't help it. I'm like now I'm writing a story about Mesmer. Right. And I was able to go around for a few years and like pick up on stuff but it is like I've always been interested in like outsider guys. Right. I don't know what it is. Maybe it's just like being like a kid and looking for weird stuff that people didn't know about but like I've always held like you know like Sun Ra's at the top you know it's like and actually you know what happened through the course of doing this book is that you know Sun Ra kind of sounds crazy and you don't know what the fuck he's talking about. I have there's nothing vague about anything that he's saying anymore. I listen to it and I'm like yes because he's read all the books. Right. He's totally and it's actually I have kind of an inspiration for this is friend of mine has there's a book of all of Sun Ra's poetry. Yes. There's books that are split up that are little books of his poetry. There's one edition that's all of it and in the back is a bibliography of it says in and it's like this isn't Sun Ra's book collection. These are the books that were in his house when he died kind of. Wow. And it lists all the books and I'm like if you look in the like that's kind of inspired for like what's in the back of my thing. It's just like I've looked at it all and I was like I've read I know what he's talking about. All this shit. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Well that's it. That's the thing. The way you're describing your book is that if someone's listening maybe they would think that this is just a compilation of different philosophies put together. But there's an over. Yeah. It's like all smushed together and I did find that like in seeing all this stuff like all these guys had this they're all kind of looking for this thing. Well one of the they all seem to be kind and it's all kind of like you know like there is some and then I just found out about Alchemy and like the Philosopher's Stone and I was like oh there it is. That's what. Well this is see this is you have there's a theme that comes through it. It's not just it is a bunch of it is a lot of stories and philosophies and illustrated quotes. But there's an overarching theme that's kind of pouring out of the book which is this idea of shaking. Well this is my this is what my interpretation of it. Shaking off the old paradigm that is making that has the tendency to make us feel very limited and depressed. And plugging into a much much much bigger picture. And in that and you've used you've sort of used all these different examples and you've hung hung them on this frame to hang this bigger thing on. But you clearly have come in contact with some kind of bigger thing. And I in I don't know if it turned out this way but I kind of made a conscious like intention and I felt like there's a lot of like people have resistance to so many aspects of it. I was like I'm not going to make it some black magic thing with the pentagram on the cover because people who don't like it aren't going to look at it. Right. And I think it's because I'm in the world of comics that I've found to be astoundingly just really just kind of like very middle of the road kind of world. That's strange. Yeah. It's very strange. Different time than the 60s. It's not you know you wouldn't think everyone's square now. Huh. People are just square these days. There's a lot of squares and funny hats. Yeah. What's going on? Yeah. But I that and then people are also very hesitant to the other side to the new age side of it. And I could see that there was a stuff that just everybody would like. Right. Or would be into. So I kind of without thinking too much about it and it's only my I didn't want to make a book about chakras or about astrology or about actual stuff. I wanted to make it a little bit more vague to kind of like throw it in there to the science fiction people because when I go to San Diego Comic Con and I see this like display of corporate commercial like fantasy all over people's bodies and I can tell what kind of people they are. They are. I think there's a lot of this information that they would think was really cool. Right. That in that part like kind of baffles me. Well that's kind and you're you feel compelled you you felt compelled you feel compelled to get this information into the world. There is a. Yeah. Yeah. And there's a missionary feeling in a sense or a kind of like a altruistic feeling that you're you're wanting to be part of. You must be crazy then. Right. That's why I thought you're crazy because if you're if you're trying to use your art to help the world you've lost your mind and I want to read this smarmy intro. I've got it right here. It really flipped me up man. It just I didn't expect it. It was it was this is from I'll have the link on my site and you guys can go check this out because this is the kind of shit that is like slowing down the whole fucking process is these goddamn critics the moment somebody has a mystical experience they want to put them in a mental asylum. Can I tell you something about this? You won't be able to put on this podcast. Yeah. Hold on one second. Okay. Here we go. All right. Regie's just published 148 page hardcover survey of dozens of major occult thought streams in words and picture form shows not just a radical transformation dash heightening question mark in Regie style but also a degree of dot dot dot yikes has Ron gone crazy. The trademark Regie cuteness is still there in the human figures but there's no narrative no word balloons instead instead cascading masses of blocked text drawn in 3D profile cross sections of micro and macro cause most action squiggles and diamond zaps chromosomes and galaxies and plant leaves and on and on a spookily obsessive vibrating controller that recalls Egyptian and Mayan hieroglyphics. 70s Jack Kirby it is trippiest Howard Finster's folk Christian exhortations and of course every genius featured in the landmark 1986 lack my show catalog. I just don't like that term crazy when it comes to it's like you know what crazy is crazy is when you find yourself eating your own diarrhea on the street not making beautiful art. You know crazy is like the crazies when you come to and you're looking at your babies floating in the bathtub that you just drowned not when you've that's crazy we've got to stop using the word crazy to describe people who have woken up or are in the process of waking up because what ends up happening and by the way this is as I reread that the guys have obviously quite a good writer and that's an excellent description minus the crazy stuff but the reason that I don't like the use of that term because what happens is people start waking up for whatever reason who knows why maybe they come in contact with some information that you have here maybe they take mushrooms or maybe they have a powerful meditative experience or maybe they fall in love or maybe they have heartbreak and they start waking up and then as they're waking up because nothing in our culture prepares us for how big this universe is when they start getting glimpses of the truth. Their mind starts thinking oh no I must be losing my mind am I going crazy and then things like this only amplify that and then you start feeling guilty for waking up and you're right you begin to resist because you don't want to go crazy so you shut the conduits off and just try to get back to your normal life and so that's why I don't like the term which could be dangerous dangerous why well to yeah to open up and then to kind of like close it all off again yeah you can't can you close it off again that could really make people snap you know do you think you can close it off again once you've once you've opened it up I don't think so now this is in this great book if you ever heard of Chogyam Trumpa mm-hmm he's great he was like he's a this Buddhist teacher kind of an apostate I may have read the name and not known how it's pronounced Trumpa TRUN GPA but and I've talked about this on the podcast before but there's a in the in the introductions to one of his books on meditation he says don't if you can avoid becoming spiritual avoid it like don't go down this path because once you start down the path you can't go back once you start waking up a little bit you're gonna have to keep waking up because you can't you can't go back into the normal world again so I know what you mean then you're crazy then you must be nuts I get it all the time you know people say oh Doug you know Duncan he's loopy he's he's loopy it's like it's such a funny thing that term crazy meanwhile you go out in the world and you see this like you see it from the the the dusty old lens that everyone's looking through the world at what's crazier than that they're putting this like toxic like refined alcohol thing that came out of the ground into their giant metal box that like hundreds of people died to like make cuz they're mad cuz they're late to pick up their t-shirts for their new promotion yeah that's crazy not be not sitting and drawing beautiful beautiful works of art that are there a medium to get across this much bigger message how about put yeah putting the doom hoes in your fucking metal chariot so that you can get to your goddamn job that you decided class on time yes that's that is absolute insanity now I want your butt will look good just your fucking butt looks good so that you'll get a better job totally sane totally normal of course yeah exactly what we're supposed to be on this planet to do that's it yeah getting a hurry so your ass looks good that's why we're here that's why billions of years of evolution happened to solidify as us so you can get to your fucking Pilates class on time you robot I want to read this this is in the very beginning of the book and man what I've been doing is so I'll get like uncomfortably high from eating this new marijuana that I found at this dispensary called chiba chews that are very strong and then I'll get really uncomfortably high and then I'll sit and read your book and it's so fun it's the best man and so I just want to read this beautiful opening to the book it starts with a William Blake quote contracting our infinite sense we behold multitude are expanding we behold as one oh my god it's great and then this is the I'm just gonna read I mean I wish you can't describe the art it's too complex and too intense to describe you guys just have to buy this book this is western be here now and you guys know how much I talk about be here now it's just as powerful as that but but this says kept in balance by equal weights everything in the universe came from one point everything inside and outside of you is made of materials split apart at this initial moment every aspect of every process from the largest of the smallest is attempting to be united again everything strives towards strives toward perfect balance the macrocosm is the microcosm all is one and that sound effect is exactly right but then I did now I just want to play this I'm I'm gonna stop for a second I'm gonna play this I don't know did you hear if you know about the how they've just proven inflation theory that everything big bang yeah mm-hmm did you see that awesome thing where the scientist is they tell him for the first time yeah it's so cool do you mind if I play it really fast so people can hear okay hold on okay so for those of you who haven't heard this this is the from YouTube Stan Stanford professor Andre Linday celebrates physics breakthrough this is like we hilarious this is like what would happen if we were in a dimension where everyone was a super genius this is what candid camera would be like but this is pretty cool can you hear it mm-hmm Stanford University today I'm gonna deliver a news to professor Andre Linday who is the founding father of inflation so inflation is the theory about the bang of big bang it explains why we have all this stuff in the universe so today I'm gonna tell him our experiment bicep to base itself Paul has found the smoking gun evidence of inflation he has no idea that I'm coming so I have a surprise for you wow it's five sigma a point two discovery yes what just a second can you repeat it five sigma as clear as day are a point two what if you can you like the game are point two plus minus point all right we don't expect anybody you're not tells it's probably some kind of delivery did you order anything yeah I ordered finally it arrived we are talking right now about the billions of the billions of the billions of the millions of a second after the big bang so we see the face of the big bang it is an image of these gravitational waves which are purely quantum gravity feature of what was produced in the big bang so this is a remaining part of the story I would love to be that smart even this is true of such a what a beautiful thing because here we have you know science catching on to this stuff which is been described in secret in mystery schools for such a long time but it's really cool to see that's the stuff that's so interesting that it's funny for people like put up their guard against it in like a materialist sense right that like you know I'm pretty before I kind of like a pretty skeptical person in general or like whatever and I take stuff from everywhere and sometimes science is stupid and sometimes religion is stupid you know it's yeah nobody's got like a like a hold on it all but then yeah there's really basic stuff that it's like all of this these ancient ideas it's like why do people know that inherently right like why is nobody like surprised that they found out the big bang because like it seems like people kind of know it right and like we're proving it now but why did everyone think that always is heavy stuff it is heavy stuff and it's and when you have the gift of picking it it can be so complicated I mean just listening to that five Sigma Pi in the fifth degree radiant really wow let's open champagne but so you know that that works for a certain type of person but when you have the talent to pick out the most simple parts of these giant ideas and throw it out there that's what I'm saying man that's what you've done here it's like you have the yoga sutras of Patanjali for example if you ever looked at those they're so simple simple simple little verses that you can then break apart is and make it as complex as you want it's a fractal you can go deep and deep and deep and this just this idea you know I've had this idea before on LSD I had this I this very similar idea that that you know what would happen if nothingness woke up and has somehow was aware of itself what a terrifying moment that would be that that would just be the most terrifying thing that could ever happen as you don't have any you're nothingness that says that point of consciousness and then that would be a really horrifying moment is the way I thought of it and then that would cause you to shatter into a zillion pieces and then we're all little fragments of that universal terror dealing with the little bits of the terror on our own level and if each of us can handle fix that that little piece of the universe inside of us then maybe we could suck back together again minus the terror and be in some kind of orgasmic eternal paradise state but this that's what all that's what you're talking about that you experienced on a psychedelic is like that's what all esoteric literature is about because that I was just reading in a book last night like what you're talking about you know it's like it's like there's all these like you feel that and then there is it's been written about right and that's why I throughout history but this is why I love this book because you've grabbed all these different thoughts that I've had and you've not you've put them down and then you've illustrated them in this brilliant way particularly this this this is just on page 13 but this this idea that everything every aspect of every process from the largest to the smallest is attempting to be united again that is you know I'll sit on the on the couch with my girlfriend and my dog will jump up onto the couch while we're sitting together and then lay on both of our laps and that's there's clearly a gravity of like of congealing of like things coming together again you know and then and then that's God or that's love or that's to me that's high I can't think of anything more high-tech than that there's you know what I mean it's just that when you're when that's happening and everything's amazing and there's just this little bubble of utopia for a moment you've got this bubble to me that's that's better than a time machine that's better than a spaceship that's just this amazing moment and then the other side of that is the times when I'm separated from everything or pushing things away or trying to like extract myself from situations right yeah then you've become part of the explosion that's going out so I just love the idea that you get to decide am I going to be part of the congealing blob love force or I'm going to be the part of the thing that's shattering off into time right so which part are you right now Ron Regi I don't know anymore you don't huh both I don't know all of those things right well you know sometimes one times the other I mean because we're things definitely going waves back and forth you know because both are important you know this that's the whole duality the whole like togetherness and separateness is pretty confusing you know yeah both are important and you have to like keep them in balance you know you can't just be one blob of love all day I guess you can but I don't know it's just you're worth thwarted again and again and again it's like the whole thing is it's like this balance that you're talking about it does this both are valid the separation the breaking apart the shattering and the coming together are both equally valid and that's the big confusion that's I think where you get into this like what's his name Zizak or what's that guy's name you know I'm talking about he's got he's that like yeah is there yeah I haven't like looked into it he's he got in a battle who's he against is he the guy that isn't a battle there's somebody else that it's like them verse each other with their ideas he's he's got this terrible like speech impediment but he's a genius and so he's just like this and I this thing that we are is like I can't do his voice but his whole point is like this is a fucking mistake this thing that we are is a malfunction because what's fused together here are these two impossibilities like we're having these two problems that have come together which is something this and nothing this if somehow accidentally met the fucking ghostbusters they crossed the wires and the end result is that we're stuck in this constant state of being either ripped apart and then trying to draw ourselves back together so what's the solution Ron I don't think I have any answers it's funny for me to make this because I'm definitely the guy I'm like I'm not the most studious person I'd like to read a lot of stuff but I can't like parrot you back things and give you the dates and everything I'm like a little like shaky on that side and I'm like not sure of anything myself you know so like I'm like very like almost like very like amateur approach to like everything but I was just able to like put it all in this anyways see this is what all of you guys always do oh really because the people like me when somebody asked me what the answer is yeah oh I'll tell you and the people and I don't know I have no right to do that but the people like you and the people from the Ramdas camp whenever you ask them questions they're always like sorry they're like sorry I don't really know I don't know don't know the answer yet here we have this incredible this incredible book that's so filled I mean you have really just poured yourself into studying this stuff it's incredible and yet you're still just like all of us kind of still kind of just like at an introductory level because I'm being a very modern day gentlest you know I wasn't like anthroposophy is for me I'm like I didn't have that happen which I didn't want to happen really and I've never really been that into like subscribing to one thing because that's probably where you're gonna find answers is by going into one why don't you want to subscribe to one thing this is too many different ideas if there's anything that like I do I mean it seems like all the alchemical ideas like actual alchemy seems to be a really good basis of stuff that I can go along with and I'm like can you describe how to like alchemy is something that I certainly didn't understand it was one of the fun it was probably the funnest part about doing this and kind of almost like was the funny thing to even like get me going into a lot of this stuff was just realizing what it was because Maja was giving lectures on alchemy and I was like alchemy because anyone's like what is that it's some ancient thing that's turning lead into gold it's before science they didn't know quite what they were doing and they thought you could do that but they were wrong so forget it when it's that's very like an oversimplification it it there are parts of physical alchemy that did form the basic basic like the basis for the physical sciences and of course the physical sciences grew out of alchemical ideas even if a lot of it wasn't right they like thought that things combined in certain reasons and that built it but that was a very tiny aspect of what it what it is which is mostly a system of dealing with the psychological like problem of being a human is it's psychology really Carl Jung spent the later half of his life something like 30 years studying it and writing about it but that's when he was old and crazy he lost his mind so no one cares true yeah you know like the Mysterium conjuncto is like what the like when you look at the like the collected young it's like the first one's like this and it's all the stuff you know about yeah the second one is like this big and it's the Mysterium conjuncto and it's all about he sees that these archetypal the whole idea of the they're being archetypal ideas that all humanity holds that are in our dreams and form the basis of these like characters and everything that go through all the legends like that's the part of Jungian idea he's saying that it's in that's in alchemy and the symbology of it is what alchemy is and it's was done by and it's it was done by people in secret because it always had to be something when it's always been dangerous to delve into that stuff and they had to keep it secret because it was separate from the church and it was separate from the state all throughout the history of Western culture so they had to speak in rhymes and verses and they had the right books and trade them with each other secretly so that nobody even know what it was and but they also had to like sometimes they had to wave their magic wand and like do some tricks for the king give them money the history of it is very if you read about what they actually had to go through like this is and this holds in the whole tradition of witchcraft and magicians and any story that you've seen in the pointed hat and like whatever yeah like leads into a lot of this stuff is that it sounds like being an artist in the modern age because like the role of what an artist was throughout history is like a lot of times you were a craftsman or you were a religious person and like the idea that we have now this independent idea is very much seems like the idea of like an alchemist and it's so funny that it's like the word is thrown around so casually and a lot of it comes from Maja's lectures she would always she one thing that she points out is she'll take a word be like you know this word that you know that you throw around casually like hermetically sealed yes every last little thing like that is just open up the book just Wikipedia it and read it and be like really right what it means and it does change everything that you think about certain like because hermetically sealed the word hermetic is these they're talking about what me or me is trying to mess to I can never say the name yeah it took me a long time it's trying to mess to Jerry is or something I missed it justice Hermes try missed it can you talk about who that is because I think this is a great place to go with this conversation because hermetically sealed we nobody knows exactly who he is he's a very mysterious yes person that probably didn't exist but it's kind of an amalgamation of three or four maybe people who did exist because it's Hermes being because it's also a you know like a Greek God yes it all kind of ties together but I guess if I turn to the page it has it here we go here we go while you're flipping through that man I've got to tell you I woke up last night because I've been you know very excited about talking to you talking with you I woke up last night and I thought oh you should tell Ron that you should make a deck of tarot cards using using this you could just already use the art that's in here you could just pick panels out and it's on the list like it's like eventually there should be around you tarot yes I can do that 20 years or like whatever I'm not sure exactly I haven't delved to the tarot is a pretty serious thing and I haven't I wouldn't want to do it lightly it's but it's kind of funny I've been doing a lot of the jaw it's been like commercial illustration jobs and a bunch of different things that I've been in commissions that I've been doing yeah they all kind of I've been joking that I'm making my own tarot because they look I've been doing these things that look kind of archetypal I'm like well if there was this and that I don't know what this that's the goddess of that's the king of such and such yeah yeah well like I did in New York Times illustration it's about their want to put a ladder at the lat the very end of Mount Everest it's like the last 10 feet oh they want to put a metal ladder so it's like I had to draw a guy in a ladder looking up and the other guys are going like the long way around that's a tarot card I don't know what that is yeah right that's look it's a car for these climbing that's great which is funny because I don't know I'm like and I've asked as I've drawn them I've asked people who know I'm like is that someone and they're like no I'm like but doesn't it doesn't look like the maybe you're not supposed to know maybe that's not your job you're supposed to make the thing and not know the thing probably I mean sometimes do you think maybe that's just it like sometimes you just don't get to be the person who knows what you're talking about but you that's other people's job yeah kind of yeah that's how I do feel about that's why I chose cartooning as a medium because you don't it's the most I kind of already had these like kind of intricate ideas about cartooning before I got into any kind of esoteric ideas cartooning is the most direct form of speaking directly to one from one human being to another because when you read you're going through these weird system of characters yes so and you're not seeing with cartoony you're seeing the person's hand so the person is directly what I drew on a piece of paper yeah goes into their eyes with you it's very private right you don't need to know if I'm alive or dead who I am what sex I am right anything about me and I don't have to tell you because you're just looking at the thing right which I kind of like and it's got so much words and you know if you look at a painting it's a little bit more mysterious but with this there's a lot that I get to say to you yeah and you don't get to say back which is I wished what I wished the internet was like this two-way conversation thing with comments I'm finally getting over up until recently if there was like I'm like if you couldn't turn the comments off I wasn't using it so don't I want to say some stuff and not talk about it I just don't get I love thinking about it like I like to think about the mind state you've got to be in to like send somebody a shitty tweet that you don't know like you're so infuriated by something that you've consumed that you like you feel like you got to send a dart down the digital tube into that person quite often like they they try to quite often these comments they're they're not like a you know and I know this isn't news to anybody but they're not like a really logical critique they're trying to pick out the they try to find the worst thing they can say to you the very worst thing it's almost like they hope that you'll read their comment and slice your they want to murder you almost with their comments like they want to it's very it's very bad and it's very interesting I feel like I've from living here and people that I know it's very it's really funny that people understand that they're talking about real people and like we all might as well all create cartoon characters of each other because even these celebrities that you hate are like real people that like live around here that like go to the they have to go to the gap or whatever like even if they have somebody go to the gap for them like they're probably reading what you're writing you got to be careful man and it doesn't matter like who they are they're all like real people it's very weird so we might as well just make up fictional versions of ourselves we kind of have to well haven't we done that run haven't we done that anyway like isn't that the idea like we are all just fictional versions of nothing oh you found it about yeah it's so I reproduced this thing called the emerald tablet of Hermes Trismegistus the emerald tablet is like the holy grail the 10 commandments of hermetic ideas and it's a very short it's interesting there's a lot of different translations of it yeah that like some of them say god bigger and like you know like kind of accentuate different things through the ages but uh yeah I will you read it okay I'll do it thank you true true without a doubt the below is as the above and the above is as the below to perfect the under to perfect the the wonders of the one as all things come from the one from the meditation of the one so all things are born from this one by adaptation its father is the sun and its mother the moon the wind carries it in its belly and it and its nurse is the earth it is the father of all of the wonders of the whole world its power is perfect when it is transformed into earth separate the earth from the fire and the subtle from the gross cautiously and judiciously it ascends from the earth to the heaven and back to the earth so that it receives the power of the upper and the lower this you will possess the brightness of the whole world oh no excuse me thus you will possess the brightness of the whole world in darkness will flee you this is the force of all forces for it overcomes all that is subtle and penetrate solid things thus the world was created from this wonderful adaptations are affected and the means are given here hermes trismegistus is my name because I possess three parts of the wisdom of the whole world it's like a wow it's like a rap boast 2000 bc look you got to throw that in after that beautiful incredible thing you got to be like by the way this is hermes trimester yeah check check check check out my cd bitch yeah right it's beautiful it's it's almost like uh it makes me think of um uh the doubt hing almost it's it's it's so it's exactly it is so deep you know you could take you could pluck any line from that and spend a lifetime thinking about it it is a little bit funny that a lot so much more there's so much eastern stuff that in our american culture is well known where it's like there's so much stuff on like the western side which honestly has a lot of like comedy in it and like fun i love reading the flowery like writing yeah a lot of people in like the 17 1800s writing stuff and they're like yeah right i love reading it it's i what i i'll tell you what i really love about it i love that it's right there in front of you just like you said you can go to the internet you can go there's all these texts are there right there in front of you but nobody knows about it it's it's like it granted it's hard if you have no idea to unravel that can you unravel from crazy new age things or weirdness can you unravel what you still have to like dig through the don't heap to find it yes you do there is work involved but this is the thing it's like i mean i think that you know it when you see it like anything else you know well i don't remember what page it was on but you were talking about reading these old texts you were saying is there use in reading these old texts and you said and you said that you have to try to connect to the energy behind it right mm-hmm yeah so so you're you're sort of like when you go at these things don't approach it as though you're gonna from a text from the 17th century you're going to it's gonna like be like you're reading something that nasa put out yeah but if you can connect to the thing that inspired the person to write that stuff and usually if you're interested in doing that you're gonna recognize things anyways you know yes right and that that is an interesting aspect of this stuff isn't it seems like it buddhism hinduism most of this stuff it's out there and it's not secret it doesn't have the tendency to be kept secret it's not hidden right but what's cool about this stuff is for some reason it likes to hide it's almost like eastern forgive me for saying this because i love eastern traditions and everyone who listens knows but it's like this is so bad you know that awful book men are from mars women are from venus it's almost like eastern traditions are it are a dog and western traditions are a cat i never thought of it that way you know like it's one one is just like right there for you uh-huh but the other one it's going through that's a very interesting analogy never it hides it's tricky it likes it makes you work for it in a certain way and that's the other thing i like about your book is because i've always been attracted to the trickster idea like concept two and that's you know oh that's a cool like angle yeah why why is it like that why is it so slippery uh i think probably because of that it's like an artist artistic tendency right to be tricky to be to be tricky uh to be like to make people wonder to kind of like get people's imagination going is kind of like what the like whole idea of magic is you know it's like to trick someone into seeing something you know um i don't know a lot of what in in a literal sense it's had to be slippery because of the way that the patriarchal christian society has uh dealt with all of us for the last couple thousand years you know pretty you know like they it's it's had to hide a lot of thing a lot of ideas had to be hidden for a very long time you know as it's like still hidden still and are still hidden yeah it's very it's been very it's a that's really why in a literal sense there's more uh kind of fun esoteric reasons why stuff would be mysterious or hidden uh and kind of hard to understand because it's not for everyone uh you need to do work to pull it out you know like that kind of stuff that is yeah in the in the western sense there's a lot of that there's you know in there um so like you're not going to know exactly into you know but a lot of it yeah is literally just because it had to stay like it was dangerous because it is it's a lot of this stuff that we're talking about kind of abstractly is dangerous to the status quo of consciousness right and that's what is that's what i think like i don't know if it's the more time goes by it feels like we're kind of slowly continuously like heading towards something like that to me personally it seems like it's just like every six months it's things are getting more crazy in the culture yes they're heading towards that uh heading towards what towards uh uh people realizing that are a shift in consciousness uh really this conscious yeah like yeah and it seems like it's going to be hard to keep people from it i've only been thinking about recently but i wonder if it's going to be with younger people that the more of this technology stuff that they've already had uh from when they were born being around and dealing with and then looking at us or the society of their grandparents or great grandparents and like how they're going to decide to live i think might really shift exponentially yeah i i mean i i definitely get that feeling and i definitely maybe i'm wrong and maybe it'll be for the worse or the for the better or like strut but i think a lot of it might be like consciousness based you know as aspects of society or shifting well you know to pull it out of like all of society's shifting and bring it back to the self sometimes i wonder it's like and you read you know some of this stuff it reminds me of things i've forgotten and then for a second as i'm remembering how beautiful the world is and how incredible the world is suddenly everything brightens up and you look around and you know i even said in this interview the colors seem brighter to you you you get this feeling like all of a sudden everything is you're like whoa wait wait oh i forgot this is paradise oh wait is this heaven are we in heaven is this some kind of like paradise that i'm too dumb to see it's heaven hidden from people by their lack of awareness is that what keeps you from realizing you're in heaven is the more your consciousness shuts down the more you seem to feel like you're in hell and the more you wake up the more suddenly you're like oh wow and not just like colors are brighter but all of a sudden that's when the synchronicities begin to come is this paradise here or is this the the bad point that we've got to like work to get towards paradise you know right and is it if it's paradise here does that mean that and a lot of use of terror tradition really says that it's it is some other place that this is like a medium that this like physical thing is something to like move beyond that's something that i'm not always like i'm not really too sure to move beyond how by death by yeah by death beyond death evolution reincarnation like moving to a bit becoming a having a better like improving your soul in this lifetime that's like gergiev growing your own soul or whatever yeah and and there's a lot a lot of that is like that like oh yeah this physical thing is like oh the astral thing we're we don't have bodies is better that i'm see i don't like that i don't that bugs me i think that that's that's doing that thing where you're you're getting your that's in there so like anything else it's like you gotta like kind of like make your way through that depending on how you feel about like i want this to be heaven i don't want to why can't this be it why does there always have to be some fucking destination exactly but i see that as kind of like the western the whole patriarchal like mindset that we this society that we live in is very like based on that the only way that we've we've arranged this way for like these us weird monkeys to get along and it's so hard for like us to do that that we've had to like construct this thing carrots but hanging carrots in front of everybody and it's very yeah at all no one even likes carrots and i'm not sure if you can like let even if you can like have like if you let a little bit of it go if it's all gonna go let it all go well that's the thing you know you read about these stories that come out a collapse of civilization the end of this the end of that and it's like well no it's not it's just a collapse of civilization would maybe that could actually you know if someone gets an enlightened if someone got enlightened for example someone wakes up for somehow you suddenly do come out of the dream and you realize like okay great my career isn't me and my personality wasn't me and i just assembled this whole thing i'm the universe having this incredibly pleasurable experience being a human being and then you just you're suddenly free well if you looked at your ego as society yeah it's a collapse of society you know in the same way isn't society just the ego of the population and the collapse of society could also be the enlightenment of society simultaneously it's true it could be i think so meanwhile some fucking kids cradling his mother's smoldering head in syria and like yeah this is enlightenment asshole this is just bloody brutal collapse so what do we tune into i mean you'd have to decide this is where i always get caught is like do is it just ego maniacal narcissism to pretend that if you can wake up if you can open yourself up if you can raise your consciousness then the world around you will transform in the most beautiful way and you might come out of a terrible dream to realize that you are an awakened being and living in heaven or is it the other it's better than like why not do that it's kind of the point of my book is like why why not try why not try that a little why not consider it like kind of like not you didn't even have to be like a big giant thing just like a little bit of it is good and is obviously seems to be positive yeah just a little thing just a just a little bit of that you know because it's such because like what's the the way that things are is so oppressive that you know like how could it not a little bit of that not help you know or like and just so i mean people are not coping humans are not coping with this system right all right never mind yeah what you're talking about like the real poverty and violence in war in the world and the environment and everything else it's just like we're not it's not working right like we're not and we're not dealing with it well at all and yeah any little bit of kind of like positive awakening or being able to even just function and deal with it one way that i'm able to that i've been functioning lately is that understanding that like how many things aren't real that like we think of as real and in kind of in the in the idea of just being like oh you think i this kind of like separation idea of like being like oh that person believes in astrology and like because of where the moon was yesterday that conversation went well that they had with their sister you know like i don't believe in that stupid i'm just going along like you know it's like thinking that that's a ridiculous idea and applying it to a lot of things from like something like money oh yeah which is the whole reason that like you know like i can have this microphone in front of me like it's all like it's the most same it's like it's a astoundingly abstract idea yeah as it are laws or because like rules of any sort yeah yeah well especially based if you're living in the now especially based on in the now rules are like laws about anything it's just like that guy is going to stab you there is a law and it was right it's a good thing we argue about it how he's going to go to privy it's like he's still going to stab you right now and like and there's like this guy maybe he's going to stop him from doing it maybe if when he was a kid if there had been right yeah you could have you could have the goddamn supreme court say that that guy should not stab you and he was still gonna get a lot it's just a lot of human mind like stuff going into all these fictions so like so i've kind of like been able to cope by equal as in them all as like all equally like i could like take part of or take seriously or like kind of you know take reliever that people have different combinations to like get through right you need to i mean this is this is the thing here we go again with the crazy thing because the moment you start that's crazy that he's crazy doesn't believe in laws you know or yeah the whole thing with the president comes from hardcore you you you're you're talking about this sort of i heard about anarchy before anything yeah right well it is an it is anarchist that was like the first thing i heard about as like a kid who was just looking for rebellious things right i don't know other people heard about kiss or something first like i heard about anarchy can you can you do me a favor for somebody like who has spent a a little bit of penning drawing anarchy symbols on notebooks i don't know what it means can you describe what it means with anarchy yeah uh well i think it means a lot of different things to different people um to you as not to me it's just like the like the it's a very basic just like rock and roll like the rebel idea rightarian like right fuck you it has a basis in the it's political basis in there not being any authority whatsoever you know and not living with any rules or whatever which you know i don't know does that go into like black magic realm or like whatever but i think but there's like actually i was in um sweden capital sweden where was i uh anyways i was in sweden on mayday and they have all the different groups that march by the palace yeah in my the people i was with they were like which groups you want to be with the social democrats or the anarchists or the black blood or the difference so i went with like the anarcho syndicalists who had the they were they had the black flag and they were the anarchists and hung out with them and like was drinking with them all day and i was like yeah i'm an anarchist too and stuff into the middle of the day when i was i realized i was like there's only one difference between me and you and they were like what is it i was like you guys believe in work i'm an anarchist you're an anarchist because it was a very you know like that i was in their public drinking hall of their like place where they had you know like they all grew their own vegetables and they were very like you know but they had their system and i was like no i think um i if i was getting along those lines my anarchistic things would be the destruction of all the systems and no systems yeah and it's i mean it was in there was yeah it was not they didn't they didn't like that the problem with using the term the destruction of all the systems that's where it scares people when the truth is the systems have been destroyed because the systems never really existed we're talking about the idea of there being no time just this one moment and there's these little like what humans have decided to play these various games of make believe that they call governments or whatever and and we really take it seriously i mean when you want to i love the way that that thing that you show the way that science is like breaking that down too yeah to science to just be like oh shit there's no time or like whatever it is that they're that little pinpoint that they're talking about that little point you think there was a fucking senate in there or there was there was the potential for the senate and congress and everything was in there and then the question is is is it wouldn't it's you know whatever this inflation that they're talking about is if you zoom far enough back from the inflation guess what it's still a little fucking point that's the thing and that's where you get back to the beginning of your incredible book which is that here we are dealing with this balance between maximum inflation and maximum unification and here we are caught in between have you ever heard that idea that the crucifix represents the past present and future crossing with infinity yes where does that come from uh oh i don't know where it comes from but it's in yeah like all basic belief systems is that yeah like the four wins and the four elements and the the crossing of it it's yeah it is very basic um it's the yeah and the universe coming out of the point in the middle yeah i know in uh it's in hinduism i've said i've been looking in the kind of like different uses of the swastika in hinduism that cross point and that what the what the other lines on the swastika represent are the motion in the spinning of the universe well and the universe coming out of that point i think it's isn't it and that's i believe like in where it's used in hindu uh representation is that's what that's supposed it's the motion it's the motion and that's kind of like what yeah and that's what like the symbol it's the spinning of mixing yin and yang like everything together why is it that the shittiest people snatch the best symbols but that one's you know it's very the spinning of the swastika is like that's what we're all here to like do wow yeah wow this um you know what man this is frustrating we we've oh it didn't even we barely scratch the surface ron it's i'll have to come back you gotta come back because this stuff is like i'm really really interested in it and um did you want to ask me more specific questions about the book or something yeah absolutely well yeah you know i if you have like little specific ones i could always like answer them quickly if you want to like i just want to i you know rather than um uh ask a question i was wondering if you could just read these two pages because i just thought it was so beautiful from the from the red book yeah okay cool awesome all right and then if you'll come but if you'll just please come back because we could talk about it more okay cool here this is uh what it is is it's from the red book of Carl Jung which came out a couple years ago do you know have you seen the i don't know what it is it's um it's a book that he did in secrets that's very very large it's a it's it's a lot like this book it's a giant uh illustrated book of his paintings which when you see them you're like oh he didn't have to do all that others if he had just made these paintings he would be remembered forever as a great artist besides the fact that he's Carl Jung also right but it's all these paintings and uh there's all this writing in its um i believe it was his analysis of his own dreams when he was younger when he was putting together his dream like the things his ideas for psychology kind of did it on himself first and the red book was like his diary and wow it's been like a hundred years or whatever like his family just recently had it released and didn't even know about it um close to here just a few blocks from here in At Water Village there's a the Ecclesia Gnostica which is a Gnostic church I've been there yeah the light there's not very many Gnostic churches in the United States at all and there's a gentleman there named Stephen Heller who's a Gnostic priest and an expert on Jung and Alchemy from the Gnostic perspective cool and he was doing lectures they do like he does a lecture there every Friday night um for years many years uh he did a series of lectures about the red book so what I did is I haven't read the red book and like dissected it but he just told this really brief story from the red book with which I just took notes of and so this is a comic made from my notes of Stephen Heller's interpretation of what's in the red book which is what most of the stuff in this book I didn't it's my translations of all of these ideas I didn't make up really if you guys could hear my brain you would have just heard Ron Regi pop into the category where I called coolest guy ever so uh how do I read this without the I guess it's good with just the word it's good with just the words only that which you call banal contains the wisdom that you wish to discover alone in the castle wearing green you are drawn upwards from the top of the tower you look into the distance and you think to yourself do I see something there in the woods the red one appears and comes closer you see a figure in the woods wearing red and it comes up to you he comes up to you and says hello you have called me here and you say who are you the devil and he says no although many people think that I am you say who are you then and as you say that his coloring mellows and your green outfit blooms into flowers and then he says I am joy and your answer is but I can't experience joy for then I cannot be serious and I must concentrate to do my work so when I heard that my little cartoonist brain said I'm going to make a comic of that which is how we we cartoonists are uh or at least the kind of cartoonists that I am we're very much just like uh journalists or blog writers or something like that we're out there like we're making our little things and we make comics out of them I don't think you'll ever be able to define yourself Ron but but that this book cartoon utopia that little piece right there that uh suddenly it's back now I'm back oh yeah stop fighting off joy what do you what do you think you have to be serious stop stop this endless battle against joy and your book is page after page after page of different ways of saying just stop fighting joy and and and that's what's why it's such a wonderful thing to have around because if you're feeling bummed out you can just open it up to just about any page and whoosh your it reminds you so thank you so much for this book thank you and thank you so much for uh coming on my show and how can people find you Ron uh on Facebook or I have a tumbler uh Ron Regi Jr and you tweet too and I I suppose I do I don't tweet directly other things that I'm using like tweet for me I think well you're an automated tweeter I'm an automated tweeter so you're what's your time I'm on Instagram I'm on all of them I'm on almost all of them just under my name so I will have links to all all of them at my website and um uh definitely a link to pick up a copy of the cartoon utopia which you guys have to do this should be around your kids um and around

90^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 536: Monk Yun Rou Transcript and Discussion^2022-11-09^Progressive presents an ad from mom. What does it say here? Bundle your home and auto insurance with progressive and get protection around the clock. You know what? I'm sorry. I think it should be around. What are you signaling? Me to stop talking? Oh, all right. I'll stop talking. No, just kind of tell me. That's all you get around the clock protection when you bundle and save with progressive. It's easier than getting your mom to make this radio ad. Progressive casualty insurance company affiliates and other insurers is not available in all states or situations. Hi pals, it's me, DeTrucel. And this is the Ducal Trustle family hour podcast. If you're listening to this on the week of November 7th, then you, like me, are probably crawling with all kinds of weird government propaganda from the left or the right or the center. God knows where it fills us up, crawls inside of us this morning when I woke up and did my nipple yoga, which I highly recommend that you consider doing. It's a fantastic way to wake up. It's a fantastic way to realign yourself with your body, and it will show you why nipples are on everything. You see, nipples are kind of like the wake up button on the human body. They're more than just something that babies suckle on to get their sweet mother's milk. No, no, no. Nipples are kind of the way to tell your body that you're awake. They're a way to invite your body into the day. And there's a special method. It's similar to yoga breathing, also known as pranayama. But in this case, it's nipple yama. It's a rotating circular motion from the right nipple to the left with a yank on the right, yank on the left, yank on the right, yank on the left, squeeze, right, squeeze, left, push up, up, down, down, squeeze, squeeze, left, left, right, right, squeeze, squeeze, right, left, left, right, left, squeeze both nipples simultaneously. And you're going to get a gush. What's going to come out generally is all the stuff that you dreamed. If you had nightmares, then the color of the fluid is going to be a kind of grayish, slimy, dark color. If you had great dreams, then you're going to get more of a pink flow, not bloody, more like the color of a rose. And, you know, there's colors in between. There's actually people who in other countries will examine the nipple flow, the fluid, the nectar, and let you know what's going on with you karmically. But unfortunately, we live in the West and though we have this incredible technology around us, it's really difficult to find someone to read your nipple fluid. But I digress. What's happening to every single person living in the United States and maybe other countries is that we are getting inundated with high level hardcore propaganda just blasted in the face with some of the most intense, insane, psyops level bullshit that maybe has ever existed on the planet in the old days. If you wanted to condition people, if you wanted to send out propaganda, it had to be on the printed page. It wasn't all colorful with alerts and zings and bangs and zips. And though I do love zips and bangs and tweets and alarm sirens and bright colors and charismatic, angry people. At some point, it's important to check in with yourself and ask yourself, is it normal for me to be tight as a wild gorilla's asshole that just spotted a leopard hanging in a tree above it? Probably not. So I hope that you're finding a way to not disconnect because God knows the last thing you want to do is disconnect from politics. I mean, my God, it's truly the most important thing in the world. I mean, especially this election. We've never heard this before in any other election in any other midterm. Never have we heard that this is the most important one. No, truly this, this one of all of them of every single one. Oh, yeah. And I know what you're thinking, but it seems like in every single one of these elections, they act like it's the most important election of all time. And every single time I fall for it and then I get really like wound up and I vote and things seem to basically stay kind of the same. Not this one. This one matters, friends. This one matters because democracy is on the ballot, my friends. Democracy is on the ballot. This is a chance once in a lifetime, maybe to vote no to democracy. Do you really want to be part of a democracy? You really want to go down and put some dumb shit into a machine in a high school gym. God forbid you have to poop and you go and sit in that high school gym bathroom. You're going to you're going to get high school crabs. You're going to go home with some false sense of, I don't know, accomplishment, a mild dopamine drip and crabs just crawling all over your pubes, laying their eggs in there. And you're going to have to explain that to your lover. Like, no, you don't understand. I voted. I'm not messing around. I didn't hook up with somebody who had pubic lice. I pooped in a high school gym. I'm saying poop because we can't say shit on the podcast anymore. Romdahl used to talk about the different levels of reality. One level, it's the level of the midterms. It's all the human stuff, your social security number, where you put your vibrator before the guests come over, that stuff. That's just one level of reality. There's another level of reality that's pretty amazing, low population density, too, just outside of all that noise and madness and insanity. There's another level of reality, a beautiful level of reality. There's a lot of different names for it. Some people call it the present moment. Some people call it bored as shit, but it doesn't have to be boring. In fact, it's an incredible place, a place where everything most of the time is fine, beautiful even, incredible, where you don't really have a personality or identity in the way you understand it. You don't really have a you and stuff you like and stuff you don't like and people you're angry at and people you're happy with and a list of people that you've buried in various landfills across the United States. No, in that present moment space, you're just this, everything and nothing simultaneously. This is a beautiful place to be. Now, you can't hang out in that place all the time, can you? You have to do stuff. You got to go to work. You got to go to that puppy mill and you've got to get the dogs to make love. You got to go to the penitentiary you're a guard at and you've got to stop the prisoners from making love. This is your life. This is reality and I'm not suggesting that you should dismiss this or go floating off in some meditative, ambivalent haze. What I'm saying is if you get too stuck in the midterm stuff, you get too stuck in the politics, if you get too stuck in the fleeting, temporary, bugling of megalomaniacal narcissists who are making so much money from their positions of power, then you can end up with a slight tremble in your undergun. It'll tremble and it'll wake you up in the middle of the night as it vibrates and it exudes that thick, creamy stress oil that so many of our underguns released during the midterms. This is why I'm suggesting maybe it's time for us to vote no to democracy. And yes, to monarchy, think about it. Democracy is not really working. And since it's on the ballot right now, this is a chance to actually get rid of that system. No more weird, geriatric people gaslighting us about bullshit. No more going down to vote. No more feeling bad because the person you voted for turned out to be the next incarnation of Joseph Stalin or Charles Manson. No, you don't have to feel bad anymore. If the king sucks, you didn't vote for him. And your friends didn't vote for him either. It's a king, but maybe the king won't suck. Maybe our new king will be beautiful with an incredible beard and a sword that glows when evil is nearby. You won't live in a country anymore. You live in a kingdom. And yeah, are you going to have the false sense that you have some control over the direction of the country you're in? No, but there's some possibility that while you're out in the fields, uh, working with your ox or when you're walking down one of the many byroads of your new kingdom that you might pass the king and he might like you and make you a Duke or a Duchess and give you a kingdom inside his kingdom. You might become the Duke of Minnesota. You might become the Duchess of New Jersey. Now that's pretty incredible. You're not going to have to get a lot of money from various corporations and billionaires so that you can get enough TV ads to get elected. No, you just need to make that king's eyes twinkle in that special kingly way. And he might grant you a boon. I think there's something to be said for thinking about voting no to democracy. And yes, to monarchy. Friends, if you are listening to this on the week of November 7th and you live in Fort Worth or Dallas, I would love for you to come and see me perform. I'm going to be at Hyena's Comedy Club November 11th and Fort Worth. And then November 12th, you can catch me in Dallas at Hyena's Comedy Club. We're doing two shows a night and by we, I mean myself and the brilliant William Montgomery. I hope you'll come out. I've got a Patreon. It's patreon.com. Fortslash DTFH. We gather twice a week for a meditation and a wonderful gathering. We write books together. We love each other. We're a family and we want you to join us. Just go to patreon.com. Fortslash DTFH and sign up and finally my loves. I'm getting my YouTube channel fired up. All the weird stuff that doesn't necessarily fit into the podcast. You can find that by looking at Duncan Trussell on YouTube. Filling it up with new content every day. I'm evolving my studio soon. I'll have over 300 cameras that I can look from one camera to the next to the next as I talk to you about ways to upgrade your iPhone. That's on YouTube. I hope you'll subscribe. Now I'm fascinated by today's guest. He's the only Taoist monk that I know. Of course, I was introduced to him by one of my favorite DTFH guests, Danieli Bolleli. He's been on the podcast once. I hope you'll listen to that episode. But before you listen to that, listen to this one. This is an authentic Taoist monk, a martial artist and somebody who is valiantly combating a fungal infection in his brain. Someone who is on the precipice of letting go of his body and is completely fearless and completely open about his situation. You can find him by going to monkyunru.com. I'm going to have the links at dunkintrossell.com. He is an author. He's written many, many great books. He talks about some of them during this episode along with an incredible vision he had after he stopped breathing. This is some wild stuff. So strap in and welcome back to the DTFH monkyunru. Welcome, monk, welcome to you. That you are with us. Shake hands, go meet new people. Welcome to you. It's the dunkintrossell.com. Dunkyunru, welcome back to the DTFH. How you doing? Doing okay. Now, you got interrupted. I don't know if I'm glowing like the last time. Do you always have a glow? It could be the lighting. We had to sort of shift the podcast around. What happened? I had a hospital powder, too. We did, and I'm sure it was a health-related thing because nothing else would do that. Things aren't going on, but I'm still here. Are you feeling better since your visit to the hospital? Well, you know, I got two things going on. You may recall one is... I do. Yeah, I'm feeling better since the visit to the hospital. That was not a high point in any way. But you know, how about this? I am not in the hospital. Thank you. Oh, yes. God. Feeling better. I'm glad. I see that you had my brother, Daniela, on again, which I haven't had a chance to listen to. Oh, it's good. I love him so much. Can you tell me what's going on behind you there? What is that? Is that an altar? What are the symbols above? I'm looking at your awesome studio. Quite impressed. You've got... It's very organized. You've got a bookshelf. And right behind me, I see... I'm going to unimpress you. How am I unimpressed? The only thing that doesn't impress me is you put your router next to your samurai swords. Are those samurai swords? Yeah. See, I don't think you should do that. They're not samurai swords, but they are Chinese swords. So the reason that that's there is that it keeps me on my toes because the router imbues crazy energy, imbues those swords with crazy energy. And sometimes they come right out of the stand and they start warring around. And I got to end up under the desk, and I don't know if they can see that low and all. All right. You guys used to have a magical sword problem in my studio too. You know what I did? Got rid of the fucking swords. I didn't... I love that. I love that having to stay on my toes. Yeah. I knew your desk ain't on your toes, friend. Well, it doesn't always get all four swords. So usually I have a chance to grab at least one and defend myself. And since I'm not doing a lot of sword dancing these days. Sword dancing. You know, it's not all bad. So I have this bookshelf. Well, I have a lot of things here. The red thing, framed. Red thing is my ordination with the Chinese government. It's a very, you know, embarrassingly stamp. Then there's some other artwork. I don't know how much you can see. I can see the horses. The very top center piece. That's... I bought that at the art gallery at the Forbidden City many years ago. Almost, I don't know, 15 or 20 years ago. It was a display from the University of Inner Mongolia. And that was painted by the chairman of that art department. It's just the most beautiful painting. And I hate snow and I hate horses. Don't ask. It's a fantastic painting. And then here is my... When I was very, very sick, I started to pare down my library. I didn't want my wife to have to deal with all that. I didn't want her to do away a lot of things. But there's still, you know, the good texts and the critical things that I need for my classes and stuff. Tell me about the altar behind you. What... It's not really an altar. It's a table. I moved some things off of it. I don't know really how I can very easily show you this. This bookshelf is got a lot of altar stuff on it. I'll just show you one or two of them because they're beautiful. Nobody can see them except us. We can describe them. Yeah. Well, we are recording videos, so maybe who knows one day it could end up on the internet. Oh my God, you disappoint me so much. I told you. You're gonna warn me too. I can... Don't worry. It doesn't have to. Look at your beautiful... Look at your beautiful... Okay, well, I'll pull out a couple things. This is really amazing. I have a lot of Buddhist things and a lot of Buddhist things of interest. One has an extraordinary story with it. Well, my father in the 70s is a famous physician, and he briefly took care of the Shah of Iran. And... Wow. The Shah of Iran gifted him. He had no idea what this was. Nobody in my family had any idea what it was. I never dared to ask him for it, because he had no idea what it was. So after he passed away, I asked my mom if I could have this. Wow. It's beautiful. This is an extraordinary carving in... I guess maybe Afghan or Persian, Turk wise, which is different from our own here. Folks, it's just beautiful, vivid blue. It's really pretty. What is that a carving of? Well, so that's the thing. It's the legend of the Monkey King. Oh, Hanuman? The Buddhist monk traveling from east to west and journey to the west. And here you can see his staff. I see it. Remember, we talked a little bit last time about how Taoism was a very porous religion philosophy. Yeah. And one of the ways that it has survived thousands of years. And if you count its shamanistic precursors, longer than that, is to absorb, to be porous or permeable, one of the good Taoist scholars here in the US called it that. I can't remember whether it was permeable or porous, but I've thought about that for a long time since I read that thing. It's very true in the monastery where I was ordained in Guangzhou, in southern China. If I'm ever fortunate enough to be able to go back there, sign of American relations don't make it likely. But if I am, it's called Qinyangguan, which means pure Yang, which means you open the top of your head and you connect to heaven through your meditation practices, which you asked me about. You were fascinated by the six hour standing guys. Yeah. Remember that. Anyway. So this is a very good entry to what I kind of feel like I want to talk about with you today because we really didn't get there last time. And it's very, very important. We'll see if it's of interest. I wrote a novel which just released the Jade Boy, brand new. To do that novel, it took me years to write it. I had to travel all over China. And I was in pursuit of this riverine neolithic tribe that lived. And was the sort of foundational shamanistic thinking as one of those early shamanistic practices that we think salted into Taoism. Okay. And I wanted to put this story together with Taoism and make a kick ass story about a Jade robot was constructed with a golden head. It's constructed to be about the size of a six or eight year old boy. And he was gifted to the Baron Queen of Kubla Khan. You know, the Kubla Khan was not troubled by a Baron Queen. He just got another one, you know, so he had many. But this was the first Queen and she still had to be honored, even though she couldn't have a baby. And the court inventor, the guy who invented strutting swans and musical elephants for the amusement of the Khan was in love with this first Queen and he created for her a child substitute. Okay. And he gifted it to her so that she could technically have a child. And there was, and it turned out that the boy was sentient. That somehow this robot was alive. Okay. And that's, and there was a whole religious convocation about all the different religious heads were in Kambalik at that time where the, where the emperor was, and they decided that, you know, yes, he was alive, which meant that he could theoretically, he was the son of the first Queen. He could be the next emperor. Be the next emperor. The first emperor. An AI emperor. But the AI was thousands and well, now it was 800 years ago. And there's a whole lot to the story. It's the most fun thing. Anyway, this little statue. It represents that culture. So it has very interesting eyes. Big ears. Yeah, it kind of looks like a little bit like the, the creature from the black lagoon, but not like way cooler, kind of like aquatic. It looks, it looks Polynesian. The creature from the black lagoon. I have a green one. There's a parent. I got a, it's a blurry internet connection. You know, I don't understand what I'm seeing there. Yeah, that's right. No, you're right. It's the creature from the black lagoon, which has kept me going with that book all these years. It's got aquatic ears. I didn't mean to insult your statue. It's got like kind of like flappy aquatic ears. Yeah. Okay. I'll give you that. Anyway, here's something that happened around this. So I went and found an excavation in central China. And I found a museum that had just opened about this culture. And it was a beautiful museum. I learned everything I needed to know from the book in this museum. When I came back, I stopped in Hawaii to work some more on the book. I got a little room in a big island, Airbnb, and I just stayed there with my laptop working on this, everything fresh working on this book. And I was like super disciplined. I didn't go out and I had a refrigerator. And I just, I didn't go out. And like after 10 days, I thought, you know, I'm out of my mind. I'm on the big island. I'm staying in a room. I can do this. That's Western New York, which, which I'm not above doing. This was good because I was on my way back. Anyway, I get out, I get my car and I drive. They completely other side of the island. I had a nice lunch. I'm just so relishing not looking at the screen. I take a little procrastinatory walk and I see kind of a junk store, like just some old furniture and stuff. But for whatever reason, I walk in mostly so as not to head back to work. I'm just wandering around this dingy shop and I go at the very back of the shop. There's a case and in the case is that little guy along with a friend. And I look at it because I've just come from the museum where these things are. Yeah, see them. Wow. WTF. Yeah. That's my little guy. Yeah. And he's in a jade. Yeah. And I have one of those free zones of crazy stuff. I go to the lady at the front and I say, could I look in those next year? Yeah. And I take these two out and ask how much they are. And they were a little pricey, but I ask her where she got them. You know, my husband was all into Chinese stuff and he was over there. And he visited a museum in central China called Sanchin Way. And I can't tell you if they're real. They're probably just reproductions. And I'm listening to this in my eyes. And I tell you, you know what I'm doing here? And she goes, no, that's, this is, you're making this up. It's impossible. It's impossible. And I'm not making it up. So I buy one. From two weeks later, the other one comes as a gift in the mail. What? She sent it? She sent it to me. Cool. Cool. So I have these pair reminding me of the power of story. Incredible power of story and coincidence, which isn't probably. And it was a real like mind bending thing. That does not seem like a coincidence to me. That seems like an episode of the Twilight Zone or something, except usually like the Jade statue is cursed. Or in this case, it's just, well, let's really think about it. There just was pause for a second. I think it's important when magic happens. And especially in like ceremonial magic, if you successfully execute some spells, some, some whatever, you're supposed to like, and you say, you downplay it or you don't admit what it is. And apparently that's like bad practice. Like you have to admit it worked. It happened. The thing worked. So let's think about it. You've gone to the big island. You're in an Airbnb, 10 days going nuts, writing. You go to take a simple walk, meaning this is right by you the whole time you've been writing. It's just been sitting there calling me or something. And there it is. It's not, I've never seen whatever that thing is in my life. Like I've never seen, it's not like we're looking at a, a bobbly head of Kevin Costner or something. Honestly, I've never seen a bobbly head of Kevin Costner, but you know what I mean? This is impossible. That's the partner. Wow. That's what she sent me. They're both Jade. And they are amazing. And that was some kind of magic other than I, I didn't have that intention, right? Cause I didn't know those things were there, but however it happened, it was an extraordinary thing. Well, yeah. That's, that's extraordinary. That's a affirmation of your book. I would be very excited because it would be like the universe saying, yes, you're on the right path. And usually I just think of those things as bread crumb trails, little clues dropped into the time space continuum by whatever to indicate, like, okay, yeah, you're doing the right thing. Kind of like when I give, you know, you, I'm trying to get the dogs to like sit on their cushions when we watch TV. And I, you know, I'm trying to manipulate them with food. Right. It's like that, except you're not a dog and whatever this thing is, it's probably a whole infinitely more intelligent than humans. When she said my husband visited San Qinglui, I probably like got dry mouth and froze. Yeah. For a moment or two. Yeah. Because I had no way really of immediately integrating that into my reality. It took me a little while. That's the other quality of it is you, you have to either forget it, which I think a lot of people do. I think those things happen more often than maybe people think. It's just that it's too much to deal with that reality. So, so you just sort of, you naturally forget about it like a dream or something, or you adapt and realize, yeah, whatever's going on here. Well, you know, we've got some serious blinders on as for sure. We've got serious blinders that are only allowing us, or we were deciding to wear the blinders and we're only seeing a tiny sliver of whatever's happening. In an earlier book, Mad Monk Manifesto, I talk about this in terms of filters. And I say, you know, we're just as we have evolved through millions of years, we have gained these filters on our consciousness that interrupt how much and what we can see. Right. And I think the, I posit, I wasn't there, so I don't know, but I was a student in evolutionary biology for a long time. I posit that these filters are the brain's number one job. As we evolve, the filters kept us from dying and going nuts, being overwhelmed with a thousand frequencies of light that we cannot see coming in from the cosmos, and we would be blinded by them or so confused by what we could see that we couldn't function, find a mate, find shelter, find something to eat. And that we need the filters, but not all of them. We now have an opportunity through meditation and Dallas practice to remove selectively and purposefully the filters. So, you know, when we drop acid or two shrooms or something, you know, I think there's also a lot of filter removal going on and which is can be, you know, terrifying or fabulous, but it can't select. Right. I can't select. No, it's pretty, it's a roll of the dice. It's like, if you get lucky, you take the right amount of acid, you take too little. You don't take enough acid and what happens is the filters get magnified. It's like you get triple filter, quadruple filter. You get stuck in the filter. You take enough acid, no more filter. You know, that's where things get interesting. It sucks when you get stuck in the filter on a psychedelic though. That's, that's where I think that's interesting. I never really thought of it that way. I will say that people often ask me why I don't do more of that stuff. And I say, you know, I don't feel like I'm in any way a control freak, but I do like to control some things. And in this case, my Dallas meditation explains the filters in some ways, not in this language, but, you know, basically, and tells me which to take off or which not to take off. And that has proven to be fantastic. Admittedly, it's a lot more work and a lot more pain in your legs than. Well, yeah, teach a man to teach a teacher, teach a man to make acid versus teach a man to buy acid. The man can make acid forever. It's difficult to obtain the precursor ingredients, unfortunately. But in this case, you know, and this is why, you know, you hear if you're, if you're so many psychedelic people, fans of psychedelics get drawn into meditation out of some intuition at the very least that just maybe there's something here. But you hear from people like you and you hear from people like Ram Dass and you hear that you hear over and over again. I'm telling you, there's a way to get to a place so much more fabulous than the place you're getting to from psychedelics. It's just like you're saying it's there's a difference between having a discipline to sit, have a daily practice to, you know, have a teacher to do all the things and, you know, meeting somebody in a park to get a piece of paper. Big difference, you know, one is quick, one is slow and people in our culture, they like quick. So I understand the, I understand why. I'm not a dedicated psychonaut. So, but the experiences I've had very much underscore that for me at least, because I do like daily practice, and I do like the frame that it gives life. And I also, you know, we were talking about story and something I've been thinking a lot about since our last conversation. And I wrote a newsletter about this subject. And you know, maybe it's because I got a lot of books coming at this year, I got three came out already. Wow. I feel like that we don't give story enough credit in terms of creating our culture, our society, how we see the world. It's all story. Yeah, whether it's a Judeo-Christian story from Syrian stone god, Babylonian, but whatever. Or it's a Hindu story about, you know, created 60 million gods, whether it's a Taoist, so-called scientific way of looking at the universe constantly rebalancing itself and harmonizing. These are all stories. And if they're strong stories and the luck of the civilization dice gives them sway for a long period of time, then they become so inextricably entwined in the fabric of our everyday life that we don't even know they exist. We don't know where those stories came from. We just are born into them. Yeah. So to me, the fascination, and it took me a long time, decades, I think, to really understand this. To me, the fascination is to see what it feels like to create mythology. And I don't have a large enough audience because I'm in a fringe area in the wrong country, let's say, for that. What? What? You mean Taoist monk isn't like trending on Tik Tok right now? It has been trending on Tik Tok like I can't tell you. Oh, I get all kinds of hits. So I've discovered that there's two different ways to convey these ideas. One is, I write something like Madman Benefesto, which is I hand you a glass and I say, Duncan, drink this. You take a sip and you guys disgusting. It's so bitter. I say, yeah, but it's the real thing. So take it and, you know, you read this, you'll really understand what's going on. And you go, all right, you hold your nose in your swallow and you say, yeah, that was awful. And then you take a minute and you go, oh, I see what you're saying now. Yeah. But it tasted terrible. I couldn't get through it. Yeah. Or you can take that medicine, put it in a strawberry milkshake. It's the same medicine. Same medicine. Well, I'm telling you, there's a company, Annie's, our kid has allergies, so we have to be careful, but they're brilliant. They came up with a crunchy snack that looks like our kid, I'm sorry, their kid loves cheddar bunnies. All right. But Annie's is just released, not sponsored by Annie's, by the way, hidden vegetable bunnies. So it's brilliant. It's brilliant that no idea he has no idea he's eating vegetables, thinks it's cheddar bunnies, which it is, they don't taste terrible, they taste good. So yes, I know exactly what you mean. If we are, and I think that it's like, they're real parallels between parenting and what you're talking about, which is that if I try to get my kid to eat like all the things that you think a child should eat, good luck, good luck. What are you going to do? Tie him down, foie gras, broccoli into them like they do with the geese? No. You got to like hope that they like it and then like find ways to get good food into them. So I feel like what you're saying is when through a practice, you discover that this is not false, but in fact, there is a way to reduce one's suffering in the material universe that's so incredible. It might be the most beautiful thing floating in the world. And then what generates from that is compassion. And then what comes from that is you want to help. But like what you're saying, you go right with the broccoli, people aren't really interested in broccoli. People aren't interested in that, especially when it challenges, when it challenges you, you know, when it challenges your identity, when it challenges all the work you put into your own personal story. So yeah, I hear what you're saying and I agree. A deep and hearty thank you to the alchemists at Loomi Labs for supporting the DTFH and for creating my favorite microdose gummy out there. Friends, are you afraid of edibles? You should be. I am. In the old days, I'd try to figure out just the right microdose of whatever edible I had and inevitably I would get that shishito pepper effect, slurp one of those babies back and the next thing I knew, I was fantasizing about what it would be like to be disemboweled by an undead pirate lich with a with a magical hook for a hand. Just feeling that hook going up through my belly and into my throat, pulling my head off and then somehow I stay alive so that the undead pirates dangling my head in front of its head and saying to me, you're me, you've always been me. I'm too old for that shit. I got things to do, man. I can't worry about maybe finding myself on some roller coaster created by Satan plunging into the depths of hell. And this is why I love Loomi Labs. They did it. They created the perfect microdose gummy. Thank you, Jesus. And it's available nationwide. You can fly with these.

Last time we talked with, we spent a little time on the vision that I had was our comatose and that vision of what is the future of humanity and all that. I got, I got some feedback from out there. I'm not surprised that you are not surprised. I'm sorry, but before you talk about the feedback, would you mind summarizing that vision again for folks who are just joining us for the first time because there might be people who didn't know this story initially. I had multiple organ failure from sepsis and I was pretty, I guess, I was, I hesitate to use the word because I cannot say if my heart had stopped, but it probably had and if it hadn't, it was about to, and I wasn't really aware of that. I wasn't aware of being resuscitated, but anyway, and you know, I was resuscitated in an ambulance, so I became conscious in the ambulance. And I was aware of, you know, the conversation between the EMTs and the hospital as they're driving you 800 miles an hour because if you ever had to get the guy to the hospital fast, this was the time. And so I heard the back and forth and, you know, they said you'll need to repeat those blood numbers that would take blood. Those are not consistent with human life. I do remember hearing that thinking well that that's that's not good. Yeah. So anyway, I was, I was out for a few days. And during that time I had this vision, and I had a, I had a companion in the vision. And I don't want to get religious about that because I have no real sense. I would love to tell you that was, you know, lousy or Buddha came and hung out with me, but I can't tell you that. What I can say is that I was aware of what I call the curator and the curator was interested in showing me stuff he wanted to show me. I did have a sense it was a he, but I couldn't say what he looked like or anything. He kind of yanked me around the cosmos. I was going very quickly through space. I remember passing comments and seeing them in great detail. I was going by zooming in close to planets. There's a lot of space in this as opposed to trees. Right. It was a very cosmic thing. And it gave me some tiny sense of how much there is out there and how insignificant and tiny we are. Yes. Which is, you know, a Taoist idea in some respects that, you know, you're part of a matrix or fabric. You're not, you're not by any means utterly important, but nor unimportant. But nor is it all about you. Right. Another thing which you pointed out in our last conversation, nobody really wants to hear that, especially not in our culture. That's the broccoli. Right. And everybody wants to hear it is all about you. And that's where self help industry arises. Anyway, when I began to come out of this, whatever this state was. Last thing I remember being shown is the future was the future of humanity, which maybe is the future of humanity. I felt certain about it then and I guess I still do now. Which was that, you know, we become very enmeshed. Yes. In our AI. And we end up floating around in space in these giant synthetic things that look like Alaska King crab legs. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, but, and I reacted poorly to that model. I was like, no, no, no. And the curator gave me a bit of tough love and said, you know, I'm sorry, you don't like it. Because it's not really about you having crab legs tonight. That's how it's going to be, you know, that's what's going to happen. So anyway, I did get, I got some feedback from people were not angry at me but but they were disturbed by this vision which I completely understand. The best I could do was say, you know, I don't have the sense that despite my poor reaction to it, it was a bad thing. I had the impression, for example, that there was no suffering at all. And how could be, how could I resist a state in which pure consciousness was retained. And yet, and everybody was there and you were there as Duncan but you were Duncan part of a big thing. But there was no physical suffering and I can't tell you that I got so into it that I could talk with the curator about emotional suffering and disconnection or any of that because it didn't last that long. And mostly because I got upset. If I had not gotten upset. I have a feeling that I would have gotten more detail on this. No, no crab legs floating in the No, thank you. But it's not like, it's like you're, you're talking about like a kind of technological extrusion or something like some kind of like a Yeah, yeah, just some some form of like, I don't know, space ship was like sort of kind of carbon fiber but it was, you know, nothing hit that hit it couldn't hurt it. Yeah, strikes bumped into it and bumped off. It was very, you know, it was was way beyond our tech. But somehow we got, we got there. And, you know, there are many people in that field to think that human beings, just like a seal of cancer, better examples are things that have gone extinct the dodo. They were just there to serve the course of evolution and we as human beings are just there to serve the course to serve the purpose of generating what they call strong AI, which looks at us like we look at an ant. Yeah, right. That's not going to step on you unless you're directly under my foot, but you know, it's like, let's imagine you and I are sentient droplets of water. We just we came to I don't know what happened and we are beginning to realize that we're in a river. And we're beginning to realize that this river is getting faster and that this river is about to turn into a waterfall, meaning that our entire experience of what it means to be this wonderful little peaceful bit of the river is about to radically dramatically drastically change and we've gotten attached to different like whatever the hell's in that part of the river we've gotten attached to it. This is what it's always been this little part of the river. And there's droplets who are like, we're going to stop the flow of water, we're going to find a way to freeze it, we're going to find a way to stay exactly here non flowing. We are not going over that fucking waterfall that waterfall into the end of everything. And that's what that's what's happening right now, except in this case it's like what you're talking about the waterfall is many different names for it. But it's the technological singularity is one of the more common ones the apocalypse is another. The color you got. Yes. But of course, you know, really what's happening that a most water, you know, most droplets of water is that shit's drying up. So that's another another, but we're going to become a cloud. I like the river I don't want to be a cloud I don't want to be evaporated no. You know, stories, all the way back to ancient stories on tablets and Egyptian things and so on. You know, what they're always about, because the only thing that's really true, despite what we could make up to. I don't know, clarify or reinforce these ideas. The only thing that's really true is change. Absolutely. You know, two years ago before I got sick, I was still jumping around with a 30 pound sword and doing splits. And now I'm reaching out for something to stabilize me as I go down the stairs. Right. And it can't be too many of them, by the way. How could I have possibly foreseen that. I mean, worse happens people get it by a bus. I mean, you get ALS, which is a disease I could think of that's even worse. But I don't I don't think that I like I don't think any of us are like thinking, well, you know, at some point I'm probably going to have a very rare fungal infection. Right. But I mean, the fact that it was this particular one is interest, maybe because it's rare. But the point is that if you if you live in a way that cultivates the awareness. And we talked about this too, but that you are part of something very much larger, and that the things that happen are not poor me things. I never I never had a why me feeling. Which is strange, I know. Not one you didn't have a single flicker of like, are you fucking kidding me? Like, seriously, like this is this is it? Yes. But that I find is a bit different than why me. I wasn't feeling right. Like, I'm not like why me like victim. You didn't get victim. Yeah, right. Yeah. Great. You know, this happened to me, as opposed to someone else. I didn't have that. I did have the. This is not a fun way to go out feeling because we would not have that feeling. But you know, we don't get to choose. I remember my primary master. Once, a dozen years ago, I got sick, and he and not this sick, but I got sick. And he said, oh, very good for you. And I remember thinking, excuse me and what, you know, I felt a flare of irritation at this. How could you say that really? Why would you say something like that? And he saw my expression. He says, look, you have a place to go. And this is a shortcut. You didn't choose it. But if it didn't happen, you'd have another 25 years of meditation to get here. It's pretty much the same thing here. And I said, I'm sick of shortcuts. I'm fine. Just give me the 25 years of more practice and I'll scramble up the mountain on all fours, you know, but. And again, he said the same thing. Yeah. Okay. Doesn't matter what you feel. And it's the same thing as the guy telling me too bad if you don't like this future of humanity, but that's what's happening. It's a Job experience. It's a Job book of Job style thing. Job is just getting dragged about by God. He is over it. And at some point God basically says the same thing. Like, who are you? Like, who are you to question that which made the Leviathan? Like, what? What do you want? You giving me notes? You giving me notes, Joe? It is a very good story. Very good story. And I've just, you know, I decided a long time ago that I wanted to live. I wanted to write my own story for my own life. And I also wanted to write stories of ideas and I wanted to create people and relationships that I could imbue with some of the things I'd learned. They're not didactic books, not the novels anyway, but they have the whole, you know, the stream is in them. Yes. You know, and it's my favorite thing. And now that I'm physically quite limited, I did this workshop last weekend, people came to Tucson for some study. You know, it was a couple of days of movement and philosophy put together. And honestly, I wasn't able to do a lot of the movement. I had assistance and everything got done, you know, but I wasn't like I was before. And I could, I could tell that some of the folks there who hadn't seen me in a while were like, oh my God. But not, not everybody. And they got over it. And, you know, I just, I just told them, I said, look. Taoism is all about change. Yes. I mean, that's what this is. I became a monk in this because I take that. I take that philosophy and worldview so seriously that it really makes more sense to me than any other story about who we are and why we're here. So, since I like it so much and I've been telling it and hearing it for so long and different voices and different times and people and books. I'm just going to accept that this is exactly what is supposed to be happening right now. We, I mean, it's got to be, it's got to be, what do you, is there a malfunction somewhere? Is there like a circuit somewhere, the deep space that somebody's like, oh, shit, we got to plug this in. I'm so sorry. It was a malfunction. So it's on me. Or, you know, that they're all playing us as a video game. That this whole thing is from our, from our descendants who have created a reality kind of matrix like, and they're, and they're seeing a monk. Let's see what happens if we do this to him. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It could be. Handles with Mr. Monk. It just could be the dinner's ready. You know, it's dinner's ready. The way we translate getting called to dinner, you know, when you're a kid and you, you experienced, I experienced that these kids, these days, I don't get it like we do, but we, they just don't let us roam. People would have dinner bells. You have to ring the bell. You hear the bell. You go, you don't want to get to the point where you hear your mother angrily yelling for you because that means that you fucked up. You know what I mean? So you go and you go eat dinner. I, maybe that's, we're talking about something similar, but in an hyper dimensional level where what we consider like death, letting go, it's just ding, ding, ding, ding. Come on, it's time to eat. And then, you know, then it's, there you are, you're back at the dinner table eating and your mom's like, you got to stop playing that game. Why do you always give yourself that fungus thing? You should try a different way to tie. Yeah. And, you know, that I've always had a weak constitution and had a lot of things wrong. My childhood was not robust. So it's not entirely surprising that I got this as opposed to some, you know, Olympic swimmer or something, but still the story, even that is a story. You know, that's me creating a narrative of well, you know, I was a little fella. I was a little fella and I kept falling down and I couldn't keep up with my friends on the bike trail. Okay, now I'm old man and look what they do to me. We're a bitch. I mean, this is like you're habituated to it. It's like what you're talking like the, this reality, this, this truth of change, this fact that look at you, every single one of us is a melting candle. No way around it. We're melting at different rates. Sometimes you start melting faster than you thought you were going to melt. This, what it seems like what crept in or big, big stories, powerful stories, addictive stories that are the opposite of that, the opposite of the melting candle. There's hope. You might live forever. We're going to find a cure for death. We're going to cure a death. We're going to cure disease. And so these stories became solidified. And if that's not the story, the story is a distracting story. Let's look at the midterm elections. Let's focus on geopolitics. Let's look at that story instead of looking at the much bigger story, which is like, we're melting, baby. We're melting down every single one of us. That's a really intense story, even though it's true, you know? So I think we're habituated to like sort of echo that in varying ways of attempting to bring some solidity to this, this very non solid, very fluid, very, very, very impossible to control situation that we find ourselves in. I get it. You know, it's a, and I understand why people think it works. I understand in the past versions of me why I would adhere to that. I still do. I don't want to spend all day thinking about the fact that I'm like a old candy bar, somebody left on a sidewalk, gradually melting. You know, one of the things that came out of that vision was something that I had before the vision. But it was heightened and sharpened, which was my constant awareness that human beings are far from the only and maybe not the smartest creatures on this planet. And then we have somehow taken it upon ourselves to just be a pure force of destruction. And do we do other nice things? Do we have the ninth symphony Beethoven? You know, do we have Ulysses? Yes. Do we do amazing things? Yeah. But what happens somehow is those amazing things that we can do somehow dropped out of service, meaning that we can't, we don't use those facilities now. Right. To, for the greater good, it became an all about me culture. Oh, yeah. And, and, you know, it's very the problem for me, at least with that is that I'm painfully aware of the consequences of those decisions and actions all the time. I just, I'm in a constant state of seeing them. I don't mean negative because sometimes they're very good. Things we do. It's not just bad things we do. Yeah, whatever they we do, and whether we judge them one way or the other, there is no extracting us from the whole of reality. That was him has this phrase. That that was shame that that was big. Which means, you know, when you're fighting with your wife, you know, step outside, take your telescope and take a look at the farthest stuff you can see and and realize that we are just this little marble as it's often called. You know, the sad thing if you had a, if you had a nice enough telescope, you'd probably see some alien fighting with their wife. So, you know, a long time ago I wrote a novel about about aliens and the subject of it was, they're here all the time, they're in our drain pipes, they're flying, you know, 767s or whatever. But we just don't see them. There's that fantastic story about Captain Cook coming, sure, in Polynesia, Hawaii, I can't remember. And the natives came to the beach, and there were his ships on the horizon. I find this a fabulous metaphor for this whole thing. And they didn't see him. Yeah, he was right there, right there. They didn't see him at all. Right there. They couldn't understand. He was landing. Yeah. And they can see that those were human beings dressed funny. You know, they had no ability to even perceive those people. Why? Because they had nothing, nothing in their experience or sensorium. That's a European conquerors coming to destroy our island, our way of life, take our stuff, our women, all that. No idea. No idea. Didn't see him. So, you know, as far as aliens go, I am completely open to the idea that there's one standing in the corner laughing while I'm having this chat. They're in the other corner. What's happening right now is so cool because the radar technology that they have developed is brand new, insane, like hardcore, never before seen ways of like using radar. And so now, all of a sudden, there's this uptick in pilots seeing shit that they didn't see before because the radar is picking it up now, like things hovering in the air, things going faster than anything anyone's ever seen. It's causing all this turbulence in the government because it's like, what, we're going to ignore this? You're going to ignore that? You're going to ignore the ship? We don't know what this is. Didn't we learn our lesson about the European conquerors? We don't know what these things are. And so it's causing a lot of problems because people in the military can't put the toothpaste back in the tube. People in the military, they swore oaths. They're like, listen, I have to leak this. You can't tell me that I'm like, they call it a swamp gassing where you, and that's what they did. They ruined people's lives. Instead of gaslighting swamp gassing, it's like they ruined people's lives. Like people in the military would encounter these things. They would report it. And then they're gone. It's like, you didn't see an eight. There's no UFOs. What are you talking about? And now it's all coming out. Like, oh, no, no, no, they, they, they report just came out. I can't remember how many cases in the report. Maybe I'll just make up a number of thousand cases of those thousand cases. This isn't just like someone in a field being like, whoa, I just saw a thing. This is like people who you have given the responsibility to fly million dollar jets. And of the of of these half of them, something like 50% of them cannot be explained. No idea what the fuck it is. No idea. So yeah, I agree with you. It's everywhere. They're all around us. The universe is teeming with sentience. And we're pretty blind to most of it. I think so. I think that's exactly right. I want to thank Apollo Neuroscience for supporting this episode of the DTFH. Apollo is a new wearable that helps you sleep more and stress less. This is some wild technology, friends. It's like a micro dose on your wrist that helps you feel more present connected. If you're having problems sleeping, it can calm your nerves and clear your mind, melting away stress so you can sleep. It's like a wearable hug for the nervous system using touch therapy to help you wind down into a restful state without drugs or side effects. More on the wrist ankle or as a clip attached to your clothing, Apollo delivers silent soothing vibrations that help you fall asleep and stay asleep. It was developed by a neuroscientist and board certified psychiatrist who's been studying the impacts of chronic stress in humans for nearly 15 years. Apollo Neuro is running an IRB approved clinical trial in conjunction with MAPS, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, to understand long term effectiveness of Apollo wearable with PTSD patients who have undergone MDMA psychotherapy. You don't have to wait for the results of that study to come out though. Head over to ApolloNeuro.com. They've already done lots of studies on this incredible technology and the results are astounding. It's the only technology with an issued patent to reduce unpleasant and undesired experiences associated with medicine assisted therapy, including psychedelics and traditional medicine. Across their research, Apollo users experienced on average 19% more time in deep sleep, 14% increase in REM sleep, and 40% less stress and feelings of anxiety. According to a recent sleep study, consistent Apollo wearable users gained an extra 30 minutes of high quality sleep per night.

And remember, you can find everything you need to find out about the Apollo by going to ApolloNeuro.com. Thank you so much, Apollo Neuro. There was a yesterday or today, so like yesterday or today, I just saw, I think it was in your time saying that they have determined that some percentage of them are high performing Chinese drones, which ought to give us some pause, frankly. Yeah. If we haven't even been able to figure out that what that's what they are for the last 20 years, that's, at least to me, that is not an encouraging thing. On the other hand, how do we know that the Chinese are not seeing our crazy speedy high tech drones? And because of their culture, nobody talks about it at all. It would never get out. Well, no, you know what, they call them anonymous. I read it what the Chinese government is calling them. They do have a name for it. It's something like anomalous weather. They have a funny name that they're calling that they're calling them. They have admitted the seeing some of the same shit that lots of other people are seeing, but in a different way than we currently are. But hey, wait a second, you are telling me so you told this incredible vision that you had on the last podcast and you were saying people responded to it. It felt like you wanted to add to your vision. Like you were going to tell me something regarding that vision. You've been getting a response to it from people who were fascinated as I was. I don't think that there are any sort of images or things to add to it. But I feel like people seized on what they thought was scary. Like what I didn't hear from emails and texts and even in one case a phone call. I didn't, I got that people were disturbed by it and took it as negative. One lady, you know, couldn't sleep because of it kept coming into her mind and I felt like I had to respond to that one because she couldn't. She couldn't sleep. And you know, my worldview does not put that play that at my doorstep that's on her if she can't sleep because things happen all the time we all have stuff. But I did feel compassion in that I wanted to not have her feel that way. So, you know, I had a kind of what I thought was a reassuring conversation and it was. But I think the main thing about that vision is that focusing on just the part at the end where I didn't like where I saw and so I kind of blew the connection if you want. Yeah, sort of doesn't capture that experience and a lot of other ones, because if you meditate for a very long time for many years, that's not the only experience I've had by any means was just a particularly timely one for when we talk because just happened before that. I never get the idea that any of those visions are negative. To me, to me, take away from them, much more significant and powerful to me as the experiencer was not, oh, you know, humanities can end up in crab legs floating around the cosmos, imprisoned or something. Because I had a little grasping of no, I like us the way we are. But besides that, the whole thing, the vision itself, the non dual quality of seeing the world as differently as I did in that vision and as I still retain. I do remember we talked about the mosquito. I just can't bring myself to kill. There have been, I was already on this path so maybe you could say fewer changes than you might expect from someone who had never had these ideas before. But remember, you know, Taoism is non dual. It's all about things being interconnected. And the very first stanza, which I know you're aware of this, in the Laozi or sometimes called the Tao Dajing, that very first line, the first line is, you know, if you can name it, in this case Tao. That's not it. Yeah, correct. And, and the deliciousness of this irony of someone who has such a clear vision of the world, the universe, everything, some group of people or single person maybe had this transcendent non dual view, which you could turn like a tank turret. And if it meant anything and it would reveal the same expensive interconnection. Right. Yeah. He went ahead and wrote the book anyway. He didn't just say, sorry, I can't really write about this because every word I say is not really the thing. You know, that was not down. Yeah. Because language is too paltry a tool for this. But you have to admit, if you are writing the seminal book on Taoism, is there a funnier first sentence in a book about Taoism than that? That to me is what it shows how sparkling he was. Like, is that is the funniest way to start your book? Which is like a degree. And it's one of the things that, you know, I have, I am never going to dunk a basketball. I'll just say upfront, not going to happen. I could take camps and practice. You know, I have short legs. I don't jump well. I'm not a great athlete by any means. Okay. I have a, I have a facility with language. And so even though the words I'm writing are not the real thing anymore than louses are, I still accept that it's the best thing I can be doing is teaching and writing, mostly intertwined actually. And that if I'm a tiny pipsqueak of a nothing compared to louses in the way I do it, but we both accept that even though it isn't the actual thing and we use the word moon, but that's not that great celestial orb itself. That's a word. I still find story. Anything we discuss, we end up coming up with stories, not just books. We put the universe in terms of story. And maybe it's just because of what happened to me in the vision or what was made clearer. Or maybe it's a new level of understanding of things since that event. I think I see story everywhere now. I see how people connect with story. You know, you mentioned trying to train your dogs to stay off the couch with food. You know, I train my dog, one of them, to do everything I ask. If I've got like really juicy, disgusting, foul smelling dog treats in my pocket. Yeah. And some of the stuff I have is you have to wear a mask if I open the thing, it's a little gag you. And yet put that stuff away. The dog is two raised middle fingers. She knows exactly what she's doing. And so yes, my worldview is now that I do believe that dogs understand human emotions better than we understand them because it's adaptive to them to do so. And she knows that I'm not carrying the treats. She has no particular interest in doing what I ask. And that is a story that is a different story than, yeah, you know, a dog just lives for me. She just looks at me and she gives me the googly eyes and she'll do whatever. You know how many people think that about their dogs? And you know, the story is really, the story is really all about the treats. Oh yeah. It's one of my favorite ways of infuriating my wife, who really has a very difficult relationship with my poodle is because the poodle has the most like you've never heard anything so rotten. Like it's like a banshee shriek. And we got kids. We got kids you could put two and two together like she spent, you know, 30 minutes finally getting the young the baby to sleep. Gatsby, who knows what he sees a squirrel, whatever, just remember something bad shriek barks baby wakes up. Wife is like, well, you know, it's time. We just have to give we have to put him down. You can't you can't use the night as a dog for waking up a baby. But and I love but my favorite thing to do is I sit on the couch with him when we're hanging out at night. And I'll pet him like, Oh, did you have a bad day today? You are thinking she's like, it's so fun. But I know that it's a hilarious story. People tell about the motivation of their wolf descended dog. Whenever, especially when it gets romantic and like, like what you're saying, it's incredible. I love those stories. This is but you know, the stories are great. I actually begun a little book called the monk and Mimi about me and this one particular dog to explore the stuff. But still, the amazing thing is that we keep on telling ourselves stories like I gotta put him down. This is a bridge too far. It's a gag, folks. We're never going to I would take I don't care if that poodle only sees me as a walking treat bag. I take a bullet for that. Well, maybe not a bullet, but I definitely do a lot for that dog. So everybody ridicules me about how I am with the dog. Last time we talked, we're talking about the dog. Sorry, let's get back to that was enough with the dog stuff. You know what? Speaking of stories at Brian, we're at an hour. Do you have maybe a few more minutes that you can chat? I happen to have with me a book that is not a vision that came to someone in an ambulance. Have you read this one? The singularity is near Ray Kurzweil. Oh, when did it come out? This book came out actually quite some time ago, which makes it that much more incredible because the book is filled with predictions. Kurzweil is made regarding where we're headed technologically and very accurate predictions and what's really awesome about it is like many of them are completely coming true. And in fact, some of them are coming true sooner than he predicted that they would happen because Kurzweil predicts that by 2045 we will have that's when we're going to have nanobots that disassemble our bodies, reassemble our bodies. This is when like what you're talking about, this is when we go in those crab legs basically and I just wanted to dig up in here the part where he kind of describes exactly what your vision is was and let me just dig this up. I'm sorry, I didn't have this prepared. Let me just find this because it is shockingly similar to what you saw. And also another person who had a similar, a similar vision was Tim Leary. Let me just find this if you have just one second for me to look this up. Here we go. I'm going to get to the part where there's a lot of emotional pushback to Kurzweil and a lot of people who really think he's got it spot on. And I am someone who's kind of in the middle on that subject. Well, the, here's the thing, the, the reason that there I can't find it man I'm sorry. I'll send it to you when I find it. Essentially he says the exact same thing we're going to disassemble our bodies and fly into the universe essentially like our way of what we even consider to be a body and in our unconsciousness is this is going to look like a chrysalis phase essentially. And the, this is the critique. The critique is coming from environmentalists. One of the great critics of what he calls singularity singularity anism. It's a religion is from one of my friends Doug Rush coffee's written some great books. And he's he is analysis of it is it's a it's a dream of being saved. The idea is that rather than respond to what's happening in the world, you have this fantasy that technology at some point is going to reverse all the damage we've done to the planet and everything will get better. And his analysis of that is like, this is fucking bullshit because these same people who you think are going to save you are currently investing in million dollar bomb shelters in New Zealand. So your dream of some technological Messiah or shift is just that it's a sad dream. Nothing is going to save us. Nothing. We're fucked. We don't get to be the technological crab legs. We don't get to be that we get to be ash covered like cancer-ridden remnants of humanity, scrabbling through the wasteland. He didn't say that. That's my language, but that's the critique is like, come on. It's not nothing saving us. And it's not a river. And it's not. It's not a it's just bad. It's just bad. We need to fix the planet. That's varying degrees of that complaint or critique is what I've heard. That's why people bash it and react to it that way. The other critique, of course, is it's inhumane. You're talking about giving up our humanity. This isn't a it's not consensual for everybody. Not everybody wants this to happen. You know, you bringing this up really shines a light on something about towers thought that be guiles me and has for so long. Because it's so interesting this is coming up now. I'm going to talk about the weekend and the last week in conversations with two different students, both middle-aged women. They really wanted me to focus on what that was and has to say about death and about what happens after you die. And I kept putting up my hands and saying, please, don't do this. Do this belief system or the science or call it what you want. Because we don't mostly go there. Part of what makes this all so attractive to me in young theory, the focus on change, harmony, balance. What what be guiles me most about this is it does not require any belief in any story or doctrine. It doesn't ask that of you. Yeah, it doesn't also provide the emotional suck or that many religions have provided to many populations over the course of human history. Whether it was Christians, who were Jews, offering a less orthodox take on how to still be a Jew, but have a little easier time. You don't have to make love through a sheet. You don't have to face certain direction, like Muslim people do. You don't have to eat certain things, but not other things all the time, blah, blah, blah. Those strictures which made life very challenging. Some people really want to be told. It's like how many people are going to rejoice when in a few days, Trump announces his next run a lot. How many people are going to stand on the edge of a cliff and go, oh, my God, what? Yeah. How can I deal with this? So somehow when you have a faith or religion or a philosophy that doesn't try by proselytizing or promising, Buddhism did this too when it first came to China. You know, there were all these, some very shamanistic, that is like religions, but the life of the average person was just so effing miserable. They were going to be constricted. Any moment the emperor's troops that come through and conscript them to war, fight against somebody they never heard of, about something they don't care about, give away their lives, they're never going to see their wife and kids again. If you're 15 to 50, off you go. If the Buddha comes in and talks about the pure land and talks about a system of karma in which you can do certain things to direct the course of your own afterlife. This is a very attractive story. Yeah. Everybody just like, you know, Jesus walked on water and he's going to save her. These stories are the Jews, Messiah is still coming, just wait. All of these things are stories that make it easier to accept the real here and now. Yes. That doesn't, does not have those. So by and large, it doesn't have them. So that means that there was quite a lot of friction between Taoism and Buddhism all those years ago. Because Taoism has one very clear way of looking at the world and this is something else. What Taoism really does, and this is what I had to tell these two students in a way that I, you know, I hope went in. We are talking about how to live. Yeah. Not so much how to die. Right. Right. We are, or what happens after we die and we acknowledge that we don't know what happens after we die. And since we don't know. Even if you are a 40,000 hour meditator, you may see things and believe certain things, but you cannot say to a follower or a fellow believer or a fellow practitioner or a fellow scientist because Taoism is kind of a science. You can't say that you 100,000% know what exactly is going to happen to you when you die. Right. So the idea is that since you can't be sure, watch nature, understand the ebb and flow of how things go, change the Tai Chi too, that little Yin-Yang thing. It's a movie, not a picture. Haha. Yeah. Right. Right. Yin-Yang is constantly becoming Yin. Yin is constantly becoming Yin. If you take a picture of it and say this is it, you missed it a whole thing. Yeah, you missed it. So if you can live and this is, you know, what I used the word beguiled before, but I guess it's a good word. What tells me about this is that everything fits. You can make to some limited extent predictions that are likely to be right. Not a thousand percent, but most often correct. Yeah, you can anticipate things. You can figure out ways way way, you know, the effortless living prescription. You can figure out decisions to make and ways to live that will make your life better and easier by devoting your life to compassion and humility and frugality. Yeah. Right. So the prescription is really how to live, not so much how to die. And it's a very, very practical thing, which is not surprising because the Chinese are very practical people. They can build a mythology around Taoism and have the, you know, the Jade Emperor and his thing, eating the immortal peach and all that ladies floating around and all. Sure. And we have that stuff, but, but that's not what it's about in terms of your everyday life. Well, I go ahead. Sorry. The, I have an app on my phone. This app, when you go jogging, it will let you pretend you're being chased by zombies. It is a way to entertain yourself while you're jogging so that you will jog. Obviously, it's not so you can like experience running from zombies, right? But the point is like, let's get you jogging. You're going to feel better. To me, this is what we're talking about. It's the, the, the, in Buddhism, which I practice, what's delightful about it is that it works that when you start discovering that in fact, this isn't bullshit. And then all of a sudden, you start experiencing a life different from what you ever thought you would have. And it, and it, and it's working. It's working. And it's great. And all the stuff you might have gotten into it for enlightenment, whatever the fucking thing is that you've gotten up in your head about, it starts fading away and importance compared to shit, man. It's what's, it's been like, it's been a few months since I've gotten in a rotten fight with my wife. It's, I'm not, I don't want to drink anymore. What the, what is going on here? Then that becomes so wonderful that to me, the compassion is the recognition of not everybody wants the broccoli. Somebody wants an internal pair, maybe, or somebody. And I think that a side effect of this stuff, or maybe the primary effect of this stuff is compassion. It's just compassion. And in, in Lao Zhu, Buddha, if I had to guess what's enticing them to write these things down or to teach or to do the thing you're doing, it's as simple as that. It's like, shit, this works. And I can help. And then after that, whatever comes out of your mouth is pretty amazing. I think you might be, I think you, you, the teachers, sometimes I play around this idea speaking, here's my silly freaking story. Here's my silly story. Y'all come here and you come here with certain limitations that you assign to yourself, knowing that should you be more aware than you are, your ability to articulate these things would be diffused by the, by, by whatever that may be. And so you encumber yourself, so to speak, with these filters, because otherwise you can't. So the idea is like, instead of sailing up to the island with a ship, and in this case, you're not conquering, you're not, you're not, you're conquering suffering, I guess you could say. But instead of sailing up to the island with the ships that nobody sees and everyone freaks out or whatever, it's a different, more subtle, gentle way of doing it. But somehow you don't get to know the whole story either. Maybe you do, and you're tricking all of us into thinking you don't. I don't know. I wouldn't be surprised. It wouldn't make me mad at you. But the, that's my, that's the story I've been kicking around lately is like temporarily it's a university. I don't know if it's going to be a university forever. This human life thing we're doing here and people like you pop in as the professors. It's a rotten job because you got to be a body and go around, you know, and do it and like deal with it. Yeah, yeah, as those like me. And then, you know, and you don't get the whole, you don't get the whole story because we don't have the whole story. And because we don't have the whole story, we're confused and scared and suffering. And but you don't have the whole story. And when you find out that this thing is happening to you, your reaction isn't why me. A lot of us, every day we wake up and go, why me? And so, you know, you figured it out. You found a way to not do why me. And we need that. That's, you know, I, so I think it's just a hyper compassionate way of expressing how the universe expresses itself. You know, it's like, yeah, I'll do it. I'll go in there. I'll go in there again. You know, it's funny, so many things. I, by my own, by my own lights, I have thus far failed in a lot of things. So last time, you know, I concluded that, you know, I wasn't the transcendent monk that I wanted to be, because if I were offered a do over, you know, I was like, wow, God or somebody came to me and said, you know, you got like, I'm pretty sure we talked about it. You're a thousand steps up. And you have only eight left. And if you make those last eight, remember, you know, you're going to be the by the mind blown out everything. Yeah, knowing that light, whatever, which is not a word we have. But you're not going to get there because, you know, I'm going to take it back so that those eight steps, you know, do, and you're going to want to say yes, because they are grotesque. They are suffering beyond your wildest imagination. The thousand put you at a good place. You got you see a lot of things, you don't see everything, but you see more than a lot of people do and you see like a lot of people who have, you know, climbed this thousand and eight. I am such a wimp of a monk. But, you know, I would say, hey, you know what, if you can, I could actually do that do over thing. Yeah, the suffering of the last two years, I never experienced that. And I hang it, you know, where I was at a thousand steps and it takes me to 25 years of practicing meditation to get where I am now because of that. I'm good with that. Let's do the 25 years, not the, not the eight steps more. You know, I'm cool with this. Roll the tape back, please. Since you offered, I say thank you. Yes. Well, I think you can roll the tape back. That's what happens when you die. If you want to roll the tape back, you can roll the tape back. I think you get to do it. I didn't think that's what keeps it. That's what's like why we keep coming back because you can roll the tape back. It's one of the things. Again, this is just my speculation. I don't know who the fuck knows, but I do. I do think that like what we're in is it's like the thing data doesn't really go anywhere, meaning that there's ways to reassemble one's life and do it. Do it over and over. If you want to, if you want to, and you know, I think people like you actually think that maybe when you're embodied, but I've heard a lot of people when they drop their bodies, you know, the reports are, they're like, I do not. They act like, they act like when my kid doesn't want to go to school. They're like, no, I want to stay home. No, I don't want to do it. But like, I think folks like you, you're like, I'm going to go back in. Yeah, and you know, in my metaphor, I would just not be that macho monk who said to whoever that was offering me the choice. Never mind the suffering. Bring it on baby. I want to go. You know, I'm not that guy, which was a. A sobering revelation, but I later came to feel that that whole narrative, that whole story is horseshit. There probably is nobody who. Another narrative story that I just made up and like, why did I even go there? What the hell was that? Well, another old attachment limitation thing. And then, you know, a lot of people asked me about this. I'm like, yeah, forget it. Don't ask me about that. It's horseshit. It's horse shit. It's horseshit, but it's delicious horseshit. Really? It's fun horseshit. You can make like cool little shapes out of the horseshit if you want to. And you could see where, you know, my character and my experiences and my habits and all that would create that story. But yes, you know, many years in the martial arts, there has to be some ego. There has to be some machismo involved. Otherwise, you know, play a guitar instead. I mean, it's just an arriving the way I look at martial arts now. And the way I look at my own practice subject for another time, but say completely different. That was what this weekend workshop was about. I, you know, I really focused on like, why are you guys practicing this? And that's the context and the purpose of it all actually. And what can we learn from movements and, you know, conflicts that teach us about the rest of our life? Because we are not in 1600 running around with a 10 foot sword on a battlefield. That's horseshit. That's a fantasy life. There are many people who love that and do that, just like there are people who never came out of Tolkien. Right. But right. And I'm not criticizing it because like, you should do what you want. But it's not the best mesh with reality. The best mesh with reality is to recognize that all these principles of boom, boom, boom, boom, right? Every one of them teaches you something about how to deal with conflict in your life. And that shit is fascinating. That's crazy. That's crazy. Like every single one is a little, little fractal you can unfold. It's not literally like, how often are you going to be punching somebody? What kind of rotten life do you have? Like clearly there's something more to it than that. And if you're connected with any kind of modern reality, you know that if you are a person who is so paranoid about leaving the house, that, you know, you need to take your 11 foot spear with you everywhere you go. You have a problem. You need to get some help, right? You need to get it. Why does everything make you so full of fear? But you also have to realize that everybody out there, every granny has a Glock in her glove box. I live in Texas. Yeah. And I'm in Arizona. So we are preaching to the choir here, right? But what I'm saying is it's one thing if you love to practice those things, which I do, right? And since I've been sick, this is a little bit of a pathetic admission, I grant. But I carry a big spear and a big sword everywhere I go with me in my car because I'm like Linus with his blanket. Sure. You need a stinger. I can't use them right now. But I carry them because I'm still hopeful that someday maybe and that's a crutch. But it's a fun crutch and it doesn't bother anybody. There's crutch. That's a sharp crutch. But look, you know, I love chatting with you and I would love to have you come back on and let's get into the nuance of the practice itself. This is I'm completely unfamiliar with it. The philosophy I like the physical side of it. I think lots of us would love to hear from you about that. And and I would love in a few months if you want to come back, I'd love to have you back on. Also, you have three books coming out right now. Can you tell folks where they can find them? Sure. In the spring, which I think we talked about it briefly in the last one, I believe, but maybe not was was my memoir, The Monk of Park Avenue. Yeah, all of these you can get on my website, which is just Monk Yunro, but also just go to Amazon. They're all there. You can even just look up Yunro and see all the offerings. There's a lot. The second one is the story of the woman who ended up ruling a chunk of China because of her prowess with the spear. And you can imagine what an Amazon amazing woman this was. I kind of became when I was studying the technique that she developed, which I still practice admittedly weekly these days, but I still try to do it. I became sort of romantically fascinated with how could this woman figure this out when as far as we know, nobody in previous Chinese history, I don't know what was happening in Africa. But yeah, you know, spear is very basic, but she figured out this whole thing about spiraling it the same way we carve the. The rifling into a barrel of a pistol or it spins the bullet so it stays going straight flies further more accurately. Yeah, hundreds of years before there was a gun. What do you mean like she figured out this is a projectile. And if I can just twist it, I'll keep it on target longer and it'll be stronger. And that was such a genius thing was like an Einstein of martial arts this woman. And so I became sort of romantically fascinated with what little of her story exists in history books. It's very tiny. I had lots of, you know, literary latitude to render her. And I made her sort of a serial killer in the modern world and a sexual omnivore and just this amazing person in ancient China. And I wove it all together. That sounds incredible, man. I'm ordering that now. Wait, what is that called? Wasp warrior. I'll be I'll admit, I like the ancient spear thing, but you got me a serial killer. That's where I locked in. Wow, the kind of person that she was right. This involves a lot of Buddhist stuff too, because there's karma. And when you order a one ton soup at a Chinese restaurant, you're connecting to this book, because the God hon dun is one ton. One ton soup is named after this God, because it's the God of chaos. And one ton soup has the most amorphous, crazy shaped dumplings. It's not like having a bow or having a shrimp dumpling where, you know, they're all exactly the same and every restaurant is a shrimp. You can see it, blah, blah. In any restaurants, one ton soup, the dumplings are deliberately made in a chaotic fashion. No two will ever be the same. Chaos soup. Chaos soup. And this is the God of chaos. And she was his, he was her patron, let's say, through the ages. And so that's where the serial killer stuff comes in. Anyway, it's a really fun, fun book that involves her right at the beginning of the book to the little temper. And she pulls up in front of a 7-Eleven at a stoplight. Some guy runs across. She's driving with her husband in another car. They're going to Christmas to see his family. This guy comes running out with a knapsack, losing bills. He's just robbed the 7-Eleven. He's got a shotgun. Okay. And she honks. She honks at him. She's mad at him. And he's using slugs instead of pellets and a shotgun. He just turns around and shoots her right through the windshield. And the slug ends up in her brain. Part of the thing is about the relationship with this husband and wife and what he slowly uncovers about her past and who she really is and her Chinese family and her life. He has to pick it apart in order to help her. So it's called Wasp Warrior because there are wasps involved in her cure. Oh, damn. The last one, the Jade Boyd, these are two that I took a lot of time with and they involve a lot of Chinese history and really fun stuff. But that character of the little Jade Boyd is probably the most jaw-dropping and you have to be kidding me. Oh my God, character that I've drawn in 20-not books. I can't wait. These are fun books. Folks, all the links you need to find these books. And Moncunro will be at DuncanTrestle.com. Thank you so much for your time today. I really appreciate it. Thank you. I love our conversations too.

Tis ID Trussell, and now we're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. Pleased to announce that I just finished my third feeding session at the Cantal Institute in downtown Brooklyn. I'm just going to play a quick, quick public service announcement from the sweeties over there, and then we're going to jump right into this live podcast recorded at the Bell House in Brooklyn. I knew when I woke up that morning that something had to change. I stood in front of the mirror and realized that the night before, I had ground my teeth so much that I had no more teeth in my mouth. There was just a pile of old tooth dust. Also, my fingers had been exploratory the night before, and while I slept, they went places that I did not want them to go. And there was a general funk all over my hands, a funk I could not wash off. My husband saw me and he said, Jean, if something doesn't change, then I'm afraid our marriage might be over. That's when I knew it was time to call the Cantal Institute. It's time to wake up, come to the Cantal Institute. Your life is going to be fantastic. Linda's undercarriage is covered in nipples. When they wheeled me up to that undercarriage, I could not believe how many beautiful nipples there were for me to choose from. I picked the biggest one. Linda is ours. We took her, and now she's happy. Come on down to the Cantal Institute and you can feed the kind of vibratory sauce dripping out of these nipples is A grade stuff. You're going to feel like you're sucking off a rainbow. You're going to feel like your entire being is filled with light, love, and happiness. Come on down. It's time to feed.

Yeah. Ladies and gentlemen, it is my distinct pleasure. He's been a guest on the podcast and I would love for y'all to give him some love and respect and applause right now for the very wonderful Emil Amos, everybody. There's no divining while the pattern gets cold, it gets me, it gets cold, cold, cold. Something makes the world go round and I don't know what it is. If it blows through me, get it out of me, cause I don't know what it is. If it blows through me, get it out of me, cause I don't know what it is. If it blows through me, get it out of me, cause I don't know what it is. That's a new song, but in hopes that somebody knows any of the stuff, I think I'll play this song, it's like 21 years old, that's fucked, actually. If anybody knows it though, it's because it's on this record in Duncan's like, we're tripping in Oran College and we're in my dorm room on like my bed, just looking into each other's eyes, normal, Tuesday night, and we're like, we're tripping and I guess I just, I don't know, it was like a not cheesy moment where I was like, you wanna hear this new song man? It was like, seriously doubt I said that actually, but I'm telling the story and just breaks into a song and then you hear him be like, what the fuck was that? You know, and we're like peaking and it's on this record, it's like particular recording off the Walkman is on this record, it's always a really special moment cause that only happens like one time in your life where Duncan like is on your track like talking to you and just But anyway, it's called Young Man, it's got to be, it's 21 years old. When this storm's clear, I'll be standing right here, I'll survive the sadness of this world. So let the sun rise, I am a young man, I live a long time. I hope my heart is not set on much, I gotta move slow and let my eyes close. Trust in this world with my life. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. And I will stand before you, and I will bring a smile. I gotta ask you, you travel the world, and you put yourself in some of the most desperate places that I've ever seen, the dangerous situations. Have you ever felt like truly in danger, like in a position where you thought things were gonna go south, or is that just normal for the show? I want to say yes, because that would be a more interesting answer than saying no, but I don't think it's all that dangerous for me most of the time. Okay, let me cut to this clip. Yeah, I mean, I have to, like, put the password and hold on one second. God damn it, man. Fucking reality, seeing a perfect universe that wasn't malfunctioning. I would pull up the clip of you hanging out in the park with the PCP smokers, but hold on. I'm telling you, it's like I get fucked by my past by not remembering my password right now. Hold on one second. It's like either Trump is amazing, or I'm so happy that Trump is president. One second. Sorry, we're almost there. Hold on. This is gonna take a second longer than I thought. One second. You know what? I'll cut this out. This is the beauty of recording a podcast. I'll just cut this out. That's what's incredible about it. Fortunately, I've sent myself the links. Hold on. Sorry, you guys. Just like, can you guys start oming again, please? I'm not even joking. Start oming, please. Keep fucking oming! Perfect. Perfect. Okay, great. Here we go. This, for example, maybe you can introduce the clip, because I'm gonna bring up the clip where you are talking to the former leader of the Process Church. Hold on one second. It's 222. Hold on one second. And previous to this, only because we don't have time to show it, Hamilton was just... Well, first of all, can you just talk a little bit about the... Can you talk a little bit about who Timothy Wiley is? Timothy Wiley was a sort of priest in the Process Church. If anyone is familiar with that, or implicated in the Manson murders in some kind of nebulous way that I've never fully understood. But they're like a semi-Satanic religion. Not semi. I would not call them semi-Satanic. They were full-on hardcore death metal hippies. They were into... This was like a real hardcore hippie cult. They were into Lucifer, Luciferianism. And from the philosophies, it's a sticky... You know how some cults have a sticky philosophy? You know, like, Mark Marin has got a fantastic joke about how he doesn't want to read Dianetics? Because he's worried that like five pages end up like, you know, this kind of makes sense. It's a glorious joke. But in the same way, if you look into the Process Church's philosophy, it's sticky. Like, it sticks in your head and you're like, God, I don't know. Maybe Lucifer really is the Lord of the Earth. I don't know. So this is the guy that you were hanging out with. This is the guy. And it was hard to find someone who's really pro-PCP. That was something that I wanted to... Yeah, but how do you... So like... I was looking. What do you... Go on Craigslist? I couldn't find anyone. I mean, there were people that they used it, but they didn't have a lot to say about it. It was not compelling. And then there was this one guy who had a website with this essay that he'd written about the miraculous properties of PCP. He wrote a whole mythology where he reimagined the Garden of Eden as being this sort of computerized, extraterrestrial invention with a serpent that was like symbolic for PCP in some way. Well, I mean, I guess that kind of makes sense, right? I mean... I think the re... Well, you know what? I'm just going to play this clip and then we can talk about why I don't think I could do this kind of show myself. Interactive dolphins. What was the motivation for doing that? I've always been interested in dolphin intelligence. Using PCP especially with dolphins was just wonderful. And you can just go straight into communication with them. How would that manifest would be an example? One of the questions I... telepathic questions I had asked was, how do you convey information down through time? How do you store information? And I was at about waist deep one time. There was a dolphin swimming out about 10 or 15 feet away. And I had the impulse to pick up a sand dollar. And when I looked at the sand dollar, the impression that came was that these sand dollars are information storage devices. In other words, dolphins can project. They use sound to project images. And they project that image onto that and it stays within, right? Because when shells grow, they grow holographically. You see what I mean? I don't know. The shell will retain its information as it grows. So another dolphin will come along later. We'll ping that with the same frequency and they will receive the information stored in the shell. So this is something, this is a realization that you had. You were on TCP, you picked up a sand dollar and you understood its significance in recording information. I was in this telepathic bond with the dolphins while this was happening. Wow. Wow. That's an amazing story. What I didn't show, only because it's like earlier in the clip, is prior to this scene, you watched as he snorted like four rails of PCP. Yeah, he loves PCP. In some moment of watching a man like that snorting PCP in front of you, knowing the history of PCP, it's not always dolphin communication that happens. It's demon possession that happens. Didn't you feel slightly nervous about what could happen if this guy goes off the rails and decides to start chewing his lips off? No, I was excited. I thought that he could handle it. He definitely was a very experienced person. I think he knew more about how to handle PCP than anyone I've ever met. When you are coming up with episode ideas for the show, is this something that you pitch? Does someone pitch this idea of like, hey, PCP, not always bad. And you're like, yeah, let's do something on that. Let's find ways that baby PCP isn't the worst thing ever. Well, yeah, that's actually how the show started. Vice acquired this TV channel that used to be H2, which was like a history channel derivative that just re-ran ancient aliens. They wanted to do a drug show and they were showing me some of their ideas. It was all scare stories and typical negative reporting on drugs and saying, it's just a really tired way to discuss this topic. Why not say positive things about drugs? And the person who was in charge at the time said, well, you have to admit there are bad drugs like PCP. No one could ever tell a positive story about PCP. And I suggested that I could. And you were right. I think one of the beautiful things about the show is that with a show like this, if I was hosting a show like this, I think that I would fail miserably because my instinct would be to overdo how great drugs are. Like I think that I would be too much on the side of drugs and it feels like you managed to walk this beautiful tightrope where you don't come across, you do seem to be something of an advocate on the show, but you don't come across as like a rabid, drooling drug person whose belief is that it's all good. It's all fine. It's great. You do like show the dangers of these substances as well, which I think is really quite beautiful for you, but it feels like underneath it that you're like a profound advocate for psychoactive substances. Is that true? Absolutely. I mean, I think if you really love something, you owe that topic skepticism. You owe it to really look at it in a rigorous way and not just talk about the positives. So if I seem balanced in my reporting, it is because I'm an advocate and really care about these substances. When was your first contact with psychoactive chemicals? Pretty much in college. I smoked Salvia when I was in high school and that was pretty interesting. What was that like? That was your first psychedelic experience? Yeah. I was afraid of psychedelics when I was in high school. My parents had sort of scared me away from them and Salvia was very new at that time. There was not much information about it. So it was also widely available and it was completely amazing. I love Salvia. I guess I'm in the minority. Wow. You are in the minority. I hate Salvia. Yeah, a lot of people do. I don't know. Can you describe how Salvia affects you? You personally? It just depends on how it's administered and all these different variables. But generally there's this kind of bizarre dissociative effect where you sort of feel like you're being pushed backwards. There's strange, proprioceptive, gravitational effects where you feel like you're being stretched or tilting or falling through walls or barriers and repeating patterns that kind of parallel mirror effect, that sort of thing. But it's a weird experience. I guess it's not for everyone. No. And it's interesting. It's not. Well, Salvia was one of the... I have fallen into this trap two times with Salvia and MEO-DMT. Pure hubris punished by the gods. But I remember with Salvia going in the old days... I don't think it's even legal now is that they scheduled it, didn't they? It's legal in New York. It's not federally illegal, which is nice. Because it never became popular because nobody liked it. People liked it for YouTube videos. I mean, there's an entire genre of YouTube videos of people smoking Salvia, jumping out a window, smoking Salvia. I don't know if you've seen it. Of course, yeah. I think they're amazing. They're amazing, but to me, when you think about the mythology behind Salvia, do you know... I'm sure you're aware of the mythology behind Salvia. It's some kind of goddess spirit, right? That's what they say. It's the feeling that some people have, yeah. Or do they think that at least when it's used traditionally in Oaxaca, they think that it's a botanical embodiment of the Virgin Mary? Right. So Salvia is the Virgin Mary. And when you look at it through that lens, and imagine that the Virgin Mary is being summoned into these fucking apartments with like cat turds all over the floor, where a guy's like, take another hit! Take another hit! How do you feel, man? Punch him in the arm. Wake him up. It's sad, you know, because it seems like the drug is being used in absolutely the wrong way. And when I use Salvia, I remember going to this head shop and they had it, and the guy's like, no, this is like 50 times stronger than LSD. And I'm like, shut up. No fucking way. I bought it, took a hit, and it was just miserable. Exactly what you're talking about, tilting through space, some kind of spiraling vortex, a feeling of like insanity and death, followed by a relief that it's over. Horrible. I hate this stuff in Hamilton. I hate it. What could you compare to Salvia? What are other drugs that are, is Salvia in a family of drugs? It isn't. That's what's so remarkable about it is, you know, Salvia, when you look at the history of it, people had known about it since at least the 1950s, and no one could get any effect from it whatsoever. All of the anthropologists and botanists that went to study it weren't really able to characterize the effect, because the active chemical salvanor in A is chemically different from most other psychoactive drugs. It doesn't have what's called a basic nitrogen, so it was difficult to extract. No one knew what was responsible for the effect, and so a lot of people didn't even think it was active. It was a huge surprise when people discovered that it actually contained the most potent, naturally occurring psychedelic known to science in the 90s. Wow. I didn't realize it was, I always thought DMT was that. Oh, this is far, far more potent than DMT. Really? Absolutely, by weight. Yeah, the active dose of DMT is 40 to 50 milligram. Salvanor in A is fully active at half a milligram, so it's arguably 80 times stronger than DMT by weight. But again, even after they discovered the active chemical in Salvia, when they would screen it at different receptors associated with psychedelic activity, it didn't bind to any of them. So then there was a second mystery of what is it even doing, and it wasn't until they were able to screen it at a really large number of different receptors that they found that it bound to this subtype of opioid receptor called the Kappa Opioid Receptor, and that was a total curveball no one ever expected that a psychedelic... I expected that, you know, when I was on it, I was thinking to myself, oh, this is clearly something to do with the Kappa Opioid Receptor. Hamilton, how do you... This is going to sound... Well, you know what? Compared to you, I am a dumb person, so here comes a dumb person question. How do you remember all that, man? Like, where did you... To me, what's interesting about you is you're the psychonaut, but you're also the chemist. And in an interview that I read that you did, you were talking about how consumers... There's consumers of drugs and people who study drugs, and the more you consume the substance, quite often the less you know about the substance. And you seem to fall right in the middle there, where you have a very academic understanding. How long did you study chemistry for? How did you get to that place? Most... I mean, I did study it in college, but most of what I know about chemistry comes from working in a lab in Philadelphia with this chemist who's actually on the clip that's being queued up right there. But, you know, I've worked in this lab on and off for the last seven or eight years, and that's how I learned most of what I know about actual chemistry. But what I just described is in chemistry, that's just history. You can read that on Wikipedia. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, so I don't know. Just read it on Wikipedia. Do you think your experience of drugs is different from people who aren't aware of the way it's interacting with our neurochemistry? It's possible, yeah. I mean, I think a lot of people have subconscious biases against drugs. They think of drug use as something naughty or self-destructive, and when you have that feeling that it's a bad thing to be using drugs, I think that that's going to color the experience in some way. Even with mushrooms, people often say, oh, this is food poisoning. The psychedelic experience is a form of poisoning. And even when you think about it that way, it's not the case. It's a drug effect like any other. It's not food poisoning. It's not bacterial in origin. But if you're thinking about it that way, I feel that you're already setting yourself up to have a negative experience because you're thinking of it as something negative, a form of poisoning. Well, this is something I think about with mushrooms. Did they evolve? Why would a mushroom evolve so that it has psilocybin inside of it? What is the benefit for a fungus from an evolutionary perspective to have a psychoactive chemical inside of it? Is it an accident or is it a defense mechanism? And if it's a defense mechanism, then what a sad defense mechanism, right? He spent all this time coming up with a poison to keep the monkeys from eating you, and they're like, oh, this is great, man. I love it. Or do they want us to eat them? Is there some benefit? Well, that's a possibility that it acts as an attractant, that it's somehow advantageous for it to be consumed or when you touch it, it spreads the spores. But ultimately, people don't know. It's a great question. I think about it constantly, why this would be the case. You know, it's also very tempting to have this anthropocentric interpretation, because it has a drug effect in a human that must be why the mushroom is producing. But from the mushroom's perspective, it could have all sorts of other uses that have nothing to do with us. It could be preventing ultraviolet light from damaging the spores. Or the elves like it? The elves like it. With mushrooms in particular, psilocybin, it is a poison, though. When I take mushrooms, as opposed to, say, LSD, there's a body-heavy thing happening that feels like this isn't exactly what my body wants inside of it. Like, if I eat mushrooms, I'll have to shit. I don't know if that happens to you, but it upsets my stomach. And then you're doing the, like, portagion experience when you're tripping, which is like a Uranumous Bosch painting. I don't know if you guys have felt this before, but witnessing the spiraling, swirling breathing of a portagion with skulls and fractals spiraling into the shit in the fucking portagion. All right. To me, it feels like mushrooms in particular. Maybe they are somewhat poisonous. Well, even the word poison, it's sort of poison, drug, medicine, all these words don't really have exact meanings. It's certainly not more of a poison than LSD or anything else. And the reason that it has that effect is because you have serotonin receptors in your intestine. The original name of serotonin was enteramine because they thought it was exclusively in the intestine. All these receptors in your periphery that are activated by psychedelics as well. So it's not because it's having some kind of poisonous effect necessarily. It's because you have these receptors outside of your brain. I love that. No, that's a beautiful thing to think. I think that what you're talking about is, it goes very deep into our psyche because since, at least when I was a kid, I think things have shifted maybe a little bit. But I've been programmed from the moment I started watching TV to think that every single drug that isn't prescribed by a doctor is in some way or another evil. Like, this is the, I am a casualty of the war on drugs because no matter how much I would like to escape or evade or drop the conditioning every time I take LSD, every time I take MDMA, every time I take a psychoactive chemical there's still the kid from the Reagan era who was watching on Channel 13 the commercial where the egg gets broken in the pan. You know, this is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions? Remember? And I think that poisoned a lot of us and I don't know if there's any way to like separate myself from that because when I take drugs, even as much as I love them, as happy I am that they exist in the universe I still in some way or another feel that this is evil, right? That's conditioning. Do you feel like that? Are you able to escape into pure hedonism when you take these substances? I don't feel it's evil. I don't believe it's evil. But I've been programmed to think. We live in a puritanical society. People still believe that sobriety is a virtue and that drug use is a bad thing. And you know, when you look at the list of controlled substances, the government doesn't control dangerous drugs. It controls euphoric drugs. Cyanide is not a controlled substance. Strychnine is not a controlled substance. Tetrautotox and any of these ultra potent poisons, none of them are included. It's the euphorians. It's the drugs that make people feel good. That's what's being prohibited. Why? I don't know exactly. People are afraid of them. I don't know. There's complicated reasons. I mean, even if you take salvia, it's amazing tracing the prohibition of salvia in the United States. I don't know if you know the story. I don't. But there was this emo guy named Brett Shiddester who smoked salvia and then years later killed himself. And his mother was grieving and looking through his diary and found this entry from the previous year where he wrote something like, just smoked salvia tonight, learned that life is meaningless. It was fine. It was fine. Something like that. And then she thought, oh no, that's what is responsible. It was because he smoked salvia in the previous year that caused a spiral and depression. And I lost my darling Brett and went on a crusade to have salvia made illegal across the United States. And in some states, the prohibition of salvia is called Brett's law in his name. So what happened is you have one grieving mother who decides that this is a dangerous drug. You have a lot of politicians who don't care at all about salvia. In the slightest, they've never used it. They don't know what it is. They don't know that it has all sorts of potential therapeutic and scientific uses. All they know is that there's a grieving mother saying, make this illegal and maybe that they can gain some political traction by doing what she says. And so before you know it, it's a schedule one drug, the same schedule as heroin in half the United States. That's insane. That's absolutely insane. And I liked it. Your version of the story is, I guess, slightly more comforting than what appears to be happening, which is a concerted effort by people in power to control society's ability to access high utopian states of pleasure. That there seems to be someone at the top. I saw this interview with the Grateful Dead and one of the band members in talking about LSD said something that I think about all the time. He's like, they don't want us to go into that room, man. And I think about that a lot because it's like, oh, it does appear that way. Like, yeah, I guess it's a mother's fault, but it seems more like there's something bigger than that than just some individual doing that. Or some politicians are like, I don't know what salvia is. It feels like there's something behind the scenes. Oh, of course. What is that thing? Racism. Racism. Yeah, probably. You think that it's... Well, historically, yeah. It's been a great way to target various races and selectively prosecute people based on their drug of choice. This is the Nixon regime, right? This is the idea of like, let's make marijuana illegal because we can't target... Let's target the sacrament because we can't target the movement. That's what you're saying. Yeah. And by prohibiting drugs, you give yourself access to an enormous number of people. You can lock up almost anyone you want. You can plan drugs on them. It's a very convenient way to control people. That is so fucking sinister, man, to think that. Right at this point, this is where I get lost because to imagine who would think that? Who would, like, in a meeting somewhere, sitting down? Who would formulate that plan? Like, you know what? Let's just make these incredibly healing, beautiful molecules illegal so that we can begin to throw people into dungeons whenever we want. For those words or some version of those words to come out of a human being's mouth and for the person to hear themselves saying it and not want to put a gun in their mouths implies that there's some different species that we're living under the control of. How could a real human being actually implement that plan? Power control. And also because they, you know, they maybe convince themselves that it's truly the case. It's still happening today. Now, you know, we look at the history of cannabis prohibition and it looks insane. We think, how did this ever happen? But there were times in the past where it wasn't approved of in the same way that it is now by the public and it didn't seem like such a bad idea. And we're repeating the same mistakes now. Everyone seems to agree that cannabis is okay to use in most cities. But synthetic cannabinoids are a different issue. Everyone hates synthetic cannabinoids. They're eager to control them. They want them all prohibited. And maybe 50 years down the line we'll be saying the same thing about the synthetic cannabinoids. What were we thinking? Why did we think that it was necessary to prohibit all of those compounds just because there were some media reports and a few people had problems with them? Do you think, do you consider Hamilton's Pharmacopia to be a form of activism? I mean, there's definitely an ideology that I'm promoting. There's something that I'm trying to communicate. Yeah. What is that? What are you trying to communicate? I guess in its simplest form to value drugs and to think about them critically and not take them for granted. Because I think that, you know, we get so caught up on, like, are they good? Are they bad? Are they addictive? Am I addicted? Is it toxic? Is it right? Is it wrong? Will it benefit me that people don't even stop to appreciate how amazing it is that it's even possible? Like, I can't see any evolutionary reason that human beings have to be able to have a psychedelic experience. Just the fact that that's even consciously a possibility is utterly amazing. Right. Yeah, you're right. I mean, this is actually, you know, like for example when Wiley's talking about the dolphin telepathy. And in other moments, as I've been watching, I get the feeling that you're something of a skeptic. Like you clearly connect with the potency of what these psychoactive chemicals can do for a person. And I think you are underplaying how much you're putting yourself at risk from doing this show. You say that you're not in danger at all, but I wonder if you're just telling yourself that because you don't want to acknowledge the danger that you're putting yourself in. For example, right now, politically, we're witnessing how fragile the political system is and how things can change so quickly that a person with a show like this could be breaking laws that haven't been put into place yet. You know, you're putting yourself, you know, I kind of hate it when people say this to me. They're like, you know, you're on a list, right, man? You're on a list. But Hamilton. You're on a list, motherfucker. You are on every list. You're on every list. And I'm sorry to laugh about it. I've got a quote here from, let me find it, from one of your friends. I hope it wrote it down. Sorry, I can't remember his name. He's the LSD chemist that you're friends with. Casey Hardison. Yes. And in this beautiful quote, you're a burning man this year. And in this beautiful interview with him, and he seems just like an incredible human being, he said, most people who take psychedelics don't think of the chemist who risked their liberty to produce them. And I wonder if people who watch your show are thinking the same thing about you, that you're risking your own liberty by putting a show like this on. Do you feel like that, man? You really are putting your ass on the line here, man. Maybe. I mean, sometimes someone will contact you and say, oh, you know, you're just trying to get high. This is just about getting high. And when people say something like that, I can assure everyone this is the absolute worst way to get high. Making these documentaries about drugs publicly is a really, really bad way to get high. It's just the most expensive, worst way. And I am probably putting myself in some degree of danger, but the people that I really believe are putting themselves at risk are the chemists. They're the people that appear on the show. Because ultimately, as a journalist, I do have a legal justification to be doing all of these things. If I'm at a clandestine Kweilud lab and the police in South Africa show up, I can walk home. I can get on my flight back to Brooklyn if... Wait, let's think about what you just said. If I'm at a clandestine Kweilud lab... Okay, where were you? Where was it? In South Africa. South Africa. So, like, the South African police go rolling into a clandestine Kweilud lab. And they see this guy is like, no, no, no, I'm a journalist. They're like, shh, shh, shh, sit down, bitch! You're going to jail! Like... I don't know. I mean, luckily it didn't happen. I think I would... Maybe I would go to jail, but I think I would get out quickly. Because ultimately it's not illegal to be a journalist and witness something that is illegal. But there's no question that the chemists who were manufacturing the Kweilud on camera definitely would go to prison for what they were doing. They were the ones that were taking the true risk. So I just don't want to overestimate my risk and underestimate the risk of the people that trusted me enough to participate in these documentaries. Well, I think that's another thing that comes across in this show, is that you love these chemists. And that you, whether it's the PCP chemist Flaca, who was showing you the secret recipe for making PCP, which I think I could pull up here, or whether it's... What's his name? Who lived in the volcano? Daryl LaMaire. How many people here have seen the show? If you haven't, you have to go home and watch this. But one thing that comes across is that you have this profound respect for these people. Something I was wondering is, and maybe this is a terrible question, but which do you love more? The psychoactive chemical and its effect on the human nervous system? Or the synthesis of the chemical? Because it seems like you're almost more infatuated with the chemical process that goes into making these things than the effect of the things themselves. I am, yeah. Wow, that's so fascinating. But it's almost like the high itself seems like a secondary consideration to what these people are going through to produce the substance. Yeah, I mean, I think it's fascinating because there's so much uncertainty in science. Sometimes when I'm working on this, some executive advice will watch it and say, like, oh, it's good, but can you scientifically explain why it is that when somebody smokes PCP, they strip nude and punch a hole through a wooden fence? And you can't really give a satisfying explanation to that question. There's a lot that's known in terms of molecular neuropharmacology. People know a lot about how the drug binds to a receptor in the brain, and they know a lot about the qualitative behavioral effects of a drug, but connecting the two between the molecular level and the behavioral level has been very difficult, and ultimately it's not something that people can explain in a satisfying way at this point. Thank God, right? Thank God. Because you don't want them to know that. Like, that's a bad thing for them to know. Like, the moment the government figures out how to make people strip their clothes off and punch holes in fucking walls, that's a new bomb. Like, that's a new, definitely that's a new thing that a Trump drone is going to dispense over some protest. You know, that's going to happen. Do you feel a little nervous right now as a journalist seeing what's going down politically, this like fascinating war that's happening between our government and the press? Do you feel a little nervous about what could happen? Well, of course, yeah. I think any thinking person is profoundly uncomfortable with what's happening right now. But in terms of drugs specifically, that hasn't been an emphasis of Trump's, he's mentioned it, he mentioned it during the inauguration speech, he mentioned it when he was campaigning. During the inauguration speech, he said they're cheaper than candy bars. Yeah. Is that true? But you've got to be nervous. I mean, like, when I see what's going down, I'll tell you, and I don't mean to keep ringing the paranoia bell here, man, but one of the things, what's that? Yeah, it's making me paranoid even thinking about it. Listen, I'm sorry, I'll pull you out of it in a second. Okay. Because we're all going to die, it doesn't matter, man. But one of the things that has made me feel incredibly careful about talking about these substances, even though I guess I'm not being careful right now, is that when I did an interview at Singularity University on this whiteboard, they were talking about how the potential exists thanks to technology for people to be breaking laws right now that don't exist yet. And that in the future, you know, we can all end up getting, like, arrested. Like, when what you're saying, the idea is, let's prohibit a substance that is, nothing's wrong with it at all, a substance that is actually pro-life, that someone who is healthy and was into existence itself would want this substance, a substance that you'd probably want to, like, teach your kids to use, something that's, like, jogging. You know, and that's what I think of as LSD. LSD to me is that thing. It's a healthy, powerful, life-affirming, positive, beautiful chemical that has the potential to transform society in a way that could really create a lot of beautiful effects that have already happened to some degree, but if it wasn't prohibited, then God knows what could actually happen in society, you know. But these substances are, when you think about the fact that there is the potential for even mentioning these things in the future to land you in a dungeon, right, then you have to be very careful, you know. It just seems like you're putting yourself, your ass on the line. Sorry to go back to that again. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, ultimately, I think this is, like, a bad way to think about it. And maybe another point of my show is to try to dilute that kind of thinking a little bit. It's like, oh, don't talk about it publicly, you'll be on a list, you're going to end up in prison. Because the truth of the matter is that all this is vetted by the legal team advice, none of it's illegal. I haven't broken any laws, and I love talking about it. I think it's fascinating. I am free to talk about it, and if everyone is afraid that they're going to be locked up in some dungeon in the future because they spoke their true feelings about something that's benefited them, then you're already punished. Beautiful. Ah, God. Run for president! How did you connect with Vice in the beginning? Like, how did this come into existence at all? Well, when I started, it was a very different company. It was, you know, 2007 or 2008, and it was small. It was easy. I walked to the office, and the editor-in-chief was a friend of a friend, and met him and told him that I'd been hanging out with these Hasidic Jews who were transitioning into secular life and using a lot of psychedelics to help the transition, and he was interested, and I wrote an article, and then I wrote for the magazine, which was a thing then, and then they started making videos, and I did that. They asked me to make videos. It's kind of a boring story. All right. I don't know. Hasidic Jews transitioning with drugs is pretty cool. Your idea of boring is probably way different than most people's ideas of boring, man. When you've been in a fucking laboratory underneath a volcano, I guess nothing's going to be quite as exciting as that, but are there any, since you are on the cutting edge of psychoactive drugs, are there any new drugs that maybe we don't know about right now? What should we look into, Mr. Morris? Well, there's so many. I think that's a thing that people don't appreciate, is that there are literally tens of thousands of drugs, and I guarantee that there will be new types of drugs that are discovered in the future that are completely different than anything that's currently known. That was the case for Salvia, pretty much. There was a little bit of research in the 50s where they were looking at these Kappa opioid receptor agonists as potential morphine type drugs, and they noticed that everyone that took them would have these bizarre hallucinations, so they just thought, okay, this is not a viable way to treat pain, because too many people are thinking that their bed is a train, or their hands are made of dogs. I'm on the pain train, man. But again, to go back to the question, if I was a person who wanted to try a new psychedelic that I hadn't tried yet, what would be a psychedelic that you could recommend? One of the interesting ramifications of prohibition is that every time a drug is controlled, new drugs hit the market to take the place of that controlled substance. So prohibition has actually catalyzed the sale and availability of an almost unfathomably large number of new drugs that no one would be using if it weren't for prohibition. All these synthetic cannabinoids, the vast majority of people using them, are only using them because they're cheap, or because cannabis isn't legal, or because their urine is being tested by their employer, or they're on parole, or whatever. So there's an unlimited number of new things, new psychedelics, that's happening all the time. Name one or two? Yeah, man, why are you holding out on us, brother? We want to know about a couple. You're like, there's over 30,000 beautiful new drugs. They induce orgasms, they make you see angels, they make you talk to your ancestors, you can levitate. Next question. What's just like, let's say tonight, if you wanted to do a brand new substance, what's on the... If it's brand new, you don't even know if it's good or not, you don't know anything about it. Okay, here's an example, there's a new drug that's appearing on the market called NDTDI. It's structurally really interesting, it's kind of like a hybrid between a tryptamine like DMT and an Ergoline like LSD. Wow, that sounds incredible. But it hasn't been tested by humans yet. It's new. Hold on, wait, what mailing list are you on, man? Humans aren't even taking it? Where did you hear about it? These things are available from great market vendors in China. It's a whole huge industry, making these derivatives of MDMA, making derivatives of masculine, derivatives of DMT and selling them on the internet. And talking about these things publicly is a little bit weird because people will actually try things. I wrote an article a little while ago about, as chemist Alexander Shulgin had speculated, that there could be a marine psychedelic that was produced by certain sponge species. And no one had ever tried it. And so I wrote an article about the synthesis and qualitative effects of this drug. It was the only psychedelic that has been isolated from the ocean and only the ocean, the only known marine psychedelic. And it was kind of just answering a small little psychedelic mystery that had interested me for a long time. And then someone starts selling this drug on the internet and suddenly there's reports on Reddit of people saying like, oh yeah, there's five bromo DMT, the CDMT stuff. It's really great when I mix it with my weed, but what's like... I get it. I get it. So yeah, you feel a little bit of responsibility. There is a responsibility because I don't know about NDTDI. I don't know about the toxicity of five bromo DMT. I get it. Yeah, that's it. And that would be a heavy burden to like announce something like that and then find out like somebody chewed off their foot in a bathtub because of it. So yeah, I get it. Yeah, you got to be very careful. All right, cool. Let me just write that down. I'm NDTII. In an interview with you, somebody asked you the classic question. I want to re-ask you the question just to see if maybe your mind has changed on it or if you've had any new revelations about it. So I smoked DMT and I have the experience and I think to myself my mind couldn't produce this. I have come into contact with a higher intelligence. A lot of people who sacramentally take these substances and on your show, you've come in contact with them a lot. They report their experience is mystical. They feel as though they're shamans. They feel as though they're not making LSD for profit. They're making LSD for transformation and they feel as though some, it feels as though they've come into contact with the divine. Do you feel that psychedelics connect us with a higher intelligence or do you think this is a purely endogenous process that has nothing to do with some external force? I think it's a purely endogenous process and I think it's all the more amazing for that reason. I mean, give your mind some credit. Right. This is something that is happening in your brain as a result of your consciousness, your memories, your life. The DMT molecule contains no memories. It contains no information. It produces different effects for different people. It's a completely internal experience and I don't think that diminishes it in any way. I think it makes it that much more amazing that it's possible that people still don't understand how it happens, why it produces this sort of effect. Yeah, no. This is like the Carl Sagan perspective. It's like, why do you need some extra thing? It's already a beautiful thing that the planet spit out life at all and then that life evolved to the point where it could have an interaction with chemicals in such a way as to achieve these transcendent states. And yet, in these transcendent states, for me and for other people I know have entered into them, it's not as though there is an ambivalence here. It's in that state. There seems to be some kind of direct communication. It's not as though my mind is saying to me, hey, this is your mind talking to you, Duncan. Hi, I'm the universe. I'm everything. And I'm going to have a little conversation with you for the next six hours. And it's going to suck. But whenever the universe comes to talk, you're like, no, please get anyone else. But it doesn't feel endogenous, Hamilton. For me, it feels like I can accept, all right, this is just your brain. This is just your brain outputting this some deeper part of it. But it just doesn't feel like that for me and for a lot of us. And I don't think you're saying this as though you know for certain. But how can you be sure that it's just your mind? How can you be certain that there isn't some communion happening when the history of shamanism, the history of taking these chemicals is one that has within it a built-in mythology that involves connection with entities or higher consciousness? I just don't think it has any explanatory value, ultimately. I don't think that it solves the mystery in any meaningful way to say that entities are supplying you with information. Then what are these entities? Why does this molecule only expose you to these entities? And why isn't it there all the time? If anything, it makes things more complicated. It seems like a really inelegant way to solve what is maybe the most important scientific question in the world. Or the most important question in the world. And that question is, are we alone? That's the question. And we're trying to answer that question. We're answering it with our telescopes. I think we are. We're trying to answer it. We're trying to answer it with our radio telescopes. We're trying to answer it. And it's a question that people have been speculating about for a very long time. And many people have returned an answer which is as complicated as it makes things. Why does it dial us in to a specific frequency of intelligence? Well, I don't know. It's like a phone number, man. DMT is curious to me. It's specifically DMT. Because when I take LSD, I can emit projection. I'm totally comfortable with projection on LSD. I'm seeing some projection of something inside of me. And what I'm seeing on LSD is usually different than other people on acid. I mean, there's a wavering breathing quality, a fractal quality, but it definitely feels like subconscious elements of myself are being revealed to me. And the universe is the screen they're being projected on. But with DMT, what's fascinating about it is how so many people have the same experience. They report the same kinds of entities. The same kind of place that it takes you to. The implication to me being this is not something inside of us. It's allowing you to see a thing that's always here, but maybe isn't necessarily within us. Any more than anything outside of us is within us. Yeah, I don't know. God damn it, Hamilton! Not the way it is. Except Jesus Christ as your savior! Ultimately, it's however you want to construct meaning, solve the mystery, however you want to do it. It's up to people to decide. It's like any other mystical thinking. If you want to believe in God, everyone is welcome to do that. If they want to, it doesn't have much explanatory value for me, so I avoid it. And I think that humans have a tendency to fill in the cracks between their understanding with mystical thinking, instead of accepting ambiguity and mystery, which is very uncomfortable. People want answers. That's why people like shamanism, I think, is they want someone to say, you're vomiting because you're expelling toxins, negative memories, negativity from your body, you're cleansing yourself as opposed to the truth, which is you're vomiting because of serotonin receptors in your intestine, and who knows what you ate earlier, and maybe there's no answer for why you're vomiting. Maybe you just have to accept the mystery of the origin of your vomiting, and no one will ever explain it. You would be a fun person to take psychedelics with, but you would not be a good shaman, Hamilton. But you would be such a wonderful person, because you know what, we need both, I think. We need both. When I'm tripping out, it would be nice to have a Hamilton with me, and it would be nice to have some kind of deep shaman with me, so that the shaman could say, yeah, that's your darkness, you're vomiting your darkness, because that lens is particularly beneficial. Whether or not it has some quantifiable truth to it, it doesn't matter. If I'm vomiting and someone says to me, that's your darkness, let it out, then it opens up a lot of room for healing. But then maybe as I'm puking and someone says, that's your darkness, you need to get it out, I might be like, shut up, shut up, hippie, that's not, I don't feel good, Hamilton, what is this? It's just your fucking serotonin receptors, man. Don't worry, so it's beautiful. But even that's limited. It's not as if you have this one little scientific explanation and that suddenly solves a mystery. There's a site, the 5-HT2A receptor, that most classical psychedelics bind to, but it's not as if that explains it. Knowing that they bind to this receptor doesn't explain anything, and then you go deeper as science evolves, then you learn that there's functional activity at the receptor. There's an agonist, an antagonist, a silent agonist, an inverse agonist, what is it doing? And then there's a second, and then you go further, what's the second messenger, what's the downstream effect, what systems are being activated, and the mystery keeps getting deeper. But I think the advantage of looking at these things scientifically is ultimately you are answering questions, even if you're not answering the grand question, you're answering small questions, and as you answer all these small questions over the years, you're chipping away at consciousness, you're chipping away at an understanding of how the brain works, and that's a worthwhile pursuit. Harold and Morris, everybody, let it hear it! Beautiful. Thank you so much. All right. Well, we've come to the part of the show where we take questions, so there's a microphone somewhere up there. Anybody who has a question, please come up and feel free to ask away. Hello. Hello. Hi, my name is Bob. I was just curious, this doesn't really relate to anything that you guys have been talking about tonight, but do you have any idea why the government is aiming their sites on CBD and CBD oil and why they're trying to take it away from us? Yeah, that's an interesting question. I don't actually have a great answer. There truly is no rhyme or reason to a lot of this, and, you know, a few years ago, the DEA placed a drug called 2CN in Schedule 1. Has anyone here heard of 2CN? No one has heard of it, because no one used it. It was never a drug. What is it? Yeah, 2CI and 2CBR drugs people have heard of that people used, and those are also illegal now. But 2CN was just a random drug that Alexander Shulgin synthesized, and they kind of just threw it in. Why not make it illegal? No one's going to stand up for 2CN, throw it in Schedule 1, and that is where it sits, and that's where it will be until people really thoroughly deconstruct all the controlled substances, because, of course, there's people standing up for CBD and cannabis, but the truth is that the list of controlled substances is ridiculously long. It's more drugs than any pharmacologist would know off the top of their head. It's literally close to 300 different substances. So why CBD? Because they could. Also, when you consider, I mean, again, to think of it in this way, you have to believe there is some cobble of people making these sinister decisions purely for the sake of profit, but every time you make a substance illegal, every time you schedule a substance, you immediately open up a pathway for revenue to flow into specific industries. So you make CBD illegal, and now you have another reason to put someone in a for-profit prison. You're making money for lawyers. You're making money for the cops who, in whichever states, allow confiscation of a person's money or vehicle. So it opens up just more and more avenues for the state to make money. There's a clear benefit for the state to schedule substances. There's an undeniable monetary benefit for scheduling substances, and a lot of people do say, just follow the money. Like, who's profiting from this? Who profits from CBD being illegal? CBD, an anti-inflammatory substance that can help with nausea, a substance that helps with insomnia, a substance that is amazing. Who benefits from that? Lots of people benefit from that, not being accessible. Who wants to take a fucking ambient? Who wants to, like, come to you on a plane jerking off into a bag of Doritos? Nobody! Who's gonna, like, pick that over, like, CBD. Like, a nice, gentle sleep versus a potentially psychosis-inducing amnesic doom drug spit out by a corporation. You know, so if you look at it from that perspective, there could be some nefarious plot involving lobbyists who are well aware of the profit that comes from scheduling certain substances. Yeah, thank you so much for answering my question. But the point that I wanted to bring up is that, in my opinion, it seems like that the pharmaceutical companies want to kind of control CBD as a substance, make it illegal, and then offer them, offer CBD as a drug that you need to get a prescription to, and that seems like just fucking, just evil as fuck. Yeah. And it's just bizarre to me that, yeah. Anyway, so thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hi. My name is Stephanie. Thank you for the show. You're amazing. Thanks. I'm curious about microdosing. What's your opinion? Also, dosages, specifically psilocybin and LSD. Great. Yeah, it's amazing what a craze microdosing has become. It's become the thing that I'm asked about more than anything. Every single day when I wake up, I have emails about microdosing, and I would have never expected that the way to get everybody interested in psychedelics was to make them not psychedelic. But it's a very compelling idea that you could use a psychedelic in a way that's interchangeable with caffeine or something like that. Ultimately, it hasn't been studied in any meaningful way, and it's just sort of being passed around different news outlets as a novel idea. Silicon Valley. Exactly. Yeah, and it's a very attractive idea. I don't know why, but it depends on all these different psychedelics have different pharmacologies. LSD has more of a stimulating dopaminergic effect than psilocin and psilocybin, so maybe it's better suited to that sort of thing. Ultimately, most people don't have access to the pure chemicals to begin with, so it becomes very difficult to gauge the dose unless you're working with pure crystal LSD, and then you can volumetrically measure the dose, or if you have an incredibly sensitive scale, you could use that. But it's tricky. It's tricky when you're working with a black market commodity, and you don't know how much you're consuming, and you don't know the purity. And because they're microdosing, there's no real definition for it. Different people are using different doses of different chemicals. It probably comes down to what works for you. Well, I love it. It's great. If you happen to find the problem with it is just what you're saying. It's like, how do you know if you're going to microdose, then you have to have some idea of what you're taking a fractional quantity of. So that is a problem, which means that you would have to... Fortunately, and this is a ridiculous idea that popped into my head, but I was thinking if anything has benefited for profit LSD chemists, it's got to be the new microdosing craze, because they can now sell microdoses, which they do, of LSD for the same amount as a regular dose of LSD, and just exponentially increase their profit from it. So I kept thinking, fuck, is this some nefarious plot? Did some genius LSD chemist just write a blog post for the Huffington Post? Just take smaller amounts, it's great. But it is fantastic. I have tried Adderall, I've tried various ADD medications, and I've microdosed LSD, and microdosing LSD seems so much better and yet somewhat similar to a lot of these ADD medications. It seems to have a very similar effect, at least subjectively for me. So try it out, just give it a shot. You'll love it. Thank you. Maybe it's just one cautionary thing. I feel a little weird about saying this because I don't want to scare anyone, but a lot of psychedelics do have affinity for what's called the 5-HT2B receptor, which is known to cause some heart problems, and there have been studies done in rodents where repeated low-dose administration of psilocin causes abnormalities in the heart valve. So it seems like, I just would hate if everyone gets wrapped up in this weird idea and then suddenly it has a negative effect and makes psychedelics look bad in the long run. So be careful would be my other piece of advice. Be careful, he's right too. Yeah, be careful, be responsible. Don't be the fucking, don't get some law named after you, please. Hey guys, thanks again for the podcast, it was awesome. Cool, glad you enjoyed it. So my question is actually because both of you guys are creatives, you guys both write, I know you do your comedy and you record and stuff like that. How do you guys go about your work week? What pushes you? How do you break things? Do you plan in the beginning of the week? How do you go about it? Well at the moment I'm working in an office, so I kind of have to show up and work. Yeah, to make this TV show because I just started making the second season of the show and yeah, so I have no choice but to work. And there's lots of people that would get really angry at me if I didn't show up, so that's fear and necessity or... Here, cool. Is the shit... Is it planned for you or do you plan to do the show about around the week? It depends. It's kind of planned by me because I write these episodes and create them, but then there's a showrunner who forces me to actually complete tasks. Do you script the whole thing yourself? Yeah. Holy shit, do you write the songs? I did for the final episode, yeah. Wow, cool. Falling in love with you, Hamilton. I'm not as disciplined as this man. I have stand-up spots at night, so at night I go to do comedy. Since I've been in New York, I've been doing it a lot, so I'll go and do stand-up comedy at night. And in the day, I will either have a pot, I'll interview someone for a podcast, or more likely I will have to sit down and try to record like an intro for a podcast. So that's how it works for me, is I'll wake up and then sit in front of a microphone, drink coffee, and ramble, and feel crazy, and wonder how this is my job, and then upload the thing to the internet, and then go and do stand-up comedy at night. And then somewhere in there, I'll try to work on jokes. And then also, I'm learning to play piano right now, and I'm trying to learn how to like... You know, one thing Alex and Allison Gray said to me. Are you a creative person? Yeah, editing stuff like that film. So one thing Alex and Allison Gray said to me that's always stuck with me is they said, take what's working and make it bigger. So whatever is in your life that's like working out for you, see how you can amplify it. And so for me, that means like, okay, well with the podcast, how can I make it more intricate in its production? Can I like learn to make music? Is there a way to like make... Like what you're doing, man, at some point you're like, I'm gonna make a fucking song about some of these chemists and record it and put it on my show. And I think that's a really brave thing to do in the same way. That's what I'm... I've just gotten obsessed with like Ableton Live and like Synthesizers. And so my idea is to try to incorporate that into the podcast. So that's what I do. Awesome, thank you very much guys, appreciate it. Thanks for the question. Thank you guys for the podcast again. Thanks. So do you think Trump should take psychedelic drugs? Great question. It's an interesting idea. I mean, it's an old idea. You know, if people were to put LSD in the water supply, then there would be no war. Everyone would love each other. We live in a utopian society. I certainly wish that were the case. I have a feeling it wouldn't be the case because there are many bad people that have used psychedelics. Obviously Charles Manson and many, many others. Psychedelics aren't some kind of magic bullet that make every narcissist or psychopath good. In fact, they're extremely unpredictable, which has been the main barrier toward using them as weapons and using them medicinally. It's hard to know exactly what they'll do. That's what makes them so valuable. So do I think Trump should take a psychedelic? I would love it if he did. It would be interesting. So yes, I guess it's a short answer. Right on. I think that the question is interesting because it implies that you think he hasn't taken a psychedelic. And I would bet a lot of money on the fact that Trump has done plenty of drugs. Really? Yeah, sure. For sure. He's like, hell yeah. He doesn't even drink. His brother died of cirrhosis. I know that he says he doesn't drink, but he says he doesn't do a lot of stuff. I just think that, you know, I think he's done, there's a lot of things I think Trump has done. A lot of things that you'll never hear about. And I think drugs are the least interesting of the crazy shit that guy has done. Like that guy, I would bet $10,000 that that man has been fisted. I would bet $10,000 that by the fucking barbed glove of some hardcore New York dominatrix just comes to Trump Tower once a month and just fucking Mike Tyson's his asshole. Bam! Bam! Probably while he's snorting DMT or so. I bet the disappointing thing, we all think the idea is like the bomb is the psychedelic. Just like what you're saying, that's the dream. Oh yes, we'll drop the dust on ISIS and they will inhale it and realize that death is wrong. I know so many people in what some people call the psychedelic satsang, people who are in the psychedelic community, who have severely inflamed egos. Like the idea that there's some kind of ego diminishment that happens through psychedelics. I can remember being at like a screening of God, what's the name of it? Do you know this show about Tim Leary and Ram Dass, what was that called? It was a great show about there like, anyway, I went to the screening of the, what's it called? Dying to Know. Dying to Know. I went to the screening of that and at the end of it, some psychedelic person stood up and yelled out, I have the truth that comes from LSD, talk to me after the show. So that psychedelics can create that state of consciousness too, where you know this is the right way. So I think Trump takes a psychedelic and like you're saying, it could be interesting. In the same way that like getting annihilated in some blast of radioactivity could be interesting, but I don't think it would necessarily be a good thing. But maybe MDMA, I don't know. Thank you. What's that? Or ayahuasca. Yeah, but what if he drinks ayahuasca and in the ayahuasca state, the spirits come to him and they're like, you're amazing. You're the best president there ever was. North Korea sucks. You should bomb them, Donald. You know? You never know. That's the problem. I think that would happen. And again, I think that's why this is an internal experience. If there really were some benevolent elves or entities, then they would be more reliable because these elf entities would always want people to do the right thing. What? Why would they always want someone to do the right thing? This is one of my favorite Ramdas quotes, which is, just because a thing doesn't have a body doesn't mean you should trust it. Not a mic drop moment. Great. Hey, what's up, guys? My name is Rob. Hi, Rob. I guess this question is for Hamilton. So you've experimented a lot with psychedelics and you seem like a really skeptical, rational person. And that's fine. It's a good way to be. But have you ever had an experience that made you question, like, obviously psychedelics made you question the reality. But what I want to say is like, have you had a moment like, fuck, maybe I'll... I haven't. No? Cool. I wish I could say that I had. Yeah, yeah. Because it would sound, it would make me sound less crazy maybe, because it would seem like I'm weighing both sides of the issue. But I am a hardened materialist. You know, I love science. I have a really profound love for science. And I think it's the best tool we have for understanding these states. And I've never felt that mysticism was necessary to explain things. Okay. Yeah. You know what it is? I've been listening a lot to Jordan Peterson recently. And he really, like, he talks about how, you know, science is only like 300, 400 years old. And mankind, we evolved to function in this play, to view meaning in a different way than, you know... differently from my scientific method, you know what I mean? So what I'm saying is, like, man finds meaning in, like, symbols and stories. And, like, I feel like a lot of times when you go on these trips to psychedelic, you have these powerful experiences. And you experience these, like, I don't know. You experience these, like, these, like, it's almost mythological stories when you go through this trip. And you come back with something powerful and you can share with people and tell people these stories when you go on the trip. I don't think science excludes that. I don't think that it's not as if a scientist doesn't have an awe-inspiring experience or someone that believes in... doesn't interpret it mystically, doesn't have an amazing and beneficial experience. They still have visions. They still, you know, think about their memories and everything else. It's not, it's just, there isn't this need to assume that it's happening through some force other than the brain. I think the brain is really, really amazing. I think it's, you know, just about the most amazing thing that exists. So why wouldn't I use that to interpret these things? I just don't see any lack of complexity in the brain, like it's not enough. Awesome. Thank you for your... Okay. Hello. Hi. Hey, thank you guys for everything. You're awesome. My question is, the gentleman up there said something very interesting. Hamilton. Yes, well, all of you guys. But including the bearded gentleman. Oh, up here. Oh, okay. Sorry. Yes. Was that he saw a hologram of information data on a little sand dollar, right? And that's how the dolphin can communicate to him. It's like, oh crap, I picked up what you were, you know, putting on that sand dollar. That kind of aligns with these theories in the holographic universe. I'm not sure if you guys have heard of it. Interesting piece of physics that says everything in the universe is like unfolding and unfolding and stuff like that. And basically, everything is a hologram. Our consciousness, the universe, everything's a hologram. We're all just not really seeing the big picture, you know, the park. Yeah. Have you heard of that? Like, what do you think of it? Do you think maybe he kind of was thinking that or tapped into that thinking somehow? I have heard of it. I think what he was thinking about is that there was like some kind of pop science interest in the 70s and 80s and the possibility that dolphins could communicate visual images with sound in the same way that they perceived their environment with sonar. They could then, so for example, if there were a person like Timothy Wiley in front of the dolphin and the dolphin saw Timothy Wiley and it projected sonar on it and then was able to visually interpret him from that information, it could then make that same sound and communicate an image to another dolphin of what Timothy Wiley looked like based on, you know, the reflection of the sound waves that they can very accurately mimic. So that was an idea. Carl Sagan wrote about it a little bit. As far as I know, no one has followed up on it in a meaningful way since it was a thing people were speculating about in the 80s. But so that's what I believe inspired his idea. But in terms of like a whole, like sand dollars being holographic, like a two-dimensional thing that, or three-dimensional information on a two-dimensional surface, I don't know about that. There's a difference between me and you, Hamilton, because when you're like, I don't know, I was like, I know exactly what he means, man. I know exactly what he's talking about. But I think it's funny that in the 60s, at some point dolphins must have been like, damn, the monkeys are getting high, man. What's happening? Like, all these high monkeys keep swimming at us. Like, why are they? Just avoid the high monkeys. They'll try to fuck you. Yeah, so I think there's something, honestly, I don't know, man. This is why you would not get Nicole, and I would. Like, if somebody like that, with that beautiful white beard and those sunglasses, got me, like, if I snorted PCP with that guy in like 15 minutes, I'd be like, take my money, sir, I believe you. My system's good. That's what I'm saying. But also, you miss out a little bit. I think that there's a, who knows? I don't know. Maybe they, you know what? I'll tell you this. The next time I go snorkeling, I'm going to look at shells in a totally different way. Like, fuck, that could be a dolphin tweet. Thank you. Thank you guys so much. Hi, Duncan. Hi, Hamilton. I've been reading a lot recently from the harm reduction community about purporting the positive effects of psychedelics on opioid use and opioid abuse. And however, I do feel like I'm kind of in a bubble in terms of just living in New York City and being, practicing with like more liberal physicians. So I'm just wondering, number one, how widespread is this kind of like harm reduction movement across the country? And also, like, what can just the average citizen do to support like these kind of therapies without looking just like kind of a, I don't know, crazy? The therapy specifically you could donate to MAPS or the Hefter Research Institute or the Beckley Foundation or any number of different foundations that are working to research psychedelics and use them therapeutically, you know, depending on what you do. And also, start a website, teach a class. I don't know, it just depends on what your strengths are. But in terms of how widespread harm reduction is, I think the internet has been the major tool in spreading harm reduction information. And that's something that's been happening since the 90s with Aeroid. So widespread, I think. Thank you. Hi. Thanks, guys. You've talked a lot about the mystic and metaphysical aspects of psychedelics, but I want to touch on a certain aspect of that and ceremony. As you've seen different cultures use psychedelics, what do you think the benefits or maybe the negative aspects of ceremony are? Because it seems like one thing that ceremony really does is help to bring the individual into a grounded sense of intent and maybe some sort of responsibility with the experience. And what about that is important for us as a Western society that's really starting to use these drugs in a totally new way and we have this opportunity to learn from what people have done in the past and implement it in new ways. What do you think we can learn or what do you think we can avoid from these type of ceremonies that cultures have used for thousands and thousands of years? Yeah, I mean, there's no question that our culture has gone about this in the absolute worst possible way. You know, we decided that the reasonable thing to do is to take people that sell or possess psychedelics and lock them in cages and it clearly doesn't work. So any culture that's figured out a way to use them beneficially, it's worth looking at what they're doing and studying it because not only do they not destroy people's lives for possessing and selling them, they actually heal people within their belief system with these substances and there's so many different variations depending on the shaman, depending on where you are. The music is a common theme in these ceremonies, the chanting, often there's someone who's watching over people who is very experienced with the drug and knows its duration, knows the potency of the plants that they're working with and those are two simple but very important things. Yeah, great, thank you. Thank you. Duncan? Yes. Thank you so much for this. It was amazing. Thanks for coming. My, I guess my main question and we've touched on it a little bit is, I mean, I know, Duncan, you support maps in Symposium. That's where I saw you before here in New York. And Hamilton, I guess my question for you is, you talked a little bit about the legality and your action in this, but what is your opinion on their work that they're doing and I guess some of these drugs that you know about that are more experimental versus kind of LSD, psilocybin, some more use. I think all this new research that's coming out right now is great. But, you know, ultimately my scientific hero is Alexander Shulgin. I'm very interested in the chemistry. I'm very interested in new drugs and how humans respond to them. And a lot of the clinical work that's being done right now is very basic. It's very safe work in a sense because it's, the stakes are so high, nobody wants to do something very risky. When you look at, you know, the Roland Griffiths work at Johns Hopkins, it got a huge amount of press. But the conclusion of that first clinical study was essentially that psilocybin is psychedelic. They concluded. And it's not necessarily a mind-blowing revelation, but that's the kind of work that has to be done, just this very basic work at the moment to figure out, you know, does it help people with OCD? What are the therapeutic properties? The more accepted therapeutic effects that people can find for these substances, the easier it is to argue that they shouldn't be in Schedule 1, which by definition means that there's no therapeutic use, no medicinal use. So I think it's all great. I think that everyone involved in this work knows what they're doing. They're doing it in a very politically conscious way because this is sort of a complicated game that everyone is playing. And I think it's great. But the work that I find most compelling is, you know, synthesis of new drugs, the new drugs that are being discovered every day. And that doesn't get as much attention because it's maybe less interesting for most people. Thank you. Hi. Thank you so much for this first really quick question for Duncan and then a more general question. Duncan, welcome to New York. Thank you. Now that you're here, when are you making a trip upstate to visit your spiritual parents at New York? Alison Allison? Yes. I'm asking for purely selfish reasons. I live right near there and go there a lot. I think the next full moon party, I was looking at the date. I'm doing another show here in March with Krishnadas and I'm afraid that that falls, either, wait, is the full moon tonight or is it next month? Yeah. See, that's the problem. It's like, so I can't go in March, so in April, I think that's when I'm... The solstice event is next month too. That's the big one. When is that? Middle of March. Well, you know what? If I'm going up there, I'll tweet about it. I definitely will be going to one of their events soon. Okay. And I do consider them my mommy and daddy. Thank you. Then more general question. It kind of relates to some of the others now, but this is for Hamilton, I guess specifically, with this research that's been going on with maps and Johns Hopkins when you're talking about it. And just in general, it seems like so many more people are so much more open to discussing their psychedelic experiences and coming out about it. And it's a lot more of a comfortable situation now. Do you have hope for the future of psychedelics in general? And could we see more positive changes with that? Lifetimes versus way years off, as far as just society being more accepting of them? Yeah, I do have hope. Within my lifetime, growing up in the 90s, the only reporting on psychoactive drugs in general in the news is exclusively negative. Now, if you type in psilocybin in Google News, you're going to find more positive stories than negative ones. And part of that has to do with the scientific research that's provided a substrate for reporters to say good things about psychedelics. Part of it has to do with fashion, that it's trendy to say positive things about psychedelics right now. There's a lot of different factors at play, but the end result is that the New York Times, every major media outlet is now semi-routinely saying positive things about psychedelic drugs. It's being read by millions of people. It's changing people's minds. And I can only see that as a good thing. And that's another reason not to be afraid. That's the other thing. It's like this whole being on a list, don't say anything positive about drugs. It's like ultimately the media, as much as people hate the media, they sculpt public opinion on these issues. And the more people that are saying positive things, the more likely it is that minds are changed. And then the next politician that comes along and thinks that they can gain political traction by scheduling salvia or 2CN or whatever will think twice about it because they might assume that people actually care. I think you're totally right, man. I don't know why I got so fucking severe on you in the middle of the show like that, man. It's just like, I just don't want to see you get murdered. I'm just kidding. I keep doing it. I hate to see you get dragged off. But no, I think you're absolutely right. Who cares? You know what? I'll get dragged off to the fucking dungeons. It's a great way to die. You know, it's a great way to like, seriously, like, you know, this is like, God, I'm sorry, I always do this. But to quote the Bhagavad Gita, in the beginning of the Bhagavad Gita, Argent of the warrior drops his bow and says to Krishna, the embodiment of the universe, God, I'm not going to fight. It's better, you know, it's better to go in the forest than to kill. And the responses, essentially, the essence of the Bhagavad Gita is to die in sacred duty. To die in sacred duty. If you're on a battlefield, and that's what we are on, for real, we're on a battlefield. And the battlefield is a war. And the war is a war against a legion of people who think it's okay to put alchemists, chemists, healers, shamans, people whose only intention is to accelerate the intellectual evolution of their species in jail. There's a group of people who want to do that. And that is wrong. It'll never be right. It's always wrong. It's wrong on every level. This is a war. So, in this war, if you were to get arrested, hurt anything in that kind of war, then what a beautiful thing to happen to you. Like, that's one of the highest victories. That's one of the highest achievements is to, in the pursuit of some justice, to fall in one way or another. And that's how heroes are made. So, that is why, when you're arrested, I'm going to build a Hamilton statue in my house, and burn candles in front of it. I'm sorry. That's an attempt at a joke. I'm sorry. But no, it's still, I think that it's a very important thing, and that regardless of outcome, it doesn't matter. You can't think about the outcome. And every single person in here can immediately do something to accelerate us getting to a point where these things are prescribable just by going to the maps website and donating to maps and help. That's all you got to do, or volunteering with them also, because if you were really into it, you could start volunteering for their Zendo project. I've done the Zendo application all the way. There you go. Awesome. Hello. Hi. Just wanted to tell everybody, you know, if you're thinking about it, just do the drugs, do them critically, think about solutions, and, you know, it might work, it might not work, but, you know, control your experience. No, that's good advice. Anyways, so how's New York? How's New York treating you? Warm welcome? Is everything good? Yeah, I love it here. It's amazing. Like, it's, it really is, I have right now a very cheesy love for New York. I'm still fascinated by the subways, like I like riding the trains, and I think the people here are, it's so funny because the, you come here, it's weirdly, I've said this to Cora, my girlfriend, and like, I think she's like, this is actually the opposite, but I keep thinking, it's like Burning Man, because like, Burning Man's got such a bad rap that it creates a force field around it where you have this idea of what it's like when you go there, and when you get there, you realize, oh, fuck, this is the opposite of my fantasies about what it would be. So, New York being a city, a hard city that alienates people, a city of like, everyone's out for themselves, a kind of Machiavellian capitalist dystopia or something, it's the opposite of that. It feels like this humanistic, beautiful experiment. Sure, not everyone's like grinning from ear to ear here, but you get the feeling that if you fall down, someone's gonna help you stand up, and that people are like, well, he's sticking up for each other. And the other thing that I think is very sweet is that 2am on the subways when I'm coming home from a show, people are comfortable enough around each other that they're sleeping, and I think there's something really beautiful about that, so I like this city. Wonderful. I'd say as a New Yorker, that's the best part of it. We could all just be ourselves. To me, I've been a few places, not too many, but it's the realest place. You could just be yourself, so wonderful answer, and Hamilton, you're awesome too. Thank you. Thanks. We have time for one more question, then we gotta wrap it up. What's up, guys? I'm just wondering, how has Timothy Leary's work influenced your own personal works, both of you guys? I wouldn't say he's had a huge influence. I think he's interesting, historically. Yeah, he was not the guy that I was most interested in. A lot of other people have. Alexander Shulgin, John Lilly, Terence McKenna. Timothy Leary's obviously very, very important, but he's kind of stigmatized at this point because people think that it was his manic attempt to show everyone that LSD was great that resulted in this kind of mess that we're in right now. Some people will say that. I think that's a sort of simplistic explanation, but it's an idea that people have that if he hadn't gone off on this mission that maybe scientific research could have continued and ultimately it was a bad thing. It's arguing a counterfactual and it's impossible to know exactly what would have happened if Timothy Leary had never existed, but... Yeah, that's a sure. Yeah. Thank you. Good for you, Duncan. Well, you know, one thing that's impacted me in my life is Ram Dass, and I go to the Ram Dass retreats regularly, and I think about a lot of those teachings, and those teachings come from Neem Karoli Baba, who was Ram Dass' guru. And it's actually, you're more like Timothy Leary. In that movie, Dying to Know, there's this fantastic scene where Ram Dass is sitting with Timothy Leary, who is in his last weeks of life, and Ram Dass starts talking about the soul. And you see this friendship between Leary and Ram Dass. So Ram Dass starts talking about the soul, and you see this is not a new conversation. This is a conversation they've been having since the 60s. Ram Dass is talking about the soul, and Timothy Leary is like, the soul? Where is it? Where do you think it is? Like, here? It's something in you? What are you talking about? And it's this beautiful love between these two, the materialist and the spiritualist. They're never going to agree, but their interaction is so playful and sweet. So when I think of Timothy Leary, I think of the person who catapulted Richard Alpert, who was to become Ram Dass, into a state of consciousness where it made sense to take LSD to India and give it to people who were meditating to try to get a map for what that state of consciousness was. And because of that journey to India and diving into that level of what a lot of people would probably consider to be insanity, he came into contact with Neem Karoli Baba. And because he came into contact with Neem Karoli Baba, Be Here Now came into existence. And because of Be Here Now, I was able to gather a lot of tools that I use every single day to keep myself from going completely nuts. And so for that, I feel a lot of gratitude for what Timothy Leary did. And that's what I think of him as. I think of him as the person who pushed Ram Dass into the unknown, or Alpert into the unknown. And we need people like that. So I'm very grateful for that person. I'm so glad that he was on the scene. Yeah, me too. True. Thanks, guys. Thanks for the question. Everybody, thank you so much for coming tonight. I'm going to be hanging out in the bar there if you guys want to get a drink after this and just hang out. If you enjoyed tonight, we're doing another show in March with Krishna Das, who's going to see Kirtan in the beginning and talk about Channing Mantras. It's going to be pretty awesome. If I could please just have everyone give a gigantic round of applause for our spectacular guest, Hamilton Morris. Let him hear it. Please. And thank you all so much for coming.

92^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Emily V. Gordon Transcript and Discussion^2016-08-24^"Hello, sweet friends. It's me, Duncan, and you are listening to the Duncan Trestle Family Hour podcast, and I'm having what we used to call in the oil industry a champagne problem. I've got a bunch of great podcasts, and I can't pick which one to release. So I'm just gonna do it chronologically, but Jesus fucking Christ, if I've been having some incredible conversations with some beautiful human beings. I've got four podcasts under my belt, four of them vibrating like the Ark of the Covenant and some dusty government warehouse. I just wanna open it up and let those sweet face melting angels fly into your waxy ear holes and melt the faces off any of those aspects of your personality that are giving you a low grade incarnation. Because come on, let's face it. This thing we're all experiencing right now, even when it sucks, it's pretty amazing. And that's a blasphemous thing to say. I know many of you out there don't necessarily believe it when I say that. And many of you might say, yeah, sure. Maybe for you, everything feels like heaven. You inherited half a billion dollars from your grandfather. You've never experienced want, hunger, sadness, tragedy, catastrophe, or any problem at all in your life. You're sponsored by Monsanto. You're still making money from some of those oil fields that you own overseas. And I tell you this, friends, it is true, I am a multi-billionaire who's never experienced want, sadness, suffering. I've never experienced hunger. I don't know what that's like. Sometimes I read about it in books where the protagonist or the antagonist might describe themselves as being hungry. And I think to myself, I don't even know what that's like. I have food that is constantly shoved into my mouth by legions of erotic servants wearing ballerina outfits, men and women alike who, using a neurological scanning device that's attached to my third eye, immediately know when I'm hungry and come to me and spoon food into my mouth. Not only that, but I take perfumed baths with lavender and honey. And my nipples are regularly softened, moistened, pulled, tugged, expanded, and iced down by trained doctors and clinicians who live in the sub-basements of my home. I don't know what it is to have insomnia. When I go to sleep, there is a trained anesthesiologist, not like the one Michael Jackson had, but an actual government-level, MK Ultra-style anesthesiologist who puts me under. And as I'm sleeping, they open up my eyes and drip chamomile tincture into my eyes ensuring that I only have pleasant dreams. I've never had a nightmare. My dreams are filled with angels, bars of gold, warm mud baths, and a never-ending string of beautiful angelic beings that I copulate with until I wake in the morning and a group of children throw flower petals on my bed and a bugler softly bugles a happy hymn to me. The children acquire, sing to me, and I'm just gonna play you a sample of the beautiful music that I wake up to every single morning in my Bavarian mansion where I'm currently recording the intro to this podcast. You are beautiful no matter what they say. Words can't bring you down. You are beautiful no matter the same way. That's enough, get out of here, get the fuck out of here. They sing about gratitude and the importance of life, the importance of understanding that this world and this incarnation is a precious, precious thing that we should all appreciate regardless of our current situation. When they're done singing, I have them dropped into an industrial-sized blender and I drink a delicious smoothie. Nothing tastes quite like an inspirational child's choir after a night of wonderful dreams. After that, I'll spend a few moments gazing from my balcony upon the Bavarian forests. Wherein lay the hidden cathedrals of some lost and ancient religion, cathedrals that contain within them the skin, flesh, teeth, and heads of saints like John the Baptist. But you don't need any of this to experience true happiness. Really, all you need is the present moment because that's all anyone has. In fact, that's all that actually exists. And some of my friends who are in the Illuminati have told me again and again and again that the only weapon they truly possess is the ability to distract the human population from realizing that they are always sitting in the middle of the Garden of Eden, the present moment, the Garden of Eden, the place that cannot be bought with gold, silver, skulls, blood, or bones, a place that you have earned simply by incarnating in this wonderful dimension. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go resuscitate Bono again. We've got a great podcast for you today. We're gonna jump right into it, but first, some quick business.

And I am ever so grateful for their continued sponsorship of this podcast. I know it's innately embarrassing to rave about your sponsor, but I gotta tell you, man, going from my previous website to a Squarespace website feels like going from some old clunky shitmobile whose wheels are filled with hair and teeth of the people I ran over during blacked out moments of drunk driving to some kind of sweet, self-driving Tesla-style car that won't let me kill no more.

If you go through this portal and buy something on Amazon, Amazon will give us a very small percentage of anything you buy, and it's a great way for you to support this podcast. I just ordered from Amazon something that has truly changed my life. I have scoliosis. I have terrible back problems that were recently compounded as part of my midlife crisis. I don't know if that's what you call it, but for lack of a better word, we'll call it that. I hired a trainer and wow, man, I screwed my back up. I already had scoliosis, but whoa, I really hurt myself and had to get MRIs. God, nothing's worse than listening to a middle-aged guy talk about his health problems, so forgive me. Long and short of it is I got one of those, a dangler. What do you call it? The thing you lay on and it reverses you so that you hang upside down. An incline thing, a dangler, a meat-body dangler, I think is what they call it on Amazon. An inversion table, holy shit. If you're having back problems, I mean, I don't know, all back problems are different, but this is the most miraculous physical recovery that I have ever had in my life. Just dangling my hairy old flabby meat-body from that sweet dangler a couple of times a day has completely fixed my back problems. I know that sounds insane, but it actually works. If you wanna order something cool from Amazon.com, get one of those meat-bodily danglers, meat-body danglers, whatever you call them, a danglin' rod, a danglin' table, also known as an inversion table, but you can get anything from Amazon, toilet paper, tissues, they even have subscription services now where you can have a monthly, depending on how much toilet paper you need, monthly toilet paper delivered to your door. Look, I live in Los Angeles, so anything that keeps me out of that dark river of numb humans surrounded by goddamn metal, oh, good Christ, Lord, fuck, man, shit. Nobody wants to go into traffic, man, and especially to go into traffic to buy some boring ass fucking shit that you just need because you happen to be a soul trapped in a human body like a dolphin net to have to drive to a goddamn store through 45 minutes of shit fucking traffic just because you have to buy stuff that you require to tend to the embarrassing combination of molecules and food and microorganisms that you call your human body. You, this beautiful infinite consciousness, has temporarily gotten trapped in this thing like a fish in a goddamn net. Nothing's worse than driving down that metal river and gazing to the right and left and seeing people equally aware of the fact that instead of spending this precious human incarnation engaged in acts of hedonism, love making, education, or even, dare I say, selfless service to our fellow man, we are spending our life energy inhaling fumes on these concrete river beds as we drive to get halls or hemorrhoid cream down at the local chain store. Fuck that, man, go through my Amazon portal and you will have these wonderful, yet embarrassing necessities delivered right to your door in a nice brown box that you can open up and immediately smear those creams and oils on your body and get in your car to drive to a local park or the gym or a museum or a bar or your heroin dealer or wherever you go to experience the finger of Jesus as it touches your heart. Don't spend your life in a chain store. Go through my Amazon portal, won't you? We also have a shop located at dunkintrestle.com. We've got t-shirts, posters. We just ordered some enamel pens and we are going to restock the entire store. Some of our stuff is sold out. So if you want some Dunkintrestle family hour paraphernalia to show your DTFH colors to your fellow meat buddies, why won't you go to our shop? And finally, dear friends, we have updated the forum. This is, I don't talk about it as much as I should, but one of my favorite places to hang out on the internet, just underneath Reddit, is the forum located at dunkintrestle.com. I'm not going to call it my forum because it isn't my forum. It's just a community of really interesting, cool, smart people who hang out online. Some of the guests from past episodes are on there and just a lot of really cool people are on there. So if you want to experiment with going to an online forum, why not give us a shot? It's pretty cool, man, it really is. If you've got some idea that you want to develop some question that you're having, or who knows, maybe you want to see if you can connect with other folks who listen to this podcast. The DTFH forum is the place to go. Go to dunkintrestle.com and click on the forum link and it'll take you right there. Today's guest is an author and clinician who has written an amazing book called Super You. She also has a wonderful blog that I occasionally visit. Not enough. I'd probably be happier if I spent more time there called Do You Think You're Pretty? It's at emilyvgordon.tumblr.com. She's also on Twitter. She is a wonderful soul who shared a lot of wisdom with me during this brief conversation that we had. I wish it could have been longer. So now everybody, please welcome to the Dunkintrestle Family Hour podcast, Emily Gordon. [""Welcome, Welcome to the Dunkin' Donuts!"" by Emily Gordon plays in the background.] [""Welcome, welcome to the Dunkin' Donuts!"" by Emily Gordon plays in the background.] Thank you so much. Thank you so much for coming all the way up here. No problemoos, it's beautiful. Coming, thank you. Yeah. Thanks a lot. I like Pasadena a lot. Where are you? What party time are you? Los Feliz. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful air too. It's great, but it's not as secluded. You're in a full-on seclusion sitch. This is a seclusion sitch. Coyotes at night, howling. My neighbor is like kind of, she's very sweet, but she's a little obsessed with the coyotes eating our dogs. So whenever I- They're very small. They're very small. But it's one of those things where every time I see her, our topic that we always go to, she's like, I heard the coyotes last night, and I thought, oh God, they ate one of your dogs. Oh, so she's like fully anticipating that your dogs are already being consumed. By the time she sees you, she thinks you're in mourning. Every single time she sees you. I have to reassure her and say, oh, they're fine. They've not been eating. Look at them. Yeah, look there. I'm walking, I'm walking them, they're right here. So, wow, you are a very busy person. I can be, yes. But you are doing, you do a lot, you do a lot. You are a producer. You have, I don't know the right word for it, and so forgive me if this is not the right word. An advice blog? Is it therapy blog? I would say an advice blog. I think that's the best way to put it, yeah. Yeah, an advice blog, and you've written this amazing book, which is, and I want to talk about all of it. Okay. But in particular, what I really like about your book, do you know much about chaos magic? You know, oddly, I do know a bit, because I dated a guy who was a chaos magician when I was in North Carolina. What was it, was his name Raven? His name was Tom. Oh. Oddly, yeah, he didn't, yeah. And I think the thing that he had joined was maybe not the most legitimate thing, but they all lived together in a trailer. And so I knew a little bit just from going to visit him. But he moved to a trailer in South Carolina, and then we kind of fell out. I like the idea about, I like the idea that you don't have to worship a thing that is mythologically factual, if that makes sense. In other words, you don't have to tune into the symbols. Yeah. They did the world religions have chosen. Yeah. You can pick. You can do whatever you want. Anything you want. Absolutely. I've got a friend who taught me about it, who praised a Batman. And that's his deity of choice. That's his deity of choice. And the way he explained it to me, which I thought was really quite brilliant, is take Ganesh, the Eastern Elephant God. How much do you know about Ganesh, really? Were you raised with Ganesh? When you grew up, did you see Ganesh everywhere? And your parents told you the story of Ganesh? Or more than likely, you run into Ganesh at a New Age bookstore? Or at a restaurant. At a restaurant. There he is. You think that looks cool. Maybe in college, you learn that this is the decapitated child of Shiva whose head was replaced with an elephant. But then, when have you seen an elephant? How often? Right? Every symbol attached to the symbol is. Far from you. Far from you. Yeah. So the idea is, but Batman. We got him. He's everywhere. He's everywhere. We got canon. We don't even know the Ganesh canon at all. At all. We have no idea who's played him. We have no idea what the little suits, different suits, meant and what they wore. And if they had nipples or not, we got nothing. Nothing. But we know a lot about Batman. Exactly. That's interesting. So that's, and the idea is like, yeah, no shit. Is there really a decapitated deity whose head has been replaced with an elephant that lives in some ethereal kingdom? Come on. Most likely not. The odds are, slip. It doesn't live in a physical realm, right? Very slim. I mean, infinite universe, multiverse theory, at that point, maybe everything's happening. Fine. But then we've got other fish to fry. Other fish to fry. I'm not concerned. A lot of other things are real. In that case that we need to start dealing with. So it's really a brilliant concept. And how does that idea connect with your book? I do think, I kind of started thinking about, I wanted to write a self-help book, and I was trying to. I was kind of talking with my publisher about different frameworks for it. And I've always been kind of really into any kind of narrative, any kind of story, any kind of fictional story. This could be Harry Potter. This could be anything. But those things always kind of spoke to me more so than the stories I was supposed to take very, very seriously and the stories I was supposed to memorize and sing songs about the Methodist Church I was raised in. So I kind of like that superheroes are this idealized version of ourselves. But one, an idealized version that has flaws and that we allow them to have flaws. And I thought that was kind of cool because the idea that you're working towards being the best version of yourself but that you are still kind of flawed and that you have to be okay with that and figure out ways to make those flaws work for you. That's true for superheroes and I think it should be true for us too. So that's kind of where the idea came from. So a lot of religious figures don't have, we don't get to see what their flaws are. Like maybe Jesus farted a bunch. Like we have no idea. Like we don't really get to hear that stuff as much. And so yeah, that's where that came from. And so I really kind of like the idea that you could just pick a deity of your own and go to town. Yeah, and it's that, this is something I think about the secret damage that TV does to people by- Oh, I think of this all the time. Because you know, from like, I don't know what you think of them. It doesn't really, I have a small opinion about it, but not much, but like take any host, Jimmy Fallon, Bill O'Reilly, name most of them. And you see this flawless being. And if there are flaws, they're flaws that have been carefully chosen. They're adorable flaws. Exactly, right? And so this gives the impression to the whole world, here's what health looks like. Yeah, here's what the best version of you could be. Right, well-dressed and someone who really doesn't change over time. Not at all, that's right. Doesn't seem to go through anything. Yeah, not to mention that they're all white men. So like, then you're like, oh, I guess a white man is what I'm supposed to be aiming for. That, yeah, that over and over and over again. Secretly, that's what it says. Because for so many people, that is the eight, a lot of people consider that to be one of the versions of ultimate success. Yeah. Not just comedians, but a lot of, when you're a kid, Jesus Christ, David Letterman, whoever it may be, you look at it and you think, wow, that's someone who's really done it with their lives. They've done it. And so that secretly teaches you, here's what a healthy being looks like. Yeah. And so interesting too, and now I'm thinking, the time that Letterman blew up, the guy that was trying to blackmail him, and just did that on television, that Conan leaving when he got fired from The Tonight Show, was like, hey, listen, I need you to not be, don't let this harden you. Like when they break those molds, those are the two that I'm thinking of that were like so memorable to me, and it's because they were showing their flaws for a few moments. Yes. And that was it. It's the most powerful moment. When suddenly there's a human there, and not some kind of mask, and it makes everyone feel better, because all of us are wandering around, going through all kinds of shit. And if we had a team of 30 people making sure that we looked and acted a certain way on television every single day, then we would, that's what we would do. Be flawless. And then we would just be tired the rest of the time, I imagine. Exhausted and probably angry, and probably doing a lot of weird shit that you never hear about. And this is the, you know, one of my favorite Ram Dass videos. You know Ram Dass, he's a spiritual teacher. I've heard of Ram Dass for a minute. He wrote Be Here Now. He's awesome. Okay, yes. So when he was at the height of his touring from this incredible book that he wrote, and from his, like, he's just got an amazing story. And he's like, at that time, he was really putting on the way you would expect someone from- What you get your money's worth. He's got the beard, the long hair, he wears like a robe, and he's really committed to the role of being a teacher of Eastern thought, or someone who merges. He was a doctor of psychology, so what's so cool about him is he was- He actually had science too, yeah. Sensitizing, that's great. You would love him, but he comes out and he's like kind of laughing. He's like, I just yelled at someone backstage. And he's like, and I'm supposed to be this teacher. And he's like- I'm not the one guy. Yeah. Well, no, somehow that makes him more- Absolutely, yeah. Because you're like, wow, beautiful. So when are we embracing our flaws, and when are we in denial about our flaws? When are- In other words, this is who I am. Yeah. You know, I'm just this kind of asshole. You know what I mean? Yeah. It seems like it would be very easy to get caught in thinking, oh no, no, no. These are just my flaws and I embrace them. It's what makes me a superhero, versus I need to change this shit. I think there's this thing of like taking your flaws and moving them to the forefront of your personality and deciding those are your personality. And I think a lot of people get trapped in that and that's a bad, I think that's a bad trap to it. Like, oh, I just say what I think and I just tell it like it is. Like, you're just an asshole. Like, everyone is thinking these things, just because you say them doesn't make you like somehow more insightful than anyone else. You're an asshole. So I think there is a thing of like, once you kind of understand what your flaws are, what your less than stellar qualities are, understanding that that doesn't mean that they need to, then dominate your personality. But that you need to figure out, I put them in two categories. The ones that you need to like kind of cushion and like build a little home around so that they can kind of, you can support them. And the ones that you need to kind of integrate into your personality and be like, yeah, this is part of who I am and it's fine. Like, I'm super overly, overly organized and kind of obsessive about it. And I think for a long time I tried to be like, well I'm this like punk rock girl and I do whatever and I don't care, I'm cool with whatever. I'm not, I'm not actually cool with whatever. I'm like, I need to be very organized if things start on time, I need them to start on time. And that's a, I'm not even gonna say that's a flaw, but that's a quality of myself that for a long time I tried to deny and act like it wasn't there. And now I'm kind of, I'm taking, I'm getting jobs because I'm organized in a field that often people aren't super organized in. And I'm the one that's like shushing people backstage and like keeping time for a show and all that stuff. So that's kind of ended up working for me. And it's been a thing that I've considered a flaw for a long time that I'm now kind of working with. There are other flaws that I have or other flaws, anybody has that, it's not that I wanna get rid of them or incorporate them in my personality. I just realized that like, this is a thing of mine that requires a little bit of massaging. This is a quality I have that like, it's not the forefront of my personality. I don't need to hide it and pretend like it's not there, but I just need to. What's an example of that? If you could talk about it. I could be overly sensitive. I think I can be in some situations I can be overly sensitive. I'm very overly sensitive about my health and I try to hide from people when I'm not feeling well. Oh wow. When I'm not well, yeah. That's a thing that I'm like, I work on it a little bit, but it's just part of who I am. You mean kind of like the like John Wayne thing? A little stoic. Wow, yeah. I do that too. You don't, I don't know. Why do we do it? I have no idea, you know, I don't know. Maybe it's because there's, well there is a superstitious idea that should I start talking about my- You manifest it. Yes, it just amplifies it even more. And somehow, but then whenever I do talk, when you finally do like, tell someone, I'm fucked up, man. You feel better right away. Yeah, I think, I know why I do it. I said I didn't know, but I totally know. I have always had a thing where I wanna be easy to be around and I feel like if I, if there's anything that like, makes me even slightly difficult to be around, like I'm sick or I'm not, I'm angry or I'm upset about something, then the people I'm with will be like, well you're not worth the trouble, bye-bye. Yeah, yeah. And I say this, I say this very easily, but it took me like maybe a decade to figure that out. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and you know what's fascinating is, do, are there people like that in the world? Maybe, I have to assume that there are. I've been running from them for my whole life. But it's like, it's like that when you can sit, cause I know when my brain manufactures a being, that then I'm shaping my life to please- This like imaginary creature. Yeah, another God, another God. And you're worshiping it through your never ending sacrifice of happiness or truth. Health. Health and the altar of this thing. But then when you start thinking like, shit, have I ever met a person in my life who's been like, you know, that fucking Emily? She was talking about how she didn't feel that good. Fuck that girl. And I think we need to, we need to ex her out of this group. We can't even get out of here. She's done, no one's done that. No one's done that. And if someone said that, you would be like, what are you talking about? That's some really good reality testing, Duncan, that I have never even thought to do, even though I definitely should have. Isn't it weird? Yeah. Cause all these phantoms exist. Yeah. And usually all I know is like, I don't know, when I really look into myself, I don't think I know myself that well. Like I like, some days I feel like, okay, yeah, I think I've got this thing. But quite often I'm a little, I don't even want to say confused because that makes it seem even more in focus than it is. She's kind of a foggy amalgamation of behavior patterns. I'm not sure what it is. You can kind of connect them, but ooh. Yeah, I don't know. Yet my construction of people outside of me, flawless, flawless. You know them so well. So well. I've got them packed. Like, like, like beautiful little geometric patterns that somehow from my brief encounters with them, I've been with myself for 42 years. Some of these people I've run into for a total of like six minutes. And I am completely, fully aware of everything about them. So it's ridiculous, you know? I'll even hear a little click in my head of like, they'll tell me one thing about themselves. And I'll be like, click. Oh, now I got you. You got you. I got you. But by the way, do you think those people think that they know themselves? I don't, well, I don't, I think there's people who, there's some people who may be never, ever, and a lot, like. Oh, don't even give a shit. Don't want to. Yeah, I think that's true. They don't even think about that. They don't even think about like who, it's like the same way that maybe, like I try not to think about my organs inside my body. I just don't want to think about it. I don't like getting MRIs. I don't like seeing it. You don't want to know. There's a bag of weird things. There's so many bags. Just a collection of weird bags. Yeah. Bloody bags encased in myself. I don't like looking at it. I know they're there. But in that same way, I think some people, they don't even want to, they don't look back into their psyche. Yeah. So they're just, you know. Just floating around. In heaven. Which by the way, is it a, it's a luxury to even have the ability and the time and the brain space to look inside yourself. Cause, you know, evolutionarily, we weren't built, we were built to like run, Right. Hunt, get away from things, gather what we could, live, die. Like we were not, you know, we're just now getting around to like, we have the luxury to like self, like self reflect. Yeah. That's a luxury that, and a lot of people now don't have because their lives are not set up that they have any spare time or any ability to. So it's a little bit of a luxury, but I also feel like some of those people do think they know themselves and they just haven't. They, because they know, they've gone like a couple centimeters deep and they're like, oh, got it. I got it. I don't like cheese. That's it. Got it. I'm a no cheese liking dude. Which by the way, and I'm not even trying to talk down to them because I feel like maybe that could, maybe that is the answer. It's like, do you like cheese? Do you not like cheese? That's it. What else do you need to know? Yeah. Yeah. It's one of those things where there's a teacher, Chugyum Trumpa, who says, if you can avoid going down this path, don't do it. Because once you start going in, you can't come back. Yeah. Because once you start really. And you can't, yeah. It gets worse before it gets better. Right. Yeah. It's kind of like in the morning, when you're in the middle of a great dream and you start waking up, you might be able to go back into the dream a little bit, but you're still gonna be. It feels a little dumb when you go back in. Yeah. Yeah. You're like, I'm trying to replicate. This is having a conversation with this pillow. Oh God, I was on like a lazy river in heaven and it felt so good. I just want to go back to that for a second, but you can't. No. And it really is a lazy river, I think. As much as it seems nice to not gaze upon the inner workings of the machine that you call yourself, it seems like, I don't know, to not do that is to, well, I don't know. Who's to judge, right? Who's to judge. I think it is hard. And it's like sobriety. It's like anything else. Like that's what I always tell people when they go into therapy. Like you're not, you're gonna get to a point where you're not enjoying it because it's work. Right. And then the idea is that you keep working to the extent that like you then get to a place where you're comfortable. That's true in relationships. It's true for sobriety. Anything, like it's not, you have to work. It's not always gonna be fun and easy. And if you're signing up for like, I want to really get to know and dig into this, but I want it to be really easy and fun the whole time. No. Go fuck yourself. It's not gonna happen. There's nothing like that. Yeah. Learning piano, none of it. Spin class. Spin class. It's not gonna be fun. Now you, so you're a trained counselor. Yes. And you went to school. You got a. Master's degree in couples and family therapy. Wow, cool. So that's a lot of edgy. That's a lot of years. How many years is that? It was just two and a half. So I got a master's, I got an undergrad in psychology and then a master's. So six and a half years. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Just six and a half years. Just the six and a half. That's a long time. And also getting a master's degree, it's not like they just give this to you. Like you. Yeah. It's super intense. It's super intense. You have to do. Cause I have a degree in psychology. So I went for the first four years, but then I remember as you know, the teachers are telling you what you're going to have to do. If you actually want to practice, it's just so daunting. Yeah. It's a lot of work. It's so much. It's your practicum internships. You have to like write papers. You've got to like take classes. And that's if you don't have to support yourself, which I did. So then you also have to have a job. Yeah. It was like the most intense, I would say two and a half years of my life. For sure. Holy shit. Where did you intern? I entered at a couple of different places. I did practicum, which is when you're just observing and not really participating in being a therapist. I did a domestic batterers group, court-ordered. I did a preschool for troubled preschoolers. It was like part of the Head Start program. And everyone that was there was great. We all knew the program was a terrible idea to like pick out kids in preschool and decide that they were troubled. You're already fucked up. Yeah. So we, everybody in the program was great. They were doing their best to work within like not a great system. And then internship, I interned at a community counseling center that was just like whoever got brought in for whatever real study intern. Yeah. It was mainly, it was community counseling for like a while. And then I also had to see clients on campus at the like campus clinic. And then I also worked in the writers. There was like a writing clinic on campus. And that was my job. So often I couldn't remember when I would see people on campus if I'd seen them about a paper or about like a personal issue. Wow. So I just had to have a policy of like ignoring everyone that I saw because I didn't want to like break confidentiality. But I could have said hi to someone I helped with the paper. No. It was complicated. It's, I mean, I can't remember anyone's name. It's the worst. So in that case, I don't know what I'd do. Just dumb me up. It's great. But you, you, you're no longer practiced. No. You don't practice anymore. I practiced for almost seven years. Why don't you want to, why don't you do that anymore? I got burnt out. I, I kept taking super intense jobs when I got out of school and I love working really, was really intense populations. But I just, I was getting burnt out. I went through like a health scare that was kind of intense. And then that kind of made me want to. What was the health scare? Oh, I, oh, that's a hole. I was in the hospital for a month in 2007 and was in a coma for like eight, 10 days. And had a very mysterious illness that no one could figure out. It took them that long of time to kind of figure out what was wrong with me and then I had to spend the rest of the time getting better. But it was a super intense. Yeah. So I have like this genetic condition that's like very rare, very treatable. They just didn't know what it was. And it's called adult onset. It's still a disease and it's like a form of arthritis that affects your organs. And I just kept getting sick and sick and sick and people were like, you have pneumonia. You're having panic attacks. And I was like, none of this seems right. So then hospital, very sick. And when I got out, I went back to work and I was working with all people with schizophrenia, all my clients. I was working at home for people with schizophrenia. And I just was like, I can't, I have so little, I have my reserves are so low. I can barely help myself and I definitely can't help you guys right now. So I tried to take an easier, easier quote unquote job at like a community, like a mental health center, just like a very, and then I was like just angry all the time. And I was like, I gotta get out of here. If I'm not good for the clients anymore, like I need to go immediately. This is like not, and it was hard. It was really hard because that was my identity for so long was like being a therapist and I really loved it. But I was like, if I'm dealing with a lot of stuff on my own and if I'm not helping clients, then what am I in this for? Like none of this. Was part of you thinking that somehow you hit for taking on all of this psychic venom had in some way, I don't, I'm not saying it caused this to happen, but activated it, like the stress may have activated it. That's an interesting idea. I think it had always kind of been there because there were definitely times throughout my life that I'd gotten sick and been like, what a weird, why couldn't I shake this for like, what a weird thing? Anyway, let's keep going through my 20s. But I do think, I think I wasn't, as much as I was trying to like maintain self-care because that's a big thing they teach in grad school, like take care of yourself because you're not helpful. I was doing my best, but it was just a very intense job that I had. So I couldn't really take care of myself as much as I should have. So that might be part of it, but that doesn't change the fact that no one knew what this illness was and it took like specialists, seven or eight specialists, like over a week to figure out what was wrong with me. So like working with me 24 hours a day with me on a respirator. So like it's both. Like I think at some point I would have popped off, but like no matter what, it would have been very hard to figure out what was wrong. I think the effects that really getting sick has on your life, the teaching that it gives you is so potent. I wish I could pass it on to other people. Without having to almost kill them. But when you, that thing, once you're initiated in that way, then everything, no matter what, forever will be different. Do you have that too? Yeah, I got cancer. I got cancer. Oh my God, yes! Yes, absolutely. So that like, once that's happened to you, you realize the fragility and impermanence of life and you can't ever go back. And you can't explain it. And you can say the words to people and they're like, yeah, sure, that totally makes sense. By the way, I was living in a reality for like an hour or so that I had forgotten. I had forgotten that you had cancer. I like that. I mean, I'm now getting to the point where I have forgotten it from time to time. For like a few moments at a time. For a few moments and then it comes back and I'm like, oh yeah, that happens. Your body does break down. And this is a reality of every single person. And it sounds so miserable when you say it. But people don't realize that it's a doorway to a form of true freedom. It's magical as shit. What can you possibly do to me? Nothing scares me. You can't scare me. You can't fuck with me. You can't do anything to me. I'm basically invincible to everything except for my own body. This is the radioactive spider, right? This is the universe. Wounding you. And yet from that wound, you gain this new perspective on everything and life becomes precious. Again, not precious in like a cheesy way and not like it's easier. No, certainly not. It's sad. I get bummed all the time and freaked out and scared. Anytime you get even a little bit sick. Yes, you know. Yeah, and that's what I was, I like you have no, I was saying this to Camille just the other day. Like you don't know what it feels like to get a little bit sick and wonder is this it? Is this the beginning of it happening again? Is this it? And he's like, no, I totally know it. I was like, no, you can know intellectually. And you were there. He experienced it in a very real way. Absolutely. He doesn't know. No one understands. No. And like I just had a nice wonderful health scare. I fucked my back up a while ago and I ignored it because I'm scared of like I just, I've somehow my brain is like connected. It's a really awful thing. Your brain will decide the doctor is what's going to give you cancer, right? It's really bad. Like before you go to the doctor is the one who literally does tell you. So technically that's true. So your brain just like brings the two together. Like the diagnosis is the disease. Definitely not true. And a terrible thing to think. So, but so yeah, my back was fucking hurting and like, I'm like, all right, I'm going to have to go to the doctor. This is hurting way too long. I'm looking it up. Of course, anything you look up on the internet, it says cancer no matter what it is. Toast. But anyway, that week, two week period of waiting for MRI results. I went into the doctor's office. You know this. When you sit and wait in the doctor's office and you listen for the footsteps and your brain is like, all right, what are those footsteps sound like? Are those happy footsteps or those footsteps of a man about to tell you're going to die? I've got to figure out how I'm going to tell this. I've got to figure out, let me hold on. Let me get my words right. Let me get my words right. He's like practicing before he comes out to you. Yeah. Yeah. And then, so the doctor like tells me you've got, I have back problems, but I'm like, is it cancer? He's like, no, it's not cancer. I'm like, yes, great. I'll take the fucking goddamn milder. I don't care what it is. Whatever. I don't care. Yes, great. This is what happens when you experience this. How to, as a therapist, how do we overcome that? This is such an energy drain on us. Yeah. How do you get past that? I don't know, because I think the gifts it gives are so lovely. And how long has it been since, how long have you been in remission? Oh God, 2013 is when it happened or when I was diagnosed. Yeah, you're still in, honestly, I think you're still in an infancy of a sort. It's been nine years since I was in the hospital. I'm still, I still get sick, but not to the level that I did then, but it took me like five years before going to the doctor, didn't raise my pulse so much that they were like, are you okay? And I'd be like, I'm so anxious, I'm just terrified. Like you have no idea, I'm just terrified right now. But it'll be, which by the way, I got my blood drawn on Monday, because I still have to get it drawn all the time to get tested to make sure I'm okay. And I wasn't panicky. And I remember sitting there thinking like, it's been a, I'm not panicking. This is lovely. And of course that's when it'll get you. That's when it gets you. The back of my head whispers that. But the front of my head, given enough time with like everything going great, everything doing okay, the anxiety level does drop a little. Do you have a person, like I know the kind of cancer I had, the chance of recurrence is minuscule. Thank God. Testicular cancer is with radiation therapy, very small chance. So I can refer to that person's chance, but even that doesn't work. Even though I think God, there's like that person's chance is so low, lower than a lot of other things that could happen to me. And yet still you're, so, but do you have like, if I were your, if I were your client, and I was experiencing anxiety when it comes to going to a doctor, what would you tell me? What are some tools that you could give me to use? And you are, I'm assuming you were a person who has had a major health care, not just like a regular person. I'd be like, fuck and get over it, go to the doctor, you're fine. Yeah. I think for me, it was important that like, regardless of the anxiety, you still have to do it. And that every single time you do it and things are okay, which they most likely are gonna be, let that be a little bit of a sav on the like, see, it's okay, it's gonna be okay. That doesn't mean, and it's just literally doing it even though you're anxious. Cause I think the more important thing is getting the checks and getting, going to the doctor and checking things out. Cause I didn't do that for way too long. And it fucked me. And so I think managing that. And then also like, I mean, and usually when people are anxious, you tell them like, do a worst case scenario. You don't wanna do that in these situations. No, because there is a worst case scenario. By the way, you've already lived through it and you've beaten it. Right. So I think that's part of it. Like there was a worst case scenario and you, you tackled it and you nailed it. So even if the worst case scenario happens, you've tackled it once. You could do that again if you had to. But the worst case scenario, this is something that really the worst case scenario for all of us is that we die. And there is something to be said for exploring that. Because, you know, even if a person has not had some illness yet, everyone in Buddhism, it's old age, disease and death. These are all inevitable things. If you are a human body, you know, you're gonna get one of them, right? No matter what. Maybe you'll somehow avoid two cause you were an aborted fetus. But you're definitely gonna get, I mean, depending on your views on that. Sure, absolutely. I did make a political statement. Yes, you really, what is it? I don't know. But what I mean is, what I mean is, odds are you're getting one of those things and they're all related to the fear of death, right? Yeah. And so overcoming that seems to me to be one of the great superpowers. In fact, flying would be awesome. I'd love it. Flying would be, yeah. It'd be incredible. I'd be my favorite. If you have to choose between flying and just imagine that you could be quenched completely of your fear of oblivion and feel perfectly at peace in the universe. Would you rather be someone who can fly while in the back of your mind there's an imaginary clock taken down towards some terrible doctor's appointment? Or would you rather be someone sitting on a city bus who feels completely and fully alive at all levels regardless of the impermanence of your situation? I wanna fly. Yeah, fly. I wanna fly. I'm not crazy afraid of death. I'm afraid of long, painful illnesses. Right. That because I feel like it's watching people watch me suffer is horrible. Me having to suffer is horrible. The oblivion part honestly doesn't really bother me. You're right. No, it is, for me a lot of it's just the fucking inconvenience of getting super sick. It's like incredibly inconvenient. And it's the definition of inconvenience. And you're inconveniencing everyone around you and it blows, man. But I think behind it though, I know when my pulse increases in the doctor's office and the nurse looks at you just like what you're saying like what the fuck is wrong. You're just sitting here. Are you a fucking weirdo? Did you just do cocaine before you came in here? I feel that's connected in some way to, even though I do think, oh yes, this is the, it's not the, my extinction I'm worried about, it's the- The suffering. The suffering that freaks me out. Still in all, I don't know. I think it's somehow connected in some way to that big question mark floating out there. But who knows, maybe it's different for everybody. Maybe so. Did you make, when you were sick, did you kind of go like make peace with like, okay, if this is gonna happen, I'm okay. I've enjoyed my life. Or were you like fuck, I haven't seen insert country here or whatever. I felt, I mean, I felt a kind of fatalistic excitement over the idea of like wow, shit, this movie's going in a different direction than I expected. Like three is nuts, this is wild. I mean, you do get a like, I can remember driving to get radiation therapy in, or before the radiation therapy, when waiting for results after, you know, they find it, then they have to find out, well, how far in your body has it gone? You know, is it in your brain? Is it in your lungs? So I can remember like driving to the doctor and looking around and there's the world. There was like a blimp in the sky, people driving through traffic, and you realize, oh my God, this thing's just gonna keep going, man. I know, it doesn't all go away when I go away. How is that possible? That guy that probably doesn't know I exist. And we'll never know. Yeah, and then it's like somewhere in there, everything got very tranquil and beautiful, and it's like, wow, this beautiful thing keeps going, and there's something in that that's somehow so sweet and poignant. At least soothing. And soothing, yeah, and then you're a little swirl of problems seem less problematic. Man, I did not mean to go there. No, I'm happy we did. I don't get to talk to other people that have had that experience very often. I don't really get to talk to anybody who does, so. Thank goodness, right? Yeah, it's better that way. I guess it's better that way. But you, so your blog, you give advice to people right in, you give great advice to people. Thank you. Do you follow this advice yourself? Sometimes, I try to be honest with people when I don't, when I'm like, I'm telling you, I usually will post a very lovely like, this is what you should do, and here's what you should do it, and then at the end they'll say, I'm saying all this knowing that it would be very hard for me to do this myself, and I don't know that I would do it myself. I try to be as honest as possible, and I try, I do my best to try to only give advice that I would actually do myself, because I do think it's very easy to sit on a, like a throne of like, well, you definitely shouldn't be doing this, and you should do this instead. When I know I would never actually do that, and that's a really hard thing to do, so I think acknowledging how difficult it is to actually make any kind of change, big or small, is very important, because often when I've been given advice or when I've seen certain therapists, I just feel like they're preaching to me, and that they feel like they're, you know, somehow so much better than me. I'm down in here with you, like I'm not, I don't, I'm not any better than anyone who writes me in. I've just had more education, and more training in this specific field, but I'm not, I don't make great decisions. I just try to push people to like, even if you're making really bad decisions, make them with intention, make, know what you're doing, know why you're making the decisions you're making, even if it's for the worst fucking reasons, just so that you know yourself a little bit better and that you get to know the demons who are making you make bad decisions inside yourself, just don't be like, I don't know why, keep sleeping with this guy, it's great. Yeah, I mean, there's part of you that knows, and if you don't know, you need to figure that out. I'm not saying you need to stop sleeping with this guy, I'm saying know why you're sleeping with this guy, who's a bad guy. Right, so. Why don't we wanna explore our intentions? Why is that something we try to conceal from ourselves? Sometimes it messes with your ego a little bit to know that like, you are doing something for attention seeking, or that bad attention feels better than no attention at all, or there's a million reasons why we do stuff that's not great, picking fights with a boyfriend when you just to feel like there's something exciting happening in your life, like you've got some drama for once, like there are all kinds of reasons we do things that aren't the most like, cool sanctimonious reasons, but that's okay too. I'm not even saying that you have to change those things, just like, let's just be more aware of them. Cause I meet a lot of people that I feel like are like, it's so crazy, this stuff keeps happening to me, and you're like, you're making them happen, like you do, even if your decision is to abandon control, that's still a decision you're making, and at least be aware that you're too freaked out by your life to even make any decisions right now, and then you can start working on the actual problem, which is that you are terrified to control your life, rather than like talking about how like the life world keeps just like tossing all these weird things at you, like, no, you've made a decision to let anything just come, and knock you around. Right. Yeah. Because it's harder to act. It's so much harder to act. It's easier to be a victim. Absolutely. And it's easier to be, I guess, some kind of robot or something at that point. If you're not analyzing your intention, you're just an autopilot creature. I talk about autopilot a lot in the book, and I also, I do think that autopilot is an okay way, it's a coping mechanism sometimes, I think. If you're going through a rough patch, if you're in a rough, if you're in a rough patch, I think it's okay to kind of go into autopilot for a bit, just like, I just need to get through the next few days, next week, whatever. But I think a lot of people get stuck in it, and just a year goes by, and you're like, what have I done? What's happening? It's really easy to stay an autopilot, I think. So I think it's a good, you shouldn't torture yourself if you're in it, but we should always be aware that like, I'm doing autopilot right now for a reason, and at some point I'm going to have to pull out of it, and like start figuring things out. Is there a hierarchy of intentions in your mind? Like, better intentions, worse intentions? I don't think so. I don't think so. I mean, obviously, good is better than bad. You know, having an intention that's like wanting to, like make your life better, and wanting to improve yourself. Sure. It's a poorly worded question, but what I'm trying to get at is, is there some kind of, you know, like the Dalai Lama says, you can always be, try to be kinder. You can always be more kind. So the, what I mean is there's some kind of intention that all of us could adopt. Where in other words, I'm, let's say I am angry. Let's say I've got a, just a cloud of anger and depression hanging over my life forever. Indogenous, shitty depression. And so that means that my readout in the imaginary spaceship that I'm piloting with my hopefully a soul is all wrong. Yeah, you're gonna, it's all like foggy and clouded and weird, yeah. Right, so I can't make navigation decisions based on, this is a great analogy. Based on that fucking thing, right? Yeah. But I know I want, I can, outside of feeling, I can think, man, I bet being compassionate and kind to people is better than hurting them. Even though I don't feel that at all. Yeah. Are you a fraud at that point? If you're faking. Yes. I don't think so. I think sometimes you have to, people think that like motivation comes to them and then they decide to change everything as a result. But sometimes behavior change comes from making the change and then waiting for your feelings to catch up and waiting for your, the thought process to catch up. I mean, if you, you know, when you're depressed and you're like, oh, I should want to work out and then working out will help things. I like just taking a walk around the block. Don't wait for the motivation to come. Just take a walk around the block and then if you do that enough, eventually the endorphins will kind of kick in and you'll start feeling a little bit differently. But if you wait for the like, today I am motivated to exercise. You're gonna be waiting a very long time. So I think kindness is like that too. I do a weird thing, like if I know a friend has something big or weird coming up, I'll write down in my like, I have a paper day planner because I'm a nerd. I will write down, check in with this person on this day. And then I was having a conversation with a friend and they're like, is that good or bad that you had to write down? Would a true friend have remembered on their own? The fact that you have a little reminder, hey, check in with this person about their surgery, their whatever, is that better? And they weren't like dragging me. They were just like, it's an interesting. And I was like, yeah, I don't know. I don't know if it makes me a better friend or a worse friend, but I do know. I'm the one that checked in with that motherfucker. And you didn't. Right. So. So it worked. Yeah, like I don't know if it's important. I don't know how important it is to like, know all the like, I just remembered because I was thinking about you versus, I wrote it down because I like you and I wanna make sure you're okay, but I probably wasn't gonna remember it on my own. I don't know. It's confusing. Yeah. I mean, like it's something so much of what I do. And I think what a lot of people do is emotionally driven. It's like you feel like doing a thing, but sometimes the thing you feel like doing sucks so bad because it's based on anger or fear. And so, but that means that you have to weirdly make a decision to start operating on a completely different set of GPS coordinates that are, you're kind of like someone who's completely blind at that point. And so this is where I always get confused because I think, well, shit, do you just sort of like, I don't, I understand writing something down, but if I'm, and this isn't really from my life, I'm just making something up. Let's say you're with somebody, you're having lunch with someone, a friend who's having a rough go of things, right? And you're such a self-absorbed asshole that you can't stop thinking about, oh, I don't know, your fucking podcast studio, you know, or your new graphics card that you wanna install on your computer or something, right? This is the pollution that's filling up your brain. How do you, how do you fix that? Teach me, how do I connect to- Wait, I thought you said this wasn't you. It's not me, not at all. I don't wanna be selfish, but what if I am? But I think everybody is selfish, but the cool thing is nobody knows how selfish you are, except for you. Right. And so- That's cool. You can find yourself to be selfish, but that if you're forcing yourself to be unselfish, I think that motivation alone makes you unselfish, because really selfish people aren't even thinking, stop thinking about your graphics card and focus on this asshole. Really selfish people are like, anyway, that graphics card, like, there's a difference. That's the greatest T-shirt. That's really a great, I hope someone who hears that, just please make that into a shirt. You're very confusing to most people. That's us. That's us. Not to anyone who's ever played video games. Yeah. I love it. I love that idea. I think that that's a very compassionate way to look at yourself and it's great, because we aren't at the point in augmented reality technology. Not yet. We're hovering above us as an asshole meter. Thank God. I'm out when that happens. I'm moving into a cave. I'm done. I'm done. I'll burrow down into some muddy hole and I'll just die. So you have a fantastic podcast. Thank you. And it's not just a video game oriented, but that is a part of it. Yes. So I just wanted to ask, are you playing any great games right now or are you find yourself? I just started a game called Stardew Valley that was a steam game that was only for PCs for a while. It just came out for Mac and I don't have a PC. So I just started playing it and it's just this one guy created it and it's just a relationship sim where you, it's like the graphics are very room entry and it's like you inherit and I just started it. So if there's a twist, I haven't gotten to it yet. You inherit a farm and you, when your grandfather's, none of this is a giveaway, it's all in the opening. Your grandfather gives you a letter and says when you find yourself feeling like you want to escape your life and that you're miserable, open this envelope. And then it cuts to you like at a cubicle years later and you're like so bored and upset. And these are all rudimentary graphics. So it's kind of great. You open the envelope and it's like, hey, by the way, I gave you a farm. Go move to the farm. That's where you need to be. So you moved to this farm that's in this community called Stardew Valley. That's it. And you just get to know people and you farm and it's just a lovely game. It's just a lovely game. Is it text-based or is it? Yeah, it's mostly text-based. And there is crafting involved, which I haven't even, because I just started, I haven't even gotten to that. So I think it's a little like, a little bit of Minecraft, a little bit of like, get to know these people and make friends and figure out what your relationships are. But the way that he's written the text, the way he's written the dialogue is just better than most games I find and kind of more compelling. So I've been really enjoying it. We also just played a game called Inside that I highly recommend. Did you play a game called Limbo at all? Yeah. It's from the people that made Limbo. And it feels like a, it's not a sequel to Limbo at all, but it feels like it came from the same universe. It's gorgeous. It's like a platformer. It's like an adventure game. And I highly recommend it. So do you ever think you're gonna get a PC? I need to. I literally, my friend Thomas over the weekend was like, what the fuck is wrong with you? And I was like, I know, I need, it's so stupid that I don't have one. I just did the, I just did the switch. And it, watch out. Cause it is a money pit. That's the other thing I've heard. Yeah. It's a money pit. You can just keep spending all of your money. You get possessed by some irrational demon that for no reason at all, wants you to start, it appears to be. Now, I don't know. Do you ever read any Terrence McKenna? No. Cause you'd love him. He's fantastic. And he's practically a God. And I would pray to him. I haven't prayed to him yet, but I would pray to him. There we go. We found a demon for you. He along with a few other people have this cool idea that I've ever heard of Taylor Deschardon. I always say his name on, but so these, basically the idea is we're being drawn into a state of maximum complexity and maximum harmony. So we're ultimate harmony and ultimate complexity. Meet, this is the singularity. This is the apocalypse. This is the, it's all of it. And we're getting drawn into it. And the closer we get to it, the more advanced technology gets. I was like, I can't wait to see how this can be expected in the future. How it connects. Cause technology is the physical manifestation of the form that we're being drawn into down the river of time. And so when you start messing around with a PC, you feel this pull to build a thing that perfectly simulates reality. And, you know, I don't need dual GTX 1080 graphics cards. I don't need that. Certainly not. I am not running some kind of like weather simulator to determine global warming in the Arctic. But, and yet, I now am like, I have a, I just got my GTX 1080 and now I'm like, well, fuck, I'll just get another one and I'll build the thing. So anyway, the point is, you are someone who clearly I'm gonna get into it. Loves games. But you love games in the right way because you see beneath the graphics. Because really who gives a fuck about the graphics? I do not. Who cares until you have a great graphics card? It's also interesting that you're creating, you're building something in a way that I don't know if you do woodworking or anything, but like, you're building something. We don't really get to build things very often. Then we put them together as modern humans. Right. Yeah. So you get to have your own little outchemical laboratory. Yeah, exactly. And these new PCs, they're like liquid cooled. Yes. So you have like a thing that actually has its own sort of circulatory system. So you're not just hearing this huge fan sound constantly, which is how my life used to be. Yes. Yeah. Right, so I highly, highly recommend going down that path. I need to. You guys would fucking love it. And it's so absolutely, unbelievably satisfying. And then VR comes. Which we talked about that for a second. You, what's your view, what's your take on VR? I'm totally into it, absolutely into it. I will say, I have a lot of friends who are like pretty obsessive about it in like a great way. And I have not seen anything yet that has made me go, made me as obsessive as they are. But also I haven't done it as much as they do. Do you play Minecraft? I don't anymore. I did for a little while. Did you like it? I loved it, of course. Okay, after this, if you have time, we'll go into Minecraft and VR. See if you really see what it looks like inside that fucking universe. I think you're gonna break me. This is not gonna be good. It's, I think I'm partially afraid of like what, how sucked it. I think that's part of it. Well, yeah. It is a monumental time in human history for a lot of different reasons. One of them, and the one that I'm the most interested in is the fact that we're all about to have access to alternate realities instantaneously that are fully immersive. And there's a lot of therapeutic value in that. It's not gonna be just for games. It's gonna be- Oh, I think it's gonna change a lot of things. I think that will be amazing. That part will be amazing. Now, finally, I've got one last question for you. Okay. Because you're great, man. I wish you were still doing therapy, and we weren't friends. Because I would sign up, man. Oh, goodness. The world needs you. Oh, that's such a lovely thing to say. Here's my question. Okay. Now, this isn't like one of those things, like it's a friend of mine, it's not me. It really is a friend of mine. Okay. He's having this kind of like a recurring depression. And he's the sweetest guy ever. But he's getting depressed. He's a sober person. So like ketamine treatment isn't an option. A lot of people are saying that really works. And I know a lot of people listening have got the blues. And so what do we do? Can you give us in a few minutes, just some real world, if I'm somebody who's depressed right now, and I'm just not feeling it, what are some things I could do right after this podcast ends to begin a way out of this pit? Okay, it's a pit. That's exactly what I was gonna say. It is a pit, and it is a pit that wants to keep you in it. And I think I try to tell people to think of depression as not you. It is something that has attached itself to you. It's not you. So I think it's important to first externalize it, a little bit. And it can give some gifts. That's what's weird. People who are depressed to kind of think more analytically, they can really sit with their feelings, which is a thing a lot of people are terrified to do. So it's not, it's an external thing that like, I try to think of them like as big dumb dogs that like jump all over you. It's like trying to do stuff for you. It wants to help, but it just doesn't know what it's doing. It's kind of an idiot. So it wants to have you be more analytical. It wants to have you kind of sit and ruminate and think about your feelings. It just is not great at it. And it kind of ends up swallowing you a little bit. Not great, we don't want that. So first realize it's not you. This is not who you are. This is a thing that's happened to you. It will get better because depression does go in and out. Even if you don't treat it at all, there will be a point where the cloud will break. We just want it to break a little bit sooner because we have lives to lead. And we don't want to feel like this all the time. I don't hate medication. I don't hate medication for depression specifically because it is just such a, sometimes you just, like you said, that pit, you need someone to just give you like a hand. What is this, booster? Booster hoods? Booster hoods. That you can step into and pull yourself out, but you can't rely on the medication to do all for you. And you also can't, but I personally don't think it's terrible to have medication be the thing that helps you. I've seen it help a lot of people. But as a talk therapist, I think you need to see a therapist immediately, make an appointment, tell them you want sliding scale so that you get, and don't go through insurance in my opinion, do private pay out of pocket because if you do that and sliding scale, then you end up paying way less than you would if you go through insurance. That's my personal advice. Go in and talk to someone. Make a list of the things that help you care for yourself the very basics of like showering, going for a walk, writing down how shitty you feel, talking to someone that you care about, watching a show that makes you feel very comfortable. Make a list and make sure you do two of those things a day, just two. Start with one. Two's too many, start with one. I think it's just hard to, when you're in a pit, it's hard to even pull yourself out enough to do anything else. You have to just start small. You can't go from being super depressed to being like fine again. Just start small and if you make little tiny changes, get into a therapist, little tiny changes, you'll start to see things are changing but it does take a little while. How do you find a good therapist? I personally, I really like psychology today, their website has a thing called find a therapist. I just happen to like it because they collect data for all over the country and you can check off stuff like, this is what I personally do. I'm not a lesbian but I always check off gay friendly. I always check off working with fluid gender identities because I want someone who matches kind of how I feel about the world and matches like is willing to see this. If you're more conservative, take those boxes because those exist too. And find- Filled with hate, close my, I'm looking for a close-minded person who's filled with fear and hate. It's Sylvia, great, go see Sylvia. Tick the boxes that not even if they match who you are but match a worldview that you kind of believe in. And then I always tell people audition a therapist. Go into that first session. Don't assume that that's gonna be your therapist from now on and slug through it even if you hate the person and don't like listening to them talk. It's not supposed to be painful. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's not supposed to be painful. So get into that office. If you feel uncomfortable, that's okay. If you feel angry, like don't be in a situation that makes you feel like you are not gonna get anything done. But it's supposed to feel a little uncomfortable because you're telling your truth to a stranger. It's weird. I can't afford a therapist. What do I do? There are places that do free therapy. There are places that do super, super. I'm talking very, very cheap. You really need to ask around about sliding scale because I know a therapist that will charge $10 a session. That's too sweet. Yeah, because they want to help and they know even if you don't make any money, they're good people. They're often overworked, but they're good people. There's also terrible ones out there. They're not all the same. But just keep checking around. But that's what sucks is that you do have to put the effort into it. And often if you're depressed, the last thing you have the energy for, it's hard. It's really hard. If you can't afford a therapist or don't want to go to one, I mean, if you're religious, you can seek that out because that's often free. You can seek out a friend who has had depression and kind of check in with them. Often there's group therapy you can do that's completely free for like depression or anxiety. They'll like be group sessions. It's hard. It does require effort. No one's gonna swoop in and kind of help. You gotta save yourself. This is what it is. There's so many tools out there that can help you, but you do, yeah, you gotta. You gotta make that decision, that existential decision out of nothingness, not based on emotion, right? Just do it. Yes, make the decision. Just try, just that alone can start this awesome cascade. That's what I'm saying. It's a small thing. Making the decision that like I want to get better is a small thing. I think it'll feel huge to people, but it's a very small step. And then you followed up with another step and you followed up with another change, and it's not, you don't ever go like, today is the day that I will be better. No, that's not gonna happen. And then you'll just be disappointed and you'll go back to being depressed again. Small changes, small, tiny changes, little handholds, and then you'll get out of that pit. God bless you. Thank you so much for coming over here. How can people find you? Come to my house, we're just kidding. I am, my Tumblr, where I do the advice stuff is emilyvgordon.tumblr.com. And I always tell people, I am not a therapist on that. I just give advice. Like I can't claim to be your therapist from there. Great advice. You've just heard how talented she is. It's great. I'm also, I'm on Twitter at the Jynomite, within another, T-H-E-G-Y-N-M-O-N-O-M-I. Okay, T-H-E, thank you, sometimes I can't spell. And yeah, I... Indoor kids. Indoor kids is on hiatus currently. How long has it been on hiatus? Little bit, little bit. Because Camille and I, my husband, who I do the podcast with, we made a movie together and then we had to make a TV show together. Would you guys remove all the back episodes? We didn't do that, you can listen to back episodes. That's true, absolutely. So we just were too busy to record for a little bit. So we're currently on hiatus. And... You gotta get back in there. We're, yeah, I know. I know, it's fun. Get the PC, recognize what has happened, and then you will have a 7,000-hour... Our lives will be... I'm telling you, both of you will love it so much. I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm really into LED lighting on my computer. You want it to pulse. I don't know what that means, but I'm excited for you. These computers come with LED lighting systems that like pulse like it's breathing inside. Cause it's a creature that you're building. That's it. Yeah. Thank you so much. All links to find Emily, you're gonna be at, in the comments section of this episode. It's been a wonderful time. Absolutely, this has been great.
