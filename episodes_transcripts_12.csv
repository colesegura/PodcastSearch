And as always, much thanks to the Pertinger Association for their generous grant of $250,000. Coming in, we are coming up to 999. If you notice some reverb on the microphone right now, it's because I am doing the podcast from within a limestone cave in the Kaffu Valley in Egypt. I received a grant from the Pertinger Association for $250,000 to spend a couple of weeks in this cave. I don't know why they gave me all that money to do it. It's just a cave with some limestone and a little cot and a mattress and a bolt that I use for my bodily functions and excellent internet connection. And there's a hot tub in the cave and some cameras all over the cave. And there are beings in the cave that come up from the subterranean tunnels and mount me in the night and floodlights turn on when this happened and the cameras film it for the Pertinger Association. So I'm glad to be part of this group. And I hope that whatever it is they're researching in some way helps not only the people of Egypt but the people of the world. And do I enjoy the nightly mounting that I've been receiving? No, I did these goblin beings. They have distended bellies and very long probing fingers. Their noses are shaven and their eyes are droopy black, jello like mucus holes that wheat rancid tears of garlic scented plasma all over my chest and trembling buttocks. So I would love for the time to go by faster than it is. And I'll tell you, once I get out of this cave and get a good shower and a good night's sleep, I'm gonna find a podcast studio that has some better sound than it. Well, I'll be. Here's a special treat that just fell through the mail slot of the blast door sealing me in the cave. It looks like it's a song sung by the goblins living underneath my cave. Wow, let's hear what they have to say. We are the coblins that live in the tunnels, the run underneath of the cave you've been caving in. We are the ones that prod them to poke you and weep on your buttocks and discreetly film you. You just ignore us, so we keep doing it. You just ignore us, so we will continue. We are the coblins that live in the tunnels, the run underneath of the cave you've been caving in. Whoa, those goblins are deep. They're also incredibly talented musicians. I mean, they're really outside. Like those goblins are saying that if someone in your life is being oppressive or doing things to you that you don't like, if you don't speak up for yourself then they're just gonna keep doing it. But I don't know, I'm gonna have to look deeper into the song to see if that's what it really means. We've got a beautiful podcast for you today. My sweet loves, Adam Strauss is here with us today.

Welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, Adam Strauss. Surprisingly. Tonight. Welcome. Look at you sit you are with us shake hands no need to be blue Welcome to DTFH. Adam, welcome back to the DTFH. Thanks for having me, man. It's good to be here. Do you think of yourself as an advocate for people who have mental illness? No. You know, I thought you were going to ask me because I'm also often asked the question, am I an advocate for psychedelic use? Everyone knows that. Well, no, that is kind of a nuanced answer because I feel like certainly I'm an advocate in the sense that I feel like you should have the right to, to do what you want to do to yourself, uh, full stop. You know, there shouldn't be as long as it's not fucking with anyone else. Mental illness. Um, first of all, are you okay with the term mental illness? You know, it's, I don't love it, but there's not a better term of convenience that succinct. So I use it myself. Um, it's always kind of bothered me. The words always kind of bothered me because it, it, it, I don't know, something about it, it just feels like, you know, I think probably folks like us, folks like us. The colorful people. That's not the right word for the neurologically. That's not the right word for, I like the colorful people a lot better than mentally, just cause you know, like when I think of mental illness, when I think of illness in general, you know, I think of like it in terms of like vomiting, sick, fever, and then like, when I think in terms of what they call mental illness, I just think of people who have picked up patterns of reacting to the universe that don't seem to match the patterns that most people think are good or healthy or normal or societally pleasing patterns. And so sometimes I wonder if the term mental illness is more of a control term, an actual descriptor of the event. I like what you said much more, but it is a lot wordier. So you have a paragraph there, but it is exactly. Cause I think what you just encompassed there is the idea that first of all, um, these are, I think it's useful to think of these things as patterns, as sort of amalgamations of, of, of, yeah, patterns. I can't do better than that. Things we've developed over time that probably served us in some limited context at some point in our life where we thought served us. Right. Uh, and now the second part of what you said that it's not even necessarily that they're maladaptive, though, I think generally they are maladaptive. We'd have to kind of unpack that word, but they, they cause suffering. It seems like that may not be necessary in the people who have these patterns, but there is also an element of, um, you know, this interesting work where you look at schizophrenia in countries where it's not pathologized in the same way as a medical problem, but more as, uh, demonic possession, say, or some form of temporary insanity and the sufferers. And I maybe they're not even sufferers in that context, but the people who have schizophrenia or would be diagnosed with schizophrenia in this country are not given medication instead. They're supported by their tribe, their community. And remarkably, it often seems to be fairly short lived. This is, yeah, this could get into a whole digression, but, you know, I'll throw this out there. I think one of the reasons the term mental illness is in wide currency is certainly the pharmaceutical industry has a huge investment in us seeing it as an illness like any other. And they've advanced this whole idea of chemical imbalance, which is completely false. Really? Yes. Even educated people who suffer from quote unquote mental illness don't realize this. There has, I'll state this without any caveats or any, uh, any qualifications. There has never been a correlation found between any neurotransmitter level and any quote unquote mental illness. People with depression do not have lower serotonin than people without depression. Is that this is a hundred? This is a hundred percent. Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm not going to do the Google search. I'm going to trust you here. Yeah. Research is well, then why are they called? So it started as a reasonable hypothesis where the idea was they noted with certain medications that they increase, they seem to increase in animal models and rats, they increased the availability of certain neurotransmitters and that would seem to change the behavior of these rats in a way. I don't remember the original studies, but it was, but, but essentially would seem to, um, to, to change them in a way that they're, they were more active. They were less quote unquote, you know, sort of depressed acting. And in humans, it also seems like at least with some people giving them these medications can lift some of the symptoms. Right. So a reasonable assumption is, okay, if we're giving you something that seems to increase depression, then probably the problem, the first place was you didn't have enough depression, but that was actually found to be false. Say that again, if we're giving you something that increases, sorry, serotonin. Okay, gotcha. Right. If we're giving you something that increases serotonin. You need more depression. Right. We have to increase your. That's called poos. Yeah. Right. So for, if we're increasing your, your serotonin, uh, and you get less depressed, then it seems reasonable to assume, well, you probably didn't have enough serotonin to begin with, but that link in the chain is false. That is not, there are people with, it's very hard to, to measure depression in the brain and live people for obvious reasons, but when you do like metabolites, cerebral spinal fluid, that sort of thing, there are people with, um, who aren't depressed, who seem to have relatively low serotonin levels, people who are terribly depressed, who have elevated serotonin levels, there's simply no correlation. Oh, and this was discovered decades ago, but the drug companies continue to push this narrative that mental illness is caused by a chemical imbalance because it's good for moving product. You know, no one's going to argue against taking a medication when it's, well, yeah, it's, you know, it's like a diabetic, you know, I'm enough insulin, you need to take insulin, you don't have serotonin, you need to take serotonin. Well, I mean, but I have met people who are on SSRIs and say that thank God for this. If not for this, I would be dead meat. Like it definitely, I've met people who swear by their SSRIs who are, who are, and not only that, but they feel, um, really like resentful of the idea that it's a crutch. Yeah. Oh, and I don't think it's a crutch. I don't, but I'm not saying you're saying that at all. Yeah. But, but, you know, like that's, it does get back to the original, my original question to you, which is that we've so stigmatized mental illness in this society that any kind of like, oh, wait, oh, shit, they're on anti-depressants. Oh, shit, they're taking anti-anxiety medication. Oh, fuck, they're on Adderall. Oh, shit, they're in this. Oh, no, they're not. Oh, no, I hope they're, are you all right? That whole thing happens only with this particular sort of, right. No one's like, oh, you, you, you fractured your vertebrae. You're going to get back surgery. Uh-oh. You're, yeah. Yeah. Okay. No, no, no, no, I'm so sorry. Oh, you're diabetic. Ooh, you need insulin. Maybe you should try a little harder to, uh, so you got a headache. Metabolize your glucose or whatever. You got a headache. All right. Well, you're taking Tylenol, huh? Okay. Well, I mean, do what you need to do, but you know what I mean? Like there's, now that's not everybody, but it is such a stigmatized thing that, uh, and maybe hopefully less so these days, um, that people who sometimes will actually hide the fact that they're taking psychiatric medication for fear of persecution by, uh, or judgment. Yeah. And I, I did, I mean, I was on these medications for 15 years and I do want to make one point clear, though, there is no doubt that there are differences in brain structure between people who suffer for, I guess we'll just keep saying mental illness because we haven't come up with a better term or the colorful people versus those who, who don't. So I'm not saying that there, there are absolutely biological, neuroanatomical correlates to mental illness. Uh, but the whole idea that it's this simple thing. Oh, you don't have enough serotonin in your, you have too much dopamine in your schizophrenic. That's bullshit. Right. And in fact, the drug companies are actually forbidden by the FDA as of, I think like 2006, more than a decade, they've been forbidden for saying this in advertising and they still do it sometimes because it's worth it to them to just pay the fines. Uh, it's, it moves product that effect. They don't say it very much now. It used to be widespread in advertising. They don't say what? That, uh, you know, you may suffer from a chemical imbalance. If you have depressure, you may suffer from low serotonin. Isn't it so? Yeah, exactly. It's like you're a, it's like your car. It's like, Oh fuck, man, it's lowing, it's running low on radiator. And it's comforting for that reason to believe. And again, I was on this stuff to believe, okay, well, I just don't have enough of a certain neurotransmitter. I have too much of another and this, uh, this will top off the radiator. This will even things out. But I, I, part of why I don't like that whole sort of that way of looking at it is I also think it reduces what I think is a profound existential struggle that I think everyone has to engage in at some level, um, at, at some point, maybe not till the moment you die, but I think, you know, where we're set adrift in this unfathomable universe. And yet we have to somehow live our lives and navigate and make choices in the face of profound uncertainty that exists in every moment. Right. So I don't want to romanticize it, but I also don't want to reduce it to, oh, yeah, you just, you know, your, your neurotransmitters are a bit off. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's great. That's beautiful. You're right. And, and, and that, that version of that hyper materialistic version, mechanistic materialistic version of how the human organism works definitely serves pharmaceutical companies in the most extreme way. Yeah. Yeah. And I, I mean, I, there's a great book called anatomy of an epidemic by Robert Whitaker, who actually worked for drug companies for a while. And he makes a pretty persuasive case that I don't want to spend all our time talking about this because I can get pretty indignant and we have as much time as you have. Well, he makes a pretty strong case that essentially these, and again, I want to make the distinction at the outset, because I'm sure there's people listening who are on these medications. Well, let me say this as clearly as possible. If you're on these medications and they work for you, don't fuck with it. Stay out. They absolutely do help some people. Yeah, they do. No question. I, unfortunately, was not one who has helped. And I say, unfortunately, because if they help me, I would still be on them. Right. I have no pride or compunction about that, you know. So, um, and if you're on them and they're not helping you, I would still stay on them or get off them very, very slowly because SSRI withdrawal is no joke. What happened to one of my friends? Yeah. He became, he lost his equilibrium. Yep. He wasn't able to balance you mean like physical. Yeah. Yeah. He couldn't stand up. He couldn't stand up for a few days. Yeah. Cause he cold turkeyed them and it was not good. I tried that once and it was the worst. I would say the worst drug experience I've ever had was abrupt SSRI withdrawal. What was it like? It was, I thought I was going crazy. Um, not to be fair, I've had that thought numerous other times when I'm not going through SSRI withdrawal, but it was, so there was a sort of a very unpleasant physical. I mean, this was 11 years ago when I finally got off of them, but a very unpleasant sort of physical activation, a buzzing kind of. Um, what were the other symptoms? Um, my, a very weird physical feeling in my head. Uh, a buzzing, a physical feeling in your head. Do you mean like an auditory hallucination or like your body was like my body was vibrating, like my body was vibrating. Yeah. There wasn't an auditory component. Um, it felt like sort of like maybe electricity was going through me. Right. Yeah. Again, this was 11 years ago and I, but I remember the first time I tried for a few days cold turkey and I got back on them. The second time I tried, I tapered very, very slowly and got off for about six months. Uh, and I was passed through a draw and then I got on again for two years. And then the third time when I finally got off of SSRI, and I was on lexapro at 80 milligrams, the standard depression dose is 10, 20 milligrams, I got, I took six months to get off and I did it. I still have this in my, uh, in a notebook somewhere, I mapped out this withdrawal plan where I'd take like, you know, 10% less of my dose for a couple of weeks. I had a pill splitter and I was, I was quite scientific about it. And over six months, I tapered to the point that I wasn't taking anything. And the reason that I finally got off, uh, was because I wanted to be able to work with psychedelics and this isn't true for everyone on SSRIs, but it was for me. Psychedelics did not work for me on SSRIs. Now, can, what do you know about psychedelics and SSRIs? Because I have heard that there's certain SSRIs that actually are okay with certain psychedelics. What, do you know of any re like actual research on this and not like, not the personal anecdotes are right, but is there any studies, uh, done on this at all? I remember hearing from, I think the Johns Hopkins people have done a little bit of like collection of data about this, but I don't know. Do you know anything about this? Yeah. I mean, what I know is so generally there's not a safety issue. The, the, the exception there would be stuff that, uh, MAOIs, monamine oxidase inhibitors, cause that can cause, interact and cause what's called serotonin syndrome. Right. So like, you wouldn't want to do ayahuasca when you're on SSRIs. Right. Having said that off the record, even though we're on the record here, I've heard from some pretty knowledgeable people in this community that those fears may be overstated, that people have successfully used ayahuasca and SSRIs and been fine. But the, the sort of dogma would be, and you know, to play it safe, anything that has, uh, an MAOI, MAOI component, you'd want to be really careful with. But my understanding and don't, you know, don't make life decisions based on this is, and my own personal experience is that the, the SSRIs that don't have that component and SSRIs themselves don't actually have that component. None of them that I'm aware of inhibit, uh, that, uh, that chemical, they're safe, uh, but many people notice a very diminished effect to psychedelics. Some find it doesn't work at all, which was me. Yeah. Some, a very, very small number apparently, and this is totally anecdotal, actually find elevated effects to psychedelics. So it certainly modifies the way psychedelics work, which makes sense. Cause the main receptor that these medications work, I think it's the five H two A is also the one that the SS, SSRIs and psychedelics both, um, bind to that receptor. Gotcha. So yeah. So it's, it's kind of, you know, this is the thing, like having a. Pregnant wife, uh, is really interesting in that you realize like for a pregnant person, if you Google, can I, whatever, while pregnant, you know, like, like, like at one point, you know, poor pregnant people, my God, I had no idea, right? There's so many restrictions. I heard it was bad, you know, uncomfortable. I didn't realize it was like, it's a kind of crazy uncomfortable in the sense that like the, the normal avenues of, uh, using like release, sir. Yeah. Like some soothing yourself, some bombs. I'm not even talking about things you eat. Like there's certain bombs that you can't topical stuff that you can't put on your skin. You can't put like, it's just like crazy, man, but the general advice is with almost everything is play it safe because it's either they know a little bit or they don't know anything or they know it sucks. But in all of those, it's like, why risk it? Right. Right. Risk the risk, the lifetime of your offspring for to get a little soothing feeling on your skin for an hour and it's similar with a sweet little baby. You've got growing in your cranium there. It's like, if you, like, do you really want to risk potentially causing some kind of actual damage in the hard wiring of, of your brain by, because I've heard that's what's it called serotonin, selective serotonin reuptake in him. No, the shock syndrome. Oh, oh, serotonin syndrome. Yeah. That is like, it can, it can be fatal. Yeah. It can be permanent. The, I don't know much about the effects other than death. I actually, I don't know that much, but yeah. What, tell me what, what have you heard that I can just fuck you up? I, this is the thing I've been saying lately as I get older and become less ashamed of my laws and fallibilities is that I have a PhD in pro science, meaning that like what happens is like, whereas like doctors, like once I did this interview with Dr. Drew and he's got his desk is just stacked with fucking medical journals and he's reading this shit through the lens of someone who went to school for like 18 years or however long you went to school and absorbing it to learn it because he has to learn it because he has to give prescriptions and work with people and that's how doctors and scientists operate. Whereas me, I will like hear about this thing or that thing. Go to like the front page of a medical journal, read it for approximately three minutes and then move back to Reddit thinking that I have discovered everything there is to know about this thing or that thing. So I hesitate to throw any data out like that, especially this particular topic, which is just like, fuck, man. I mean, for some reason, I've heard that it's just it's can be so damaging. Yeah, I have like an overload of serotonin in your brain that it it the damage is just it's just not a good thing. Yeah. And if you don't die, you're going to have like the worst fucking headache of your life. That's one of the symptoms, right? Have you read that? That it's just like migraine level suicide headaches and it's just like, no good. So, you know, I like, that's why when I heard that there are psychedelics that work OK with SSRIs, I was amazed because I had always just assumed. No, never, you get most of them. I mean, my experience from talking to people, it seems like most people, so this is anecdotal on SSRIs, can experience some effects from psychedelics. And yeah, my understanding don't make life or death decisions based on I don't even have a PhD in pro science. I have I have I have I dropped out of college in that. But I would say I don't I'm not aware of acute dangers of psychedelics that don't involve MAOIs. So the problem is ayahuasca, the actual ayahuasca vine is an MAOI. That's the problem there. So an SSRI combined with a source of DMT that's going to bind tightly to your serotonin receptors that could be toxic is my understanding. Right. But if you're on Prozac or Paxil or Zoloft or Lexapro, all of which I was on, by the way, is on all of them. I don't think you're risking life or limb by using a psychedelic. But the operative word there is think. Well, you need a good psychiatrist. You need a psychiatrist that you can go to and they're not going to. I don't think they're necessarily going to know. Sorry to cut you off, but I just because I always I feel like that's part of. And I guess the reason I I unfortunately, I mean, one of the results of the drug war and the ban on the substances is we have a 40 year blackout on doing research. So SSRIs came up when there was a blackout on even looking at psychedelics. We just don't have good answers for a lot of this. But, you know, there's good. If you go to Arrowhead, if you go to Blue Light. I mean, if you're willing to make decisions based on anecdotal reports, but a lot of them, I believe what you'll find on those message boards is there's plenty of people who have used psychedelics on SSRIs and been OK. And I'm not aware of reports of like toxic reactions for non-MAO inhibiting psychedelics, SSRIs. Well, you know, the problem this is like with psychedelics, it's I think a mirror of what happens to someone who's having a challenging trip. To me, mirrors what happens to somebody who in fact, you could say it's identical to a person who's experiencing a nervous breakdown or some. Moment of crisis, personal crisis or some in that that both of these people will begin to if they're in the wrong environment, they'll begin to demonstrate a kind of shame based around it. So if somebody begins to. So if you're at a party and you are having a challenging trip, you will begin to feel embarrassed. There's a kind of very sad, almost John Wayne-esque sense of what's wrong. I'm supposed to be having fun with my bros, but I'm thinking about my mom died. I'm thinking about how my heart got broken two years ago. I'm thinking about how I'm afraid to do anything in the world that's going to hurt anybody's feelings, and it's making me real sad. But everybody around me is dancing and now I'm feeling real bad because I don't want to bring anybody down. And that's like a microcosm of what happens with somebody who has depression or mental illness in the real world is they're looking around and everybody's either happy or pretending to be happy. And they're like, I don't want to. I don't want to burden you with this thing that's happening to me. And then they also feel like it's their fault. That's the other tragedy is a lot of times people with mental illness, they think they brought it on themselves in this way or that way. They've been taught that, you know, you shouldn't have done that thing or you know your guilt did it or you're too guilty or you blah, blah, blah. Or you can or you can choose not to do it now. Just stop doing it in some way. Yeah, you can just stop that pattern. Yeah. And dance. You'll be fine. And then we get into that whole fucking unravellable, unravellable yarn ball of, you know, free will versus biological determinism and all that shit. But I mean, certainly as someone who's been on the inside and still is sometimes on the inside of of, yeah, just very trapped in my own suffering and thoughts, you know, I can say probably on behalf of most people who've been that state, if it was that fucking easy, don't you think I'd do it? Yeah. I mean, yeah, maybe there is an element of choice. Maybe and that and that is that is legitimate. You know, it's I mean, fuck, I mean, being human, there's so many layers and levels and to know like, yeah, there are times where I'm like, maybe part of me likes getting trapped in this cycle sometime because there is something comforting about it. Well, there's something comforting about imagining you have control. Right. That's a big part of it. Absolutely. Yeah. And I was I was talking to I was I was talking to a woman who she works with psychedelics with a lot of people with PTSD, particularly often trauma from sexual violence. And she said something that never occurred to me. And she herself had had, you know, been blessed at a very young age. And she said, you know, I just thought it was my fault. And that was easier in a way. It was easier. Always. Yeah. Yeah, that never occurred. That this conversation was actually was on the 4th of July. We had this conversation. Yeah. Always. Yeah, it had never occurred to me. And I kind of then thought about it in my I haven't had horrific trauma. But also, yeah, maybe there's a part of the OCD control thing where it's yeah, it's comforting to think, OK, well, maybe I'm choosing this. Man, this book, I mentioned it to you before the podcast. How are you anyway by Annie Lamont? It's blowing my fucking mind. And she just she kind of talks about how so you're a kid and you're in a family where there is mental illness, there's addiction, there's abuse, there's some there's an adult who is demonstrating a pattern that isn't based on anything in the real world. And what that means is that from time to time, mom or dad freaks the fuck out on you or on mom or on dad or on the dogs or on your brother or on your sister. And it's not based on anything that happened that you can see there. You're looking around. There's no cause and effect. You can't say if I don't do this, that won't happen. Right. And so what is because your entire life, you know, your very short life, this person has been the producer of your fucking reality tunnel. Right. It is easier to imagine that you in some way or another instigated this seizure of whateverness that happened, whether it's like physical abuse, mental abuse, drug abuse, neglect, whatever it may be. It's easier to imagine that this is because of you than it is to realize that this person is not actually a good gauge of the way the universe works. Because up until that point, you've based everything, including your language and your like movements on the way they are. You've been tuning yourself to a tuning fork that is not necessarily in tune. And so to fix that problem, you self blame and you self blame because you as a defense mechanism and you keep you carry that with you through your whole fucking life. But what I'm just missing one one link there. Why is that a defense mechanism to self blame? How does that serve the person in that situation? Well, OK, so if I can imagine that daddy is rational and logical and I did something wrong, then that means that I can begin to predict when the next rage is going to happen. Right. And if I can predict when the next rage is going to happen, then I can reduce my anxiety. All I have to do is alter my behavior a little bit. It's like a cargo cult in reverse. It's like, you know, the shit right. So yeah, so soon. Right. So it's now whatever was happening when the rage happened. And then the person who's got the disorder, whatever it may be, let's say it's alcoholism, they get drunk. And when they get drunk, they get mad. And when they get mad, they they fucking they become really angry at you. And then when they become really fucking angry at you, they sober up. And it's more difficult for them. They do the exact same thing the kids doing. It's more difficult for them to imagine that they've got a mental illness and that the reason that they did that fucking thing was not because the kid knocked the milk over, but was, in fact, because they've been drinking every day for the last six years and their liver has turned into a fucking pretzel and their brain is all like withered and fucked up. And oh, and the reason they've been doing that is because they watch their mom get raped, but they forgot about that. So it's easier for them to to to to to be like, well, the fucking kids fucking God, right? If only had done that fucking kids clumsy. Yeah. What the fuck? The kids fucking clumsy. He's got to learn. He's got to learn. He's if he doesn't learn from me, who's he going to fucking learn? Right. It's for his benefit. Yeah, both both parties in this terrible situation are engaged in a kind of desperate self-deception because it's more difficult to come to terms with the reality that the adult has got a little fucking skip in his record or her record that needs to be repaired. And so now we get this like now we have like the story of so many dysfunctional families. How will we anyway? Annie Lamont, check it out. She breaks it down in the most compassionate, concise way where you're like, oh, my God, this is what's happening right now in the world. This is what's going on right now. And and and and and it helps you be compassionate. You know, you know, that's the thing. You know, the thing you said earlier, if I could fix this, I would. Right. That that right there, when you begin to realize that that's most people. Yeah. And like most people, most people, if they could fix it, they would. Yeah, maybe everyone, everyone. I think they're for sure there might be some people outside of that, you know, because we have to like we don't want to just say that everybody is like, you know, without guilt, you know what I mean? Everybody is without like everybody. Well, you still have responsibility for your choices and the consequences of those choices. I don't know if that's what you mean by guilt, exactly. But I do think, I don't know, maybe this is an naive belief. But I guess I do think people don't want to cause suffering for themselves or others unnecessarily. I believe that too, man. Yeah, I really do believe that. It's one of the real heartbreaking realizations that you have when you realize that it's not as though the world is teeming with evil men and women. It's that the world is teeming with people who are doing the best they can do right now. And they're trying to avoid their suffering and paradoxically, in most cases, certainly in my case, you know, we could talk about this more in the context of OCD, but to keep it general, in my case, by trying to avoid my pain is the almost the sole cause of suffering in my life because I have a pretty fucking amazing life. Like the universe has been quite merciful to me, which is a whole big existential question I have. Why am I so fucking lucky? But putting that aside, yeah, most of what I'm hurting is generally because there is some there's some source of pain, some loss that I just want to avoid. And I'm going to run kicking and scream, I'm going to try to crush it. Well, wait, let's reverse three seconds and go back to the thing you said right before that, which is like, I have all these great things in my life. Yeah. Why am I so lucky? Yeah. Yeah, let's explore that a little bit, you know, I think that that's a really, I think it's funny because the two things that are certainly related and and well, it's sort of you could go back to the title of that book, which I love. Hallelujah. Anyway, yeah, you know, yeah, I suffer sometimes quite a bit. And knowing that it's unnecessary often does not make it easier. Well, you know, a lot of people, but yeah, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yeah. But a lot of people, you know, and I don't know if this was you, but a lot of people when they're growing up because the what they're growing up in is a pretty chaotic situation. I mean, I mean, just like in just just in general, like that beautiful thing you said about we're sailing this boat through this is crazy. You're making it more beautiful. I don't think there was any nautical metaphor. But no, you take no, I want to hear yours now. Let's just keep. Yeah. Into this into this world, which is a hurricane of phenomena. And we're standing in the middle of this hurricane of phenomena. And if you sort of look back generationally, I'm I'm saying, let's pop back to like, I did this terribly depressing, horrifying Google search, which was just like how many people own slaves in the 1800s? I think it was 1830. I could be wrong about this. Might have been a little earlier, but it was something like, and again, bro science friends, I skim, I go back to God of War. And this is my fault. I'm not a doctor. But it was it was definitely more than 100,000 people in the south had slaves in the 1800s. Like my Uber driver picked me up the other day and we're having this conversation. And he's from around where I'm from in the south, except he's black and I'm white. And we didn't say anything, you know, about how we ended up in the south. But the way I ended up in the south was I, my grandparents from Belgium got on a boat and they they were on top of the boat. Whereas the way he got to the south, I don't know for sure about this, but he was not standing at the time. His ancestors were not standing at the time. They were they were the propulsion system in the in the hold. Yeah, or just chained and right thing and shitting all over each other. And that's the 18. That's like that's that's what my grandpa. That's when our grandparents were alive. That's 300,000 people, I think was the number, but I could be wrong in the south. And that's just slavery. Yeah, that's not including all the other incredible traumatic shit right happening all over the fucking planet and particularly everywhere. Right. Yeah, that's two generations ago, man. Right. I think two, maybe three. That's three generations ago. So we're three generations away from that, two generations away from the Holocaust. Yeah, which was my relatives. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So so so when you begin to like realize like we're born in, we're born into a hurricane, yeah, we're born into an epigenetic hurricane where the people that we that give birth to us, many of them have PTSD. The United States has been at war 93 percent of its time. There's been 23 years that the United States has not been at war, which means that a great many people are suffering from PTSD and they're self-treating with alcohol. You're born into that kind of world, man. And you've got to think you've got to figure out a way to make it make sense. And the way you make it make sense is you either imitate the person who's crazy or you fight against the person who's crazy. And this produces this horrific kind of wobble, which is there's no middle point here. You're either like, my fucking dad was a motherfucker who fucking abused me and he was a fucking drunk, or you have a fucking beer in your hand and you're looking at your kid and you're like, he's got the fucking milk in a piece of shit. Yeah, because that's what your dad did. Yeah. And so where is the middle? And it's like, that's the place that's like, we've got to figure out a way to tune ourselves to that, you know. And I think that's what we're kind of looking at in the world right now. Forgive me for the rant. No, I like the rant. And I mean, yeah, but I would go a step further and say, all right, let's even look at the 23 years without war. Let's look at it on a on a societal level, but also even I'll bring it back to myself, not just because I'm a narcissist, but because that's I do have a PhD in myself, at least, if not in many other things. I my I had a pretty stable family of pretty stable upbringing. Now, if you want to talk about epigenetics, yeah, a lot of my relatives were in Eastern Europe when World War Two broke out and none of them made it over. So describe I have a feeling you definitely have a more concise and a deeper understanding of epigenetics than I do. And can you describe that a little bit for people listening? I actually I don't know much about it. What I know, I'll give a plug. Joe Tuffer, who I also I think I have an extra copy of this book. Duncan, I'll shoot it over to you, has a book called The Fellowship of the River where he talks about epigenetics in the context of psychedelics. And so that actually my knowledge comes mostly from him. He's also the one who when I did your podcast last time, the one who who was who was tending to me when I thought I was dying on Iowassica deep in the jungle of Peru. And but but so my understanding is, you know, it was thought until some recent time that, you know, genetics determine certain traits, physical, emotional, mental, etc., which is true, but there's also epigenetics, which is basically genes can be turned on or turned off by environmental factors and stressors. And once they're turned on and turned off, that's now part of your genetic makeup and it can be passed on. So if if, you know, if let's say my grandmother had horrific trauma, she was in the States, that's why she made it. But her relatives, her mother, her sisters back in Lithuania or wherever, were all exterminated. That must have been terribly traumatic for her. She subsequently gave birth to my that that trauma could have activated, almost certainly did activate an expression of certain genes. And then those genes are activated. And I'm I'm going to say I'm 60% confident of what I'm saying. Now, I'm not highly confident, but I but the general idea is that is that once those genes are activated, now she has my mother and those genes can be passed on to my mother that would have otherwise been dormant. Yeah. So essentially, the really put it in the broadest strokes possible, your environment affects your genes, which then is passed on to future generations. So, you know, the the the son, the grandson, the great grandson of the slaves and the slave owners are both carrying the genetic inheritance of that. In a sense, we're carrying the genetic inheritance of all of our relatives. Yeah, that's right. Or potentially, I mean, it's yeah. Well, I mean, and I again, like what we've done here in this conversation is to get incredibly mechanistic, you know, something I was railing against earlier, which is to sort of like break down like pathological, anti social behavior patterns to a genetic level. But I think it's good to start where we can start, you know, but I have to jump in because it also pulls it out of the mechanistic thing in a cool way, because if you believe in free will, which is a whole fucking thing, then this also implies that our choices can change our genes. Right. Let that sink in. Your choice is your choice to whether or not to drink ayahuasca, but also your choice to be compassionate to the woman in front of you at the airport, who's too slow taking her shoes off, which is an experience I had yesterday. Holy shit, dude. That just is fucking insane. So yeah, so it's like, OK, OK, this is what it's like. It's like, right. So if we go off the premise, which these days seems like it might be a little controversial, which is that people are doing the best they can right now or doing what I would say people are trying to doing the we have to define doing the best they can. I don't think everyone is doing the best they can for the good of humanity. I know I'm not most of the time, but they're doing the best they can to get by, minimize their own suffering. And I guess this is how I'd look at it for myself. First and foremost, I make choices based on my own selfish interests, not a hundred percent of the time, but I'm going to say mid 90s. OK. Majority of the time. OK. But then once my own basic choices are my own basic needs are met, or it's not operative, you know, I have enough food in my belly, so I don't have to worry about what I'm going to eat. Then when I can do something that benefits someone else that doesn't have too high of a cost, I deem to myself that I'm going to do that. OK. And I think that's true of, I think everyone at some level, I really do. OK. Yeah, I think that's that's what I'd say the best we can. And I don't think there's anything to be ashamed about that, by the way, if that's you. And I think instead of thinking like, OK, here's a better way to put it is this. Yeah. Instead of thinking like, let's create a premise. Here's a very fun premise to work with personally, which is you, the listener, and you and me. Right now, in this moment, you're doing the best you can. You went through some shit, man, and now you're doing the best you can right now. You and you can look at yourself and your brain might tell you or your conditioning might tell you, no, I'm not, man. I should be jogging. I should be less selfish. I should be kinder. And usually people will refer to the past. So they'll right away be like, no, you know, I fucking introduced my brother to heroin and he died. So no, I'm not doing the best I can now. It's like, no, no, no. Right now, play around with the lens of the concept. With a lens. Look through the window. Even if it's even if you have to do make believe like it, like it's in other words, like right now, I could say to you thought experiment sort of. Yeah, I could tell. I don't know about you, but many people I could say right now, like right now, you and me, we could do it right now. Yeah, let's pretend that you and I are police officers. Let's just pretend as an acting exercise. Yeah. Like we it's easy to do. We can we can do some really shitty improv. Dude, you fucking can you? That is too tie dye. You're not allowed to have that much tie dye hanging on the wall, man. That's local regulations. I know. Fuck it, man. I'm going to keep it up there. Sorry, man. Sorry. We got it. We got to pull you in. Yeah. Reeducation. Reeducation. That's like tapestry. Yeah. I don't know what you're calling it, but that is clearly forbidden by local regulations. I knew it, dude. It's a purple, purple. You can have purple and you can have pink, but not in the same tapestry. Yeah. This is not the first time we've come by. We've given you multiple warnings. Dude, let go back. I'm going back for life, man. You are. It's the three strikes rule. So OK. So like so. OK. So easy. That's easy. It's going to my acting reel. Easy. Easy to do. But if you do try to do the exact same thing with yourself, which is just imagine it right now. You're doing the best that you can right now. And imagine that back there when you did all that shit that you did. That you shouldn't have done. You're right. That was fucked up, man. It hurt people and we all wish that we hadn't, but we did, right? And you just imagine that, right? But right now, you're doing the best you can. You're doing the best you can right now. And just sit and play around with that idea where it's like, if you're doing it, you're doing it. And now, if we add to what you just said, which is so fucking trippy, which is like, you are holding this kind of clay, which has been being carved upon by your ancestors right now. And this clay, it's got all these crazy signatures and glyphs. Grews. And this little thing, this clay, man, this is what you're going to pass on. Down the line, right? And during this little brief, it's almost like we're on a conveyor belt, a temporal conveyor belt. And our lives are when this ball of clay, this genetic mass that's been being refined or... Like a relay race kind of maybe, yeah, getting passed down. And we can start refining it right now. And we are whether or not we're aware of it, I think at some level. I mean, there's another way to look at it, which is the whole idea of Hebb's law, which is essentially the sort of common formulation is neurons that fire together, wire together. So that basically, when you engage in certain behaviors, repetitively, it becomes easier and easier and more and more natural to engage in those behaviors. Like muscle memories. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so I think of that often when I find myself in the throes of some sort of obsession that, all right, I want to get free of this, not just because I don't want to suffer necessarily now, but every time I do this, I'm kind of laying down the groove a little bit deeper to go into this. And so if I can break free of this, which is a whole process of not fighting it, but actually surrendering to it, the payoff is A, I'll get free often by surrendering to, we're kind of thinking a little bit of right term, but by surrendering to pain, it may intensify the experience of it in the short term, but the fruits of that are freedom. So I'll get out of whatever obsessive rudiment or depressive rut, you know, you or someone may be in more quickly, even if it hurts a bit more, kind of ripping off the Band-Aid metaphor. But the other payoff there is I'm starting to lay a different path down. And next time, it's going to be a little bit easier for me to go down this path of choosing surrender and choosing ultimately peace rather than fight and struggle or wallow, whatever the pattern is. Right, I love it, man. And that's kind of self-compassion, you know, where it's like, for me, what, where it gets really interesting is like, I have noticed that I get way more excited if I start doing stuff that isn't for me than if I'm doing stuff for me, right? It's enlivening in a different way. Yeah, it taps into something different. There's a different feeling. What's your, what's like one of your favorite movies that you've seen recently? I don't really watch movies much. And that's a weird thing to say. What's the last movie I saw that I really loved? Well, what about like a book or like, what's, what's something you really like or a song, a song? What's like a song? It's like, I hate being asked these questions. Yeah, yeah, I know. It's like a Ryan Spencer movie. Exactly. What's the right answer here? Give me a moment. What's a, let's see, I, all right. The last book I read, it was the best dollar. It's quite popular. George Saunders is one of my favorite authors. He writes short stories. But he came up with his first novel about a year ago called Lincoln at the Bardo. And I finished that recently. Did you like it? Yeah, I loved it. It was, I mean, it's, his short stories are, I may prefer them slightly. It was kind of like an elongated short story. But yeah, there were passages of it that were transcendent and kind of, he to me, he sort of taps into, into sort of a psychedelic state of consciousness without, like I can kind of be, he can bring his readers into this state of kind of intimations of oneness, of order, of, so yeah. Was there a passage that you remember in particular that you get like paraphrase? Yeah, there were, there were, I mean, sometimes the language is just so beautiful. So yeah, there's one passage where he's talking about, it's in the first person and it's this, so Lincoln is, you know, Abraham Lincoln. And so this, this person is living in the whatever 1850s or so. This guy who I think is in his 50s and he's a widower and he marries some 15 year old woman. And he's explaining, he's narrating at this point, the narrator's shift in this book that, you know, you may think it was kind of like this, I'm going to avail myself of the marital prerogative, an older man taking advantage of this younger woman, but that's not how it was. You know, I didn't lay a finger on her, but it was, he talks about how his life, I'm getting goosebumps, having this younger woman, this very vital force, he says, it's like a, a freshwater river was suddenly routed through my house. And there's an awareness of something, I'm not going to get the language quite right, but something like vital and wild and ravishing, running through my house now. And it just enriches his life in a way that he couldn't have anticipated. That's fucking cool. Yeah. Now you got goosebumps. Yeah, yeah. And what happened right there is you shared something really beautiful with me and everybody listening, and you got to relive that moment of joy that you had the first time you read that passage. And it became exciting again. It became completely new and almost better than new in a certain way. So if I am with a friend who has never seen, like for example, my wife has never seen Groundhog's Day, the movie with Bill Murray, which I think is one of the most beautiful, perfect depictions. That's one I have seen actually. And it's amazing and more than once appropriately enough. It's so beautiful because it's like, to me, if you want to really see like a great depiction of what happens when like, it's a beautiful metaphor for when your life gets stuck in a pattern or rut. And yet you can make different choices within that same rut. I never thought of it that way. That's so beautiful. And she's never seen it. I've seen it a bunch of times, but tonight I'm going to fucking barbecue some hamburgers and we're going to watch Groundhog's Day. And I'm excited just like I was seeing it for the first time because I'm getting to share it with somebody who's never seen it. And that, to me, is if I just was like just like thinking like, you know, tonight I'm just going to sit down and watch Groundhog's Day again. It'll be cool, but it's nowhere near as exciting to me as like, oh fuck, this is awesome. This person has seen this show. So like, to me, it's way more satisfying, way more exciting to do things for other people than for ourselves, not for some kind of pious reason or holier than that reason, but literally because it appears that there's something built into us that makes it feel better to give than to take. And that makes a lot of sense to me, not just from the perspective of tribalism, but also just from a general hive, any kind of thing trying to function together in a rhythmic patterned way, teamwork, et cetera, it all makes sense. And so this obsession with self-service is like a true brutality to ourselves. And we don't even fucking realize it, man. And so I agree with, I agree that, yeah, it is a form of brutality. I like that towards ourselves, depriving ourselves of sharing and giving. But I'm not sure I fully agree with the idea that it feels better to give than to take. I think it sort of depends on the context. It depends on what you have, what you need, and also who you're sharing with, right? If I said Duncan, yeah, you have a crazy busy schedule. You only have two hours free tonight. What I want you to do is watch Groundhog Day with this, with the guy who some random guy going to pull up the street or someone who you don't particularly like. Now, you might get satisfaction from sharing it still, but if there's more of a cost, I think it's, and I think this comes back, not to be too contrived in terms of tying it together. But I think this is part of the reason why it's fucking hard being human, because it's not so simple as it's better to give than receive. It's always these nuanced things that depend on all these different factors in our experience and navigating what's going to, what our own needs, what to give to other people. But I absolutely do agree with the last thing you said, which I think depriving ourselves of giving or sharing, it's a form of violence against ourselves. And one that I think many of us regularly practice because it's not really, you know, there's so much emphasis in society now about efficiency and output and maximizing. And, you know, people give lip service to helping other people, but it's not valued in the same way as, you know, what did you get done today? What have you accomplished? How's your career going? Yeah, not at all. And in fact, it's the phenomena of the way we treat our caretakers in this society. It's like, if you really want to understand how it is, we brutalize our caretakers. Nannies get treated like fucking shit, man. Nannies, teachers in terms of teachers. Oh my God, you're a maid. What? Oh my God, what? You keep people's houses clean. What do you mean you're marrying a maid? Surely, like, is that's all he or she's doing, right? You know, like, when you look at that shit, it's like, you can see that our society has a fundamental confusion, it seems, like when it comes to the value of giving to other people or caring for other people to the point where jobs where people care for other people, unless they're like incredibly sophisticated, like a brain surgeon, a brain surgeon walks into a room, right? And everyone's like, Oh my God, it's a fucking brain surgeon. A plumber walks into a room, right? Who like, we have to have plumbers. Yeah. Or there's going to be shit everywhere, right? But a plumber status is going to be less than a brain surgeon and certainly a maid's status and certainly a server's status. Like, you know, someone who's a god forbid, you should have to like become a waiter. Like there's so many actors and artists who desperately want to avoid making money as a waiter or a server, not because they don't want to do the work or because they're lazy, but because of the shame attached to serving other people and not making money from their art. And it's all related to the stigma against serving other people, which to me is there as a form of like vast misunderstanding. And I think that we could actually tie the capitalist mentality of profit into service as long as we remove ourselves from the idea that money is the only currency, right? Yeah, you know, yeah, that's the move. Yeah. And I think part of it is I mean, a brain surgeon generally gets more respect in society than a maid because it is a objectively hard, it requires a higher degree, I was gonna say harder and then it's objectively harder is maybe a silly thing to say because it depends what domain you're defining it based on. But certainly there's a lot more training. There are many fewer people who can be a successful brain surgeon than can be a maid. So I think part of it is just the scarcity thing. But I do think part of it is yeah, you know, it's there's look at the way people treat server. Yeah, it's way be. I mean, it's like, it's not just like, and also the other thing is like, man, when you consider like fucking brain surgery, like, holy fucking shit, what a rush, dude, like, I mean, my fucking God, you're opening someone's fucking head. And like, you're like in there like if you I actually interviewed a brain surgeon once and he started crying because then he had done an operation, he got tears in his eyes because the night before or the day before it went on for hours, he'd done an operation. And he was explaining to me that one, if his hand trembles a little bit, that somebody's memory of their childhood gone, gone, talk about playing God. Yeah, that's scary. It's a scary fucking job. The stakes are really high. And he invested a lot of money to get to that point. But and so yeah, brain surgeons are fucking awesome, man. But also that dude gets applauded. Yeah, saving like that dude's a fucking he's Dr. Strange. He's badass. He's amazing. It's a fucking brain surgeon. A maid, right? Who we love maids, we love them doing at the hotel. Oh my God, you walk out. That's one of the coolest things about being on the fucking road. Yeah, you're living in some magic. My bed is rent made. Yeah. Yeah, you walk out, you come back, your bed's made, there's mints on it, maybe the fucking shampoo's been refilled, everything's polished down. And it smells good in there. And you're like, this is fucking fantastic. We need it every day. It's a huge industry all over the planet. You can clean your own shit. And there's nothing wrong about it. But if you've got a little bit of extra money, you're going to pay for a maid because it's fucking great. And you're busy or whatever. And they're great. They're fucking great. But so what I'm saying is, yet, yeah, there is somehow a stigma attached to this, a hierarchy of yeah, it's a hierarchy. Exactly. But it's an icky stigma. Yeah, it is. And it's not just based on skill sets. And it's not just it's not just based on like where we're doing an analysis of skillfulness. When we look at a person or how much work they put into their profession or this profession, it's that we've got a kind of caste system that's based on employment in this country and isn't based on a person's compassion, or love, or generosity, or giving. And that is capitalism. I think that is, I mean, like you said, unless if you decouple capitalism from money, which is certainly possible, it is right. Money doesn't have to be the end point that we're measuring in terms of creating value and in terms of trading for goods and services. But if it is, then yeah, and I think but you said caste system, I think that's a perfect phrase because the thing to keep in mind is so much of this is not due to talent and ability. That is a factor. But a lot of it, I mean, here, let's bring it back to your experience. Maybe that it's not coincidental that you were the one, you were the passenger in the Uber, and the former, the son of former, or grandson of former slaves was the one driving the Uber. There's wealth concentrates generation to generation in this country. Exactly, dude. That's another thing. Exactly. I forgot to mention that. That's the most fucking awkward point. That is the most awkward point. And that's why the whole reparations thing, man. I feel like to me, reparations are no brainer. I mean, especially when you look at people who got wealthy, essentially off the free labor of slaves, give that fucking money to the descendants of those slaves. I mean, it's easy to say it's hard to actually implement. But to me, yeah, anything that sort of undercuts this perpetual reinforced class system where the people who have money, their offspring have more opportunities. Therefore, they're making more money. And therefore, their offspring have even more opportunities. Let's face it, man. Reparations are not going to happen in this country without a bloody revolution or without a shift in consciousness. Right. I was going to say, yeah. That is so profound. And I don't think that's impossible. And if maybe this is, you know, this is where we bring it back to psychedelics, I think. Well, it's not fucking impossible. No. But it is a massive, massive, massive shift from we're at today. Absolutely. No, I think it's like what you were saying. If we decouple money from capitalism, which can be done, and it certainly can be done. And one example of it, for sure. I mean, if you really start thinking about the various, it's really interesting to think about all the all the different forms of currency that exist, that it can be quantified right now. Right. So we have quantification mechanisms in place right now for some very interesting forms of energy. Specifically, this is what's being called cryptocurrency is one of the examples where we've got this bizarre way of monetizing Bitcoin mining, like energy being spent to crack to like do these like long term encryption or decrypt. Yeah, right. So like, so that's one form of currency. And that's a currency that can be directly converted into the currency of this sort of the same, isn't it? Because it's energy that is then assigned to value, which I'd say energy of the the made or energy of the brain surgeon, which is also assigned to value in the form of pay that then can be redeemed for other goods and services. I don't see cryptocurrency as it's still like money. Oh, it's a but but this is what the I'm trying to like move down the line. So we have cryptocurrency, which is like some kind of and I won't even fucking pretend. Yeah, cryptocurrency. Anytime anybody starts telling me about fucking cryptocurrency, I like listen as hard as I fucking can. And then there's weird feeling. I get this weird feeling. And I'm just like, well, I'm going to think about it some more. You're telling me at some point fourths are going to be able to pay for themselves through the blockchain. I don't know how that works. But it sounds fucking awesome. And I pray to God that it's real. But like if we if we keep but but we are looking at a way that technology is quantifying a kind of energetic system that can actually be exchanged for real money, right? So in the same way, on a satanic level, we have a long time ago quantified our life energy in terms of hours and minutes and seconds, which we then sell to this person or that person in the form of activity. And that's like labor, right? So but then if you if you keep following this interesting and relatively according to based on human evolution, new quantification, which is time, right? That's where we had sundials and shit, but the precision of time and everybody being attuned to some clock based on Pacific said based that you know, like, it's wild and it's relatively new, right? But it's a quantification mechanism that allows for a kind of voluntary slavery that we call capitalism, which is is the way things are currently working right now. I mean, it also it also allows for people to come together and creative projects. Also, it can be used for good or ill. Okay, okay. There you go. There you go. That's exactly right. It's a tool. That's a tool, right? But I think it's a tool that generally causes more harm than good. It is caused a great deal of harm. And but if you keep following this interesting form of quantification, then you start running into like these really new technological quantification mechanisms, which is likes and faves. Yeah. So now we have another form of currency. Now this currency is really interesting in the sense that it cannot be directly converted into money. I cannot directly convert my retweets or or or likes into money. Unfortunately, good, but I can't I can't do it. But you know, weird way, it can be converted into money, but it takes a couple of right, there's a few steps you have more influence. Therefore, people are advertisers on this on your podcast are going to pay more money. And right, wow, yeah, might start giving you stuff. And right, you get more lucrative gigs. Yeah. And so right here, this is what I've come to lately, Adam, and this is where it gets really fucking trippy, get trippy, man. This is where it gets really fucking trippy. So there's a term that gets thrown around all the time. And the term is fear mongering, right? And so the idea is it's the selling of fear. I saw it right. You had a tweet about this recently. Yeah, yeah. I've had this epiphany book. Yeah, it's all completely related to Paul Simon. Paul Simon has this. There's a song called The Coast and in the song called The Coast, the lyric is and I'm going to sing it. Yeah, to talk about all drum. I don't have any. Talk about fucking fear mongering, get ready to be afraid when you hear my voice. But the song goes, This is a lonely life, sorrow everywhere you turn. Now that's worth some money. Think about it. That's worth some money. Think about it. That's worth some money. Think about it. That's worth some money. Now, when you think about it, it really is worth money. And we can start at the very top where who does who makes the most money off of this off of spreading fear. Well, it's the it's the military industrial complex. We need people to be afraid so that we can have war. But we are weapons manufacturers and specifically, but people who make guns too, you know, we need that. But like it doesn't stop with that. It keeps going and it's hitting Twitter now, which is that it because if you and I and this ran is about to end, I swear to God and thank you for enjoying it. I want us pulling it out of me. You and I are walking down a path in the forest, right? And one thing's for sure. If at the beginning of the walk, our guide, let's say we have a guide, if the beginning of the walk, our guide says to us, Hey, listen, I'm going to point out the trees to you as we go on this walk. It's part of the payment that you're paying. But for an extra $10, I'll also point out the poisonous snakes. You're going to pay for them to point out the poisonous snakes. It's like, all right, here you go. I don't want to get bitten by a fucking snake, right? So our minds are programmed to not really look at the trees, because we're all the green. You could see all the fucking green, but the fucking snake is going to stand. Regativity bias. Yeah, it's it makes sense to attend to danger better than it makes sense to attend to good things. Exactly. Yeah, absolutely. Meaning that if I tweet, this comes back to mental illness too, but let's go. I want to hear you finish your point. But yeah, the conclusion of it is this. If I tweet anything scary, anything scary, and I do it in a way that's that's like really, really fucking polarizing and like really intense, I am going to get way more retweets and way more likes than I'm going to get if I tweet something that isn't scary, because the human brain is programmed to fixate on fear. So what we have here is an unintentional monetization in the form of likes and retweets of the spreading of fear and the accidental programming of people by the whoever's on Twitter to like want to tweet scarier things because when they don't tweet scary shit, they get less retweets and likes. So now we have this terrible, what would you call it, a feedback loop where all of a sudden somebody's like, Oh my God, every time I tweet, they don't even think it. They're just like, Whoa, that got 20,000 fucking retweets versus I would say maybe not necessarily scary because I don't see a lot of scary tweets on Twitter because Twitter, I mean, I'd say news is more like that, right? Where news about threats is going to get more eyeballs Twitter. But I certainly see it with maybe negative or polarizing things. Let's call it negative, maybe as a broader term than scary. Okay, that's a good way to put it. If I tweet something negative, if I tweet something polemic, I'm going to get a fuckload of more retweets and faves that I'm going to get. If I tweet something that is like, like, for example, if you tweet just something basically sweet, well, that's fucking embarrassing. Like if you were to tweet, like just like, you guys, I just want to say, I really love being alive. I want you to test this, this, this, this theory. Oh, I want you to really love being alive. I because I feel like you would get, I mean, it also depends on who you are, what your persona is in terms of who your followers are. But I feel like if Duncan Trussell tweeted, I really love being alive. I think you'd, I think you'd get some good metrics, bro. That's the horrible sentence, get some good metrics, bro. No, but here's where this is where it gets, it gets back to the idea of, well, if we can decouple capitalism for money, for money, and if we've all been conditioned by being born in this, in a capitalist society, and we've all been programmed to want to have more profit, and there's maybe no way to do that, man, it's just etched into our souls by now, or we were born into it, our parents were born into it, then maybe one of the answers would be to recouple, to couple, to somehow connect profit to the spreading of love instead of just social good. And I, and there have been attempts to, I don't know much about them, but there have been sort of utopian attempts to, to do something like this, because you could have a metric of compassion. How much love did you give today? I mean, it requires quantifying it in some way. And that's icky for so many people, because they're like, fuck that, I don't want to quantify love, I don't want to do that. But it's also icky quantifying work, you know? I mean, yeah, yeah, saying that, okay, well, you're made, this is worth this much. I mean, it's mostly we do it based on supply and demand, right, rather than the intrinsic value of the work. The essence of the thing is, if there were a way to just introduce people to a pretty amazing thing, which is that when you give something sweet to another person, whether, and it doesn't have to be some massive thing, but when you offer out into the world, something that's like, truly compassionate, truly loving, not like just, just something, anything at all, anything at all like that, you feel better than when you offer up to the world something that's really scary or dark or like really fucked up, like it's, you just feel a little better, right? And maybe there is a reward mechanism built in, but right now the reward, people are being around because it might feel, it might feel better to do something good in isolation, but the retweets that you get feel even better that you do from, from spreading something negative is what you're saying. Yeah. Right. Yeah. So we're all, we have this disincentive to, to spread love in some way, but I don't, I mean, maybe this is, go ahead, please. I don't know if I fully agree with that. I think if we're talking about the news, absolutely, absolutely fucking literally, right? I mean, people, it's there because again, we have, we evolved with this propensity to look for danger or threats. So the, you know, the number one forwarded news articles on, you know, nytimes.com are generally going to be something, you know, fucked up, Trump did or something that their readership is going to consider threatening or scary, but social media, I, because I feel like I feel like there's a growing recognition of the price that we're paying for the world we live in, the world that we've created, which is a world built of technology, which fosters these ephemeral connections, but ultimately limits, you know, when you're in front of a screen, you're not connecting the way, the way you are person to person. So I think the, the fruits of the world that we've created are isolation, isolation, loneliness, fear. And I think as people recognize that more and more, there is this sort of countervailing kind of, well, let's, let's try to change things, let's try to spread love. And I think psychedelics are, I think a tool for that, but also I think the culture around them, that sort of the second generation culture that's growing up around them now, I think that's, that's part of it is, is wanting to do things differently. And I mean, what I just said is very vague, but I guess the point I'm making is I, I'm not convinced that, and I'm, you know, I've seen some stuff that's gotten a huge amount of retweets or likes that has been positive, generally from celebrities, you know, it's not, but again, like, you know, getting into the positive negative thing, I'm really being like hyper reductive in a kind of annoying way. What I mean is like, another way to put it would be people who have like a really big following on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, they seem to be somewhat oblivious to the fact that they are tuning forks and that the vibration that they are, what would you say, the frequency they're resonating at is affecting and directly impacting massive amounts of people who are tuning themselves to that frequency, right? So the, the, the, they don't realize it. It's not like these people aren't nefarious or evil or they're, everyone's doing the best they can. I think I've, you have to bet on the podcast before this, this professor was teaching conditioning. And before he came to class, apparently the students, when I was studying psychology, they told the study before it came to class, the students began to made it like I came with an idea, which was if he's on the left side of the room, we're going to act like we're paying attention. If he's on the right side of the room, we're going to ignore him. This is great. Yeah. And so by the end of the class, he was only standing on the left side of the room. They'd completely made him move to the left. And he wasn't aware of this consciously. Yeah. Right. He wasn't aware of it. Right. So what I'm saying is these, right, right. People are fucking tuning forks. Right. And so they're radiating out this message or signal. But it's a feedback loop too, because what their audience is retreating is going to cause them to move to good or evil left or right. Exactly. So it can only be polarizing in the sense that if they're allowing themselves in any way, shape, or form to be influenced by the reaction of the people that they are sending the signal to, then they are going to either very slowly or very quickly be pushed to one side of the room or the other side of the room instead of having like a real balanced output. And so that so, so I think what we're witnessing is one of the many things predicted by folks who talk about the singularity and the impending technological singularity is going to be preceded by many kinds of disruptions. Most of them are, we're fully aware of the unemployment being one of them, the impending awakening in some form of computers. Like intelligent computers and people not having jobs because computers are doing everything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One of the things that maybe is a little less as it hasn't been predicted as much or hasn't been talked about as much is the fact that by becoming connected in a technologically enhanced way to massive amounts of people, we're unintentionally tuning huge populations to some kind of frequency. And if the frequency that you're tuning them to is a frequency that's coming from you accidentally being out of tune, then you're basically detuning shit tons of people. And now we've got all these people who are a little out of tune. And this is called, God forgive me for saying it, the United States of America. It's supposed to be a choir. It's supposed to be a song. It's a song that's made up of lots of different people. And now that was the dream. It obviously hasn't been that way. Maybe the fucking ever. But what a beautiful dream. Yeah. United States, right? A United State. And I'll tell you, man, if I've got to like unite, or if I want to like tune to some kind of frequency, I don't want to tune to a frequency where of like panic. I don't want to also don't want to tune to a fucking frequency of naive delusion. I don't want to tune to a frequency of somebody who's like, everything's roses, baby. There's fucking tigers, fucking goddamn like, you know, giant eagles flying by a fuck you, bitch. There's fucking death, right? But I'll tell you this, if I've got tigers in my jungle, and I've got giant eagles flying overhead, I for sure, if I'm the leader, and I'm going to do everything I can to calm us down first, like guys, we got some fucking giant eagles, we got some fucking tigers, but we can handle this together. And we can do it in a way that doesn't have to be scared that does because we're going to function way better if we're not afraid. That's how I see it. Yeah. Like, and so there's actually more of a, I think, I think some people maybe they're not realizing that that they're what they're saying is certainly true, which is like, man, fuck, we've been at war 93% of our fucking history. We're dropping bombs on fucking kids. And we've been doing that for 93% of our goddamn fucking history. We've got these pharmaceutical companies selling poison to people. We have, we have a massive problem with like black people being shot by cops and fucking arrested. And these are people who got dragged here three generations of fucking go and now we're throwing them fucking jail. Like, it's all true. Yeah. This is all true. But is the way to deal with these problems, to just fucking demonize and polarize and attack and banish and shame and send out that fucking frequency that has been tried for so many generations and has failed every single time where we'd be in a utopia. Yeah, to figure out a new frequency to send out, which has behind it the intention of reducing suffering as much as we can. I think it's the latter if you ask me, right? It's, I agree. I think it's real hard. I think a lot of it comes back to evolution where, you know, threats, we evolved to crush threats or to flee them. Right. And so that's the person doing the bad thing, whatever you perceive as the bad thing is, even if things that everyone would agree, you know, a black person getting shot or bombs dropped on babies, it's still, it's very hard to, I mean, it's certainly appropriate to, it's appropriate to demonize. It's not inappropriate, but is that actually going to change things? It doesn't work for my poodle. I'll tell you this much, man. My fucking poodle pissed on my goddamn Swiffer today. Now I'll tell you, if screaming at my fucking poodle made my poodle act like a better fucking poodle, I'd have a goddamn circus doc. That son of a bitch would have ridden a bike by you when he came in today. Yeah. I would have been very impressed if that was my greeting. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. It doesn't work. If it worked, it would have worked by now. It doesn't work. And I think this is the same thing we see on the, the societal level, but also the personal level. Cause what is, I mean, mental illness, again, we keep using that term, but a signature of it, certainly with OCD, but I think in most forms is that also I should be better at beating up on oneself. That ultimately paradoxically just makes the problem worse. Yeah. That's where it starts. Yeah, exactly. And to get back to your psychedelic point, I think that if the idea is like, oh shit, we're all tuning forks and oh shit, we're accidentally tuning way more people to our frequency than we thought we were, every single one of us, then the next logical question would be fuck. If I'm a tuning fork, what have I been tuning myself with? What am I using to attune myself? And a lot of people have been using randomosity, chaos, social media, news, weird data streams, and not realizing that they're tuning themselves to that. So I think where your point with psychedelics is that perhaps psychedelics used in a intentional way could be a kind of tuning fork, couldn't they? Like maybe the psychedelic state could retune us in a certain way that would then allow us to send a frequency out that wasn't quite so laced with an undercurrent of fear. Maybe. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I think that is part of it. I think part of it absolutely is that I think these drugs slash medicines, I don't really care what we call them, do have the potential to open us up to a different way of experiencing. And the fruits of that generally not always, but generally seem to be compassion for self and others, empathy. And then sometimes you get those plus four mystical experiences where holy fuck, it's all one thing and I'm it and it's me. And then from that, that's sort of the max injection of empathy and compassion. If it's all the same thing, how are you going to be shitty to the maid or the server? That's you. Or how are you going to be ashamed of being the maid? Right. Yeah, exactly. You're also the brain surgeon. Yeah. Yeah. And but you've had personal experiences with this tuning fork. I mean, this is like the entire. And that's why I'm all healed now, Duncan. That's why I am a paragon of mental hygiene and enlightenment. I'm actually, your listeners can't see this, but I'm actually levitating above the chair about it. And the thing that's really annoying, no offense, man. So I really love that you came here. But what's really fucking annoying is that angels keep appearing out of portals and like kissing his face and wiping away he's been crying a little bit. My tears here. He'll cancer. Actually, that's yeah, that's why they're collecting the tears for, yeah. Dude, you should sell that. I'm going to monetize it for likes. It's really what I'm looking for. I have a bigger play here. You could turn it into Bitcoin. I could turn my tears into Bitcoin. But so so yeah, man, but you are an example of somebody who has had like your frequency. And again, when we like, I think everybody knows by now, there's no one cure and there's no permanent cure, but certainly you experienced some remission, some profound remission of symptoms that had were basically destroying your life. Yeah, I did. And I say it in that tone, because you know, it's so easy for me to forget it. It's so easy for me. I was reflecting on this earlier today when I was, I don't even know yesterday, I was stressed about something where it's so easy. It's kind of like the studies, you know, were lottery winners. Six months later, they're no happier than they were before they won the lottery. Right. There's always the new, the new normal that we acclimate to. So like I kind of take for granted, how much better I am now than I was, you know, a decade ago, and then I was five years ago, because my experience is still very often, well, shit, this could be better, you know, and that I still, but yeah, psychedelics. That's growth. Yeah, yeah, it is growth. And I say it again, I say it in that tone, because I think there's a part of me that has trouble giving myself credit or giving the universe credit. You think? Yeah. I mean, we didn't get to explore that, did we? Because like you did say that you look at your life and you think, man, I really have a lucky life. Yeah. But then without even going into that, we jumped into the next topic and and and we are fear and negativity. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. But again, like, yeah, you landed back there again just now with, you know, and I think that's something that I'm working with now because I mean, the short version of my story was the OCD was just yeah, life destroying is a good adjective for it. Psychedelics. So I mean, my show is a long show and I'm not going to tell the whole story here, but the short version is psychedelics helped me find a lot of relief, not in the way I expected. I thought it was going to be this silver bullet cure. It absolutely was not. But it helped me learn to have a different relationship to my obsessions and to the universe, frankly, God, I mean, whatever you want to call it, there is some connection to a greater reality that together that helped me find a very significant relief. But and maybe I instead of but I really should just say and because of course, and I still suffer sometimes a lot with rumination with obsessive worry. So I don't have the overt rituals that I had and that's huge, you know, I don't spend hours or days or sometimes fucking weeks it was Duncan locked literally locked in my apartment just doing dumb fucking rituals that I don't do anymore. But I still yeah, I can still get caught in my own head in a way that makes me not really available to what's going on out here. Yeah, yeah, I can get trapped there. Yeah. So yeah, I'd say now the feature often will take the form of rumination, worry, regret, I should have done this, you know, in the past or future, you know, well, how will this go? And and so yeah, so the reason it's an end versus a but is because I think what you said is true that yeah, there is no ultimate cure, you know, no, well, there's it but and it's also but it's a process. It's and yeah, and and I and thank God for that process and maybe literally thank God for that process because I mean, I don't know that's it seems like that's part of part of I want to say why I'm here that assumes a certain cosmology I'm not necessarily comfortable ascribing it to but but fuck it. I think I do think there's meaning. I don't think I don't think we live in a random universe. I think there's an order in intelligence. I will pretend to have a rational grasp of that by any means. But I don't think to me, I mean, I think religion, it organized religion is insane. But I think atheism, the idea that there's nothing is even more insane. Listen, man, what this brings me to like, I'm sorry if I said this story before, this is one of my favorite moments that happened at Burning Man. And like, it was so profound, man, because I just been talking to one of my friends and like I was high and I'm sitting there with like my community and my friends and people I really love. And I was thinking like, I don't deserve this. Like this is just too much. It's just beautiful. I don't deserve this. These people are so sweet. And this event is so incredible. And like, this planet seems so incredible that it could produce communities like this, who even if they could only do this thing temporarily, my God, my God, the potential, the potential, I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this. I was talking to my friend who is a has is a really smart person. And he was just like, I'm like, you know, do you think it's better to think we deserve or to think we don't deserve? Is it like, is it is it is it puffed up and inflated to think I deserve this, you know, or is it better to like, I don't deserve this. If we receive a gift, is it better to think we deserve the gift? Or is it better to think I don't deserve this gift? And my friend was like, well, if you want to get depressed, you know, the cause of depression, one of the causes there's many is that feeling of, I don't deserve, I'm not good enough. I'm not good enough. I don't deserve this. Oh, no, not me. I can't. You it's better to think we deserve it. Now, this made me start crying because I was I was like, because you were high. Yeah. And then he was he went right to a deep, deep wound. And he was like, just just healing. And it was like, I said, I'm, I'm like crying at Burning Man in front of my friends. I'll start crying now thinking about it. And like, so then we're walking. And there's a phone booth talk to God, right? And it's one of the many art experiments at Burning Man. I'm not sure what it what it is exactly, but it's fucking brilliant. It's a beautiful phone booth says talk to God. And I get in that fucking phone booth, and I pick up the phone. And like, there's other people walking by, we're just, I'm I didn't think, you know, just improvising like, Hey, God, what the fuck, man? Why did you make my dick bigger? You know, what's going on? Like, you know, just stupid, like dumb, I just having fun with the phone booth, just improvising. Then all of a sudden, the phone starts ringing. And a woman answers and goes, Hello. And I'm, I'm like, Oh, I didn't know somebody was on the other line. And she goes, Oh, I'm always here. And I'm like, stunned, you know, I've just been doing really garish, dumb, vulgar, bad comedy, like, like my life. God's like, Kevin listening to do this shit for 44 years, motherfucker. And I'm stunned. And then I'm like, um, and then I'm like, uh, well, uh, I just want to say thank you, you know, this is really beautiful. And she said, Well, you're being too hard on yourself, you deserve this. You're being so hard on yourself. This is all for you. My brain exploded. And I hung up on God. Yeah, I was like, I gotta go. Shit, it's too much. It was too much. Yeah. And that's so man, but it is all for us at some level. I believe that I think, you know, we have these experiences. I mean, one of the big, well, sorry, I don't say this, you're not lucky. Yeah. To say you're lucky is to is to say I don't deserve. Yeah, I never thought of that. To say I haven't worked my fucking ass off for this. To say you're lucky is to say like you, Adam didn't take the fucking time to do the work and do the self care and do the therapy and do the acting classes and do take all the risks and do all the stuff that got you to the point where you could produce and act in a brilliant piece of theater. And you know what I mean? That ain't fucking luck. And I end, I'm trying to say end instead of but. What my mind wants to come in and I will is my parents are happily married. I was born white and tall and physically healthy in a society that values all those things. Okay. There's never been a moment in my life, literally never a moment where I'm like, shit, I may not be able to, I may go hungry because I can't afford food or my parents can't afford food. So you never had anything rough happen to you, huh? It's all about downhill. Like you're basically just like riding like a really slow Russian at 100%. No, no, my point is that things that are out of my control seem to be have aligned quite in my favor, like even just the circumstances of my birth, you know, and your birth, you're the one in the Uber, not driving the Uber. Well, that's true. That's true, man. But I've got like, I'm actually, I should never do this in a podcast because it's so dumb, but I've actually just like kicking around ideas for a new joke. Yeah. Yeah. And like, because I was realizing like, Oh my God, you know, I don't basically like, so my guru, Neem Krili Baba, and my teachers, over and over and over again have been teaching me this very simple idea, which is everything's perfect. And, and, man, you know, you say that in the wrong company and people, you're right. So, so, so, so, um, fuck it, man. See, this is again, this is like capitalism in my brain where I'm like, Oh, do you want to save it for this day so I can make money off of it? That's bad. So, so here's the, here's the essence of the thing, man. It's like, in it, I'm like, I know, I know what you're thinking. Just another white, 44 year old cancer survivor with one ball whose mom died of breast cancer saying everything's perfect. He's got it all going for him. I think that the idea that because we are, we are white. Yeah. The idea that because we are men and that we are white, that we are not allowed to say things along the lines of, I know what my dying mom's urine looks like in a tube coming out of her body that can't come out of a coma because she's dying in front of me and she died for four years fucking straight. I know what it's like to look down at my balls and see them, one of them, gigantically swollen because there's death living inside of them. And I know what it's like every time I get a cold to have a slight feeling that maybe I'm dying because maybe it came back. So to say, because of my gender or my fucking, as Terrence McKinnick's, Terrence McKinnick so beautifully put it, the way photons reflect off of my skin that I have in some way shape or form and there's a prohibition or a stigma or even it's, I don't think, but I'm not saying that. I don't think, so I think I'm saying that. I don't think you're saying that some people are. But I think, but I do think, I don't think it's black or white, no pun intended, right? I do think though that my circumstances seem to me, the circumstances of my birth, just my parents being happily married, that's a huge thing that most people don't have. That's beautiful. Having that model of love. Now, I also had an incredibly contentious relationship with my mother and huge fights from a very, very ageing. So there's other sides to that story, but still just the basic biographical facts of my existence, I think are more favorable than most people's. Well, I mean, except for the fact that you, again, by the way, what's really brutal here is that we end up getting in a kind of, and this is not my point at all. No, no. So, which is that we don't need one thing, I think, and who am I to say what anybody needs in any way, shape or form. But one thing I feel that we don't need right now in this world is to get into a suffering competition with each other, right? I don't think we need to do that. I think maybe this is the answer, is maybe if I replace lucky with grateful because that's more of an active thing. Oh, I love it. God, let's replace lucky with grateful. But it's not, but it actually does, it is a real choice, right? Because lucky implies sort of a passive thing like, why was I given all this? Where grateful says, I'm going to choose to express appreciation for what I've been given, and everything I've been given, the OCD, the good, the bad, I mean, it's the oldest cliché in the world, but it is all fucking wondrous and terrifying. It depends on how you look at it. But I mean, we exist. That's the most unfathomable fact of all. Here's the thing, man, we've all figured out how to mine the terrifying part of it out of the caverns of fear, and we've been doing it for a long time. I say we become miners of gratitude and wonder. And I say we do that no matter what is happening or has no matter what's happened in the past to us personally, it's not my job to tell anybody else. I shouldn't say we should have hallelujah anyway. I shouldn't say yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's not my job. And I do it so many and I'm so I'm sorry because sometimes it comes across in the most sanctimonious way. And it's and it's it's unintentional. It's just I'm a little out of tune all the time. And I'm trying to tune myself and I'm trying to tune myself to something that is based on wonder and gratitude like what you're talking about. And and and and I'm not ashamed of the fact that there have been times in my life when I've been really out of tune and I do and I'm not mad at my parents anymore because they were out of tune. And I'm not mad at my grandparents because of whatever they may have done. And I'm not and as much as possible. I'm trying not to be mad. And I'm trying not to hate. Yeah. And I'm trying not to hate because I'll tell you this man, I don't care what fucking shape the ice cube tray is that you put the fucking cyanide water in. That's still cyanide water. And the same is true for hate. And there is not a place where it's okay to direct hate. Let's stop directing hate. Let's stop it. What didn't work. If if if hating things made the world more peaceful, we would be living in fucking Narnia right now. It didn't work. Why are we running this experiment over and over and over again, putting different targets in front of our laser beams of hate? It isn't so hard, but it's so hard to change because I'm going to bring it back to evolution that negativity bias that crushed the threat. And yeah, I agree completely. It doesn't hate does not build things. Hate is not a creative emotion. That's not a creative force. And if we're talking about making things better, really what we're talking about is creating a different world, a new world. And yeah, and hate is not going to create that because hate destroys it doesn't create. It didn't work. Yeah. But it's so but I think also having compassion on on people who do hate, which includes myself sometimes because it's so it's so ingrained, man. It's so ingrained. You know, we evolved, you know, in the savannah, when a lion came out, it was not adaptive to be like, wow, it's main is so beautiful. Its teeth are so white. It's perfect. I mean, there probably were some of us who did that and they got eaten. So we're the ones, the ones who are still around, we're the product of, you know, millions of years of breeding that out and breeding in the kill that fucking beast. I don't care. I don't even if it's the last one left. If there's any chance or you know what, we don't even know if that line is in the bushes. We're going to napalm that whole fucking forest because there's one goddamn line in there and it eats my kid better safe than sorry. That is the that is evolution's motto, I think is better safe than sorry. And that is also I'd say OCD's motto. And maybe depressions too is, you know, protect and fascism's motto. Yeah. And this is why, I mean, why did why did why did George Bush get reelected? I would say Osama bin Laden, you know, fear causes people to all right, well, let's let's stick with the known, you know, let's it's there's there's big money in fear, man. Yeah, big money in fear. So I'm with you, man. This is I think this is how we change things. But I think we also have to acknowledge how hard it is to go against millions of years of evolutionary programming that's enacted not just out there out here in society, but inside of ourselves. I try to crush my my my own internal threats, my emotions that I don't want the sadness, the loss. And to me, in my case, that produced this horrific I mean, the OCD, it started when I had a particularly significant romantic relationship that quote unquote love of my life that ended 15 fucking years ago. I had a lot of anxiety before then I've been hospitalized twice at 18 for kind of just couldn't keep my shit together. But you've had it easy, man. I've had it easy. You've had it easy except for the getting hospitalized twice when you were I'm the distinction I'm making though. And I think is is I do feel like the yeah, no, I mean, maybe it's a maybe it's an immaterial distinction. I do feel like I guess this is what I'd say. I think on the balance, I would rather be born with two loving parents than with, you know, an alcoholic violent father who beats the mother. So in some ways, so right, I guess it's maybe I'm oversimplifying to say I'm lucky. But there have been I know many people. Yeah. Many people who've had alcoholic violent fathers. And they haven't been to a mental hospital yet. Yeah. So I'm not sure that like using your parents stable marriage is some kind of example of how you've had it easy. Not not easy. I don't think I've had it easier than some. Well, I mean, shit circumstance, I think circumstances have been kind to me. I just know that whenever I get caught up in this kind of helpful that I get caught up in suffering Olympics. You know what I mean? Where where when I know generally, there's from and I really man, again, like I gotta keep just keep fucking hammering this home, man. I'm so sorry if when I seem sanctimonious or preachy. I'm so sorry. No, I'm open. I'm open to I'm yeah, I'm talking to a lot of it is like this is my own shit. Yeah, I look at it and I try to sing to myself to calm myself down a little bit and like we all have the same shit. I really believe that at a lot of levels. So yeah, I want to hear it. I just know that if I find myself generally contemplating the fact that my suffering is exceeded by other people's suffering, then usually the thing that the situation that I'm in is not a great situation, right? I'm truce trying to figure out a way to reduce the power of the situation by thinking, well, you know, probably in some part of the world right now, someone's giving birth to a baby right into a hyena's mouth. So you know, at least at least that wasn't a baby that got born into a hyena's mouth. That would have sucked, you know. So but I think and again, what we're doing here just to draw it all back in is comparison. So now what's happening is I'm going to compare myself to you. You're going to compare yourself to somebody else and somewhere in the midst of all that comparison, we can see some of the byproducts of comparison what happens. Here's what you get from comparison. Here's what you get. You get fucking Miss America. You get American Idol Hitler and you get fucking right. Yeah, you get fucking people walking around burning crosses and fucking KKK hats who are saying that there is a genetic difference between people with black skin and white skin. And because of this, we should do this thing, that thing, that thing or another fucking thing. And it's not a good look to put it offensively lightly. Yes, it's not a good look for our species, right? That's all. So with you on that. So like one thing I try to do is like instead of doing my tendency, which is to want to tell other people how to fucking live because it's way easier to tell other people how to live than to tell myself how to live is I try to draw it back to me, which is like, I'm telling Adam, maybe he shouldn't compare himself to other people and get into a suffering Olympics. Well, maybe I'm going to try to do that myself. I'm going to see if I can do that a little bit more is like stop comparing myself to other people either in one way, which is like, man, fuck, other people have it worse than me. So, you know, the way I feel is okay. Or in the other way, which is other people have it worse than me. So I should feel guilty. Right. Why the fuck can I get my shit together? Or I should feel guilty. I wasn't born into an high in his mouth. Right. Yeah. Yeah. No. And it definitely can't have that effect. And I like the idea of substituting gratitude. And yeah, it's cheesy. But I mean, my phone every, every three hours, my little gratitude alarm goes off. And you know, I ignored it for a while. And then I hit this rough patch about a week and a half ago, which is really kind of just dark obsessing. And I'm like, all right, I can't afford to ignore this thing, because that's one way to connect to something beyond myself. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, gratitude is just kind of a quick little, okay, oh yeah, there's, God, it's brilliant. There's this, that's it. There's this and I'm pointing to my head, there's this, but then there's this. And but I do think my point being to make this change, the shift away from hate is challenging because that impulse to crush threats, I see it out there, people with the crosses and I see it in here in my own heart where, oh, there's this feeling of loss because this relationship ended. Well, I'm not going to feel that I'm going to get rid of that feeling by engaging in these crazy rituals or by masturbating or smoking weed or whatever it is, the impulse, the drive to avoid suffering is so profound. And what is hate? Hate is a form of, I'm going to crush this threat, but it doesn't fucking work. It just make, it just energizes the threat, whether it's internal or external. Sure does. Yeah. I mean, you see it happening now with Trump is all the people who hate and that is the word. Trump are energizing the people who support Trump and I can understand the supporter's point of view is they're like, yeah, fuck you, you're just going to hate on our guy for anything he does. Isn't that scary? I mean, it's like the worst case scenario would be that we get some version of Elon Musk, but it's not for solar energy. It's for hate. The worst case scenario for our species would be that somebody figures out a way to come up with a solar panel that turns hate into money and holy fucking shit, man. People are figuring that out right now and they're figuring it out on both sides of the fence. And they saw a lot of them don't even know that they're doing it. And it's like, in terms of the social media thing in terms of, yeah, tuning to, oh, yeah, I get this many retreats when I, when I say something nasty about Trump or about Obama or about Jay-Z or whoever, Khan. Yeah. Or myself. Yeah. So it's like, so the, again, man, it's like, what you're saying is like, yep, it's true. And it's, and it's right. The polemics and the polarization is not going to, I don't think it's not going to really work if your idea is you want to see a president that isn't Donald Trump. I don't know for sure. And maybe if I'm wrong, well, I was fucking wrong. I was a little pacifist, naive pussy. And I was fucking wrong, fucking hate me till the end of fucking time. I'm just saying is we're looking back in history at strategy. I agree with you here. Yeah. Yeah. Work and don't work. I've noticed that hate-based strategy strategies tend to, in the short term, produce a lot of violent results. And in the long term, lead to nothing good, except people not wanting to have facial hair like yours for the rest of reported history. That mustache is gone forever. Yeah. So, so, but yeah, it doesn't work. We try. Right. So, we know, so we know, well, that's how we say we know what works. We don't know what works, but I think you and I are both saying, yeah, compassion and love, not novel ideas, but ones that haven't been put into practice on a widespread basis. Well, they tried to put it into practice. I mean, the compassion and love stuff, they did try to get put into practice, but it happened before the internet. And so it ended in crucifixion and generally assassination. Right. When we think of the three people that popped in my mind are Martin Luther King, Gandhi and Jesus, right? Didn't really work out for them because they weren't tweeting. Yeah. So, and I mean that they weren't protected by some kind of bubble. And also, they weren't able to like harmonize. And if those people were alive today and could turn their charisma, could use technology to amplify their charisma and their message of love, non-violence, tolerance, kindness. The Bible went viral. The Bible went viral. The Bible went viral. That was the Bible. But the Bible is not necessarily Jesus. There's very little Jesus in the Bible. And also, the Bible got filtered through a lot of different filters, right? And it's been over a lot. I'm saying like right now, the actual truth, the gospel, literally gospel truth coming down directly to the masses through the good news, the good news. We've got to start spreading the good news. And I'll tell you, that's not Fox News and that's not CNN and that's not Drudge Report and that's not Huffington Post. In fact, if anybody called Fox News or CNN or any of the main or not so main news outlets, good news, they'd be out of their fucking mind. So, if you want to really get tripped out, if you really want to talk about the anti-Christ, if the gospel is the good news, then you could even say that the news comes from the anti-Christ in the sense that it is spreading a message of bad news. And I think it all comes down to asking ourselves, are we telling ourselves good news or bad news on a daily basis? Am I telling myself when I wake up in the morning, this is a beautiful fucking universe. I'm lucky to be alive. I can't believe I got to be born in this body that can walk and talk and smell flowers and have friends. Holy fucking shit, I did it. Or am I waking up in the morning and I'm looking at myself and thinking, man, I fucking suck. I had it easy. I fucking suck. I can't believe all the fucking bad decisions I made. I'm a dirty fucking piece of shit, man. I really fucking suck. Look how fat I'm getting. Look at my receding hairline. Look at, oh fuck, my breath smells weird. I need to get my fucking gums, whatever it's called, denatured or drilled into, man. And fuck, I hope I'm not drinking too much. I hope I'm not talking too much. Hope I'm not too this. Hope I'm not too that. Why didn't I learn to play guitar? And then the next thing you know, I have become the anti-Christ in the sense that everything I'm doing is not the good news. And then I start spreading bad. You're vibrating at that frequency. Yeah, now I'm spreading bad news. And I think, though, we also have to acknowledge that this kind of circles back to, well, then just fucking stop doing it, man. And it's not that easy. So I think we have these tendencies. I think evolution has bequeathed us these tendencies to see negativity, to see fear that we're very adaptive for most of our history as a species. But now, at least in this country where there's not mortal threats around every corner, there aren't giant eagles circling overhead and tigers in the jungle. That impulse, we now turn it towards things. We basically find threats. And autoimmune disorder. Right. And within ourselves too. And so I think it's acknowledging that that is there. But also I do believe in free will. And it is an absolute leap of faith. There's who fucking knows. But I choose to believe in free will just because the whole giving everything kind of unravels. If you don't, and it feels to me like I have free will. So I believe that even with those tendencies and those impulses and predilections, we can make a different choice. And it doesn't have to be lying to ourselves. Yeah. African Americans are getting shot by cops. Bombs are being dropped on babies that is part of the story that's going on right now. But part of the story is also, we're fucking breathing in molecules of a certain type of molecule that our lungs instantaneously are extracting certain things circulating through our blood vessels. Then we're exhaling other things in this environment. And this whole thing, by the way, is possible because out there streaming through your curtains is this giant flaming ball. Yeah. I mean, that constant nuclear reactions. It's all one. So you guys know you can't see it, but I've just built a nuclear reactor outside my window. It's annoying. I should have told you in advance. We're getting. Well, the angels are getting singed, unfortunately, by the sad to watch and catch on fire. Yeah. But that's what the thing's there for. It's basically when it's like one of those fucking bug zappers for angels. But yeah, man, I love what you're saying because like what I tend to do is like I veer on more towards an unrealistic kind of like quick answer to things. We need to kind of live ourselves. But I think you're right, man. Because then it becomes starting to drop in because I think if you do that, then it becomes another form of turning it around yourself. Well, why can I love myself? Why can't we just turn choose compassion? You're working against this. There's a huge load of evolutionary legacy that's on all of our backs. Right. We do have free will. I really believe that. But we are carrying 50 million years of evolution with us. But we can start taking baby steps, right? And even big steps because that's one of the amazing things about humans. I mean, look at fucking Gandhi. Look how much. Yeah, he paid for Martin Luther King Jesus paid for. But look how much these individual humans. I mean, Martin Luther King, I'm pretty sure he's younger than both of us when he was assassinated. I'm almost certain. Guarantee. Yeah. And actually, when you say that, you realize something incredibly depressing, which is that most great people who have been assassinated were younger. And now we can use that to feel bad about ourselves. Yeah. He was younger than us. Was he? I think he's around our age. I think he's around our age. There's still hope. Yeah, there's still hope. There's still hope. But and you let the beard grow a little bit longer, man. I feel like you're going to be following in his footsteps. Oh my God. You know what? I don't want, you know. No, but just to finish the point, though, I think individuals can absolutely affect massive, massive change. And I think this sounds like just a fucking hallmark. I think all of us have that potential. I mean, that to me is one of the amazing things when I read that or mangled that George Saunders passage earlier in the podcast 7000 years ago before we solved other words problems. Part of why I got goosebumps is because Saunders and great artists, great comics, Richard Pryor, great movies, music, part of the wonder I get from that is, holy shit, a human being did this. And I'm a human being. Yeah, like this is latent within all of us. And I think this is part of the struggle and the beautiful struggle and the gift of existence is figuring out what can I bring forth and how do I bring it forth? Yeah. And so baby steps, yes, but also giant steps. I think it can, you know, I do think, I think everyone kind of has always thought they're living at end times, but it really does kind of feel like we're getting close. It feels like just environmental catastrophe over population. It feels like, yeah, we can't just keep, you know, this ride can't go on the way it's been going on forever. Oh, I mean, let me tell you, man, the reason everybody feels like it's the end of the world, because it is the end of the world for you. I'll tell you this, man, I mean, I don't want to make doomsday predictions, but, oh, listener, if you're, I would say if you're over 20 listening to this, the world's gonna end in between 50 and 80 years for you, because you're gonna fucking die. I mean, right, right. Statistically. So, so, so the apocalypse is coming for all of us. Yeah, it's in and it or the ice caps gonna melt and are sea levels gonna rise and is the environment gonna collapse and is it gonna get so fucking hot outside that people start dying? And is there the potential that fascism and tyranny begin appearing around the planet and could evil cobbles of dark people begin to intentionally distort reality to try to make money? Absolutely. But are we gonna deal with that? Yeah, we're gonna deal with that. And you know what we're gonna do? We're gonna harmonize it and we're gonna make it better. And we're gonna use technology to do it. And we're gonna enter into one of the most beautiful ends of the world that ever happened. And we're gonna, and we're gonna do it without hate. And we're gonna do it with love. And if we can't do it without hate, we're at least gonna try. And when the hate comes, we're not gonna beat up on ourselves because we started hating ourselves or other people as soon as we can, we're gonna get right back to the marching orders, which I think are coming from up top, which is like, Hey guys, let's try it without hate this time and see what happens. I think it can be done. And I think that every single one of us knows that and feels it. And every single one of us gets to forgive ourselves right now for whatever it was we did that had hate inside of it. And we get to forgive ourselves that the hate comes back, because we're gonna do it. This time we're gonna do it. It's gonna happen. And if you look underneath all that fear, I think there's some a really crazy sense of like, Oh my God, something beautiful is about to happen. Even though it seems so scary, this is the part of the movie where the hero gets backed into the corner and does something, something new, something unexpected. It is happening, I think. But and I think part of it, though, is why are we in this predicament now? I think a lot of it does have to do with just being cut off from from nature, being cut off from from the natural world, being cut off from from ourselves. I mean, the environments I told you earlier, I'm done with New York, man, I've been there 21 years and that is no longer going to be my home. It's and that's just I can't live in that that disconnected from nature. I realized what a high price I see I've been out in the Bayer doing the doing the solo show since late March and whatever else is going on in my life, whatever internal drama, whatever external stressors, things are better when I can see the ocean regularly, when I can see mountains regularly, when I see trees all around me that and I think that's true of everyone. Yeah. Yeah, I think getting getting some nature, getting some some dirt on your feet, that's always because it connects us to who we are. I don't think it's like a secondary thing. I think it's a primary thing that we that we need. And just going outside. I mean, yeah, the thing is like some people maybe they can't get out of the city. Maybe they know. But I'll tell you, man, one thing I know I can do is I can walk outside. I could still walk outside. And no matter how hot it is, I've noticed that I feel better than I do. If I don't get outside for a little bit every day and get some of that fucking sweet ass angel incinerating radiation on my face, I could definitely do that, man. And I think that that, you know, learning how to do that, because it's like, man, that we've like turned our eyes away from the sun, we've turned our bodies away from the sun, and we were like staring at these glowing fucking rectangles and pretending that these rectangles are the North Star. And it's like, that shit is not the North Star. It's just it's just a tuning fork, you know, we need something like what you're saying, transcendental. And I think psychedelics come into the picture too. I do feel like we co-evolved with these plants and funguses. I don't think it's coincidental. I don't think it's coincidental that there are hundreds of naturally occurring compounds that are highly psychoactive in our environment. I think you can draw a really compelling case, and certainly McKenna has and other people have, Jonathan Ott, that we, Paul Stamets, that that we co-evolved with with this stuff and that part of this sort of fall from grace that we're experiencing on an accelerating basis now is due to our loss of that connection. And I think that is, I don't want to be too, you know, starry eyed evangelistic, but I think that is part of the path forward has to be bringing these plants back into our lives that they, they made us who we are. I mean, whether or not you subscribe to sort of the stone dave theory or, you know, the McKenna stuff, I think it's, to me, it seems strongly, strongly probable or strongly improbable that it's purely coincidental that say these mushrooms grow all over the fucking place. In fact, the greater where humans are, the mushrooms follow. And these mushrooms catalyze a certain changing consciousness that has certain long term evolutionary value, community, connection. And, and I think, yeah, I think part of, you know, this was the sacrament that I think religions were based on originally. And I think that's why religions have become so corrupt. I think, again, there's no silver bullet. This isn't the one size fits all solution. But I do think this is an essential part of the equation that's been missing for in Western society for, you know, probably, you know, the Lucidian mysteries for a long, long time. We surfaced here in the 60s, unfortunately, exploded too quickly. We didn't have the containers for it. We lost it. And now we're recovering it again. And yeah, and it's really interesting too, because like, if you look at our government studying Pythagoras, and if you look at like Pythagoras and his recovery of the Lucidian mysteries, I didn't know he had any, I don't know much about this. Yeah. Yeah, check it out. It's pretty mind blowing. He had a cult, man. The guy had a commune and like, another fucking math guy with a cult back in the oh my God, he's amazing. But you know, the apparently and again, you know, if I read again, friends, friends, friends, it's me. I'm not a history professor. I don't know fucking I looked up Pythagoras because I was trying to figure out how to make my modular sense like do a cord, you know, and I got curious about triads. But the the my point is like Pythagoras apparently like kind of balanced what was happening like the Lucidian mysteries for those of you don't know, there was something going on in ancient Greece where people were drinking a thing called Kaikion, which is producing some kind of altered state of consciousness that was producing a kind of like permanent initiatory shift for the better. But apparently there was also attached to that a lot of hedonism. And like Pythagoras kind of balanced that out a little bit with a admonition, which is like one of the worst things right that can happen to a person is excess. Let's hone it down in comedy. It's certainly true in writing. It's certainly true. Definitely true with fat cells, certainly true with cancer 100% true with populations and pretty much too much anything is generally a bad thing. And I could even say that's true for money. But you know, our personal wealth, who knows, I don't know. So he kind of came in and like was like a beautiful kind of tuning fork that took all of that like data and converted it or into a language that we call math. So which then shaped our entire society. So that's what we need. We need another Pythagoras. We need another like person to emerge from the beautiful smoldering tie dyed rubble of the explosion of psychedelic information into American, the global consciousness via the 60s, and like convert that in some way that is understandable, pragmatic, usable. And you know, I'll tell you, man, I think one of those people is Rick Doblin. Yeah, Rick is doing phenomenal work. Sorry, Rick, I'm not saying you're Pythagoras, but I clearly really like you. Yeah, Rick. I'm a huge Rick Doblin fan. I told him this was after the you were you were there. We did the the psychedelic science conference. And remember that after party that Sunday after party where I was coming out? I wasn't even high. I'd smoked some weed. But I think I said to Rick, I was like, there's no one I admire more in the world than you. Yeah, just he radiates this sort of at me. He's I mean, he's a human. I'm sure he has flaws and fallibilities, but he's but but yeah, Rick is and but that what I was going to say is there's multiple people. I think that's the nice thing now is it's sort of a distributed thing. It's not a Timothy Leary or you know, or a McKenna, but there's there's you know, there's there's all these notes. There's the Hopkins researchers, the NYU researchers, there's Paul Stamets, there's there's Bob Jesse, there's a community, there's I heard of a guy. Yeah, he's like this incredibly courageous guy who has like a brutalizing you should check him out. He's pretty awesome. He's got this really rough kind of like mental illness that almost destroyed his life, but he was strong enough to overcome it with psychedelics. He's been doing like I've heard about this guy. He's really well hung. I've heard yeah, he's got a giant dick. You got a giant dick. So on top of the fact that he's making mentally ill people not feel ashamed and like also helping in some small way to destigmatize psychedelics, he's also super funny and like he's doing a lot of good work, man. You should check him out. He's got a show. What's it called? I think it's a great setup. I was trying to think of someone else's show that I could shout out here like a really bad show. You know, I think you know this guy. I think you actually have jerked him off many times. Doesn't really narrow it down, Tonkin. Shane Moss? We're talking about Shane Moss here. It was only once. It was only once. He told me he wouldn't put me on his podcast unless I jerked him off. You can't do that to me, too. I don't think I've been on his podcast. If you want Shane, what the fuck? He did just realize that, man. I'm gonna jerk you off, man. Adam, you've got this lovely show. Where can people see it, man? Where is it? Are you performing it right now? I am. This literally right now, this is the show. In fact, this is weird meta thing of me going on podcasts. This is the show. Yeah, so the show is called The Mushroom Cure and it's the true story of how I tried to cure my OCD with psychedelics and I'm proud to say it's sponsored by MAPS and Rick Doblin. They've been really helpful getting the word out. I didn't know that. Yeah. They're great because some of the, there are only a few psychedelic research organizations out there and they're all a huge admirer of all of them, Beckley, Hefter, Usona. But the others tend to be sometimes a little bit more circumspect about lending their name to things where it's not sort of strict scientific research. They gotta be careful. Yeah. Whereas Rick Doblin, he's very open about, well, his own agenda here is the medicalization of psychedelics is a bit of a Trojan horse that this is the way to get the door open, but ultimately this stuff should be a tool for anyone of age who wants to use it. But anyway, so MAPS is, they are comfortable supporting my tale of, as I like to call it, vigilante psychopharmacology because I was not in any official studies. So yeah, so the show we just wrapped up, we were in the Bay Area for about three and a half months and Saturday was our last show. But now we're going to New York. We're going to be playing there July 20th through September 6 or 7th. So, so there for, I don't know, six or seven weeks. And, and then I may be done with the show. I've been telling this story for a while and it kind of kicks my ass. It's a hard show to do. Yeah, I gotta go back to the, the darkness. And what I've found, if I kind of just act it out, people enjoy the show, they laugh, they, you know, maybe not everyone enjoys it, but you know, most people seem to respond well to it. But if I really don't just reenact, but actually re-experience the horror, the just complete desperation I felt for so many years, the feeling of I am trapped and I don't think there's a way out. If I can go back to that feeling, the more I can go back to that feeling, the more, this sounds a little bit grandiose, but I'll say it, the more I think it heals people on two levels. I think one is the sort of, like you said, destigmatizing because most people have not seen someone be so open about their suffering. No. But two, I think, particularly related to mental illness, man, particularly related to colorfulness, colorfulness, colorfulness, chromatic diversion. Yeah, sure. Yeah. Yeah, it's beautiful what you're doing, man. And I think it is, I've thought that a little bit about that show when I've been thinking about it. It's like, man, I think he's kind of, I bet that every time he does it, man, in a non-cliché way, I bet that really hurts. And it's a lot of energy to put out. And I think that that is a beautiful, beautiful way of kind of alchemy. Yeah. Well, it's healing for that reason too. Yeah, alchemy's the perfect word. Yeah. And I think it's amazing. I hope while it's still playing, you all get a chance to see it. Adam, where can people, first of all, thank you so much. Thanks for having me on. This is one of my favorite conversations in a really long time. Thank you so much. Cool. Me too, man. You're awesome. Where can people find you? I did Shane's podcast. And I mean, the jerking off was fun, but the actual podcast was not. It was, that was fun too. Yeah, but I mean, it's like you just jerked him on. It's just like, yeah. Is he genuinely interested in me for me, or does he just want me to do it with the other hand? Everybody wonders that about Shane. Yeah. And I wasn't on his show. Shane Moss. Shane Moss. What the heck, man? Yeah. You know what? I'll be honest. I didn't mind. It's cool. But yeah, people can, oh, and I am going to be doing my own podcast, of course. You have to now. It's mandatory. I'd love to. Yeah. I'm going to be doing a, it's the tentative title. This is good because I'll know when you're coming out with this and I'll have to get the first one up before then. It's going to be called Adam's Dress is Obsessed. And it's basically aimed to having more conversations like this where it's just like, hey, I don't know what the fuck is going on and I'm a struggling human being, but there's wonder and beauty in the world. And I want to share both those perspectives because I think we often only get one of those or we get the purely negative. Love it. Also, I will throw this out there. So the Mushroom Cure, we have a Facebook page. What I've realized doing the show is there's a community that kind of organically comes together around the show. Like after the show, people don't want to leave. They're asking me questions. They're talking with each other. And I don't think it's because the show is so amazing. I think it's because seeing someone share like that, being so open about their suffering, it inspires people to, they want to share themselves suddenly. It feels like a safe space to do that. And so we just started a Facebook community where people can post their own fucked up, transcendent, beautiful, terrifying, shameful, whatever stories. Love it. It's called the Mushroom Cure colon stories of vulnerability and healing. You need to build a Discord server too, man. Oh, really? I'm going to teach you how to do that. Let's talk about this. But yeah, if you go to themushroomcure.com, that'll link to all of this stuff hopefully by the time this gets up. Yeah, we're playing in New York. And then I'll be back with a new show that I haven't started writing yet. That's the only way I can get shit done because the perfection of the OCD, that'll be in October in the Bay Area. So yeah, so themushroomcure.com, Adamstrous.com, and yeah, man, always great connecting. Great connecting with you. Thank you so much. Thanks for having me. Thank you. That was Adam Strouse, everybody. If you want to find Adam, all the links you need will be at DuncanTrussell.com or go to adamstrous.com.

I'm always so happy when I get to chat with you. I know. I was looking forward to it this morning. We're taking the kids to school. I'm like, oh, fuck, I get to talk to Mr. Bollelli today. We've never had a bad podcast together. I don't think so. We're making it at this time. Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah, for sure. Yes. You know what I'm completely obsessed with? And to be fully honest, why I'm late right now to this is. So I've taken the deep dive into AI animation. Yes. You know that thing that's in everybody's head? It tells you, well, you don't do that or you can't do that. There's no way you're going to figure that out yourself. Somebody else does that kind of shit. And so I'm like, wait, why do I think I can't do this crazy AI animation shit that people are doing? Because I went on these YouTube video tutorials, did some arcane shit on a Google Drive. And now I'm like making a music video about my smoker and I'm trying to like animate the entire thing with AI and it's the trippiest shit you ever saw. What are your thoughts on AI, Danieli? If you put any time considering what's happening right now as far as what humans can do with AI. I guess two thoughts. One, before we even get to AI, just the process of what you're doing, I'm loving it. Because the reality is that I'm a horrible example of what you're describing where I always feel like unless I already know how to do it, unless somebody who's really good at something has taken me by the hand and showed me the rope at every step of the way. I get impostor syndrome and I feel like I can do this. So it's funny because like I used to, in our household, I used to be the one cooking all the time. But I had, you know, my, I don't know, 15 things that I cook well and that's it, right? To learn one new thing would be like apocalyptic events. My lady eventually who couldn't cook what shit started cooking within three months. She was making insane things that I'd be like, how do you even, or like sometime I'd be like, hey, what do you want to eat? She's like, I don't know. And she puts out random ingredients from the closet, makes them and they are amazing. And they're like, where does that confidence come from? That I severely laugh. You think it's confidence? I think so. I think it's a fear of failure thing. Like I don't want to be the one who then put a bunch of work into something and then I'm going to be feeding my family and everybody goes like, what's this shit? And you don't want to be embarrassed by a shitty meat. Exactly. I see. You know what? Maybe part of being a comedian is we have humiliated ourselves. So many times in front of people that it's not confidence. As much as just like, I know the feeling. If I whip up some fucked up thing, it's like, yeah, I know. It sucks. I fucked everything up. But it's, you're just like, yeah, I mean, I've been eating shit in front of people. You know, someone being like, this brisket sucks. You're like, yeah, well. But that's good. That makes you brave and experimental and adventurous, which is what's happening right now. So I love that part to start with. AI specifically stripping, because, you know, you never want to be the guy who was like, back in my day, we didn't use these default devil shit. It's horrible. It's horrible. We should. So, you know, you don't want to be that guy. At the same time, it's obvious that, you know, we have all grown up watching Terminator. There are some concerns here and there with where things can go. So I don't know. Because of course, you know, it's not the, if we're talking about AI to make art or AI to be whatever the hell. Why not? You know, it could be, it could be ways to, we are already using machines for everything we do. We are just taking it several notches up, right? Of course, there's always the fact that throughout history, there seems to be a pattern of people being dicks and finding ways to use any new technology to acquire power and screw everyone else over. So it's almost a matter of time before you literally, and again, I don't want to be overly stereotypical, but the Terminator army doesn't seem like that much of a stretch. Well, look, I'll tell you this. Do you know how long it took me before I started generating pornographic images of many of my friends once I realized I could? Like it was within 10 minutes of recognizing what it would do. It's like, all right, it's definitely time to like start generating porn with my friends right away. First thing I went to. So yes, I am a degrader of the incredible technology. It was part of experimenting. You know, as far as the AI army stuff goes and things like that, I think what's really interesting in the phenomena itself is that there are, like there's lots of controversy around even saying what you just said, like people who are really in the AI, they're, they get kind of defensive. They're like, you know, that that AI is, it's us. It's trainable. It's not going to run amok. It's don't listen to the side of it. AI is us. That's not fucking reassuring me. That's terrifying. Same. When they're like, but they, what they mean is like, you know, the, the, the, yes, there's no way to like frame it in a way that isn't like somewhat spooky. Right. The other thing that they'll say is it's not like, you know, this is my favorite like argument with AI there. I just saw this Twitter thread of someone sort of presenting that we shouldn't call it AI at all. It's not intelligence. It's algorithmic retrieval, you know, of whatever it is you want from servers. And I'm sure it's going to catch on. It's not going to catch on, but I kept thinking like, well, to me, where, where that's funny is like, what the fuck do you think you are? Like you think aren't, I mean, aren't all humans in some way or another just running an algorithm? That's our personality. And the retrieval mechanism is whatever we tend to focus on in our environment, our algorithm, the algorithm, our personality picks certain things out. We pay attention to it, tunes out all the other shit. Right. Like, isn't it essentially the same thing except we're less efficient? Right. Yeah. I mean, about that, that's why the, the argument is just like cause is like, yeah, but a much more efficient and efficient meaning in anything, right? Efficient can mean paradise. Efficient can mean do fantastic things that we can only dream of. Yeah. Or it could be horrendous because you don't get to pick just which half of the circle you want in that, you know. And I think that's the issue with AI that of course it offers fantastic possibilities, but just as it offer fantastic possibility to also offer the other side of what the new money is, you know, whether you are thinking about, the AI has the ability to develop more along the thinking feeling lines or just because it's a dumb robot who does whoever the builder is, but the builder is a dick. And now you have a real problem because you have a very efficient thing that does whatever the dick creator wants. To me, if you, like, if you want to find a case in point right now, it's the, it's that we're automating processes that used to be sacred to humanity. Like the fact that right now in the background of my computer, well, it's really, it's running on a Google GPU right now, but in the background of my computer right now, I've just given it commands for scenes I want in a music video. And I mean, I could go look at it right now. It's, yeah, it's doing a really great job of turning vegetables into a saint meditating into, in a forest. Like it's just doing it. Like, not only could, not only is there no fucking way, there's no fucking way that I in a million years would be able to animate something like what it's doing in, you know, less than 10 minutes, but it's, there's no way. I don't, I mean, anyone who wanted to hand draw what it's doing right now or paint or whatever, I don't know. I'm sure it could be done, but I'm pretty sure that it would take it, take that person so long. So I think that like that's, if you want to find the thing that sure, I get the robots are scary as hell. But to me, the thing that's like really sinister, I guess, is just that we're embracing the automation of everything. I mean, it can't be controlled. It can't be stopped. I love it. I can't afford to pace up. Like if I wanted to find some like animator who knew how to do after effects and was like, Hey, man, can you make a really psychedelic video for my stupid song about my smoker? They'd be like, Yeah, sure. Motherfucker, it's going to be like $15,000 could take me four months or two months or a month or I don't know. Look, I wish I could pay you, but it's just a dumb song I made in a couple of hours about my smoker. So I'm not going to, you know what I mean? So to me, that's where that's where it's like, Oh shit, like it's going to just, it's going to wreck industries. It's going to wreck industries. And I mean, that's the name of the game, right? Sinks are constantly changing. I mean, even something that has been around forever that is experiencing a bit of a crisis because if you look at like publishing industry, writing books, yes, you know, the number of people, like what I'm eating from people in terms of what's considered a best seller now would have been a joke 15 years ago, would have been a complete failure because people are not buying books, you know, people are not reading. I mean, they are reading online. They are reading on other ways. They are the number of books that get read. And so you figure out like, is it good? Is it bad? I mean, of course it's bad in some ways. There are other things though that 15 years ago would have been, you know, like the whole podcasting industry made out of thin air, you know, wasn't even on the radar 20 years ago. You know what I mean? So it's kind of like, again, good or bad, it doesn't fucking matter. That's where the wave is going. And you need to figure out how to write it, regardless of whatever judgment we want to give, because our judgment at the end of the day doesn't mean shit. You know, it's like, this is where it's going, whether you like it or not. Figure out how you can write a wave in the best way possible. And hope for the best, because you really can't do much else. Right. I mean, like, you know, like, I don't want to get sinister about this stuff. I do, before I bring up this next point, I do think it's curious that most people that I know, when I show them any of this AI animation specifically, their reaction to it is just like what you said in the beginning, they're like, this is satanic, or this is this is demonic. Like, it's like, across the board, there's some like recoil that happens where you're like, wait, what? What do you what do you think that is? I mean, I think some of it is understandable fear of change, which is understandable, but that doesn't mean it's good. You know, because the reality is that that's what every new invention has created. But I'm talking about, I don't think sorry to cut you off. I don't think that they are looking at it and thinking, oh, fuck, this is really going to upset many of the industries out there around creation. It's more of like an instantaneous like. Yeah, but I mean, like, I don't know if you remember like when when you were a teenager and people who were in their fifties would talk about remember back in the day when you would have your like Sony Walkman and you walk around with your headphones being able to listen to whatever music you want. And everyone was like, these fucking stupid kids, they look like they are in their own world. They look like this is going to be lead to the alienation of society and two people not talking to each other and everybody being stuck in their own little world. Right. There was a 2% of truth to that. There are some aspects like, well, actually, but most of it also was paranoia and unwarranted fear. And I think that's what happens a lot. Now, in this case, more extreme, because it's not just a change like you put the TV in your living room, which again, greeted with both adoration and fear. And this is the devil doing it kind of thing. This is even more so because he's slipping progressively forward and forward away from a direct human control. Right. And so, of course, it creates even more anxiety than the normal innovation would create. Right. Right. I think it's a normal thing that happens every time, but it's magnified because it's more extreme, more dramatic and less tied to human beings. Well, the point I was going to make before that is, you know, let's say you're some feudal lord or something and you've got a little keep or some shit and some people working on your land. And all of a sudden somebody comes running in and they're like, they're these motherfuckers and they're on horses and they drink the horse's blood. They kill, they just kill everything and they're coming this way. And you're like, oh, really? Do they have armor? No. They just have bows and arrows. They don't really have armor. Okay. Well, I'm just going to send out some of my knights in armor. They're going to take these motherfuckers out and then the knights go out and the fucking Mongol Lord, they're faster. They don't have armor. They're fast. They can like, they're not following any stupid chivalry rules and they just slaughter you, slaughter everything. To me, that's what we're looking at is it's like, you know, while all the stuff is going on, the midterms, the shit going on in the UK with trust, all the geopolitical Ukraine. It's like, this is happening. This is the real thing, man. This is the thing that's like, it's coming. There's no way to stop it. It's going to completely upend human culture, everything that we understand as like how you spend your day. And to me, very few, very few people are commenting on it. That's why I'm fast. It's so apocalyptic, you know, it's so fucking apocalyptic. And I think the issue there is that, you know, the history of humanity has been this history of people developing better and better tools to be able to affect their environment, their lives, everything around them in fantastic ways. Yes. They're remaining the same dumb apes that they were tensillion years ago, in the sense that sadly, the human intelligence is clearly really high. Human wisdom, you would be hard pressed to make a point that people are incredibly wiser over the centuries, you know. Right. So that's the problem that, you know, you develop more powerful tools with the same degree of wisdom. That's not a good thing, because, you know, it's like you want, it's kind of like if you have a seven year old and you start introducing them to drive in a car and shooting guns. It's like, there's nothing wrong with the tools themselves, but this poor dumbass does not have, does not have what it takes to handle them in a good way. She is going to get angry because there's no wisdom to know how to actually use these things in a way that works. This is some of the coolest pottery I've ever seen in my life. This is authentic, magical stuff from Asheville, North Carolina, made by people who care about their employees and are trying to run an ethical business. All that stuff is wonderful. The fact that they make sure everyone has a living wage, the fact that they ethically source all the stuff they use to make their products, the fact that they give a lot of their money to various wonderful organizations. I love it. But the thing that really matters when you're ordering pottery is that the pottery is incredible and this stuff is awesome. You're going to feel like Galadriel from Lord of the Rings sent you pottery when you order this stuff. It's amazing. You want to blow someone's mind with it, with an awesome gift. This is what you want to give them. It's East Fork. You got to check them out. EastFork.com. I had a long conversation with them. They're super cool. And I'm telling you, you are going to love their pottery. Again, it's EastFork.com. Check them out. If you can't remember that, the link is going to be at dunkitrustle.com. Treat yourself or your friends with some beautiful, magical pottery from Asheville, North Carolina. Thank you, East Fork. What is the difference between intelligence and wisdom? I think intelligence is specific. It's like you can put together good sentences. You're well spoken. You can put two and two together in a way that leads to some specific outcome the way you want. Wisdom is having the sense of knowing which one are desirable outcomes and which one not so much for a greater perspective. For the greater good. There are plenty of people out there that you look at there and you say, are they intelligent? Yeah, sure. I mean, you listen to them speak and you're like, yeah, this is a well-read person who clearly understood. But then you listen to the conclusions they draw. And you're like, oh my God, I would have much rather you be a happy peasant 500 years ago and just be maybe simpler but nice. I mean, think about how many intelligent people were part of the Third Reich, right? Probably a lot. There were a lot of... Yeah, they all got jobs at NASA, didn't they? Exactly. Really smart. But obviously what we want to talk about and by wisdom, I mean really something that make a qualitative positive difference in humanity that creates... And some of it, of course, is my own standards, right? Some of it is, I think that wisdom is measured in how happy you make the people around you, how well you raise your kids, how good you are of a neighbor, how you can create them situations around you where you get a happy life but not at the point of fucking over everyone else. To me, that's wisdom, right? Yeah, it's okay. I love it. So that, to me, is the goal. Intelligence for intelligence sake not only doesn't interest me, but in some cases can be downright dangerous. Like it can be a bad trait, not a good one. Some of the smartest people I've ever seen are miserable. Yeah. Like it's an actually, it's like a personality style. The miserable, smart person. Like that's a whole thing that people love to do. I'm fucking smart, but I'm so cynical, skeptical, miserable, unhappy, selfish, self-absorbed. That's the other thing. You know, I think if we're going to differentiate intelligence from wisdom, intelligent people can be incredibly purely self-absorbed. Whereas like, it seems like with wisdom, because you've recognized at some point like, I'm a miserable motherfucker and your reaction to that is not, oh, cool. I'm going to make a thing out of this. Like how do I un-miserable myself? And then you start realizing maybe, oh, it seems like the less self-absorbed I am, the less miserable I become. And then from there you start like getting into like activities that really smart people might seem simple and a waste of time or something. Right? 100%. That's why to me, I really like that image that Zen Buddhism uses, that Taoism uses of like these three stages where you start at a stage of ignorance, where you are spontaneous, you have a certain natural spontaneity to you, but you're also fucking ignorant, so it comes with some problems. Yeah. In the next stage you become learned, you learn a lot, but you carry knowledge as this heavy burden in your head, so now nothing is simple, everything is super complicated, everything. And this is seen as the opposite of ignorance, which in some way it is, but qualitatively you really haven't made a step up, because now you're, whereas what they see as the third stage is where you move beyond intelligence, where you absorb what you needed to absorb from being cool, cool, smart, but you turn that into actual wisdom. And when you do, you no longer carry knowledge as this heavy burden, you are no longer cynical, you return to a state of being somewhat more spontaneous, but is a deeper spontaneity, a spontaneity that has a heart, that has soul, that has a certain energy to it, that is not the same as where you started. And what I see is that most of the time instead we get stuck with this debate between ignorant versus intelligent, where really there are two stacking stones towards something greater, because neither one of those are any good if you get stuck in that. Ah, that's so cool. Yeah, it's like the big battle is between the intelligent people who think that the problems of the world are because of the ignorant people. And the ignorant people who think the problems of the world are because of the elites, the intelligent people manipulating and bugging everything up when we're weirdly they both are equally probably responsible, not responsible literally, but responsible in the sense that, I mean, this is so infuriatingly simple, but like, if you are unstable, whether you're intelligent or ignorant. In other words, like if you are prone to mood swings, mood changes, sometimes you're up, sometimes you're down, sometimes you're angry, sometimes you're happy. Then that means everyone around you has to take part in your instability. Like, you know, they mean like you're destabilizing your environment. You live in an unstable world if you're unstable, everything around you is going to mean you're going to just see reflections of it and everyone. Oh, shit, is he in a good mood today? Right. Oh, good. He's in a good mood. Oh, no, they're in a bad mood. Oh, no, here we go. It's a bad mood day. And that's so awful to do to the people around you, really. Some people don't. I mean, it's not awful if you can't help it. But what's better than like when you run into somebody and you realize that in the midst of your never ending cyclical ups and downs, they're basically like stable. They're not freaking out. That's wisdom. Right. And that really does calm shit down around it. Because I think the whole like, like, freaking out is amplified if somebody else is participating in your freak out. Or anyway, whether they're participating by trying to calm you down, you know what I mean by telling you shit or participating by saying, why are you freaking out? There's nothing wrong or more commonly by freak. Oh my God, there's something wrong. You know, like, yeah, so yeah, if intelligence and ignorance, I think that's one of the qualities of both of them. Like frequent shifts in emotion based on external phenomena. Right. That's, and that's, I think I see that a lot with my lady, because people who look at me read the stuff I write, listen to podcasts and go like, oh my God. He's so smart, blah, blah, blah. And then like I have been a lot in my life. Exactly what you described is very emotionally volatile, being all over the place, experiencing super happiness, super sadness, which again is fun. There's something great about it to be able to experience everything. But when it's out of your control, it gets tiring for yourself and for everybody around you. Yeah. And instead I look at her and, you know, she doesn't write books. She doesn't. She speaks very little with most people. She's very quiet. And she has this happy, calming presence that seems to be unaffected by anything that goes on around her. And I'm like, who's the Zen master here, man? It's like, I rather learn from her. It's like, fuck everything I've been doing, everything I've read, everything I've won. It's, I want to be like that. I want to learn that person. And I think there's, at the end of the day, you are who you are, but I think there's something good about being honest with who you are, you know, not hiding it, not trying to, and at the same time take responsibility, not use diesel. I am being who I am as an excuse to dump your shit on everyone else. So in my case, I've seen plenty of time when my mood swings are hitting me hard or something. I'm not going to hide it. You know, I'm going to communicate. I'm going to tell my daughter what's going on. I'm going to tell my lady what's going on. But I'm also going to make a point to try not, so I'm just going to kind of show them a window of what my process is, what I'm going through, what I'm trying to do. But I'm also making a point that it's absolutely not fair for me to dump it on you. So it's just my shit. I will get out of it. Don't worry. It's all fine. I just need some time to myself because I just need to go through my process. But, you know, and the way you're both offering a chance for people, like you're not lying to people, you're not presenting a facade that does not reflect what's going on inside of you. You're being straight up. They are being straight up in a way that again is not, is not saying, hey, here is all the shit I carry with me. Let me dump it all around the house and over you guys because that's obviously not fair. Yeah. Yeah. That's the, so it's like the, the thing that pops up in Buddhism is if you can help, help. If you can't help, don't hurt. And so that's the, the, I think talking about these like phases that you're talking about. What, like where you, I think maybe where you shift, where you start, where the shift starts happening is you recognize, oh, okay. My reactions, like my feelings, I speak from personal experience. My feelings don't necessarily seem appropriate for the phenomena that's inducing the feeling. So this thing happens, that thing happens and you real, you're consumed with shame or anger or whatever. And at some point you're, if you're lucky, you're like, oh wait, why, why would that person saying that to me fill me with such powerful emotion that I would, you know, translate that emotion into some kind of aggression. And so that the first step seems to be like that you, you recognize, oh shit. Okay. Wait a minute. This feeling I'm having, it's number one has nothing to do with the phenomenon. Yeah, maybe someone did something annoying, but why am I reacting? Like I just saw a bus go off a bridge and catch on fire with people running out of it screaming. That seems a little weird, right? Like what's going on there? What is that? So then you, that's when you start. Okay. I'm, I'm, I can't stop with the way I feel, but I can tone down my reactions to the way I feel. That's the, that's cool. That's a cool thing, but still you're encumbered. You're still encumbered. You still are having these fucking meltdowns inside of you, these explosions. So then the next step is, I think really addressing that, like that's where you, you, you, you, because I know that like in the past, I would know this was happening. And I would be okay at repressing it, but eventually it's like, fuck, what is that? Like literally what is emotion itself? What is this in me that what the fuck is it? And so then you start, you start working with it. You start working with it. I think that's, and then you get to the possibility where holy shit, maybe those explosions literally stop happening inside, inside. You know, that's possible, Danielli. Don't you think like that is possible? I got a story for you. So yeah, that's interesting that you bring that up because for one, actually, let me say one quick thing first and then I get to the story in that sense. One is that despite the fact that clearly is not a happy place to be to be bounced by emotion left and right and out of your control. I am thankful for most of my life have been being this super highly passionate person with crazy emotions, even when it was uncomfortable and horrible. Because I feel that it allows me to relate to pretty much anybody. Like I can somebody going through something and I'm like, I know exactly that emotion. So in that sense, there's a part of me that likes it because I feel that more tools to interact with human beings and understanding of other people, emotions and where they're at. But check this out. So for reasons that are entirely out of my understanding, the past year of my life, something clicked in a way that it's interesting because I've become a very different person in the last year. From who I was before. I give you an example just starting with something seemingly silly, but I don't think so silly. Like my entire adult life. I've had insanely violent dreams on a regular basis. Right. Punisher style, blood everywhere. Really gory stuff. Two to three times a month at least kind of thing. To the point where it was like, yeah, you know, I was in there and I cut this guy's throat or there was attacking me and there was blood everywhere. And you're like, whoa. And it was normal for me. It's just how I live my entire life. The past year, I don't have them anymore. And I'm like, what the hell has shifted in me where suddenly it's not out of a conscious effort or wheel or anything. It's just they evaporated. Like they don't show up no more. And you know, it's something that's outside of my conscious control that would happen all the time that's no longer happening. That seemed to signal a shift. Yeah. And in general, I'm noticing something really changing my way I handle stress in the way I respond to situations in my overall attitude toward life. And the funny thing is that usually when something that dramatic happens, there's a story there. I have like, you know, I was miserable and I was struggling and I had this and that and I went to Peru and did ayahuasca in the middle of the jungle and the world change and I'm now enlightened or something. None of the shit ever happened to me, right? I've tried pretty much every other method I've heard of and nothing ever made that dramatic shift. This, you know, light from the sky that changes the trajectory of your life from the breathing to psychedelics to whatever. Some stuff has helped. Don't get me wrong. But like 2% where you're like, okay, that was nice. I like 2%. But let's be real. It's 2%. You know, it's not. And yet one day I wake up and I'm in a very different place from where I was before and I have no idea what happened. You know, because it's almost like my guess is that is a sum of 10,000 things and probably a certain degree of lack involved. Why things suddenly shift? But it's almost like the Zen coin, you know, when you hear that story about there's a dark, alive duck inside the bottle. You want to get the duck out without breaking the bottle, which of course physically is impossible. Yeah. And then the Zen guys tell you it's already out and you're like, what do you mean it's already out? It's not. You just told me it's in the bottle itself. And yeah, this is exactly the thing I'm experiencing where sadly I'm like, wait, was I in the bottle before? How the fuck did I get out? Did I fall asleep for a second? What just happened? Okay, I've got another one just that's exactly the same one. A student, a Buddhist student is on one side of a river. His teacher's on the other. He says to his teacher, I want to get to the other shore. His teacher says, you are on the other shore. Same does. I like the duck one better. It's cool. But you know, this is the, you know, it's a very exciting thing to hear that. I'm glad to hear that that happened to you. And it's, I think that, you know, you know, Buddhism, they call it ordinary mind, right? So it's like this mind of like, it's the mind where you think that phenomena have to be organized in a certain way to experience peace. And the more complex that organization of phenomena is, the less, definitely the less peace you're going to have. You know, it's like you're either going to be working with, you know, a kid's puzzle or some people like those insane, like 50,000 pieces. You know, it's so important. So some people, that's their reality is like, they have 50,000 bits of phenomena that have to line up perfectly. And if they come close to that, they start feeling relaxed and then they're like, Oh, great. But most of the time that's just not going to happen. The world is too turbulent. The puzzle pieces are always falling off the table there. This knocks them down, that knocks them down. And so they, instead of like the real realizing like shit, maybe I need a simpler puzzle going on here. They start blaming this fucking cat always knocks the puzzle pieces off the table, the wind, the this, the that, my husband, my ex husband, my future husband, my lack of a future husband, my lack of a future wife, blah, blah, all these things. And so you're always turbulent, turbulent, turbulent. Then the thing you're, I think is you just realized like, why do I keep fucking with this puzzle? Like what happens if I just stopped trying to put it together? What happens if I just realized it's already put together? In fact, the puzzle that the puzzle wasn't is broken. That's the puzzle. The puzzle is a scattered thing all over the place. Yeah. And then you then that thing can happen. I mean, this is the. You hear, I'm sure you know, you hear various iterations of this across the board, but it's like, this is your mind. Like whatever's going on is literally your mind. I don't mean like solipsism or like I'm God. I mean, literally you're taking in data, assembling it inside of your brain. And from that assembly, you've got some depiction of reality. It's your mind, the colors you're seeing, the words you're hearing, the way you instantly assemble words and shapes into something that you call reality. You're experiencing your mind when someone's annoying you. That's your mind. The feeling of annoyance. That's your mind. That's your mind. You know, and so I think that once you realize that it gets really exciting because it's like, oh shit. What happens instead of working on training the poodle, training the kids, training my wife, training my friends, training, trying to literally domesticate the universe? What happens if I start training my mind instead? And then, yeah, it's not like you might not have the road to Damascus experience. You might not get the praying man as that tells you you're Jesus or whatever. But it could just happen that you wake up one day. And you're not quite as neurotic as before. I want to thank God for creating Loomi Labs, which supports the DTFH because Loomi Labs created microdose gummies and these microdose gummies that they create are perfect. It's the perfect dose.

Thank you so much Loomi Labs. I love you. It could just happen that you wake up one day and you're not quite as neurotic as before. Exactly, that's the vibe, right? I mean, in some way, I would love to have a cool story about it, not for the sake of the cool story, but because it means that there would be a method. There would be something that I can see somebody else that I love struggling and I could be like, hey man, you can just do A, B, and C and you'll see the light and this stuff works out. I don't, you know, I have no idea. For all I know tomorrow, I may wake up and be in a very different state. I mean, it has been great for a year, but what do I know, right? So it's like, I would love for it to be replicable where I can say, hey, if you just do A, B, C, it's all going to work out. I haven't had that experience. It hasn't been a systematic thing. We're just going through step by step by step as led somewhere. I feel like I've run like a chicken without a head in 10,000 direction and one day I just woke up exactly where I wanted to be. And I'm like, oh, shit, how did I do it? It's like, oh no, I was running like crazy all around. It's like, okay, cool. I mean, it's nice. Of course, I like it. It feels good, but again, it would be nice to be able to use it so that you can help somebody else with it. Whereas I'm definitely not in a position to do that because I don't know what happened. Well, but I think just like any story, you know, for like all of my neurotic friends out there who like are clenching their fists or gritting their teeth at night or, you know, going through that, the hellscape of untamed mind. I think it's just nice to hear that. I mean, I think it's probably just really nice to hear like, oh, that's even possible. I mean, a lot of people don't think it's possible, Daniella. Like a lot of people, they hear the stories. We, you know, they in a lot of neurotic people are really drawn to Taoism, Buddhism, mystical Christianity, because they have a dream like maybe these countless people who are saying, you know, you don't, you don't have to suffer like that anymore. Maybe they're not just larping or maybe they're not just bullshitting. Maybe, maybe that's a possibility. But, you know, anytime you hear someone who's alive saying like, oh yeah, that it's not really going on anymore like it used to. That's, that's exciting. Even if it's not through for, it's just cool to know. Okay, that's a possibility. And I think in that sense, I, what you bring up is a good point because I do, if anything, sometimes when people have the method, just do what you ask, just breathe in a certain way, just meditate, just this. And then you do it and it doesn't work for you. If anything, it adds to the angst of it all because you're like, what the hell? I was a good boy. I went through step one through 10. I did everything you told me and you saw God and you're enlightened and I'm still pissed off and angry at everything. What the hell? If anything, it adds even another layer of what the hell is wrong with me kind of thing, you know. And I think the fact that we are all fucking different and even the same person at the same, had they done the same thing at a different time in their life, it may have not worked out that way. So I think in that sense, understanding, yes, it does happen. Yes, there are steps that one can take that are more likely to lead you there than others. However, no, there are no guarantees. And so you just go try things. They work great. They work partially. That's great too. You know, if they help you 2%, that's not a lack of success. That's still 2% better than where you were yesterday. That's fantastic. And just keep the process going because I mean, there's not like there are many alternatives. So you might as well keep playing the game and see what if something clicks, if something, and again, hopefully you start seeing what clicks for you more often than not. What methods seem to appeal to your personality and just run with that and see what happens. Yeah, man. It's like, to me, like what, you know, the cool stories are not the people who like actually like brought peace necessarily to some land. It's the story of somebody who like went into some place and tried to help. And even in the midst of trying to help, got the shaking out of them, but they still, they still try. I mean, I think, I think like the initial phases of like bringing peace to the world, it has to start with a recognition of the your own lack of peace. And then the moment you even start contemplating like, how do I get a little more tranquility into my own heart here? You, as cheesy as it sounds, you become a peace worker. You are now, you're, you're, you have the same intent as Gandhi, Martin Luther King, any of them. And how many of you know, think of the stories of them. They're plagued by their own weird human shit. I heard Ram Dass said once, if an asshole gets enlightened, then there'll be an enlightened asshole. So the, the, the, the, the notion of like enlightenment or peace or inner peace translating into no personality or a kind of homogenous, like, you know, you just suddenly become some kind of like boring ass personality list thing. I think that's a probably misunderstanding. And I, and a good reason for people to be like, well, then fuck that. You know, yeah, even if I am a scrambled fucked up mess, you know, that's who I am. Oh, you know, that's love. I mean, that's compacted self. That's the, that's already shows you that you're out of the bottle because some part of yourself is loving yourself. Even if you hate yourself, you love that you hate yourself. You love the way you hate yourself. You, you already be like that is good. That's it. That's, that's really it. That's already, that's what's so cool about it. You're, it's already there, man. It's already there. I mean, I've heard it described in a million ways. It's like a when you're out of the moment and you come into the moment, the recognition that you are out of the moment. What is that? What's the rat that that flick that way? Oh shit. I was just distracted. Who is that? What is that? You know, that's it. That's it. That's you. That's clear as a bell. There's nothing muddy about it. Nothing confused about it. You were like, like the other day, man, I'm looking for, I was cooking the kids oatmeal and I'm looking for the oatmeal bag. I'm like looking everywhere. Where's the fucking oatmeal? It's in my goddamn hand, man. It's like I've been carrying it around. I'm like, oh wow, I'm out of the moment. Totally distracted. That's a Zen parable right there. Yeah. Omeal's in your hand. Yes. You know. It's in my hand. Yeah. No, it's true. It's true. And I think it's interesting because and that's where I don't this. I mean, in some way I envy, I envy and I don't, you know, like when I was talking about my lady, like I envy the fact that she's kind of born that way. She has always been this way. She hasn't really known something else. And so one end I'm like, oh my God, life would have been so much easier from the get go. You know, it's fantastic. I love it. On the other end, I think it's like my weird quirky, annoying sometime personality is helpful in the sense that, you know, if I were to be talking to somebody who's really going through shit and being all like, let me tell you about the peace within my sweet brother. They would beat me to death and they would be right. You know, it would just be like, shut the fuck up. What are you talking about? You know, I hate the wannabe spiritual crap when people are like, let me show you the light or something. So to me, having an extremely low experience of what what other people may have been gone through, because you have gone through the same shit a thousand times and you know that place like, you know, your own home kind of thing. It's interesting because it shows that you can be on multiple levels at the same time. Right. It's like, oh fuck yeah. Like I you can speak the language, but you can also show that another language is possible. Yeah. Like I remember once just to I mean it's related and not but like I remember once there was a student of mine who came from the ghetto is ghetto you can think of like, you know, south central LA dead people on this block on a regular basis from. Drive by shooting kind of things and he would come to class and he would really dig some of the stuff we talk about. But there was always an element in him that said, did you read this shit in a book because it sounds cool, but I don't know about an experience like, and the one time where things click for him was when we were, he came to do martial arts with me. And he was from the ghetto. So a little rough around the edges, even though he knows you're supposed to keep it down inspiring, he was still going a bit hard. And he just nailed me with a punch. And then I was a good punch. And then I took his back and choked him out. Right. And by the idea and put him out out, but you know, I choked him where he and then he looked at me and he was like love in his eyes. Right. Because he was like, oh, so it's real. Like all the shit you talk about, you can take a punch in the face and stay cool. And now you're speaking my language, you know what I mean? Okay, now I'm going to listen to whatever bullshit you have to say about the universe because you show me that you can act in the world that I'm familiar with and act in a way that to me is honorable. That's how you do shit. So, okay, that means like, it's not just that you talk about the shit you talk about because you don't know how to act in my word. You know how to act in my word and you can take two steps beyond it. Okay, now I'm interested. Let's talk about it. Yeah, that's it. I mean, that is the general traditional classical way of talking about it is like, because you don't really like the, you're not supposed to earbeat and God knows I'm guilty of it. And especially when I'm like, in times when I've been really freaked out, like if you don't recognize everything's your mind, then it's a natural thing to try to calm shit down by telling other people about some shit you heard about how to calm down. She's like, okay, wait, maybe if I get everyone around me to start meditating, then I will calm down or, you know, you're pretending to be calm. Yeah. Really, you've just become a master at repression. Yes. Exactly. You know what I mean? Like you just really figured out a way to like hold in the fart. You've been holding, you know, you've like pulled off like holding it for a month. But so, so yeah, you're holding it all in. You're still tormented, but you're putting on a pretty good show. And then part of putting on the good show would be, now let me teach you how to hold in a fart. I'm an expert at holding this in. Yeah. You know, and I'm going to teach you as well. And then all that you have is a bunch of people with fucking tight butt cheeks around you at the best filled with gas. Just a matter of time before someone can't hold it in anymore. A matter of time. And then it's like, oh, who are you? You're not, you're not the person I, I married. Yes. Yes. So it's, I think it's more about like, you know, you know, it's all, it's always goes back to like, you know, why are you, don't try to take a stick out of your neighbor's eye when you've got a look in your eye. Don't, don't do that. And then, because truly like you, what's more astounding than being around someone like what you just described, where when the fucking shit goes down. They're not freaked out at all. And they're not like pretending to be calm. They're actually calm. Like that's, I think that probably just being in the presence of that would be reading 100 books on this mystical thing or that mystical thing, just watching it in the wild go down would be incredible. I would guess. Like that's, that's the real way to, if you want to talk about this. And then if someone's like, how the fuck did you do that? Like I was so scared. I was freaking out. Did you stay calm? Then you could say, oh, well, you know, this is whatever my practice is, or this is what I find interesting. But yeah, before they ask you. Yeah. And I think in that sense, keeping it real though is key. Right. Because the problem with everybody who feel that they have anything to contribute ever is that they start taking themselves too seriously. They think that their shit doesn't stink. They think that their methodology is the one methodology for all and everybody. And instead realizing that there's a huge element of luck in any achievement. So let's tone it down in the sense that whatever somebody has done, keep it humble because at the end of the day, you're also lucky. You know, if you apply enough pressure, trust me, you will crack. No matter how enlightened you are, you know, we have two eyes is to start applying electrodes to your genitals. Let's see. Maybe not. I don't know if I agree with that. There could be some chance. No. And I agree actually with you in the sense that I think there are degrees, right? The amount of pressure that you need to be under varies from person to person. Some person can be fantastic at minimal pressure. Some person can handle a certain degree. Some person can handle degrees that we can't even imagine. And then you wonder, maybe they can handle any. Daniela, did you just discover a way to measure enlightenment by putting pressure on someone's balls? Yes, that's exactly. This is incredible. The Vilelli Enlightenment Scale. We bring you in. Okay. You're realized. Okay. We're going to just gradually increase pressure on your balls. Even then. Even then it's funny, right? Because of it. It's a joke or whatever. Rather you do see these guys who are like ultra tough guys who can do these amazing things that other people would crack in fear and terror and they are monks and they are amazing. But then you leave them an afternoon to have to entertain a kid and they flip out, right? Right. So it's like a skill in handling one aspect of life doesn't necessarily mean that you have the same skill in all aspects of life. Yeah. Yeah, right. Yeah. I get it, man. You got to be honest about the whole thing, whatever it is. But you know what else you have to be? You have to be fucking honest about when you aren't freaked out anymore too. Yeah. Because some people make a whole business of being professionally freaked out. Yeah. You know, that's what Jack Cornfield called me a public neurotic and like, you know what I mean? It's like if you, if you start feeling like you're not quite as neurotic as before and you don't say that, you're as guilty as when you're neurotic. It's like it's saying that you have peace. You know, you just have to be honest about wherever you're at with it. But I do agree, man. It's like, I don't want to hear shit from a person. It's just like, you know, I actually was talking up to my meditation teacher about the phenomena of the Tulkus, the kids who are like taken into the monastic training at like the age of very young ages three, four, I don't know when it starts. And, you know, like you hear that and you're like, okay, great. So they were always around like a 2,500 year old tradition of, you know, achieving peace among other things. And so what, like, well, they didn't. So they really, they didn't, they don't know what it's like to like have to get to work and fucking traffic and all the stuff and paying your bill, all the stuff. So what the fuck do I, what do they have? What do I want to hear? But when you, when it's a maniac who you knew who suddenly isn't a maniac anymore, that's where it gets interesting because you, you know, because you're like, wait, what did you do again? And then the maniac is like, oh, I don't know, but that's really hard to do something. The maniac's like, I don't know, just woke up and I was fine. I don't know. I fuck you. It's like, I don't know. If you want, I can tell you everything that has been going on and who fucking knows? Maybe one aspect will click with you and actually help you, but let's be real. I don't have the solution for you. So let's, which is the opposite of what all cult leaders do, right? The classic leader thing is I find something that works because usually it starts for something legitimate and then I'm just going to spin it and spin it and spin it and blow it out of proportion and make it look like it can't fail and make it look like it works for everybody and delivers better result than it really does. And then I've built this whole cult of personality of everybody who think, oh my God, and I can do no wrong, which is the opposite of keeping it real, right? It is like you're on an ego trip and sadly, I mean, without going the cult leader route, but even at the more basic benign level, there are plenty of people, the so-called spiritual people who maybe without malice, but they kind of portray the same thing, you know, everything is about, oh, you should just breathe through this, oh, it should be. It's all about peace and love and mellow, which I highly prefer it to psycho, evil and somebody who's a dick, but it still doesn't feel real, you know what I mean? It's still the kind of guy that like my student would go to and go like, yeah, you have no idea where I come from, what my reality is, all the peace you are talking about, I guess good for you, but you have nothing to tell me because they're just no, you live in another universe here, you know? Yeah, right, man. Yeah, I know exactly, it's like, it's a phenomena, it's a real, we live in capitalism, there's like, you know, people who are good at portraying themselves as one thing and not being honest about all the other stuff and that's really malicious, I think it is kind of malicious in the sense that it's like, look, it's not working for you. Stop trying to tell people about shit, it's not working for you, it's not working for you, why are you acting like it's working for you, why are you promulgating something that you claim brings you some inner peace when, you know, you were just like throwing shit at the wall, like, you know what I mean, like at least say like, I've been throwing shit at the wall, sometimes the stuff works, but it doesn't work all the time. I mean, in past versions, this is why I try to like, if I'm exploring this, I try to put out there like, man, I'm fucked up, I get angry, I was freaking out, dude, I was freaking out all the time. But it's like, you have to be able to say that if you are, but if you're not, don't say you're freaking out to try to connect to people, don't make it up, don't pretend to be, you know, whatever, dissipated or something out of some attempt to, it's condescending in that case. It is. It is. That's why in fact, keeping it, ultimately, when you're keeping it real is because you are comfortable in your own skin, in every way, what people perceive as good sides, less pleasant, it's like, this is what I'm capable of, this is why I'm for better of worse, I may change, I may be able to switch things around, but this is what I bring to the table. And let's not edit it for the sake of only presenting, it's like when you date and you want to only present your good side at first, which you're never going to be able to keep that image down the road, and it sets up seeds for the relationship failing, because you cannot keep up that image. But for the sake, I guess, of being charitable for people sometime who get stuck in that phase, I think there is a little bit of a fake it till you make it thing that's true because it's important not to get stuck in it, but it's understandable that initially you may have gotten a taste of something and you are desperately trying to put the focus on it over and over, it's not where you are at the core, you haven't really absorbed it, but you did taste it, so you are like badly pushing it and you want to embody it, so some of it is understandable and natural to fake it till you make it, I think so, being honest helps, you know, being like, you don't need to fake it, you can go with it and say, these as work for me, I want to work on it, I want to improve, I want to play with it, and try it out, what do you think, oh, it doesn't work for you, interesting, I don't know enough to tell you why it doesn't, let me, you know, and you can still push in that direction without pretending that you know you put the ropes on and you are enlightened or some shit and you have the way, because that is honest, you know, that's not just fake it till you make it, that becomes dishonest, first and foremost become dishonest with yourself, which then you have precluded any possibility of growth from there forward. Right, this is what I love about Trump of Rinpoche's teaching in this regard, when you have any of these glimpses, these things, disown it, disown it, so it's like, put it down, so what, okay, great, you had the thing, great, great, great, but that's whatever happened, in fact, what's cool about your story is you don't even know, because that's kind of what, that's the idea is like, the more you get attached to a method or the more you get attached to something that happened to you a long time ago, or the more whatever, it starts rotting in your hands, like the thing just starts rotting, putrefying, changing just like everything else, even the renditions of the stories regarding the moment of whatever starts decomposing in your hand, like some sad fucking, you know, miscarried baby or something, it's like, you're supposed to disown it. I love your event, it's a huge show. I put, I only say that, I'm so sorry, I mean like what I'm specifically why I said that is because there's this very sad video about a gorilla that I think we've talked about this is gorilla gives birth, baby's dad, gorilla will not put the baby down, gorilla's walking with the baby, what's better than a baby gorilla is maybe cuter than a human baby, it's the cutest thing ever, enlightenment, what could be better, adorable, beautiful, perfect enlightenment, but it's like, really it's, you gotta put it down, you gotta give it that up too, like you gotta give that up too, you gotta give up all that bullshit, put it down and then you're starting over, see this is the thing no one wants to start over, what about all the work I did, what about all the fucking books I read, what about all the fucking thing and the piece, it's like okay, whatever, let it go man, and I think what you're talking about is some people can't let it go, they can't put it down, they went to too many seminars, they went to too many retreats, they went to too many of this and that, I'm not putting this shit down, this is me man, I'm the, do you get it, I'm the fucking piece for one, exactly how it is, that's the textbook right, and it is understandable, you know you have struggled a lot, you've been swimming in the ocean, getting your head bobbed under the waves way too many times and you've found a rock and you're clinging it to it for dear life and I get it, you know I understand, it's still a problem, but I understand why people do it, you know, I think so at the end of the day, yeah you need to acknowledge the fact that every day start a new, what worked yesterday, hopefully carries on to today, they are, the bookmakers are giving you good odds that you know if you have been able to put it string it in a row for many days in a row today may still be a good one, but there is no guarantee, you know, maybe something will happen and you find out that you didn't have it quite as together as you thought you did, but I'll tell you this, all that being said, if via some unknown whatever or through the adoption of some method that you have rigorously devoted yourself to, if you are experiencing a reality where you're no longer quite so much in hell, you're allowed to enjoy that, because that's the other problem is like within the sort of Zen Eastern idea of like let it go, forget about it, whatever, sometimes people get confused and then they, because they get attached to the letting it go and they think that somehow that like if I use, you know, if your experience isn't going to be, it's almost like a bad sign or it's like, oh no, I think something's happening, oh no, or whatever, I think like the place where the emptiness or the reality of you being surrounded by an infinite luminous womb where that starts touching the denser aspects of your mind that you've decided are yourself, and then from that contact comes a kind of, are you kidding me? This is real? You're allowed to enjoy that, like you can totally like you get to like go, ah, holy shit. You know what I mean? Like you're allowed to, you don't have to immediately go fuck, I'm feeling bliss, I'm feeling bliss, is this, wait, what is this? Run with it, no, I'm a big fan of celebrating, you know, I think it's absolute, because that's the thing, you know, some people are all celebrating where they, it's like you haven't done shit, you haven't achieved anything, you are patting yourself on the back for nothing you've ever done, and it's like, I mean, I'm glad you feel good if you're feeling good and if it's not just an act, but that's a little weird. At the same time, what you described, right, there are people who are constantly beating themselves up, even when they do fantastic things, it's like, yeah, but you know, I could have done better, or yeah, but you know, tomorrow is another day, and it's like, yeah, tomorrow is another day, but fucking party right now, you know, just dancing around naked under the moon, it feels fucking great to go for it, is it gonna last? No, but nobody's expecting you to, that if it doesn't last tomorrow, we are all judging you and say you're an asshole, it's like, it's fine, just enjoy for a while. And I think that balance where you can flex in the mirror and go like, god damn, I'm good, and then the next second you realize that it's all a cosmic joke and you can relax a little because taking yourself to seriously is the source of many terrible things, they're both good, right, you need to have both sides to it and mix them together, because if you get stuck in only one aspect of it, you're fucked. You know the example I like, Danieli is, you know, the dreaming, like so, it's like you're having a nightmare, it's horrible, chased by a tiger is usually the example given or some version of that, you wake up and you're like, oh, great, I'm not getting chased by a tiger anymore. You don't spend the rest of your life telling people I was chased by a tiger in a dream and now I'm not chased by the tiger. You know what I mean? It would seem weird, similarly, I think probably what might happen, one possibility in life is like, you wake up from the nightmare that was causing, there was a result of you differentiating yourself from external phenomena, and holy shit, wait, what, this is crazy, I thought I was that thing, but this is what I'm at, but eventually, that's just what you are now, you aren't going to feel so compelled to like pat yourself on the back and throw parties for yourself anymore, you know, I would guess, I have a theory that man, there are a lot more enlightened people out there than we think, it's just some people are like, why or would I even talk about this, like they don't really feel quite so, or I guess a better way to put it would be any way that they talk is a transmission of the Dharma, they never heard those words, the Dharma, Buddha, Jesus, any of that stuff, but it just so happens that the way they communicate with people helps, no matter what, you don't have to be there's no, this is who I am, it's just that's how they are, people around them feel better, people around them just feel better in a real way, and then maybe the people around them aren't, start feeling better in a way that isn't dependent on being in their presence, you know, and I love what you just said, because to me, sometimes when people talk about enlightened or this is like, what the fuck does it even mean, right, it's like, what are we, but you brought it to a level that's very almost measurable, right, it's like, does, does the fact that you walk into a room and interact with everyone, they walk away and their day has improved by 10%, that's a real thing, you know, that's something that is not just words, is not just the story you tell yourself, it's something that there's almost tangible effect that you can have on a situation or on people, and that's a win right there, you know, if you can do that on a semi consistent basis, you're doing something right, however we define it, you know, who cares whether it's enlightenment or not or whatever, yeah, whatever you want to call it, it's something good, it's something that that's creating something positive in the world, I love that when I see great comics here in Austin, it's such a good comedy scene, when I see really great comics, like it inspires me, you see that and you're like, holy shit, that's possible, or like, you know, when I see people who have gone from being like, out of shape to suddenly being healthy, I'm like, oh fuck, if you did it, I could probably do it, it's, you know what I mean, it's that basic, it's just basic, it's like, it doesn't have to be so, it's not whatever, you don't need flower garlands and incense and stuff like that, talking about something fundamentally more basic than that, which is like, it just might be, you don't have to be blown by the winds of your neurosis all day long, and some people aren't so much, and that's great news for every, for all of us. Absolutely, and I think the quality in that sense that interests me the most, you know, we started earlier and we were talking about intelligence and wisdom and this and to me, the way wisdom manifests, like where you can say that there is wisdom, I see it a lot in kindness and humor usually, because to me, they go together, you know, if somebody is a really kind, sweet person who's doing their best to pass something good to other people around them, they have a sense of humor about life, which usually helps a lot. To me, they are doing every, that's wisdom at work right there, because they are having an impact on everything they touch, that's, oh, that's beautiful. So to me, that's worth a million times more than any bullshit intelligence in a purely brainy kind of way, because unless that intelligence can translate, like intelligence is a bonus, like, oh, now you do some fantastic things through your kindness, through your thing, and you can communicate them in a way that's smart and okay, that's fantastic, that's a tool, but intelligence is a tool, is not a qualitative state that's good or bad in itself, is how you use it, that's interesting, and how you use it is the wisdom that manifests itself through kindness and humor and things like that. That's where intelligence interests me, otherwise intelligence is like, do I care, you know, not that interesting to me. You got a little bit longer, how are we doing on time here? Oh, I'm good. So I heard this story about the Dalai Lama, I think it was the Dalai Lava. The Dalai Lava? The Dalai Lama, somebody was asking like, if you ever, you know, mystical, but like, was asking what, someone who was around him all the time, like, do you ever see anything like magic, you ever seen anything, you know, and they were like, yeah, whenever you, whoever he's around, he gives them his full attention, I've never seen it any other way. Yeah, like, that's wild to think about, like, you know, always just fully in the moment with whoever happens to be with him. That's incredible. You don't need to like, there's no, you don't need to articulate that in some system, system at all. It doesn't fucking matter. Like, patience, Jesus Christ, when you're around someone who's really truly patient, how wild that is, like, patience, they're not in a hurry. They're okay. Just like, the base things are going or where you're at or whatever. They're unperturbed and there's such a difference between actual patients and fake patients. You know what I mean? It's such a big difference. Generosity, you know, when you're around someone who's just generous, but it's not generosity with strings attached. It's just part of the way they are generosity. You know, these are, these, these qualities are, they're, they transcend dogma, I think. And that's where no religion owns patience. No, exactly. And that's where to me sometime is interesting, because you do see human beings that are sweet, good, generous, caring human beings. And then they start talking about ideology, whether political or religious or whatever the fuck. And you go like, where did that sweet person just go? Because now before your eyes, you're seeing this sweet angelic figure turning into a fucking demon because the ideology they are stuck to is so ugly and doesn't match the natural kindness that they have. But for whatever reason, they got latched into some shitty ideology that yeah, must have given them something in their life that they needed, but is really the opposite of the good heart that they have when they are not talking about this shit. Oh, yeah, that's interesting. Now you're dealing with what conditional compassion. You know, you're dealing with, well, this person deserves my compassion. That person deserves no compassion. This person deserves it. That person does not. Yeah, that's definitely a that that's that's not a good sign. And the for any of us, I mean, it's not like any time you're like metering out compassion based on what level of, you know, what this person deserves this, like you're at a casino or something and giving out compassion chips based on what the way people's cards are coming out. That's not good. That's probably about I heard this story about I wish I could remember his name. It's a Tibetan llama got arrested by the Chinese put into prison. And, you know, they I don't know if you heard about this, but the Chinese Communist Party, not necessarily a fan of religion. So they're beating the shit out of this monk. I mean, this is a like, a luminous being, right? And they're just using him as a punching bag, punch like, I think one of his eyes went blind for how much they're beating him. And the story is that the entire time he was there, he was treating the people beating him with pure love, bowing to them, smiling at them as they're fucking kicking his ass, man. You hear other stories of this in Christianity, I know you know, I'm talking about where the martyred Christians are getting like burn at the stake and they're praying for the people burning them at the stake. This, you know, to talk about like non differentiating compassion, the reaction to someone incinerating you. I mean, the ordinary mind reaction to that is going to be like, why did you set me on fire? Fuck you. You know, so this is to me where the real magic appears where you're like, yeah, you're just, you're just going to be like this, no matter what's around you and what they're doing to you. Not to say you don't defend yourself necessarily, but. And I think that's where it gets interesting, right? Because there's an interesting dance in which energy you want to manifest, whether you want to go the route that's like, completely open and loving no matter what gets thrown your way. Or where you go, you know what, this is the one time where I turn on my inner con and the barbarian and fuck off, you know, and I don't necessarily think that turning in the your inner con and the barbarian in certain conditions is bad. I think the judgment call, you know, most of the time, that's a bad idea. You know, I would agree that overwhelmingly, the majority of cases, the better answer is in the more loving accept in general. Yeah. And then once in a while, you go like, not today, motherfucker and not with you, because there's you cross a few lines too many where no dear Richard Ramirez, the night stalker, I'm not going to be compassionate with you right now. I'm going to put a bullet in your head. And that's just how it goes. Yeah, but I think you could compassionately put a bullet. I get it. You know, you know, when you grow up, I'm sure you have your reasons. I still, you're a rabbit dog. I still need to put you down with without, you know, like I need to torture you on the public square. You know, you're a fucking rabbit dog. You just need to. But these, these are extreme examples that always the mind presents. Like in gin, like if you just do the thought experiment, imagine this, you just parachute it into your life. Whatever the fuck you were before, who knows, you just parachute it in to the frame of the present moment. You are fine. And now what you're going to do for the rest of your life is help. You're going to be come, you're just going to help. You know, that's it. You're just going to help. You don't even need a manual for this shit. You're just going to try to help the way you're going to help who the fuck knows. It's exciting. I don't know how you're going to help. It could be some massive endeavor where you bring food to all the starving people of the world, or it might just look like you being less cruel to yourself. And it might just look like you in the presence of exactly the people around you, having compassion for them or some version of that, right? That's it. That's it. Whatever comes comes. If it's Richard Ramirez, when you end up euthanizing Richard Ramirez, great, you just saved a lot of people from brutally murdered congratulations. But more than likely, what's going to happen is the person around you is going to do the thing that annoys you and you stretch for a second instead of trying to fix it. You see what happens if you don't do anything? See what happens if you don't say, why are you always with me? What happens if you don't? Right. What happens? What happens is shit gets really interesting, real fucking quick, you know, and then things actually change. But yeah, whatever dogma you want to attach to that, if it helps you attach it. I remember on what you're describing, a bouncer story where somebody they were describing a situation where there was this really obnoxious person wanting to pick a fight. And you know, the standard thing would be if you are a bad bouncer, you just beat the shit out of them. If you are a professional, you just find a way to get them out. But in this situation, the scenario was the bouncer approaching the guy and say, look, I've had a really fucking hard life. This thing happened to me, this thing happened to me, I had loved ones die in my arms, I had this and I understand this has nothing to do with you. Okay, so I'm not telling you that you need to fix it. This is just my shit. But if you can find it within yourself to make the life of a guy who has gone through all this shit, one millimeter easier tonight, I would be eternally grateful to you. Now, at that point, you're the other guy, you need to be such an asshole to go out. I mean, you just ruled out all the people who are average obnoxious, who are gonna feel like, oh, I'm actually gonna come out being the nice guy, and this poor buster, the ash were fine. At that point, the only people who are gonna give you a hard time are like the professional assholes who are going out of which at that point, you also feel better if you have to smash them, right? It's like, okay, well, I gave you every way out possible. But I like that. I like that idea of just some time being being really vulnerable. Because the thing that we all do when we feel under attack, whether by words, by anything is put up our guard. And I think there's a strength in showing vulnerability in there's a strength, even if like you're a kid and the kid at school is being a dick and having a conversation and saying, Hey, man, what's the you're actually hurting me? I'm going to her, you know, that's where you you push somebody into becoming either better or worse. If they are worse, now you have a reason to check them. And if they are better, well, you solve the problem. But you're right, you know, you're not just responding defensively automatically, where at that point, they may have not meant it that bad, but they are compelled to respond defensively and the spiral out of control, right? You give them every chance because you show a certain degree of vulnerability. And if they insist on being a dick after chance one, two and three, well, then at least the cards are on the table is very clear who they are and what they are doing. Exactly. Yeah, that's, it's, you know, yeah, you don't always have to use the sword. Like there's so many other things you could do. I mean, we both know this as parents, like the sometimes you have to be like, no, you're not going to do that. That we're definitely not going to like whatever usually involves like, well, no, we're not doing somersaults down the stairs. Right. We're not going to do that. And you have to stop it right there. You have to stop. Or you know, the most example any parent knows is like, if your kid starts trying to run across the street and a car is coming, you're not going to be like, excuse me, let's have a conversation about it. A car is coming now and it's much bigger than you. And it seems to be going about 30 miles per hour. If it hits you, I'm pretty sure like, if it doesn't kill you, it's going to put you in the hospital for a while, probably a concussion at the very least. You're like, stop. Stop. That's compassion, by the way. That is true spontaneous, the spontaneous manifestation of compassion. And if you're adrenaline was going, you needed to get fucking angry. If you've ever heard a mom do one of those, it's like, everyone freezes. The sky stops moving. That's okay. But sometimes they just don't know. You know what I mean? Sometimes I have to sit down and be like, okay, here's why we're asking you to do this. Here's why. Because when you put the the bear, the teddy bear in front of my face and punch, it's still a punch. You know, it's not softening the blow at all. I know you think maybe the teddy bear in your exploration of how to wrestle has softened your rather like powerful child face when it's the bridge of my nose. You know what I mean? Sometimes you need to explain. And then they're like, oh, oh, right. The bear, of course, it's very thin. You know what I mean? There's ways and that applied to me. I mean, I think you extrapolate from the way you work with your kids to like literally every everybody. 100%. No, I think it's key. And I think it's key in that way. And that to me is being able to relate to people on multiple levels, speaking multiple languages. Should we not put enough defenses and at the same time being real about when shit is hurting you? And I think there's something to be said for that. Daniela, we did it again. What a wonderful conversation. Thank you so much. I'm excited to hear that you're getting your podcast going again. Can you let people know about what's going on with that? Because you put yourself behind a paywall, you went up into the mountains for a while and you're back now, correct? Yes, indeed. Yeah, I mean, it was pretty plain and simple, too good of a deal to say no. Which, of course, it's something that behind a paywall, because inevitably you're going to lose a big chunk of your audience who understandably may not have the money or the desire to follow behind a paywall. At the same time, it made a difference in my family's life. So I'm okay with the way you worked out. I'm also happy that I'm no longer behind a paywall. So yeah, if you guys can listen in now, can tune in, subscribe, tell your grandma, your goldfish, whoever has a heart beat and an account where they can download the podcast to check out History on Fire.

It's a great fucking podcast, man. It's really good.

It's so sticky. You want to keep listening? You know, yeah, definitely you should listen. Don't just subscribe, listen. Beautiful. I love it. So where is it? It's everywhere pretty much.

Hello there. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake and no be too bl winner, Welcome to you at, it's the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. Derek, welcome back to the DTFH. It has been, feels like a million years. I think it was probably last four years podcast. It's been, it's been E E on. I saw one of the things about the pandemic that is so we always just think back to the ancient times before this pandemic. And I used to say that kind of sarcastically, like, you know, the before times, but the longer the shit goes on, the more like all the stuff that used to seem so normal just seems like something in the distant past, you know, like a- When there was time, when there was like a deadline, when there was like, I was thinking the other day, sorry, my first line, I cough in the mic. It's been four years, you know? I'm pretty sure I could tell you what hour it is by walking outside. I've gotten used to know where the sun is like, like I wear a watch that doesn't work. Oh, me too. There's no- Do you feel ashamed about that? What's that? Do you feel ashamed about that? Not at all. I love them people. I'm sorry to interrupt this. I'm sorry, can you record on your end on Zoom? Oh God. And we got it. Hey, do you mind if I just get some water? I forgot. Yeah, man. Like, you know, just this thing that just happened, we've become used to these Zoom, you know, we've become used to these Zoom technicalities, just all the weird shit that is suddenly, like, I don't want this to be normal. I don't want it to be like, oh yeah, it's a Zoom problem that I'm having talking to my friend. You know, but it's becoming normal. My kid, you know, when I'm wearing a mask, he'll point to it and go, mask, mask. Oh God. Sorry. You know? What was your son's first word? Masky. Mask, mask. And it's like, this is the weirdest time, you know, when you, there's something so wonderful about humans' ability to adapt to our environment, but God damn, there's something tragic about it too. Isn't there? It's all tragic. I don't know where the good part is, but it's gone on for so long. It's why humans are constantly asking why about everything. Like when a baby, fart, your child probably says why after everything, right? Did you call my child, Fart? Fart, and then I stopped because I was like, maybe Duncan doesn't want people to know his name. I was out of respect, out of respect, I called him Fart. To protect him, his name is Fart, Trussell. Your baby, Fart. You know, little Fart Trussell. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can say his name. I'm just saying, kids always ask why, we always ask why. And I think we're trying to act like this is normal. And that's what I don't like. It's like, this isn't normal. We shouldn't be pretending like this is fine, but we also have to, whatever. I'm not gonna get in a mask ramp, but it fucking pisses me off. I ride my bike every day and I just, this isn't a bike story. This is a mask story. Yeah, well, I mean. And just the amount of people that still aren't doing it. And I just, I wish there was a shirt, or wish there was a fucking necktatt I could have of like the ventilator diagram of what it does to you and how it goes inside of your throat and down your lungs, like put on your bib, put on your bib. You know, man, you can't, this is one, I've had a few like epiphanies when I've been thinking about that, going through the mass frustration. Then I just remember people fucking smoke. Like, you know, like these are people's, people are complete, they're, how many times, I can, I can, I can, I can, I've been at a cafe but in the ancient times with my kid, my wife, and some fuck will just light a cigarette, a few tables down, the wind clearly blowing the smoke across the people and we'll pretend that we don't notice it when we obviously, nobody likes having a carcinogen blown through the wind on them. And you look at it, you know, you look at the person doing it with this combination like indignation and underlying shame, right? And that's what I see with the people who are adamantly anti-maskers. It's the same fucking thing. It's like, I'm not going to adapt is what their, their ego has gotten attached to non-adaptation. Dude, when I got fucking cancer and the doctor told me I had cancer, I remember saying to him, but I can still, I had the tour, a little tour coming up. I'm like, I can still go on this tour, right? And he's like, you have cancer. No, I just told you, you had cancer. Like, you can't go on a tour. You gotta get, this is, you, there's no time to waste but my mind could not catch up to the new reality. And so I think all these people that it's a combo denial mixed in with lazy thinking, mixed in with anti-science irrationality, mixed in with terror, you know? But I, and we're all like, come on motherfucker, just put the goddamn thing on for two weeks. If everyone did it, the show would be over. Yeah. Should I put on a mask? No. What's, is this sound okay? Is it working? Sounds great. You look upset. No, I just upset myself. You look good, man. I like this new Jimmy Buffett style. Look, I'm a dad now. I'm gonna wear wine and fucking shirts. Fucking dad, I wear a wine and shirts in the day. I don't care. Derek, so, man, so let's just hit the first thing everyone's gonna be wondering about drunk history, the beloved drunk history. Really? It's like in the comedy world, this was like, you know, this meant a lot to a lot of different people, me included. You're the first person who really put me out there in front of people over and over and over again. Some of my favorite memories that I can remember. When we, yeah, when we, when I asked you about Tesla, when we first did it. No. What's the memory? It's every time I'm about to go into an amnesic blackout and the patience in your face is I'm realizing over the years how you've gotten progressively better at talking to drunk people. And like the delight in knowing that I could trust you to allow myself to fall into some kind of demonic haze that you weren't gonna use whatever I said that would like be horrific. You know, it was, you know, that's I think one of the many, many things that weird talents you develop when you start doing weird shit. And you became this Sivangali for drunk people. But also you became a very trusted person because no one's gonna say yes to doing a show where you are supposed to get blackout drunk if they think you're gonna use shit that they said when they were blacked out drunk against them to make them look bad. You achieved this like everyone trusts you that and that's when I say beloved. I mean, like you gave us all, well, you gave us all money for getting drunk. I mean, that's fucking the coolest thing, man. A big thanks to DHM Detox for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. DHM Detox is the vitamin for people who like to enjoy alcohol.

And then all of a sudden, everything's fucked in the world. I'm always trying to keep myself from plunging into the abyss of cynicism and negativity. Another person has died, another person's gone nuts. And then all of a sudden, on fucking Twitter, what pops up, but the drunk history has gotten canceled. And that was a shadowy moment for me, man. I just was like, come on. Like, come on, what the fuck are you doing? Like this show, not just because I was on it and it gave me a little bit of a spotlight and let me ramble in a drunk way and was delight. And I would always think to every single one, I'd be like, I'm never gonna do another one. I can't enjoy these hangovers. And then you'd always call and be like, have you ever heard of this story? And I'd be like, whoa, shit, and wanna do another one. But, you know, it's sad, man. How are you doing with a cancellation? I'm good, I'm good. I mean, it's definitely, it's hard because when the obvious things you work hard for something and then somebody makes a decision that's completely out of your control and it just feels, it feels like a funeral but no music. Like I just, I'm okay with the funeral. I just would like there to be music so I could end it. You know what I mean? What do you mean music? Like, what do you mean? I would like to end it. Like an upbeat, there's a difference between a funeral and an upbeat funeral, you know, like a celebration, you know? Yeah. And so we had filmed all of season seven. You remember the amazing Poltergeist story that you were told and we had shot all those. All those stories are completely finished and, you know, we stopped for COVID and then, yeah, these new people came into the network and just decided they didn't wanna do it anymore. And I had figured that they were gonna come in and say, let's just, they're notorious for like buying cheap shows that make a lot of money and so I was expecting, okay, they're gonna say the show's too expensive and we gotta cut it down. And I was prepared to pitch ending the show like it started and just shoot it in our backyards with even dumber wigs than before and just making it feel like how it originally started on YouTube. And I just thought that would be authentic and it would be like cheaper and a good way to end it. It's the stuff that we hadn't, like I'm okay with the show being over, but it's the stuff that we were doing that I just wanted to finish that. I don't know if you remember the teacher appreciation episode, like as you know, I would do this thing each night with everyone where I say like, you know, Duncan, do you mind looking in the camera and saying like your name and what we're gonna be learning about today? And each night this season I could feel when they were drunk enough where I, they thought I was just gonna say that again and so I'd go, will you just look in the camera, tell me who you are and who your favorite teacher was and everyone's face just like lit up. Cause it's like, that's the best stuff of, you know, talking about our teachers and nobody forgets that. And then I talked about mine and then Mr. Stang, my history teacher came on the show. I got like a little school desk and he's like by a chalkboard and we just get shit face and he tells the amazing story of the whiskey rebellion with Alexander Hamilton. And it was just like, this is it. Everybody wants to be friends with their teacher, but like to get drunk and have him tell a story. And then I said, I save everything and I saved my binder from his class and he like regraded my papers. It was so cool. I just thought that would have been a great way to end the series of like a history show that was, you know, gave a shout out to the most important job in the world, teachers. Yeah, I mean, usually the, like I, like usually when you have a show like Drunk History that has been successful for a long time that's become like everyone's familiar with it, usually when you have a show like that that's been going on for so many seasons, it is when it's finally, when it's time to end, usually there's some kind of joyful goodbye between the network and the creator. Like, fuck, we did this for this long. Thank you so much. And you're like, thanks for letting me do this thing. But there's something in this that is so jarring and is seems to actually be weirdly perfectly in sync with this time period in human history where it's like shit just is falling apart, you know? And like that, it's like the idea that, you know, that it would be sort of unceremoniously just, well, now, like, yeah, you did it for how long again? How many years? I mean, the YouTube was 2007, but then when it became a show, I think we did the pilot in 2012 or 13. Yeah, so, I mean, been damn near decade of doing this here's the reality. Uncreative people shouldn't be allowed to make creative decisions. And that goes in every job. It's like there's somebody at the top making decisions, no matter if it's a hardware store or a TV network, like, where they shouldn't be, you know? There's just certain people that I'm just like, why the fuck would you make, why wouldn't you just talk about it? What is the problem? Let's help each other. Is it that it's too expensive? Okay, let's change it. Okay, you can't say it's COVID because COVID's going to be gone. Just hold the show and we'll come back later. But just cut the dick off and not talk about it? I mean, it's Lorena. Yeah, what are you? What are you? Lorena Bombett? Yeah. I was gonna see where you were going. What are you, Jeffrey Dahmer Bombett? Come on. That's, yeah. You know, this is the, like, I get, to me, like, you know, there's a lot of industries. Like, to me, like, there's something, I just hope, anything you say in this regard, you sound naive and ridiculous, but I mean, I would hope that humans, like, evolve past the whole, well, it's just business, man. You know, to me, like, the whole just business. Yeah, don't take it personally, it's business, babe. Hey, it's just business. It's like, look, this is, that's the, you know. We're humans, we're all humans. A robot didn't make this decision. A human made this decision. So people at the top, this is the thing, take 90 seconds out of your goddamn fucking day and call someone and say, this isn't working out. Do the breakup. Don't just all of a sudden take the keys away. Like, breakup, do the breakup. Do, be a fucking human. Prove that you have some sort of human quality. Humanize yourself. But it's people in power that hide from that crap. They make a decision based off money, but you forget how many people that affects. I'm sad about the show, but more importantly, the world that I had of people, of crew, of, you know, narrators that don't work as much, people that I can hire, like, and then them losing their, you know what I mean? Like, that's the thing is I don't mind losing a TV show because I am excited to do more stuff, but I get sad at just how, just how it's done. How it's done needs to change because it's just, again, I'm not playing poor to me. I just get really upset with people that have no human qualities that are making very big life changing decisions. Look, you know, first of all, you don't seem, you know, I was talking to you on the, when we were talking last, one thing I said to you, which I still feel like today, is like, you're not being whiny enough, you know? Like you're, I don't know if I would be able to, like, I don't know, like, it would, it's, to me, the key part is that thing you just said, which is a TV show that's been around as long as yours is, has, it does become a family. It's not a cheesy thing to say. It becomes a community. It becomes like an artist colony. You, and also it becomes like a methodology of creation that's specific to that group of people, a sort of process that gets refined over the years and all the mistakes you made early on that you fix and all the things you learn. So by the end, you get this like incredible machine that's designed to produce this one thing in a smooth, beautiful, funny way. And so it's like, yeah, it's not just like you're canceling a show. You're canceling like a factory, a process. And yeah, it's, it's, it's, it's, maybe there's no good way to do it. I mean, and the other thing is the, you know, don't you get the sense there's just not, you're not getting all the data, right? Isn't that the other infuriating thing is like, and because you're not getting all the data, you have in your mind one person who you're fucking pissed at, but you don't know what happened. Cause you know, it's connected to a whole web of others. Who the fuck knows? That's the part that's got, that's weird. Yeah, it's absolutely no one has told me the reason. That's like, oh, force majeure. Like, well, you can't call that if, whatever, I can't talk about that, but you can't use that term if you have other shows in production. It's like the act of God didn't just happen in Burbank. Man, the, look, this is my paranoid self, you know, driving around LA, looking around, looking around and thinking some's, some's off here, man. Not that some should be on, but it's like, I've lived in this city so long, I love this city. And I remember like sitting with my wife when I began to realize I was gonna have to leave. And just, and she saw it on my face. She's like, it's okay, it's okay. I didn't cry or anything, but I was like, wow, this beautiful place, this beautiful, beautiful place that, you know, help both of us kind of like live out dream lives. Something's cracking in a way I've never seen it crack before. And I, and I, like it was this realization of like, oh fuck, like, it's bad, it's what, it's bad. And it's bad in a way that people are gonna talk about years down the road, but right now, I don't think they've even formulated words for it. And so that thing that happened to Comedy Central, to you and Comedy Central, to me indicates a huge chunk of data that you don't, that you're not privy to. And that's my conspiracy theory part of me. I just keep thinking, man, all this shit, you know, you're driving down the road here, man. And you look up and it's like shantytowns. It used to be homeless encampments. The homeless encampments are turning into shantytowns. Like, people are building little like houses with like plywood and shit. And like, there's Porta Johns, you're like, that's a shanty, that's a shantytown. And you know what I mean? And that means that if that's happening and it's spreading and expanding, then to me, that's like a little, like, it's like when you see one mouse in your house or you see like, you know what I mean? It's like there's, it means other shit's going wrong. Other shit's spreading out in the industry here. Just think about this industry, man. Like, these execs, man, they're having to deal with the craziest fucking problems, you know? And like, but I don't, so who the fuck knows what happened, man? Who the fuck knows? But I think what you're saying is that we always have been like, you know, the man, you know, fuck the man and all that. But like, now, you're like, oh, now I, you can see more of why we felt the scum-ness. And I think since all of this started COVID, like, you start to really see who cares and who doesn't. And it's like a test for everyone because there is no instruction manual for this. No one's done this before. So we're not like, oh, well that's what they did and they turned out fine. Like, the only thing that we could learn from or the other countries that started this before us, but we're really seeing who cares and what they care about. You know, like, and I think that because so many places have lost money because of the obvious, people make terrible decisions when they're in fear. Nothing good. Have you ever heard someone going like, holy shit, I was freaking the fuck out. I made the best decision. No one's ever made a good decision based on fear. Ever. No way. And all these decisions, and I'm not talking about the show, everywhere is based off fear. And we're all scared because what do we know? What do we know? We know now, which we have talked about forever. That's all we've ever known. But even more importantly now is, that's all we can focus on is this moment in time because we, this is just the craziest whacked out dream anyone has ever been part of. Dude, have you heard the litany against fear in Dune that Ben Jezzer at litany? It's like the sci-fi book Dune. It goes, it's the best. It goes, I will not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. Is it that cool? Wow. I love that. It's like once the amygdala starts, but it goes on, it goes on a little bit longer. I just haven't memorized all of it. But once the amygdala starts taking over, all your decisions are gonna be fight or flight. And I think what you're shining a light on is like right now, we're seeing people who have either allowed themselves to get swept into their amygdala and are acting in a survival way, which usually is the opposite of morality quite often. It reduces a human to like an animal level. Like when you see dogs rip food away from each other, growl or fight, that's what's happening. And I think it's happening in every level of the American life right now. It's happening in the boardrooms. It's happening in the living rooms. It's happening in the hearts. And yeah, man, it all comes down to a simple decision, which is like, you can die unafraid or you can die having fear but not reacting to it and in your dying, try to help the people around you. That's like the ultimate cool decision to make because you're gonna die anyway. Right. What, yeah, I know, I guess I said it again, but like, yeah, what moment in your life were like, I'm glad I was scared. I'm really glad I was freaking out. But right now it's hard to. It's hard not to. It's hard, it's, there's so many unknowns. We just have to hold on to what we know. And yeah, I just, yeah, you realize what's important and what isn't, you know? Yeah, and you know, it can all just get boiled down to me. It's like, it's really beautiful. It all gets boiled down to helping like pretty much. That's it. It's like, how can I hope? You know, that's it. You're, you're, that's it. And then that's a simple thing, easy to forget though. Cause then whenever you start trying to help yourself, you're going to get bored and like confused. But anytime, you know, you just try to, you try to help people around you if you can. Somehow. I'm going to miss you. You know, here's this funny thing about life. And I guess getting older and our weird business is like, we probably see each other. What do you think? Maybe four times a year? If that. That's crazy. I mean, you're one of my closest friends. Same. And how was that? I mean, that's even before COVID. I mean, there was a time we saw each other more, but maybe, maybe when we, whatever, I'm just saying like, I'm going to miss you. But I'm like, I'm going to come down and see you. Yeah. And I, that's for sure. I mean, that's like, you know, I have a, yes. And we will see each, I mean, we'll see each other in the flesh. Here's the funny thing. This is another part of my decision to leave. I just realized like, it's not like I'm going to be hanging out in person with that many people for about, for a while. You know what I mean? It was that sense. But that thing that you're talking about there, it reminds me of what happens when someone dies. Because when someone dies, their body's not there anymore. But you have this bizarre sense of them still being there. And the cynic will say, well, that's just, you know, your nervous system, your brain is wired in a universe where they exist. But anyone who's had a true loss knows like, no, that actually isn't quite right. They're still here. Yeah. They're just, they're not, they're not talking. And friends like us, we always feel like we're hanging out. Like if, with your dear friends, if you look in your heart, it's weird because you're with them. Like this is quantum entanglement, man. Like they talk about, you take two particles and put them together, you could still transmit data from one to the other. Somehow they stay connected forever. Right? And so, and to me, man, the stigma against, right now we have got to shift into a world where we're decentralized, right? And like centralization in a city around an industry that is no longer even happening in that city. Centralization around any, it's superstition, man. Like centralization is superstition. Meetings are superstition. Like this idea that we all have to gather together in offices and dab these fucking fart meetings. You find that superstitious? 100% superstitious. You've got to make a plan. When are you gonna say like a head coach talking to like his football team as superstitious? No, there are some industries that still require exports. What are you gonna do? Do you have a Zoom football game? No, no, no, I'm saying, what you were saying, are you, I thought you were just saying in general, when a boss has like a meeting that's superstitious. You're seeing in this time. In the, no, I'm saying, if you run a company that does mind work and you're getting bodies together like you're all are gonna dig a trench together, when you're just gonna watch each other eat donuts and drink coffee and talk. Yeah, yeah, that's great, yeah, great, yeah, great. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's pretty good. It's superstition, that's all. And the superstition is just like superstition always does, it hurts the planet because people are so fucking superstitious they're commuting two hours to get to a place that they don't need to be to do a thing that they could do using this incredible technology we have and missing their families. Their kids don't see them, their families don't see them. When the family structure starts collapsing in on itself because of this ridiculous two hour commute blowing fossil fuels into the air, then you know what I mean? Then you realize like this dark religion of gathering together in towers to do things that you could do remotely is collapsing around us. And that to me is the grand utopia. And as soon as artists and creators and everybody realizes that, though, oh yeah, we don't have to be here or there. I'm not saying that just cause I'm leaving. I'm just saying like this sooner people realize like we can still make good stuff and be scattered across the planet. It will be the beginning of artistic renaissance because artists generally are poor as fuck. You know, these poor comics or creators coming to LA, the city of dreams to do what? To do shit that they could easily do remotely. This is over and this is initially gonna suck but then it's gonna lead to something so wildly beautiful if you ask me. I think, I agree with you. I remember when I first moved here, I was like, I don't, everything that I'm writing or thinking of takes place in Baltimore. And I'm like, well, I guess I would have to make it look like Baltimore here, like, cause this is the only place to do things. And there's so many different types of people that have evolved that, Tyler Perry, but also, you know, Danny McBride, you know, in North Carolina, making that a new place like that. I think, and just adding to your point is that that was already happening, but due to this, there's so many things that people are realizing. Hey, I could live not that much further away or I could live in a really, really nice place for kids. They wouldn't have to go to private school or public, and just, you don't have to be in a line. I'm just repeating, I agree with what you're saying is all I should have said. No, man. I'm asking as I'm saying, I'm like, why do I still live here? That's an important question to ask cause a lot of times people are living here just cause they live here. And, you know, I think it's the job of the artist to be, you know, I think the idea, as much as you can is to realistically begin to push the boundaries. And, you know, I think that like LLA, when we first started doing, when we were here initially, right? We had to be here. There was no way we could have gotten where we're at if you'd stayed in Baltimore, if I'd stayed in North Carolina, there's no way we could have got, we had to be, if not for the Martini Cafe, where we'd be. Remember, but we needed that. Melrose and Largemont, 2000. Yeah, we needed that, man. And we needed all the connections that we made and all the people that we met out and all the like inspiration we got from being around people. And what the other thing that this ties into is yes, there are things we can do remotely, but we need to be around people. As human hearts, like people need to be, you know, I'm alone. And then when I like, I don't, I've seen like five people through all this, but when I see someone, I'm like a fucking dog going, someone's coming inside. Oh my God, yeah, oh my God, it's so good to see. What have you been doing? Oh my God. Well, you have ears, I have ears too. Wow, your nose is like mine. Oh wow. Yeah, dude. So there, I agree with you creatively, we'll be fine. But I do think as human beings and human happiness, there is a thing that is, I find the hardest part of all this is like, not like I miss touching people, but I miss, you know, not thinking about how far I am from someone. Well, I mean, yes. But still having, you know, I give people, I have always been giving people social diss, but now even more, you know? I want to thank BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

Come on, are you really gonna pretend you're feeling great right now when it's like there's a swarm of bees in your head? Well, that's me, I gotta try them out. But, and you know what I mean about touching people, I don't want that to be misunderstood. Oh, I know what you mean, trust me. And everyone knows what you mean. You little love that human touch. Ah, you wanna lick a butthole. No, man, we want to be, look, you're right. I'm just talking about any time, you know, I'm talking about LA aside. I'm talking about idolatry, man. This is why in the Bible, you know, if you really wanna piss God off, one of the great ways to do it is start worshiping a false idol. Nothing infuriates the Old Testament God more than looking at His, or His, in this case, beautiful creation, like bowing down to a fucking golden bull, right? Who's doing that? Give me who the golden bull is though. Well, the golden bull represents the, I mean, so like, in, there's- Like Hollywood. Well, I'm trying to, like, let's take it a look, let's go meta. The golden bull, like there's a type of anarchism called anarcho-primitivism, and it's the idea that the moment we started semantically representing reality, you know, like that's a beautiful mountain. Look at this beautiful field. Then we reduced reality to the language itself, so a human being will come to you and go, I don't feel, I feel happy, I feel sad, but really the way they feel is probably, like, indescribable, so in these broad sort of grunts, we end up losing all the nuance of human identity. So this is exactly what happens whenever artists get confused, like how many completely disgruntled, depressed, brilliant, genius, creative types of you run into who are deeply frustrated because they have decided that the only methodology for them to produce good art is to go through this incredibly difficult series of obstacles to get a corporation to fund their idea and put it on their particular network, right? And you meet a person who in that terrible war has become so depressed and so hard on themselves and so down on themselves when they are literally sitting in front of what in the 70s would be like the most powerful TV studio on earth with the ability to instantly publish. So what I would say the golden bull is, it's not LA, LA is great because of the people here. It's not the entertainment industry, the entertainment industry is great because it's filled with a community of creative people. The idolatry is the localization of that in a place that is very expensive to live, that is charging insane amounts of income tax and which is for whatever reason, seemingly disintegrating because the reason people came here originally was because it was like you could get a lot of sun and it was beautiful. People came here because it was beautiful. You would smell flowers in the air. Remember that? It would rain. Yeah, it would rain. You know, remember there was no fire season. Do you remember that? The Martini Lounge, we weren't walking outside looking up at the yellow sun covered in smoke, were we? No, it was beautiful and you were living here like damn, I get why this place is expensive because it's flowers in the fucking air. It's beautiful and it's a thriving community. Look at it now. It's not that and not just because of COVID, man. And so for me, that's the golden bull. That's the golden bull is worshiping a thing that's dead when it's just, it's moved on. It's not there. People are in Detroit. People are in fucking Montana. People are in, where's Danny McBride? North Carolina. North Carolina. People are like scattered all around the country and they're still making brilliant shit. So the golden bull would be the thing that's keeping you locked into a place out of sentiment. But isn't there something so rewarding when you realize this thing that you thought was the toll master or the gatekeeper, isn't the gatekeeper, you know, that there's a huge amount of joy. I had this really, really amazing experience. When I first moved here, I was up for a TV show and I got to like the final level of testing and in the room they like said that they weren't gonna pick me. And I was probably really upset. I don't remember, cause I'd try to block it out. But what I do remember is Henry Winkler was auditioning to be my dad. And he said, what happened? I'm nice. They told me I was too green. I don't even know what that means. I remember knowing like, I don't know what green is. And he goes, you know that this has nothing to do with you, right? And I was like, yeah, he goes, no, look at me. Tell me that you know that what they said in there has nothing to do with you. You know that, right? It was just like, in that same thing of like, you put all this pressure on yourself as a human of just like, am I good? God damn, do you remember this thing? I don't know why this fucking just came ahead. Hot or not. It was like my space stays like hot or not. And people would put their picture up, hot or not. It's just, I think where we're stirring the bull here is what is, we all wanna be reassured that we're okay. And that's another hard part is there's a lot of people, myself included from time to time, when you feel inadequate. It's like, what is my purpose? What I'm doing here? It's like, we just need to be looking in the right places for what's gonna give us that. And the unfortunate reality and fortunate is it just, is you. It's you, that's it. And that sounds cheesy, but it's real, it's real. And why people go, man, that person's so, I'll say, I'll preach about this till I die. You look at someone, you go, what is it about them? There's something about them I just like. And it is confidence. And confidence comes from being secure with who you are. And I will say, getting the shit beat out of you out here helped me figure out who I was. I don't, I'm not saying that's how you figure out who you are, but I do think, I didn't start getting good until I had confidence. Or I don't wanna say good, I wanna say like, finding success was being like, it's okay. And if this fails, I don't care because I'm, I believe in it. You know, and I think that's the bottom line. I don't care where you are doing this, like whatever you believe in. Oh shit, I failed at something I really believed in. Then you didn't fail, you know what I mean? Like it's just being secure with yourself and not looking to a fortune cookie to tell you if it was right or the wrong decision, you know? Yes, man. I mean, that is like, that's definitely the goal. It's like Mitzi summed it up. She would always say this about comics. She would go, remember, Heine, they need you. And that was her whole ethic. That was her whole thing is like, don't, artists, if you're not careful, you, and I am not, I am definitely not saying that like, I'm not necessarily talking about the exec that put fucking drunk history on the chopping block because I don't think anybody's like, wanting to send that guy roses right now. But the, like, I'm not trying to demonize people who are like part of the system that makes beautiful shit in the world. They're just not the creators. Cause I think that's a very naive and stupid and like generally people who feel like that about the whole industry or whatever, it's, they're not working hard enough, generally. Generally, that's what it is. It's like, you know, they, and they haven't like, they don't want to- Well, they blame it. It's the blamers. It's like what, this is a funny thing I was saying about the other. It's like, people are blaming COVID on things. Like, dude, you've gained like 300 pounds. It's COVID. What do you expect? Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Yeah. They put the blame on somebody like. Yeah. Cause it feels better than autonomy and it's easy to feel, and you know, so, but it's really like sitting down and writing, which is something you, you, which I love about you is you're always working on something, man, but sitting down and writing sucks. It's hard. It feels weird. It doesn't feel, it's like trying to like, like, you know, do cursive with your left hand. It's just like, what the fuck am I doing? You're going to hit moments like obliterated. You're going to hit moments where you're just like, I, I guess I'm the ultimate hypocrite and fraud that ever walked the face of this dark earth that I would ever think I even could do any of this shit. What's wrong with me? And so if that's hard as it is, but if you, so you don't want to experience that cause it's painful. So if you start waiting for someone to give you permission to create, and especially if the thing you're waiting to give you permission is a massive machine, a network of people who are always dropping in and out of different positions and jobs. And you're waiting for that to perfectly align and for you to get a phone call from your agent saying like, they're going to do it. And now you can start writing. You're going to find yourself exactly in the same fucking place. Except now you've got a whole network of people being like, where's the fucking thing you were going to do? So yeah, to me it's all about pushing that fucking golden cow over, forget it, man. You don't need a priest. You don't need a shaman. You don't need a wizard to come down and tell you to start making shit. Make it now. I don't care where the fuck you are. I don't care if you're in a cave in the fucking Ukraine. If you got internet, I guess you have internet because you're listening to this, what are you waiting for? Like start making the thing. And then that, to me, is what pushes things to where they need to be. We just have to keep making stuff, man. I agree. And it's hard right now because it's not like, oh, if we make something right now, like, hey, let's go do this. We do have to go, this is ready. This is just on the shelf. We can't shoot it right now, but when we're allowed to. And I think that's the hardest part of this, where there's no deadline, where the thing I'm right, I'm like, oh, I just can't wait to shoot this. But then you're like, OK, it's just on the shelf. I'm going to fuck with it a little more because I can't do the thing that its next process should be. So it's, as I said, no one, this isn't how, no one is enjoying this. Amazon, that's about it. But no one thinks this is great. Like no one does. So don't think like we're not in, I'm not going to say we're in this together because we've gotten that from day one. But nobody enjoys this. No one. No. No one enjoys it. No one expected it. And it's like, you know, the, whoa, but what a cool, like, it's a once in a century event. So it's like, you know, you're, I don't want to say we're lucky that we get to be here, but it is a magical time. And, you know, like, who, you know, when have you ever heard, like with comedy, especially, if you want to be a really funny person, get comfortable, get really, really comfortable, have everything you need, have no wants for anything at all, and you will be the funniest motherfucker that ever lived. Never. It's like, you know what I mean? The adversity, the struggle, the, you know, weirdness, the thing, it's like suddenly the gift from the universe disguises pandemic is like, look, I'm ripping the fucking rug right out from under you, motherfuckers. And now you're going to be falling through space. You don't know where you're going to land. You don't know what's going to happen. Now what are you going to do? And it's like, this is the, to me, this is like, oh, OK, this is, this is where we start, you know, we really just use it as a fuel and start making stuff. And, and, and, you know, I don't know why I'm doing some kind of missionary stuff or, you know, if you're either going to make shit or you're not, but just right now isn't the time to wait for someone to give you permission. No, but I do think this is creative hibernation. You know, this is kind of a pause that hopefully will never have this much time off again, where you can kind of go, what have I been doing that's good? What have I been doing that's not good? And how can I do it better? You know, so no one now, I was thinking the other day, it's like, no one. There's phrases people can't say anymore. Like what? I haven't gotten around to it. I'm too busy, man. The fuck doing what? You know, I always had this thing and I just remembered it because I'm looking at my PlayStation that I bought Red Dead Redemption to and I said, I'm not opening this unless I get like the stomach flu or I'm sick because I'll get stuck here. But I still haven't opened it. There's a certain thing here and maybe that's like optimism that I don't want to do it because like once I get sucked into a game, I like I stay there for a very long time and like when you're sick, you can't go outside, but I'm not sick. Um, I guess what I'm trying to say is this is a dark time, but we're all like trying to act like it's not happening when it is. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's that's the worst fucking. This is that's the thing. And I look, here's a hacky thing to say, man, but God damn it. When you're scrolling through fucking Instagram and in the middle of a fucking pandemic, somebody's popping these beautiful pictures of their vacation, wherever the fuck they went, right? Oh, it's beautiful. Oh, look at the palm trees. No masks. Oh, look, are you having a fucking margarita? Wow. I guess I guess it ended. Huh? I guess it ended. I just didn't see the fucking news. So to me, what when you're seeing that sort of like, uh, not that you should like you should be feeling yourself trembling and horror the pandemic, which some people are doing, which is to me, the opposite. But like it's to me, there does seem to be a little bit of deception happening. You know, I just keep thinking like an influencer goes to the beach. Start in LA. Influencer goes to beach in LA. Influencer takes pictures standing in front of the beautiful ocean. Influencer looks, you know, in the picture like, wow, man, you look at that person, you're sitting in your fucking house. It's like one o'clock. You're like, you stink, you stink. You're trying to remember if you brush your teeth. You're looking at your phone. You see this person beaming at the beach, right? But it's like, man, I want to see everything in between. Like how we got that, how he or she got there. Yeah, like all this stuff. Like what were you talking about? What was going on? Because if you I just think if people are and I by the way, I think I'm allowed to critique this because I've done it. Like, you know, with with with my wife, you know, I like she'll be like, oh, yeah, you guys are posting and you're like, yeah, sorry. Yeah, is that what you mean? On the other end, when you guys were at Joshua Tree. What? Yeah, exactly, dude. That's what I'm saying. It's like we're seeing this fucking picture of us and like, I don't know, Big Bear, some shit, you know, looking like we're like fucking. Hey, well, it's the best. You don't see the moment driving there when we're like, you know, what is this? What is this? What are we doing where Aaron's like, I got I got a pee. Well, we can't go to the bathroom. You can't go to the bathroom in a fucking gas station. You don't know what you took a shit in there. They're going to be COVID shit in there. So we're you know what I mean? Like you don't see that. And so I and also personally with her, sometimes she'll be like, I don't feel good today. I feel scared and I'll be like, oh, everything's fine. But inside, I'm like, oh, fuck, I know me too, man. I think we're about to I think we're a few days away from here and Trumpets in the sky. Yeah, I mean, doesn't help anybody. That's all. But it also doesn't help people to act like you're upset when you're not. You know, it's just I think, you know, that's the trick is good to like make sure people recognize that you're also going crazy. Yeah, but it's like when someone dies, you go to them or you not them, but their friend who lost, I'm sorry for your loss. They're in a better place that we are instinct is to make you feel better. What relationship with you if you Aaron said, sorry, sorry, Farts wife, Farts mom, Farts wife, he's not even two yet. Yeah, but when he gets older, they're getting married. Wait, what was I saying? Shoot, no, well, well, relationship would be good. And that if she said, I'm scared and you're like me too, like. And it's it's balance, right? It's balance. And you're just but explain to me the Instagram thing so that the guy or girls like the influencer, just all the crap that they're just acting like everything is all right. Yeah. That's what I'm saying is like it to me, the really like it's someone in post apocalypse in the in post apocalyptic films in general, Mad Max being the classic. We we don't really have the internet right in Don of the dead classic zombie thrillers walking dead. There were phones and stuff that I don't remember them like really like connecting to like the internet. I think they're made. There may be a little bit of that, but in general, in post apocalyptic films or in apocalyptic films, we don't have this amazing technology that can be used to simulate reality. So what what's like it's hilarious to see a person projecting a reality into the world during a once in a century pandemic. And the more that that reality they're projecting into the world seems like what happened before the pandemic, the crazier they fucking seen. Oh, yeah, because they're the delusion. It's a perfect example of someone who's delusional, self-centered. And and again, we're seeing like a real human experiment happening of like true colors, like everyone's taking their fur off and showing their skin. They're just like, oh, that's who you are. Like I I've been feeling like it's like, you know, you had that friend that you really felt comfortable with. But then you went on a trip and they acted so fucking different. You're like, yeah, oh, that's how you respond outside of this. Like, well, then you're too faced and you're not real. You know what I mean? Like if someone's acting completely different in this period, then they're a sociopath and there's a lot of those. Look, I this is what I disagree with that point, man, because I think that like we're seeing people's shadows that doesn't mean you're a sociopath. You know, like if you're like, if you're encountering a person in general, who's being a dick and I have had moments where spectacular, you know, dickishness where you're really a mate, you're just like stunned. And I've been an asshole back in those situations. I regret it because I keep forgetting like this is an amygdala situation. This is fight or flight. You're encountering people who are really experiencing the wrath of of impermanence right now. And they and you know, that doesn't mean that there you should like not call them out on it or confront them. Or, you know, it doesn't mean you should be compassionate by not acknowledging it because that doesn't help them at all. But it's, you know, I just think we whenever I'm annoyed with someone, I have to stop for a second and remember. Oh, yeah, they're alone. They're in there alone. They're never know what people are going through. Yeah. And they're losing their shit. And like, yeah, but so I don't want to imagine that if I see somebody being a complete fuckhead right now, that's the totality of their being. I just think it's no person under stress. You know, you know, but we do have to watch out. You know, it's like, again, this is the thing like everyone's got that. You got a shadow. I got a shadow. We might have to go on a long trip before you see mine, Derek, but at some point. You've seen it. You've got to be hammered. I've seen it many times. You've seen it more than most people have. What do you think? How would have this gone in 1975? It would have, it would have gone, it would have been much better in the 70s. It would have been horrible. People would have died, but in the 70s, you wouldn't have the fear amplification mechanism of social media. Uh, you know, the pro it's like, so in 75, here's how it goes. Uh, pandemic, people start getting sick. Um, you know, public on the news and stuff. That's what they're going to say. Wear a mask. The president's going to come out and be like, you should wear the best thing to do is wash your hands and wear a mask. People are going to look at that and be like, all right, let's just wear a mask. They're going to wear a mask. And then in a couple months, we would look more like some of the other countries on the planet right now, and it would be dying down. It would still be there, but to be dying down, maybe pop up in cold and flu season. But now what's happening is, uh, because of this magical technology we have, man, it's like, you know, it used to like, okay, so in the 70s, you would be walking your dog wearing your mask during the 70s pandemic, right? And you'd go by a park and there'd be a person with a megaphone who would be yelling, they want you to wear the mask because it represents submission. And you'd look over and be like, what a dumb shit. And you just keep walking your dog. You wouldn't even pay them any mind. Now, instead of the megaphone, you got someone being like filming, using this incredible technology that costs nothing now, using stock footage, something like a documentary called like the truth of the pandemic. And, you know, they've got a charismatic voice. It's not a megaphone. They're just using stock footage. They pay 400 bucks. It's just like stock footage that they've assembled with a voice under it, you know, saying, this is who they think you are. A sheep, but you're not a sheep. And then what happens is you got someone in their apartment who hasn't seen people for about two weeks, except for the delivery driver, bringing them groceries. They can't get their meds because the mail service is fucked up because the president's dismantling it. And so they're starting to go into a nice manic episode. And then they had some algorithm serves up the truth of the pandemic and they watch it and they're like, oh, I knew it was a lie. I knew it was a fucking lie. And then boom, now you've got psychic contagion on top of a normal contagion. And it's produced this thing that we're in in the United States. That's what happened. What do you think it'd be like? No, I just, I was excited to hear what you would say. Yeah, I think you would, I think about that dog walker. And then I also think about, oh, I'm almost late for the six o'clock news is coming on, or it's like you heard the news, you know, at a certain time from one source, and that's what everyone was kind of going through. And now there's just 800 million people that aren't even news telling you news. And just, it's just, I don't know. It's, uh, I think the Amish really had it, right? You know, no technology. Yeah. Well, I mean, look, you can't deny it. They're, well, they're, they're, they're awesome. Like the outfits, they wear a fucking cool and their barns look awesome. Really, you know, the, the, yeah, I think like what happened is we just, you know, we, they used to put cocaine and Coca-Cola. That was normal. He would go to the drugstore and be like, you get a tincture filled with opium, fucking slurp it down. It was the best. A lot of them. Those were the old days. You know that, man. That's what it's like. And there's something really beautiful about that. Oh, wait, sorry, sorry. I just got a visual of Bert Reynolds, like with a mask doing like a beer commercial. Do you know what I mean? Like when you're six feet away, have a sip, you know, like, and like it would have been cool, not COVID wouldn't be cool, but the way it was presented with a cool mass, like pull it down, have a sip, like we would have just done. I don't know. Look, I mean, this is, you want to place, you want to point your finger at something. What you point your finger, do is all the elements in society that are creating division and anything that's actively trying to keep people divided is the reason this disease is working is because the disease depends on people having, you know, not just a difference of opinion, but a sort of aggressive difference of opinion. And, and all, and like, so yeah, this is the reason it's fucking everything up because we got, we're supposed to be the United States of America. That was the idea. Like United, it was like, you're, you know, I think, I think you're a fucking dipshit and I don't like your politics, but I like you. I was, and I like listening to you talk about your crazy fucking politics, but I don't believe it. And you know, I don't believe it. And you think I'm a fucking liberal piece of shit, dumb, dumb, but we're still friends. We hang out together. You know, that's the dream. That's the American dream is like, look, yeah, you believe in this stupid thing. I believe in this stupid thing, but we're still, we're still Americans. That's the dream. I don't even know if we don't know if it happened, but if we've been achieved it yet, it's the aspiration. And in that situation, it's like, I will help you and you will help me and I like you, you know, I disagree with you and you like me, even though you disagree with me, but I'll bring you a pie and I'll like, you know what? I've been like, my kids can play with your kids. And, and, but, and the idea was that was, that's the dream. But now look what's happening, man. It's like you've got not just people from inside the country, but people from outside the country trying to confuse the elderly, trying to confuse people who have mental illnesses, trying to confuse children. And it's created this incredible fragmentation of our, of society. You know, so yeah, man, we just have to get back to what. We have to get to, rather, because I don't know if it ever happened. It might have, you know what I mean? But we have to get to a place where we're all together. And it's the nightmare of a lot of people out there because people make money from us being sort of divided amongst ourselves. Isn't it crazy like when you think about it, that we all want to be together, but there are certain people that don't want to be around others or other types of people like they're rich, you know, I want to be with only my people. Like it's just, it's just disgusting that, you know, I, I believe we are united, but we're not doing a good job of showing it. And yeah, maybe it hasn't happened, but it, yeah, it's, it's really hard. It's really sad. It's really sad because we do all need each other and we can help each other. You know, to me, that's why drunk history is special. Aside from the fact that it's a hilarious concept. If that was just the concept, the show wouldn't have lasted. No one would have cared to watch it and no one would get a fuck about it because it would just seem like some frat boy drunk bullshit. Right. Yeah. To me, the reason that it lasted for so long and should have gone on for much longer is you have this heart and that, that, that seeps in that, that seeps into drunk history and you were like using this amazing device to shine a light on really crazily catastrophic, difficult moments in American history. Your show way before woke was happening was like illuminating like shit that people didn't even know happened racial stuff that people didn't know. Fucking crazy shit that the government was doing stuff for gay rights, trans rights. Your show is doing this before it became like a thing where everyone realized you should be doing this. And to me, that was what was like that. That was the, that's what made your show. So in my cheesy 46 year old dad had made your show. So particularly American is that it was embracing the entirety of our history, illuminating it in a way that was biased because it's a drunk person. But yet within that drunkenness, real editorialization, a real commentary was coming out of people's mouths who deeply connected with some of the stories they were telling because, you know, they, you know, they, they have had direct experience with racism in a way that like a white dude doesn't. Right. And like, you know what I mean? And so that was what was coming out of your show all the time, man. Was that like that beauty? It was beauty. And it was powerful and it was tricky because some people just sat down like, let's watch these dub shit, get drugged and talk about history. And then they're like, what the fuck happened to you? Stonewall riot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That in all serious, that's the stuff that, you know, it chokes me up because that's what we were doing something that wasn't like a typical comedy show. And I don't mean that in Pat ourselves in the back, but just like using, using the format in a, in different ways where there were still silly stories. But then I knew we could do the silly stories so you could slide in the really important ones, you know, as well. So there was a balance. Like it, and I think, I don't know. I become a real nerd for all this, how to get someone's attention. And I really feel like so many things in life, whenever you're, you know, don't do drugs, okay, I'm going to go do them. When you're told a certain thing, you go the other way. And to me, history, you're always looking up, but like there's something humanizing. And I'm not saying that alcohol humanizes people. There's something humanizing the stories where someone is just telling you something that they love. They're not going, this is why you should know this. You're going to listen to someone that's just telling you something that they love. And that the stories like the, and then like the section 504 sit in the disabled act that we did, like those were the things that I'm just like, man, we were doing something that everyone should be doing. And I just, we had a couple more in there that I was like dying to like, oh man, people have never known this guy, the first gay black baseball player, the black guy I played for the Dodgers in Glenberg. Oh yeah. And he also just so happened to invent the fucking high five. Well, not be a great story and all that's the shit that he had to deal with with homophobia and like in the MLB and like, I don't know. I just sorry, it's hard to like talk about it because that's the stuff that makes me emotional because like we I'm if the show was like failing and it wasn't like being funny or telling important stories, it would, this part would be a lot easier. But the fact like we were doing the thing that everyone's saying you should do. But right, like I'm just repeating what you said, but we were doing that. And then we get cut off. Like it's just like, I don't know. Do you what are you trying to say? Is there something I'll say it. What are you, what is, do you think you, you could figure out a way to repackage it or, you know, do, do what's the deal there? Can you not talk about that? Taking it somewhere else. I don't know, I'm trying, I'm trying to finish it somewhere. I'm going to try to finish it somewhere. Um, you don't want to, you want to, you want to just like do it one more season and then that's it. I want to finish where we started. Yeah. And I do think there's more stories to be told. And I don't, um, I also know the energy when a show ends and then comes back. I don't want this show to be the cover band, you know what I mean? Like, so it would be great to come back every once in a while and go like, oh man, let's just do a quick, like five or six stories and put out like a two hour special, you know, something cool like that and do that every once in a while. But, um, yeah, it's hard, but I'm also very excited to do new stuff because, uh, yeah. Yeah. Cause isn't that kind of the, like that's the double edged sword of, you know, having a successful show, right? It's like in the midst of it, you're like, you really don't have any time. I mean, you don't, I remember when you were shooting it, like that's part of the reason we would, it was tough to hang out, man, you're always working. Like anytime I talk to you, you were in between meetings. You were working hard because you're making this show. This is not easy to make. And, you know, it required like not just a script, it required like you physically being with someone and drinking with them. Like there were so many elements of it that were not exactly what you call healthy. Right. You, cause you're like at me, it's like, oh, look, I got a two day hangover. I'll be all right. But you, you know, you were having to like, there was a lot to it, as I'm saying. And so I won't miss that. Yeah. Yeah. And not to me, I mean, there is there a sort of, I don't want to call it dark, but there's a part of me that's like, well, this is, there is a good thing about this in the sense that now you're unleashed into the world to take everything you've learned from making a successful show. What, every think of all the shit you know now, man, and, and, and put that all your energy into like, into something completely new, completely different. I think the world deserves that. You know, I think there's something beautiful in whatever it is you're going to do next. And that, don't you kind of have that feeling? Are you starting to realize like, you could do anything you want now. Like you could, everyone's going to want to work with you. You're going to have any body, any, any celebrity you want and something you write, you're going to be able to get because everyone trusts you. Why isn't that, that must feel pretty good. Uh, yeah. That's the part that, you know, yeah, it chokes me up because this is what I've always, I'm sorry. No, I just always, I've always wanted to do this. So like, but I never thought it, I never thought it would happen like this. And, uh, you know, I say these give stress as people, you know, came to me and, you know, yeah, I feel like this is, this is my school now. Now I'm ready to go. But yeah, sorry. It just, it hits me because, um, it's when I talked about confidence, I still struggle with what you just said. Like, don't you realize like people want to work with you? We still do that dumb shit in our head where we're like, yeah, but I don't know if they're going to like this idea. You know, it's like, stop it. So thank you for saying that. It's hard. Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm so excited to go out and do this new show. And, um, and I also like, I don't want anyone to feel like, um, I left them behind and, um, yeah, so, but yeah, I'm very excited for the new thing. And, uh, it, it is a weird thing of like, oh my gosh. Now this is why also I worked so hard on drunk history because I thought if I, if this doesn't work, I might have to go back. You know what I mean? And I humbly say that I think where it got to a, I got to direct more people that I ever knew produce a show, run a show. And now if now this is over, I, I'm not over, you know, and, and, and when this started, I, I, I didn't have that. I didn't have that confidence or, you know, credit. So I'm so fucking excited to do something new that if it fails, I won't. And I don't take that for granted. You know, look, man, this is like, think of all the different incarnations of Monty Python, right? Like they had their sketch show, then they, they did all these incredible movies that were many of them very different from each other. I think like, you know, Woody Allen or think about like, um, you know, the upright citizens brigade or like any great, like any collective, uh, it's really interesting to watch the way it really did. You realize like, Oh, the form that, that they were utilizing in some like thing that they did for a little bit, it didn't matter. It wasn't the form. It's like, it was the, it was the, it was the, the community and the mind behind it, because think of that, the community of drunk history, man. Like think of like, like the next thing you make, what'll be cool about it and what's going to be so liberating for you, it must be a little terrifying. I understand the fear is that people are going to look at it and they're going to be like, Oh yeah, it's Derek Waters. It's a Derek Waters made this. It's like, think of like, uh, the DuPlace brothers, you know, you watch their, you know, their movies, the stuff they put out and it's like some of them are very different, but within it, you're like, Oh yeah, there's that thing that I love about the stuff they make, you know, and, and then you liberate yourself from the golden ball, you know, of the prior form. It's the, it's the idea of like, Oh, I have to, the form is what people liked. It's not the form. It's you. It's your heart that was, yeah. When you are you, it's like, Oh, how did you come up with this? Whatever the thing is, like when you see someone, you're like, Oh, that thing that led to this was always in there. You can see it in there and that's what anything good is. It's like, it's, it's honest. It's like, it's not trying to be this, not trying to be that. It's just being, you know, and like, that's the goal for every human is being like, Oh, I know this person. Like, Oh, she would love this gift. He, Oh, this is something he's going to love. Like that defines the, or that, that, that shows that you are defined. And that's, that's the goal for, for us of just like, Oh, I, this is so up Duncan's alley. Duncan is going to love that. Yeah, man, that's it. You know, one time we did an interview, and you said, when I threw up your eyes, man, we've got the shot. We've got the shot. And I just want to bring it all back that when I started crying, your fucking eyes lit up like, I got him. I've got the golden tea, Keith. Look, man, I'll cut that part out if you don't want that out there. And no problem, because there's a place you picked up. And look, I like the tears to me. I like, you know, the smartest people I know, they openly cry all the time because they're not afraid to cry for some reason. So it doesn't, it's like emotion coming out. But, you know, man, this is like, but when you think about this, though, you and I, the things that you and I've got to do from the show. I mean, you can cut this out if you want. But like this poltergeist thing was so great. Dunga was telling the story about poltergeist, which we don't need to go in the whole details, but it ended with, it was, are you afraid of the drunk? Oh, fuck, sorry. There's so many things that I forgot we did. So Rich Fulcher tells a story at the beginning. Tell them you're rich. Oh, wait, no, I'm sorry. He tells a story about Dutch Schultz who was in the mob and buried like a hundred million dollars in bail bonds that still to this day have not been found. And so at the end of that, I go, you want to go outside and try to find some money and I have like a metal detector and I get a reading and it goes off and this like saying this out loud. It's like, no wonder they don't want me to do the same more. I was doing whatever I wanted. And so that's the detector comes up and I go, oh, we got something. And then I find a coffin and inside the coffin is Duncan Trestler. And it's real casual. It's like, hey, Duncan, how are you doing? Like, good man. This is like the best blood tank in the world. That was so fun and creepy, dude. Being in a coffin is scary. I didn't want to tell you how fucking creeped out. I was laying in there with a dirt landing on top of the coffin. It was so scary, dude. But like, you know, man, this is the look. This, I don't know what you're going to do next. You're going to do a lot of stuff and it's, you know, it's a nothing. And there's no, I'm not trying to make you feel better, by the way. This sucks and sucks to lose a community. It's a death. It's a real legitimate death. It's a real legitimate death. But, you know, your your metal detector is going to find another fucking coffin that you're going to open up and who knows who's going to jump out. I mean, that's the point, man, is like, you're not, you're like the moment. This is what I love about Christianity. Jesus is walking and suddenly he gets this sense that something is some energy feels something and he goes, who, who touched me, who touched me? And this woman is scared and she goes, I did, I did. And she's healed and she's like you and he says, your faith has made you whole. And the implication being, it wasn't me. It was your, you, you, you. It was liber, it's liberation. That's liberation because it's decentralization. It's saying, don't, if you get too caught up in my physical form here, then you, you're going to be lonely. You're going to be confused. But when you realize this is in you, at that moment, you know what I mean? Then you rise above the form. And I think that's, that's what's going to, that's any, any artist who, who has to say goodbye to a project that I don't know. I'm, I'm rambling here. What the fuck am I talking about? No, you take it with you. You know, some people don't like to phrase everything happens for a reason because there's really some awful things that happen. But I'm sorry. Those awful things do mold you. It's not like I'm glad those bad things happen to you, but all these things mold us and you, you carry on the things that you learned and you bring the ones that you want to be with you. And that's the dream of any artist, any community, any leader, I think is like finding your team and that the one thing to end the LA talk is like the thing that LA dad and what we all need is finding your team, finding your people. You know, and we didn't, we didn't have that. So those are the good things. It's, it's like, but once you find your team, you can go to a different stadium. That's, that's exactly right. Yeah, man, this city, I love the city so much that I like, I'm legit. I'm like, I have a lot of grief about, about leaving, but you know, we can always come back, you know, I don't, it's just, it's, it's, I like also the idea of like, you know, experimenting with moving about to see what happens. You were the new neighbor. I just feel like that's already a show. Podcast. Podcast. Well, you know, we'll see what happens. I just think, you know, the future is really, really bright, as dark as it might seem right now. And I am so thrilled to be friends with you. And I am always here for you, man.

It is ID Trussell, and you are listening to the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. Today we have a sonic alchemist with us. Mr. Bill is a genius who creates music that reminds me of what it sounds like when I'm trying to fall asleep when I've taken too much LSD. I don't know if you've experienced that before. If you haven't, just imagine the sound of a million elven ping pong balls being launched in to a black hole by a t-shirt gun made of the crucifix that Christ was crucified on, and that will give you some idea of what that sound is like. Mr. Bill comes very, very close to replicating that sound but in a more musical way, and he's been kind enough to allow me to play an unreleased track on my podcast. So here it is. Mr. Bill is a genius who creates music that reminds me of what it sounds like when I'm trying to fall asleep when I'm trying to fall asleep. Mr. Bill is a genius who creates music that reminds me of what it sounds like when I'm trying to fall asleep when I'm trying to fall asleep.

Well, here's the thing about sound design is a lot of people are like that with it. So pretty much what I would classify what you do on the modular synthesis from what I've heard just like at the end of the Freddie podcast and sometimes in the intro of your podcast is it sound design. And generally, that's kind of my process for sound design too. It's like, you almost don't want to know what you're doing. All as you want and need for it to be is engaging, right? Like you just really need it to be fun for you and you really need it to be just interesting to the point where you can like really go in on it and get lost in it because that's what's going to really yield the best results is you wanting to do it. It's kind of like like a martial art or something, right? It's like you really need to want to fucking do it for 10 years straight to be a master at it or 20 years or 30. How long it takes to get good at martial arts? Yeah. But yeah, so for sound design, I almost prefer when I don't know what's happening anyway. Like I kind of like to go in there and be like, all right, I'm going to forget everything that I learned at university about mixing and mastering and the traditional way that you should process a signal. And instead, I'm going to put 40 compresses on it and I'm going to put 40 delays and I'm going to put like 50 fucking flanges. And just like, you know, like I'll do this in the digital realm just to be like, what will happen? When will my computer die from doing this? And eventually some bullshit sound will come out the other side where you're just like, what have I done? Yeah. And I won't know why that works or how that like, you know, the amount of backtracing you'd have to do through that many processes to eventually figure out like, why that's happening. You know, if you put a really intense processing chain on like that, like a hundred devices that are all doing one thing again and again and again, like a very recursive or iterative process. And then you go to the start, like the synthesizer that's running into that chain. You just change it a tiny bit. The resulting factor on the other end is massive. And I won't understand why that fucking happens. I'll know how I got there. But yeah, I think in that sense, like sound design should be that way. I think then trying to validate your sound design into a musical context. That's when you might want to read a manual about which, you know, I don't know. I don't I don't foresee that happening. Not out of lack of ambition, but just more sort of like, I don't I don't like it's a it's a kind of anything you say about music. I'm starting to realize just sounds like hyper cheesy in this. But to me, it's like a it's a meditation that is absolutely. I mean, I think like anything that engages you that heavily is meditative, right? Yeah. Yeah. And and there's, you know, in, you know, the Ram Dass talks about the Pooja table. That's one of that's one of the ways people pray is you have this thing called you ever heard of a Pooja table? No, so all of this side of things is very much like I'm a noob. Oh, cool. Okay, cool. So a Pooja table, you could say is like a Euro rack, but for gods and gurus and teachers. What does it look like? It looks like an altar with a deity on it, candles. It's kind of like a shrine. A shrine. Okay. Images of beings that like inspire you. It doesn't have to be like mystical beings either. Just like, you know, if you could be musicians that it inspired you or people in your family that you love. And then maybe on the Pooja table, you also have a people that you're having trouble with. Like people like your enemies, you could put up there as well. Not because you're wanting to curse them, but because sitting in front of them in a meditative state, you're trying to generate compassion for them. And then there's sometimes musical elements to a Pooja table, like a bell that you ring, maybe a harmonium that you sing. Kirtan too. And what's interesting in this form of meditation is that there's a supernatural sort of interactivity that begins to happen where whether it be your own projection that you're seeing on the deity, which is a nice materialist way to reduce it to a non woo woo level and just say, here we have a particular type of movie screen upon which the parts of my psyche that are attuned to mystical symbol sets can shine. And then within that is the possibility to have like a profoundly beautiful experience just by seeing your own light being reflected in from a deity. But from another perspective, it's a telephone line to really reduce it to idiot terms that you're talking to divinity through. And there's an interactivity that happens either way. I don't give a fuck. It's a wonderful experience. And I get the same sense if I'm making music on these things sometimes where it's like, I feel like this is a two way conversation happening between me and chaos. And sometimes it doesn't seem like chaos that's talking back. And that's when it gets specifically trippy. So I understand exactly what you're talking about. And I would say that's almost something specific to modular synthesis kind of. I mean, there is a little bit of that in a DAW. I think when you like, you know, deep into the editing and deep into like synthesizing something with, you know, serum or like some some VST. But I specifically think like I was texting. Oh, wait, sorry. Pause digital audio workstation. People might not know of VST virtual instrument. Yeah. Like basically modular synth inside a computer. Yeah. So with a modular synthesizer, I often feel like because it's all voltages and because it's, you know, it is electricity that you're changing and any sound difference that you're having that that exists there is because of some change in voltage or some alteration to to a physical component that you're making there. So it is, I don't know, it feels a little bit closer and a bit more like you are having a conversation with a living instrument. Same with when you're actually playing an instrument, like when you're playing a guitar or when you're playing, there is some like form of actual physical resonance there or something. When you're in a DAW, like Ableton or Logic or GarageBand or, you know, whatever the fuck people would use for whatever they're writing with, it's, I know, it's a little bit more cold and sterile. I feel like it's not that so much of that conversation going on. That's yeah. That's how I feel too. It's so much so very different that you to me like that's when I really find myself experiencing these dark bargains with my own desire to like collect sounds, which is that, you know, you're having a pure moment with your synthesizers. And then by turning on the on Ableton because you want to like grab whatever the loop is that you've created. It's like kind of like being on a romantic date and pulling your phone out. I mean, like, can we take a picture together? You know what I mean? And it seems like the synthesizers don't respond well to that lack of attention. You know, it almost feels like they're like, fuck off, really? Do you have to put, you got to record everything? Can't we just have a night just you and me without you uploading some shit? You know what I mean? Like there's a sense of like, again, all projection. To me, you know, you could you call it whatever you want. Some people are like, do I call it God or source or if you really want to reduce it, just call it project. You're seeing your own reflection in the universe. And since you're alive, it appears to be alive in the way that you are, whatever. The point is, to me, these are mystical instruments that are relatively brand new to the planet. And I mean, think how long is it? How long has stringed instruments been here? Yeah, quite a while. As long as there's been hair and sticks, you know, and how long have like obviously percussive instruments? Even longer than stringed instruments, I think. Rocks? You don't even have fucking hair. Just a rock, just rocks and you got a hands and you got it. First the rock or hair? Well, it's the one of the ultimate questions. But these things, they're brand new, man. And they can emulate strings. They can emulate rocks. They can emulate whatever you want them to emulate. You can conform to that. But what I'm saying is, I don't think we fully understand what the fuck these things are. They've only been around since as long as electricity in some form. I mean, you could argue that like Tesla coil is a synthesizer, I guess. Well, yeah. I think, yeah, we understand what they are. I mean, it is just voltages and all you can do in a modular synthesizer is you can only do three things. Well, voltage can only do three things. It can either go up or it can go down or it can stay the same. Right. And literally all of these modules are just ways to vary the voltage in different ways. Sure. Like it'll send it out either like by quantized steps or it'll send it out like with nice enveloped curves, which you can speed up or slow down or inverse or anything like that. Or you could take the voltage, which is actual physical audio, record it and speed it up and slow it down in a sampler or something like this. You know, a bunch of stuff you can do with it. But I mean, that's from a technical aspect. I think what you're talking about is more from like the emotional standpoint of what it is, right? Well, it's like, OK, prior to the existence of LSD, right? Oh, by the way. Yes. Oh, no, fascinating. But my birthday is actually on Bicycle Day. Guess when my birthday is? Bicycle Day. The day. Well, yours is 419. Yeah. Mine is 420. Oh, sick, dude. How fucking cool is that? Dude, that's so sick. Match made in heaven. That's so cool, man. Yeah. Well, there you go. So that famous day for those of you who have missed me yapping about it probably by now in the course of this podcast, 7000 hours talking about Bicycle Day. That was, they called Bicycle Day because that's the day Albert Hoffman who discovered LSD 25 intentionally ingested LSD and he took a lot. Did he intentionally or did he accidentally get it on him and then took a bike ride? Story that I've heard is he got a little bit on his hand at one point and had like a, I think he took kind of a micro dose and had like a really interesting experience. And then he decided to dose himself and that's Bicycle Day. And he dosed himself based on other, I guess, drugs at the time. He didn't understand what functioned in the microgram. Wow. So he probably got real high. He took so much acid and I think it's, there's a record on how much he took and let's not forget. This is like, not just acid created by the discoverer of LSD, but this is like, this is the baby. This is a baby to the world. LSD had just been discovered. I mean, it's possibility it existed forever. And I guess some people say that when they talk about the psychoactive components that the Greeks were taking in the, what is it? The Eleusinian Mysteries and the, it was called, I can't remember. There's some sense that maybe, or in India, they talk about this stuff called Soma. You know, who knows, but this, whatever this incarnation of a psychedelic was, it's like a Jesus in the manger. Right. Jesus in the manger after Jesus got dipped in acid. Right. That's bicycle debt. Cause when I'm riding on my bike on acid, I can refer to a million different sources when I think I'm going crazy. Right. He didn't have that. He didn't know he was going to come down. But what he did have, and this must be fucking insane, is to have taken a thing that he, like imagine you invented acid and then you took a huge fucking dose of acid. Yeah. And then you're like, wow, I fucking invented this. Like that'll be pretty crazy. Oh my God. Well, I mean, yeah. It's almost like when you're bringing it back to music, like if I create some like really insanely highly edited piece of music that just, when I listen to it, literally makes me feel almost confused because it's like sensory overload of edits, which is what I like my music to do for me. And then I get kind of like high on something and then I listen back to it. I'll often go like, fuck, like I made that somehow. And I'll be like really impressed with like, it'll take me a lot of time and I'll sit back and I'll be kind of proud of it. Yeah. I'll have these like specific feelings that kind of extend pride. There is pride to it, but it's also these other feelings. And I can only imagine like with acid or something. It must be like that times a million. Well, right. I mean, you're like, you're the opposite of the person who invented the nuclear bomb. I mean, you, this thing that you made in your laboratory escaped into society. It is now warping society. And I would say mostly beneficial ways. Absolutely. And it's all based on your instinct because that like supposedly when they were studying it at Sandow's laboratories, because I think they thought it was doing something for like childbirth, uterine contractions. They were looking for something to help with childbirth. And like he apparently at pharmaceutical companies, when you're doing these studies of drugs that you're testing, once you're done testing a drug, you just, if it's shelfed, it can just stay shelfed infinitely. You know, and he had this weird impulse to pull it back down and like work with it. Wow. So acid was on the shelves. Yeah. And again, anybody out there who can correct my telling of the story of the birth of LSD, please, I will love your corrections because it's a foggy memory. He's got a great book called My Problem Child about LSD. But when I'm saying modular synthesizers are like LSD or like brand new to the world and we're not quite sure what they do. Yeah, we do know what they do. It's not like there's like elves in there fucking with crystal balls, farting in microphones or whatever. We know what they do. But in the same way that I don't think we've seen quite the impact that LSD has had on society because it's not done yet. We're not done. No. LSD isn't finished with us. It's still working through us. And similarly, I think this level of technology is connected to the singularity in AI. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah, I kind of do. We don't quite know where it's going. But I think we are currently seeing like a pretty huge shift in like what people like to listen to, right? So when I first started writing electronic music, which was maybe 12 to 15 years ago, like somewhere in that range, all my friends were in metal bands, which is what I was doing pre-electronic music was metal bands. Cool. And I would write like these wacky sort of like breakcore chiptune type beats and I would show them to my friends and be like, ah, like pretty cool. And they'd be like, dude, this is just like stupid Mario music. You know, but it's like that stupid Mario music is now like people's preferred shit to listen to like in the form of house and electro and dubstep and like all that kind of it's evolving a lot. So I think we are sort of seeing the power of electronic music now at least. Like it's creating a fucking giant cultural movement. Yeah. Like in the same way that I think, you know, jam bands did back in the day. It's like, you know, like I just told you, my friend Ben Gandra White Knight just sold three nights at Red Rocks. That's right. It's insane. It's insane. That's like great, grateful dead level shit. Yeah. Right. And to me, even when I've gone to like the most cheesy festivals and seen like mainstream DJs, you know, people that are just sort of like, I don't know. You gave me a new term that I've never heard before, bottle service clubs. Okay. You know, even when I, even then, I there, I've just noticed like a particular energy that when the, they've tuned the human in the right way is so specific to electronic music and so specifically alien, which is why I would, it's like, if I, we find out tippers and alien, that's going to be the least surprising thing to me. It's like, yeah, I get it. That makes sense that what's coming out of him is, is like alien. And what is an alien? An alien is something that's fresh to the earth. Yeah. Something that's like foreign to our understanding. Yeah. It's like land to deer. Right. And electronic music just landed here. That's a good point. Yeah. It's a fucking alien. It is an alien. I mean, the, like the question is where to come from and what does it want? Like, you know, that's, what does technology want with us? You know, it's an alien that flew out of our minds, collectively assembled itself has produced these nodes of existence, like altars, technological altars that look like our computers, look like our synthesizers, look like our phones, look like our watches. We engage with it in a religious way. We sit in front of it and go into a deep trance, regardless, even if you're watching golden girls on YouTube, you're tranced out. And then, and then within that situation, an evolution is happening, not just of the technology, but of the tech of us who are being affected by this bizarre symbiosis. So when I look at synthesizers, I do see a, well, a sprout of the form of some fucking crazy thing that is currently growing out of us right now. And I love, that's why I love it. So in like this sense, maybe synthesizer is similar to like maybe the very early stages of black and white TV or something like that. Yeah, man. Yeah. Exactly. Or maybe you could say they're similar to like the radio. Okay. Yeah, I can see that. Yeah. So yeah, in that sense, yeah, I can understand what you're saying. You know, we pick, we create a technology that picks up radio frequencies. And at first, the first radio, it must, what would have sounded like static. Just static from what? So here's the thing though. Like, I kind of see where you're going with this. You're saying like, it'll evolve, it'll evolve, it'll sound like way cooler and stuff like that. But without upgrading out is music can only sound so good anyway. Because like our hearing range, well, our hearing range is only limited to a band of about 20,000 Hertz. And that's if you have really fucking good hearing. If you have normal hearing like you or I probably have, it stops at about 16,000 Hertz or 17,000 Hertz. Lower if you have hearing damage, a little higher if you're a baby. And then the lower end of the spectrum we can hear down to is like maybe 20 Hertz and you really don't even hear that at that point. You just feel it. So that's our range that we're limited to out of that range. We like to split it up into these very particular sets of notes like a chromatic scale. Yeah. And then out of that scale, the that, you know, once we break them down in that way, we only like to use seven at a time scales. Yeah. We use seven notes that we use as a scale. Unless you're like, you know, you generally won't use all of them. You probably use like five of those and then, you know, you only like to set those up in certain rhythms and stuff. It's all pretty limited to what we like and time signatures as well. We only like, you know, four, four and stuff. And apparently the one theory I've heard about that, like the reason we like four, four music and stuff is because of walking. You know, like it, it feels natural to us to get like one, two, one, two, one, two. No way. And a lot of this sort of stuff that makes me think that we are kind of hitting the wall a little bit because we're limited, not because the music's limited. I mean, fuck, we could produce a sound system that easily produces up to 100,000 Hertz, but we're not going to hear it. It's not going to matter to us. Right. So like at that point, it might matter to like a ferret or something like that. But like, yeah. Well, I mean, that's the next step. That's all I'm trying to say is eventually we are going to be able to start making music for ferrets. That's the final phase of technology. Well, I think we're, I think we're in that, that position already. We have technology to, to make stuff that very far exceeds a, our physical limitations of what we can hear slash feel and be obviously like we have DAWs that are very capable of making stuff that we find to be incomprehensibly musical, aka just cacophonies or noise. Right. Which is like I was saying, we only like very specific sets of things in music anyway. Sure. Yeah. And the grammar that our current grammar for hearing music and making music seems to be even more limited than our alphabet. I mean, yeah, exactly. Like what, what do we got? 27 letters. Is that how many are in the alphabet? 26, 27. Something like that. Yeah. Like, I think they might have added a few, but regardless, we've got like, and that, that, that becomes sort of the binary or the pixels of language. But then we also only have like so many emotions that we need to create words for anyway. And there's only so many objects in the world that we need to name. And then you can just create combinations of the words. Well, we could, that the emotional thing is hilarious because it's like, you know, we're subjective creatures. You have no idea your view with the thing you're calling anger might be my, who knows, it might be my sadness. You know, we don't fucking know. For sure. We can kind of, you know, we can tune in with each other and decide, okay, I'm angry and you kind of know what that is sort of. But that's the problem is that, yeah, the language we use for our, our nuanced emotional states is so fucking limited that we're down to what we got angry, sad, happy, hungry. Confused. I don't know if that's a emotion. Confused. That confuses me. You know, like there's like so many when like there's, for example, there's no word that I'm aware of for like that wobbly, weird in between feeling. You get right when the mushrooms start kicking it. You know what I mean? There's no word for that. Coming up. Coming up. Yeah. But it needs its own like, oh, that's a, um, Thimble Twitter. Oh, you're. But does it need that if we already know what coming up means kind of like if I say, oh, I'm coming up. I mean, that explains it enough, right? Or do you think, do you think the resolution needs to be deeper? Well, I mean, I think, yeah, I think that's kind of the funny. That's, yeah, I know what you mean. Like do we, yeah, come on. What are you? What are you going to write a new fucking language for people like to trip? That's exactly what someone who's one took over the line would want to do. What, you know what I'm saying is like some, I love what you're saying because it's an invitation for the listener, the perceiver to expand so that that which is being sort of output, we could pick up. This is where you run into like transhumanism. The neural lace, people who are programmed or like implanting shit in their hands. Like biohacking. Yeah, biohacking, which is that's kind of what you're saying is like that there is a whole new level of music that we haven't evolved to hear yet. And they're meaning there's a possibility that we could. And then if we can, we have no idea what that's going to be like. And certainly modular synthesizers and electronic music is one step in that direction. Well, what I've seen happening lately is like rather than, I mean, we are expanding musically, we're making better sound systems, producers are getting better at sound design. Everything is like, at this point, like you go to see a really high, high quality produced like bass music show or dubstep show. It's pretty fucking amazing. But partially what I think makes it amazing is this combination of the other senses that, you know, people bring in these like million dollar, like 60, 60 story high fucking LED walls and like huge lasers that look crazy than anything. And they'll combine these like insane audio experiences with these incredible visual experiences too. And like these combination of all the senses. I think we're like really trying to tap out like a sensory overload experience. That's it. Yeah, that's it. And that that's that's where this weird reflection or version of this type of yoga called back to yoga comes in, which is like at the yoga hot one. What? No, that's Bikram yoga sounds like it though, which is actually Hatha yoga. But in a hot room. But back to yoga is the yoga of devotion or the yoga of love. And so they'll that's a hard Krishna temple and or any temple that's that's a back to temple is designed to engage all the senses. So there's incense burning. There's flower petals. There's visual representations of the gods. And there's delicious food. And there's some mental. There's some kind of like philosophy behind it that you can infinitely think about. And then there's singing that's happening in bells. And the idea is that you the idea is to grab the entirety of your being and like allow it to be pulled into a God magnet basically. In that being pulled in, which I just heard on Christian radio is called convection. In that being pulled into whatever the transcendent reality is, you begin to naturally let go of the shit that is like fucking up your life. Like instead of quitting drinking, suddenly you stop wanting to drink. It's not like you're like it's a huge the renunciation is the same kind of renunciation that you know. If I went up to you, I was like, man, congratulations on quitting. What toys did you play with in your kid? I'm probably just the normal shit like trucks and stuff. Yeah, congratulations. You're not addicted to trucks anymore. Right. You kicked it. You'd be like, I don't. I just don't want to fuck with them anymore. When I was young, if you took my truck, I'd be like, fucking give me that back. Yeah, give me that back. Where's my fucking truck? What the fuck? Right. So that's the concept behind it is it's like a higher taste. It gives you a taste of something that's so similarly with elect with these shows that you go to all of your senses are being fully engaged, man. And then you're taking some form of psychoactive chemical. Quite often people are tripping balls at these things. And then within that, they're having these like experiences that are spectacularly transcendent. But the problem is you have to be, you know, deep into the shit to even have the audacity to call it a temple experience. Right. You know, I feel like a lot of these kids are there and they're making contact with God, having real divine experiences, true data transmissions and downloads that are coming from the. Some total of all the various connections that are going on in that place. And then they like feel like they're going nuts or something. It's like, well, I just wanted to have fun tonight. You know, I just want to have a good time. And I'm getting some, this reminds me of a certain thing that I wanted to ask you. Do you mind if I ask you now before you finish? Please. Okay, cool. I wanted to ask you what you think the more powerful thing is in art out of, I mean, I guess there's like many things, but like I constantly have been coming back to this thought. Over the last few months. And it's the last since I knew I was coming on this podcast. I was like, I could ask Duncan that. So there's like two kinds of artists. I find there's people who are more in like, I would say I'm more in this camp of just trying to make something like really technically apt and like something that's kind of like, you know, very engaging for me to make and very impressive to me. And like, you know, it shows that I like have a good understanding of like all this stuff. And, you know, that kind of art, which to you in the stand up comedy world might be just, you know, these way more like technical ideas that, you know, weave in and out of like these very crazy concepts and stuff like that. And then there's this other kind of art, which is like people are just making it to play on the dance floor. They're just making it to be like big and powerful. Yeah, a lot of people engage with it because it's easy to understand. But in the stand up comedy world that might be like similar to a dick joke. Right. So, so I guess my question to you is like, is it more powerful if more people interact with the art? Or is it more powerful if the art is like more maybe legit for lack of a better word? Right. Not that either is like illegitimate. Like they're both legit. And I love all shit. But like, I don't know, like I constantly think about it. I'm like, is it more power? Like are these dubstep people who are making stuff that I think is quite simple and like maybe not super impressive to me, but it seems to be fucking impressive to all these other people. But it's other people who also don't have like a hugely technically apt understanding of electronic music and the background that I have. Yeah. For like, you know, I might have the more professional opinion or something like that. But if it gets lost on most people, does that like make make it lose its power? Or does that? That's such a, you know, I think it's an unanswerable question in the sense that it's like anyone who's making anything. Thinks about that. And some, you know, some comics that I know you have had like massive mainstream success in my earlier days when I was like really insecure, but that was manifesting as a kind of like cuntiness masquerading as some kind of sophistication in my judgment of other people's comedy. Right. Kind of that. No, but I did. And it was bad. And I, but it was really what I was, I was, I was unhappy with what I was creating. And I wasn't working hard enough. And so you see someone putting something out and it's very easy to be like, oh boy, come on, really? That's the most. And it's like, stop. Right. None of your business. Right. You don't know if that, you don't know anything about that. That's making people laugh. That person's enjoying their job. And so there you go. That being said, if you lay eyes on a thing like that and out of a kind of weird greed or a sense of like, that's what you're supposed to do to be successful. You begin to go against your instincts and start making stuff based on an assessment of a thing that is getting success. Well, at that point, you know, you have crossed over into the land of factory work, I would say. You start developing like this hypothetical audience in your mind and stuff like that. That's it, man. The hypothetical audience begins to inform your artistic decisions. And when that hypothetical, it's more like instead of in the audience, it's not even made of real people. It's made of simulated bankers, I guess. You were like putting a mon of value on your art that's based on how much money it might make based on the popularity of shit, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And to me, it's like, well, if you're going to do that, just like get into screen printing or something, you know, like why even bother? It's like, it doesn't make sense to me if that's your intent. It's any making money at any art form at all is an incredibly risky endeavor. And, you know, it's like, it's almost like they shouldn't share the same space sometimes, right? Like it's almost like I've thought about this a lot of times. Like maybe I should get a job just so my art doesn't have to share the same space as business. You know what I mean? Like just to kind of compartmentalize it too. And that like, you know, you know, aim to make my art like a more pure experience or whatever. Yeah. I mean, you know, I have thought those very same thoughts. And what I've come to realize is like you can quarantine yourself mentally, you know, from that audience. And also the audience is allowed to exist because we live in a capitalist society and people need money to eat and have rent and stuff. And so there's no shame in taking a look at your intent when it comes to creation and recognizing that there is a there's a if there's a pie there and at least some slice of that intention pie. Isn't you being able to feed your baby, pay your rent and put clothes on your body and be able to go to the doctor? Then what the fuck are you? Where you photosynthetic, you need to make it a slice of your pie. Because I think a lot of artists get lost in this insane conceptualization of the process where that slice of the pie seems abhorrent to them. But really what ends up happening is they just are, you know, I just know. And all the show I'm saying is from my own personal struggles and experience. I'm not calling anybody out at all. This is me I'm talking shit about is like most of the time, if I'm doing anything that isn't making stuff and publishing this stuff. If I'm like getting lost in wondering if I'm too commercial or not commercial enough. It 100% means I'm not having the relationship with the art. Right. I'm not experiencing the convection or whatever you want to call it that sense of like that to you is like way more important than than the art being successful. I think that the more I think that is this that is the success of the art. That's I would agree. And I literally was just having this conversation with my buddy who I was writing music with the last few days. But it seems like a lot of people like I do a lot of collaborations right like I would say hundreds and hundreds of collaborations. And it seems like one of the conversations I get into a lot with a lot of artists every fucking 20 minutes. It's another conversation about like how is this going to be perceived by people basically. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, again, listen, we're social animals. Right, right. You know, you think about in the morning, most of us get up and they put on clothes and the reason we're putting on a certain amount of style clothing more probably has something to do with the fact that other people are going to look at us. It's actually funny you say that. I never think about that really. Well, I mean, I think about it more with my art than I do with my clothing. Listen, when you walk outside, there's a reason you're wearing clothes, man. You know, you don't want people to see a naked. It's a good point. Also, it's illegal. It's just deep in us. You know, we've been putting on clothes our whole lives. Right, right, right. But like, I don't know the that all of those impulses I think I think like when you're when your mind is when you are lucky enough to have gotten the call and you're either in the valley, the shadow of death, which is completely the drought lands where nothing's coming to you. And you feel like your whole life has been for nothing. And it's like agony. This is the story of fucking Moses in the desert. Like all the stories are just about to me or you could easily take any, any, any, like biblical story or any story about a hero in the wilderness and turn it. That is what it's like when you're not making stuff that you want to make. Right. Where is the father? Why have you forsaken me? Where are you? Where is my inspiration? Why is it not coming now? And why is this stuff coming out of me? Horrific. Even just to be in that level of agony is grace, if you ask me, because it means that you are so passionate about whatever it is that you're making, that it's torturing you. Right. How lucky are you? So many people aren't tortured in that way. They've never had the guts to even sit down and start making a goddamn thing at all. Anyway, all of the sum total of the various mental machinations that go into producing any kind of art are really beautiful. And I think it's important for an artist to pat themselves in the back from time to time because they're failing. Because they're fucking running 80 compressors on their goddamn thing and they spent three days on some shit. At the end of it just sounds rancid. Nothing like what they wanted. It's like you spent three fucking days because you cared about it that much. That's holy fail. That's dying on the battlefield, if you ask me. It's heroic. It's like a very Steven Press filled way of looking at it. That's right. The War of Art. A great book on this shit, man. But yeah, so, you know, I know this. One of my teachers, Ragu, calls it bean counting. It's like when you're doing bean counting, too much. You're not making stuff. Yeah, yeah. It's like taking away from the important thing, which is just being engaged in a creative activity because that's like super fucking healthy for you or something. Yes. So I'm curious, have you ever written a dick joke then? Are you fucking kidding? Can you tell me one? A dick joke? No, I'm not going to say it. No, listen, I have, there have been times where I've gone on stage. Oh God, you know, I have a wife and a kid and I just don't do that kind of stand up. Okay. I'm not going to talk about my wife and my kid and there's comics out there who do such an incredible job of talking about that. For like either complaining about it or just the hilarious reality or whatever it is. For me, it's not my ball of X. Right. But I remember like it when I, when I, I took this break from stand up and all of a sudden I was like on stage trying to do some joke wife jokes. And it wasn't because I thought people would like them. But I know I didn't, I wasn't really interested in talking about my marriage on stage. But I'm out there doing it. And like they can just, an audience is like, you don't want to be talking about this. Right. And I think the opposite is also true. If you're doing something you really want to be doing on stage, you exert zeal and people can feel that too, right? That, you just answered the question you asked me originally. Right, right, right. That is it. Like within the passion for creation will be the quality that is going to draw people to it. Right. I would say. I would say that's like the reason why someone like Joe Rogan is so big, right? It's like, you can just tell, or at least, I mean, I haven't listened to his podcast in a while, but at least when it was like blowing up like five or 10 years ago, I have a long it was. You could just tell he was like super passionate about talking to people. Yeah. And I feel like everyone was like, well, look at this guy. He's just telling, he's just talking about his life and he's fucking stoked about it. Yeah. Yeah, man. I mean, that's, you look, this is, this is why. If we begin to hierarchize jobs based on money, didn't, it's essentially like one of the more demonic things you can do to your assessment of reality. Right. Because we're talking about a tert, probably tertiary, synthetic symbol called money, which is some kind of representation of power units. So maybe the entire problem actually is not any of this. It's just capitalism. Well, I mean, I think in the same way that like our ears aren't quite ready for the type of music that like ferrets here. Similarly, it's okay to say like maybe capitalism isn't quite nuanced enough at this point in our philosophical evolution as a species to encapsulate. The sum total of human experience in a way that fairly rewards people for their efforts. Right. I mean, I think that's without like, I mean, that doesn't make me a communist, a socialist or anything. But I think if you look at capitalism as it is, and if you look at any fucking system as it is and think it can't be perfected, then you're an idiot. Right. You know, of course it could be perfected. You know, and like right now, the way we quantify things based on supply and demand, I mean, surely there's other quantification mechanisms that are equally as valid, but are not being counted right now. Right. Like, how about the guys mop and shit and vomit up in elementary school? Yeah, that kind of seems harder than making music. Yeah. To me. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, obviously, you know, some, some person who's doing that may find making music harder than mopping shit up or something. Well, I mean, there's, there's a whole, I would guess continuum of janitors out there from a mystical janitor to a miserable janitor and maybe mystical janitors are miserable and miserable janitors are mystical. Similarly, you know, teachers, you know, are not selling out Red Rocks. A teacher is not going to go home and say, well, I sold out three nights at a massive outdoor amphitheater where I'm getting a cut of the door because my brain and collaboration with somebody else produced a specific sound people like and I could reproduce it. But I don't actually think anything like I've started to like question a lot why things get big even. And I think like the actual music is a small portion of it compared to like the management, the agency you're on, the branding you have, like the kind of investment you've done on your live show where people have come again and again and had had a certain experience. Like it's a lot of correct moves that need to be made, I think beyond just the music writing. Oh, fuck. Yeah. Yeah. When he started giving me like the background data on the amount of puppeteering that goes on and any famous persons. Yeah, it's a lot. And it completely flies in the face of the movie and the fairy tale of it all, which is like somebody hears you and then the next thing you know, you're like that shitty fucking movie. God, it was so dumb about that like country singer. Did you see that movie? It was a big hit. This country singer goes to, it's got Lady Gaga on it. Okay. No, I haven't seen that. Okay. The essence of the thing is a country singer goes to a drag show meets Lady Gaga. They're sitting in the parking lot of a grocery store. She sings. Oh my God. What a beautiful voice. And you wrote those lyrics cut to she's on stage in front of one of his sold out shows cut to now she's a famous performer selling out her own shows. This should have happened in like the first 18 minutes of the movie. There's no conversation with the assistant. There's no conversation with the publicist or the business manager. None of that. It's all just like she's making music and performing and that's her beer or drinking or whatever. That's the life. And that is such abject crap. Yeah. And the proof to realize that most of your most performers that you love are like kind of like weirdly like politicians that have a whole team behind them that are like. Absolutely. The whole thing at some point, at least in the music industry, I'm not so sure about stand up industry or anything like that. But it becomes more of like a, like a marketing brand type thing. And it's just kind of like at the end of the day, it's a thing that people can identify with. And, you know, someone's going to a base nectar show or something or because they're a basehead and they want to, you know, they identify as a basehead and like they're going to hang out with their base family. And like, you know, you know, maybe they were a confused kid in the Midwest who found the base community when they were a weird kid in high school and were like, Holy fuck, like I can associate with this. Yeah. You know, like, you know, a kid is going to go to the excision show at school, they draw an X on their table and they go to the excision show and throw an X up and like, you know, so it becomes like this identity thing. Do you know Lauren? Not personally, no. I met him. I was lucky enough to have dinner with him. Awesome. And I had a lot, you know, I was nervous because I like, I like his music and I was nervous because I was afraid he was going to be an asshole. Okay, nice. No, for no reason. We've been texting for a long time. He's the sweetest person in text. But you know what I mean? What happens if someone who's making art that you love comes to you and you catch a whiff of like, oh no, oh no, no. No, but you know, but what I realized was like, oh fuck. And it's almost even more terrifying when you realize, oh my God, you're like this charismatic, magnetic, generous person who also has this massive following. And then you realize, oh, in another era, you would be called a priest. Right, right, right. But in this era, we call you a DJ. And you would, in another era, you would be having like, I guess you would be like a traveling preacher or something doing tent revivals. Yeah, yeah, yeah. In this era, you're doing base shows. Yeah. You know, and you have a family. That's your congregation. Now, if he, if I said this to him, I think he would be like, shut up. No. Because I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't want to, I would, it's a reductive, silly, archaic way to look at it. You know what I mean? Somewhere within that massive endeavor, a business model has to form. Right. And within that, you know, somebody's got to print the Bibles. Yeah, yeah. Somebody's got to put something on the front of the Bibles. Somebody's got to make the, you know, organ that the organist plays on. I actually know the guy who does all of his mastering and that guy's job also was to like make a bunch of edits for his set. So I guess he, in this sense, maybe the Bible maker. Yeah, right. All these people behind the scenes of a church, somebody's got to make those fucking communion wafers. If you're eating, taking communion wafers, there's someone cooking those things up in some factory somewhere. Someone's got to package them, print the little cross on the package. You know, every, the ink in your, whatever they call it, they pass out at church with your program. That came from some, that was a printer somewhere and some ink that had to be made in a factory and all that stuff forms to create this sacred environment that you can have a transcendent experience. But yeah, man, I think if you don't realize that, then that's your, you know, I remember, like, we want there to be, we want it to be. Magical in every way. Like, and it just, it just isn't. And I think if I, you know, with Lauren, it's like, one of the worries is like, am I, is it going to be just someone who got sucked into the updraft of this in like success and somewhere in there. Stop, like turned into a real estate agent or something. Yeah. And then you like meet this like grounded, sweet person like, well, you didn't get, you didn't get you. Well, I don't know. Here's my theory on that. I think a lot of people who get that big, they get that big because they're easy to work with and they get that big because people are able to identify and connect with them. And I feel like the asshole big rock star DJ thing has kind of gotten bred out a little bit. It's, there's so many fucking deep, just more electronic music producers than people on the planet at this point. So it's like, it's, I feel like it's, well, maybe, you know, I'm, I spent a lot of time around these kind of people because it's my, what I've based my life around. So maybe my viewpoint there is a little skewed. Maybe you might think similar about comedians, right? You're like, fuck, there's so many comedians. But I feel like for that reason, I don't know, the way I look at it is if I'm not easy to work with, or Lauren's not easy to work with fucking your management, your agency or find someone else to work with. They don't give a shit, you know, to some degree. You know what, that to me, I think that is a really beautiful. It's awesome. Positive way to look at it. Cause it's like, yeah, the mythology of like the successful dickhead is like, you know, usually at the very worst, you're going to run into someone who's probably massively sleep deprived, you know, Right, exactly. Or like, he's like gotten on a drug tear or something like that. But most of, you know, the, I think that there's a verse in the Bhagavad Gita that I love, which is you have a right to your action. You do not have a right to the fruits of your action. So it's an invitation to stay in the moment of becoming and as much as possible, leave the rest in the hands of God. And then trust that if you do experience an acceleration because of the stuff you're making, that's happening. That's a good thing. Cause a lot, I think a lot of artists are secretly terrified of the success. Like the, the, the, you know, they're, they're like hot air balloon. They're like people who want to be, go up in a hot air balloon and they build this incredibly beautiful hot air balloon. And they tether it to the ground and maybe they get a little bit of lift off. But like they, when, when, when they start like pulling the sandbags out and they get to a certain level, they fuck themselves over because they don't want to get too high. It is, I mean, kind of scary. Once you start touring a lot, like I've gotten to the point of doing, you know, 50 shows a year, 60 shows a year at points. And like last year, I think I did that many. And yeah, it does get to a point where you're like, fuck, do I really want this to go any further? Like what is the end game here? The end game is just me being at home less and maybe making some more money, but still being sleep deprived. Yeah. And you know, when you start to think about like the quality of life and stuff like that, you're like, maybe it'd be fucking better to just become an online educator or something and just stay at home and do that. Yeah. I mean, this, to me, this is kind of the work. It's really important to listen to, to just, you have to like all the great mythologies involving like people summoned by God generally involve the person being summoned by God at first being like, fuck, no, I'm not going to do that. That's too hard. That's too much work. Again, I use the word God as a term of convenience. I could call it the force of inspiration or the progenitive creative impulse and a human being or whatever. But when that thing's calling out to you and is inviting you into a uncomfortable situation, it's like definitely the right reaction. Do that. I was like, I don't know. I don't think so. I don't know about that. It feels nauseating. There's a, I just went skiing up in Jacksonville. I don't ski that much. I suck at ski, but I love ski. And one of the things they say is only look six feet ahead of you, because if you look down the mountain, you're going to end up in the, you're going to think you're going to have the parking lot. Look six feet ahead. You know, because otherwise that fucking mountain is scary as shit. That's a good point. Yeah. That's a good way to look at it too. And that's kind of, I think, yeah, a lot, how I kind of try to attack my career as well as sort of just like, all right, what am I doing today? Right. Music. All right, let's just do that. Yeah. Think about that. Yeah. And I'm like, what am I doing today? This is the podcast. Let's just think about that. Yeah. The troubles of the day are sufficient under the day. And that's, that to me is the, as long as I'm there, I'm fine. Like, man, I got this show coming out on Netflix. It's the first show I ever made. Thank you so much. It's a show or a stand up special. It's an animated series. Wow. And, uh, Curious about that. I'll show you some of it. But when, this is the first time I've ever had anything at that level that's coming into the world. Netflix, they press a button or I don't know if it's a button. I've pictured it as some kind of weird mystical button. They just, you know, at some point, someone hits enter. And this thing that you've worked on for years instantly gets transmitted to a lot of people around the entire planet except for a few countries. Right. And what, um, why not a few countries like North Korea, obviously. Yeah. North Korea, China. Okay. Makes sense. Syria. Okay. I guess. Just swine have it. Yeah. Yeah. They, they, uh, yeah, they won't have it. It's like, whatever you have, we don't want to fuck up. Right. Well, yeah. It's, you know, like some countries are, they, I think if something's transmitting to them, you have to censor your content too much where it becomes like. Just not the content anymore, basically. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. It becomes like really like, it becomes really, and it's interesting making a thing for a global thing, you know, because it's like, you're, but, uh, the feeling, if I let my mind go too far to the, every day after the thing comes out. Like maybe you've, at the inception process, when you're making, you're thinking about the release. Yeah. Yeah. If you're thinking, yeah, it's like, Well, this goes back to what we're talking about earlier about like, you know, me being in these collaborative processes a lot. And I'm sure these collaborators do this without me there too. Is like when we're making the song, thinking about already how people are going to perceive it and thinking about like, you know, all these other things. It's like they're looking too far down the mountain, aren't they? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. But it's not in that sense scary. It's just kind of like, why are you looking down there? Well, because it's results, you know, you want to like, you want to like, you want to, you want results, you want to, who doesn't want to be loved? Who wouldn't want to be embraced? Who wouldn't want the feeling of like something they made being, you know, you, you, if you, come on, secretly every single one of us wants to be carried around on the show. There's people cheering our name at least once in our lives. That'd be awesome. I've thought a few times. I'm kind of, I think like, I'm not like a strong enough artist to just make shit in a vacuum, never show it to anybody and just make it for the love of making it. But I'm also not so into the other side of that, that I need to make stuff that just people love and that I don't love at all. Like there's a balance there, right? Yeah. Somewhere in the middle is nice. Well, yeah. And I think that like, you know, the intent. Like this is one of my meditate, my medic, this David Nickton who teaches meditation. He's always talking about intention and how important intent is, you know. So when you're sitting down to meditate, if there's some intention there and like in some forms of Buddhism, the intention is wild, which is, is that you want to in some way or another help in the suffering of all sentient beings in the universe. So it's a wild intent. And that's hard to wrap your head around. You know, but just having that even that rough sketch of that intent when you're making a thing, even if it sounds so lofty. But I just interviewed this meditation teacher named Sharon Salzburg and she has written a book on social action and social change. And one of the chapters is on creativity, being a form of causing change in society. And, you know, I think a lot of really genius artists who choose to vacuum seal themselves up in a room and not share their music with people, not because they're secretly afraid, but because they just don't want to. I think that's a kind of selfishness. I think that's actually a weird form of, of like, I don't know, I don't know how healthy that is. I've always looked at that kind of stuff as like, kind of amazing. Like it might be selfish, but I've always looked at it and been like, that's like, I can't do that. I used to think that. It's kind of, yeah, it looks impressive to me. Yeah, it looks impressive until you really think about it a little bit. But to me, to me, it's like, okay, take like anyone who made any great goddamn thing that we love today. Well, it's because they put it out, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah, I think it'd been like, well, I'm just going to keep this light bulb to myself. I mean, eventually it would have been, there would have been the whole world would be lit up by, you know, electric lights. But if someone would have figured it out, but man, what a, what a shitty thing. And also, I think people have such limited concepts of what medicine is. It's like, you know, you think medicine is just stuff you eat. It's just like a pill or something. Yeah. Like, you know, the world needs your medicine and, you know, I'm a fucking hippie. So if someone's so inspired that they're making beautiful stuff, to me, that is, you've become luck fortunate enough to make contact with angelic forces that are asking you to help the world via the transmission you're getting. Right. If you're sitting and just sealing up your fucking, whatever your particular alchemical laboratory may be, turning lead into gold, just because you're excited about watching that transformation, that's fine and everything. But I think there's something to be said for, you know, passing the flame, sharing the fire, giving the vaccines out. And because Jesus Christ, man, I don't know what my life would be like if Daniel Johnston had been like, I'm just going to keep this to myself. I'm not going to hand these tapes out. I don't know what my life would be like. Right. You know, Looping back to creation and showing your creations to people and stuff like that. I often also have this thought of, if you can make something that you enjoy, plus other people enjoy, that's kind of like the perfect middle ground, right? And one feeling I get when I listen to a lot of comedians podcasts is it's kind of that, right? It's like, because you guys are like professional talkers, it seems like. Yeah. And you've figured out like this platform where you can talk and like, it's what you're best at doing. You enjoy doing it, hopefully. And fucking tons of people like it and then buy tickets to your shows. It seems fucking perfect. Yeah. I mean, it is. Yeah. It's perfect. It's so mighty, man. If I get lost thinking about making my podcast for other than this conversation that we're having right now, oh my God, I'm doomed. I mean, then what am I, what am I going to do? Like all of a sudden what's going to happen? Do I only have on celebrities or something? Or like, you know what I mean? Then, then it's, then it's a big mess. Like, you know, I, this is when I realized like, oh man, you got to like, you got to look out because there's warning signs. Like, I just had Ashley Matthews on who is this adult film actress named Riley Reid. That's her. I know Riley Reid, yeah. Yeah. She's brilliant, mystical, brilliant person. And, but as I was thinking like, oh, I should invite her on. There was a moment like, well, do you really want to like, is that, are you really going to have, you know, isn't that a little gaudy or something that what are you doing? Like, are you, and all my, that's my being counting mind. I was thinking like, what about your spiritual audience? You like spiritual stuff. What if you offend them? And that, and then I realized like, oh, you definitely have to ask her on the show because if there's that part of your mind that's fighting you because of like the fake audience in your head, you have to teach it like a bad doggy. No, no, no, no, no, no. We don't listen to your barking. We do what our instincts tell us to do. You know, so to me, though, I love being able to support myself with a podcast and I am in heaven because I get to, if this wasn't part of it, this mutual collaboration that we're having right now, then fuck that job. Right. You know, that's shit. Because this is the kind of, now my head's whirling with ideas just because of the, not because of you or because of me, but because of our connection right now in this moment. That to me is like the precious, it's the, that's it. The thing I love about podcasts and I just started my own one, like I'm on episode 24. What's it called? It's called the Mr. Bill podcast. Perfect. And I pretty much just talked to my musician friends about stuff like this. Like, you know, how do you feel about making music? And like the one thing I really like about it is it's like you give yourself just an hour with someone else or an hour and a half. I have long to just lock shit off and just talk. And it's something that we don't do enough. And the reason why I think people like it, like, I mean, you're a stand up comedian. So I assume some people like your podcast because they like you stand up comedy. I'm not really known so much for being a talk. I mean, I do have like online tutorials and shit like that. So people know me a little bit from there. But I think the reason why people seem to like it is because it's almost like something to be in awe of because we people don't do it so much anymore. So it's like people looking like, wow, what is this? A fucking conversation. Yeah. Yeah. And that's why I love doing these is because it's so seems special now that it's so rare. Yeah, I agree. I mean, that is your phones are off. You're having a chat. And the stuff that ends up happening within that is like, you just don't know what questions you're going to answer for yourself. It's like, we need to collaborate. Collaboration is that's what we're in. We're in the entire planet as a collaborative experience between matter of various types. And that collaboration has produced this thing we call human beingness and that it's collaboration. It's all about collaboration and mixing it up. And that's yeah. And the more that we do that with each other, the better things get. It's really, you know, to me, when I am with a person and I go into my phone or they go into their phone, even if we're just watching a show together. Yeah, you feel it. It like definitely puts a big like divider in the situation and like fucks it up. Yeah, it does. It does. And that, you know, just like that moment of like sitting with somebody and like feeling the connection, you know, in a podcast where the connections being expressed through this like fun game of like linguistic tennis that we're playing right now. Non competitive linguistic tennis. Yeah, but the the if you look like underneath the app and there's an energetic there's a sense of something the same with stand up. And isn't that the same with DJing when you're you can feel. I mean, and like I was just going to I just had this idea as you're like you're explaining this. It's kind of like when somebody pulls their phone out. It's like when the sound system goes out when you're playing fucking sucks and you can just feel the energy man. It's like it's all good. Like people are vibing the or or when you mix the wrong tune that that can fuck shit up too. Like, you know, I'm playing a techno set tomorrow night and that's a super fucking specific style of DJing where if you play the wrong tune, like it fucks shit up a lot and you can definitely feel the vibe changes. And yeah, no, I agree. There's like an energy there that that can be, you know, changed. And yeah, it's nice to stop for a while and have conversations to like experience this sort of energy and yeah, and it's and it's also like you said non competitive and also not so detrimental if you fuck it up, you know, like you're in a mid performance of some sort. That's any other kind of performance, not a conversation like a recorded conversation, you know, like DJing or something. It almost feels more detrimental if you screw that up or if you don't stand up comedy and you like deliver wrong or, you know, it might feel a little worse than if you just say the wrong thing in a podcast. Yeah, that's right. Exactly. Speaking of which, I'm really, this might be maybe not so interesting to your fans or not so interesting to you because you might talk about it a lot. But I'm really interested in your process for writing stand up because a few times in my life, I've, you know, just be sitting around and I'll have this like thought or some thought and this happens like maybe once a month where I'll just have some thought and I'll be like, wow, that's like some fucked dystopian world where society does this. Why the fuck did I think of that? And then I think about it. I'm like, if I was a stand up comedian, I'd probably be able to deliver that in a way that's funny where the punchline is this crazy dystopian world where people do this now. And I'm just curious, like, is that sort of your process for writing as well? Like you just come up with a thought and then it's like, bam, I need to just figure out the rest of that thought now or do you sort of sit down and go, I'm going to write stand up comedy and then start from scratch and like build and like. Man, it's a mix. It's a mix. Like sometimes you're just hanging out with your friends and you'll, if you're especially hanging out with comics, you might say, you know, I just be telling a story and I'm thinking and then one of your friends like, oh, that's a joke. You got to write that down. That's a joke. And they're, oh shit, that's a joke. And so you write it down. Sometimes you might, what I do is I try as much as possible to journal. So I try as much as possible just to write anything. I don't give a fuck what it is. It's awful. You know, God forbid anybody should read any of my journals because they're like, you're going to want, who knows what you're going to think. Well, this could be some of the art that needs to get out there. You know, you're being selfish, don't you? Oh, no, no, no. My journals aren't fucking art. There's something called discernment. I mean, we've got to be able to distinguish our, you know, our shit from our gold or we're going to be in a really stinky world. It's important to have discernment. You know, but I do think that you also need to simultaneously have respect for the process, whatever it may be. And you know, and also have the humility to know that you don't understand why you're doing certain things that you're doing. So, you know, take yourself out of the picture there. It's like, I don't know what my large intestine is doing right now. Like I have some, like, I could guess, you know, what my stomach is doing, what my kidneys are doing, my bladder, my heart, but I'm not going to go in there and like have a, you know, tell my heart like, listen, we need to like do this differently because I think it's going to be better for our circulate. I'm going to let my heart do what it does, right? So similarly, like with an artist or someone's making anything or a parent or anybody, there's shit you do habitually that you're like, what is that? You don't know. If it's not killing you, it's not self-destructive, but it's just something you're doing. You don't know. You don't know what that, for your psyche, that might be a kidney or something, you know, and so I like to write. And then through that process of writing, I can at least become a little more patient and trusting of free flow of thoughts that are being directed into at least some kind of understandable form, even if it's just a boring, obvious assessment of what it's like to drive in traffic. Some drivel about love or some nonsense about working out or some fucking caffeinated, rambling bullshit about, what is a stranger? Some just embarrassing nonsense. You know what I mean? I don't know what that is. I know I don't, when I read it, when I go back to an old journal, I'm like, what the fuck is this shit? What are you in like a freshman in college philosophy? Are you just crap? Like, who do you think you are? Camus? Or look at how imitative this bullshit is. You're not fucking Nietzsche. Are you trying to be Ram Dassi or whatever? My point is, that's just a judgmental part of my mind, but one thing I do know is like, well, I needed to do that. I did it. And sometimes in there, I'll find the very seed of a thing that turns into a joke in its earliest form, just some little piece of a sentence that later turns into a joke, and maybe I needed to spit it out like that. That's what I do for writing jokes. Then after you get a joke down, like an approximation of a joke, you say it on stage for the first time. There's no real other way to know if it's going to work or if it's going to be interesting. And you can't just tell it to a friend or something and be like, because that doesn't work unless it's a room of people, right? Yeah, you can't say. It's like you making music and then playing it on your phone to someone. Is this good? Right. You know, if you like this, is this good, right? They might be like, yeah, that sounds pretty cool. But until you're looking at it out of the ocean of people at your shows undulating to the sound that you're producing, you don't understand what it is, and even then you might not understand what it is. Similarly, you can get in front of a room of people and think you've caught a unicorn that you're going to display some glorious, high level, powerful joke and be met with crickets. And you're like, oh, fuck. Oh, my God. Why didn't that not work? And then you can kind of like, then within that, there's lots of questions you can ask yourself. For me, what happens is I get too like, if I'm not careful, my volume goes up too high. And especially if I'm scared or freaked out about a joke, I might be like, It's just too harsh. The audience is like, what are you doing to us? Why are you yelling at us? You don't have to read that. So for me, and my friend who's a comic was explaining to me about the spirit of playfulness. Once you lose that, you're fucked as a comic, you know? So like, you know, I have to be conscious of like, intent when I'm up there and not lose track. And anyway, the point is, there's all these reasons the joke doesn't work. And quite often it's the energy behind the joke or some mechanical problem with the joke, which is a lot of the times just that you aren't explaining it well enough. What you're even, you're making all these assumptions that the audience understands you or your life or whatever. And you haven't, or it's too long. That's the death of a joke. Because you have some thing that's funny for eight seconds that you've expanded into two minutes. So I have felt like a few ways that I write music. One way is like, I'll think of a melody or I'll think of a sound or I'll think of like a rhythm or something like that. And then I'll go and be like, right, put it in Ableton, see how it goes. You'll think of it. Sometimes. And then that's one way I write music. The other way I think I write music is I don't have a musical idea, but I want to get something done that day. So I'll sit down and my way to do this is I just generate stimulus somehow. So I actually, this is another thought that I have sometimes or often is I actually don't think creativity exists. I don't think like I ever generate creativity. I think I'm completely reactive. Like I will only ever come up with an idea if I'm stimulated with another idea. So it's like, I probably wouldn't have had this thought that I'm explaining to you right now. Unless you just said the thing that you said, you know, or like people have been saying this shit for a long time. You know, the artist who writes a song about a rose, it's like, well, then was he creative or did the rose give him an idea? So the second way that I write music is I have like stimulus generating techniques. And usually these are kind of like melody generating techniques where I'll create like some complicated rack of MIDI processes and arpeggiators and stuff. And I'll just like, bam, input a MIDI note and I'll just like, like output some melody or something. And then I'll be like, oh, interesting. That gives me an idea for a harmony now. And then from there, like the process will react and like it creates this like snowballing effect. Is there like anything you ever do for writing stand up like that where you're like, I just want to write stand up today. But you don't have like any particular idea or you don't have like, is there. Yeah, sure. Okay. How does that look? That's writing in a journal for me. It's like I'm sitting in a writing and it's like, I'm not creating some awful rule that what I'm writing has to be funny. Yeah, okay. And then somewhere in there, I might find a place that I'm like, that there's a thing that I'm interested in because, you know, you won't, if you're going to tell a joke, you need to be interested in the content of the joke. Of course. You need to exert that zeal if you're going to tell it to people. Yeah. Like it's got to be something. It sounds so obvious. If you're talking about something on stage, make sure it's something you want to be talking about. Because if you don't want to be talking about it, what are you going to draw from? You talk about things you know, and or at least things that you're fascinated by or excited about. Like even if your joke sucks, at least people are going to see that you are like excited about the content. Sometimes you can see comics, you've gotten caught in a trap. I certainly got caught in that trap, which is that you sort of create a set and your life changes. And the material that you wrote jokes about is no longer interesting to you anymore. But you're up there repeating the same jokes. Well, it's a lot of work to rewrite them all, isn't it? So it's almost like some sunk cost fallacy type thing where you don't want to invest more time because you just invested it all. You don't want to fail in front of strangers. Well, yeah. And you know, many jokes, you need the canvas of failure to like the way you understand the structure of a joke. And any comic you see who is like repeating the set that they've been doing over and over again. And again, I feel completely okay to talk about this because I'm not talking shit about someone else. I'm saying, I have done this. You're up there, you're a fucking robot. You're repeating these jokes that work. Because you either, A, indulgingly want to feel an entire room of people laughing because they think you're a genius. Or B, because you just haven't been writing. Or maybe you're having an issue like creating some more stuff that you think is good. But you forget that all those jokes you're telling up there that are good started off not so good. And the reason they got good was because you'll let yourself be up there with new jokes. And to do that requires, unfortunately, a lot of different things. Number one, the willingness to kind of fail. Number two, the ability to take risks. And number three, you need a place where you can workshop jokes. So is there no way as a comic then to get new material without just like basically fucking up in front of people constantly? Like is that just a thing you have to accept you're going to have to do for the rest of your career? Well, the way you fuck up becomes less obvious. Okay. You know, better at like sort of getting out of the train wreck. Yeah. Okay. And also those old fucking jokes, they can be like glorious, glorious go-tos. If you're like, you know, your new material is really tanking or something, you know, you can like it like pull those out. That's even a controversial move. Some people like don't, don't pull them out. Die. Die up there. Die in front of them and feel it. Like go right. You know, I don't know. There's so many schools of thought on it, but... It seems like from the audience perspective, it's probably a better thing to pull them out so you can like, you know, at the end of the day, like the audience, you want the audience to have like a good experience, right? Like rather than just tanking, tanking, tanking. Exactly. Well, that's, that's also the other funny thing is you need to like, when you have a new joke, you're always going to want to open on it. So like you've got this new joke that you're really excited about. And so sometimes you'll open on a new joke. It's like, don't, you can't do that because it's a, it's a gamble and the, that could create a chain reaction that goes through the entire set. So you don't want to open on a new joke. And the main, all of it, that's one of the things I love about Rogan is like his number one priority when, when he was taking us on the road and when he takes any comics on the road, he teaches you stuff. And the main thing is like, remember, these people pay for babysitters. This isn't about you. You know what I mean? They're here to have a good time. They're on a date. They got whoever came with him to think you were good enough to buy tickets to. You can't, you can't get sloppy and lazy up there. That's on the road. But then if you're at a comedy club, you shouldn't be sloppy and lazy. You have to have the intent, man. It's like, number one, respect the fucking audience. There's comics who are like, I hate the crowd. It's like, shut up. Stop that. The whole fucking reason you came to Louisville, Kentucky is because of that crowd. Yeah, man. Yeah. I don't wonder. That's like dark to me. For me, it's like they can feel if you love what you're doing and they can feel if you at least have some sense of respect for the fact that they're sitting in front of you while you have a microphone in front of your face. And they can also feel when you're like to, when you don't and all that stuff. By the way, thank you for interviewing me. I really, I really like the questions you're asking. Yeah. I'm super interested. Specifically, the stand up shit is like, it's always, I always just think about it and I don't know any like successful comics, right? Like I'm not in that scene. Yeah. So I'm just always like, how the fuck does it work? Because I mean, like, I know exactly how electronic music works. But I don't. And let me ask you this. This is something that I'm really curious about, man. Sure. When you're up there in front of people who are dancing to your music and you're looking out at what's happening, how in that moment are you and how much are you thinking about the next song, how you're going to get into it? Like the technical elements. So I quite often don't get to look out that off that much. And the reason why is because in like a one hour set, I'll play like almost 60 tunes. So it's like I'm mixing a new one every minute. So if I don't have my set completely, like if I have my set completely preplanned, that might give me 20 seconds after a mix or something to look out for a second and then be like trying to mix the next tune. But if I don't have my set very preplanned, which is like generally these days I'll have like sort of 50% preplanned, 50% a little winging it. And if I, so 50% of the time it's like as soon as I've finished mixing, I have to be looking for another tune. Because like if I'm not, then it's like valuable time that I might be selecting the, you know, I can really only have a listen in my headphones to probably like four or five options before I have to just make a decision. What are you using? Just CDJs. Wow. I was doing like a full live set at some point, which was like with a drummer and like a whole visual wall and like everything was synced and like I was playing instruments and like I was doing some kind of something more like that. And then I was using a laptop for a while and I had all my stems broken up and I was like had a controller and I was like doing all this. But then I was like, all of these other options kind of were like taking me away from what I really wanted to be doing, which was just writing tunes. Because what I would have to be doing right is like writing tunes in the studio, but then two weeks or three weeks or a month before I go on the road. I would have to be thinking about how I'm going to play them all and then that would be when the stemming process would start because it takes fucking forever to stem shit out. Can you tell people what a stem is? A stem is one wave file of audio that is a component of a song. Like for instance, for one song, my stems might look like, you know, let's say Michael's song. I would have like stem one drums, stem two bass, stem two, three synths, stem four vocals, like, you know, it'd be a bunch of stuff. And then I'd be able to cut those stems up under controllers and be able to like trigger them in certain ways and like be able to affect certain, you know, just affect my drums and leave everything else alone and like sort of remix shit a little bit on the fly kind of stuff. But that process alone, just getting it from the tune, finished tune process to the playable state would take like per tune a day. So if I wanted to play 30 new tunes, that's like a month of time, just fucking doing that. So I was like, fuck, and it was that part was like very stressful. And then when I'd go play the show, it's like, nobody really understands how much work went into that. So like, they're not that impressed by it anyway. Whereas if I just play tunes and I play 60 tunes in an hour and 30 of them are like unreleased or something that they've never heard. But they can tell it's a Mr. Bill tune or a weird edit that I made of something that's popular at the time, but also very quirky in my own way and stuff. Then they're just as impressed. And for me, it's way less work. And then I get to do what I love up until the day of the show, which is right beats. That's beautiful. That's great. That to me is one of the true epiphanies that can happen in an artist's career. Right. You kind of like figure out what it is that you actually want out of life. Yes. And you realize you don't have to suffer for this in the way that you're like torturing yourself. Because some artists, they're like lashing their backs with this agonizing, ridiculous process that completely is taking them away from what you're talking about. The moment your artist is taking away from your art, well, that's a bizarre situation to find yourself in where you're caught up in that shit. I can't even imagine how terrifying that must be to be in front of a room full of people with an infinite number of stems that you are somehow going to play live, bringing shit in and out. So many things can go wrong. So many things can go wrong. For sure. I mean, you're always, this is the thing with electronic music. And to some degree stand up to is you're always at the whim of technology, which is kind of a bit scary because you're like, if this computer just fucking dies, I'm fucked. It's not like I have a backup plan. You need a trumpet up there. Right. Something. You need a trumpet you pull out when the power, because with stand up, the mic doesn't work. You just start, you can start screaming. Right. Anything. There's a million things you could do physically. You could do. You can react to it in the moment. Exactly. And it's not like, I mean, Or at least, you know, you're a, you're a talker. You have like, I'd never talk on the mic when I play, which is something a lot of DJs do. So if something goes wrong, I very rarely get on the mic and go, Hey, sorry, the sound system just went out or something. Because I'm like, you know, I'm pretty soft spoken person, never really yell and you kind of have to yell in that situation. Otherwise, it's, you know, if you talk in a soft spoken voice on the microphone at a fucking dance club, it doesn't work. You're fucked. Yeah. People are like, Oh, that's weird. Here's a question. Cause like honestly, yeah, I mean it, man. I was so, I'm all the questions you asked me. I'm like, there's a lot to think about, but I've got all these questions I wanted to ask you. So do you have a little bit of more time? Dude, absolutely. I'm going to do this for however long. Okay. So, and forgive me some, if some of these seem like cheesy questions. Yeah, no problem. Do you remember when people started saying, put your fucking hands up? Yeah, that was kind of before I was playing shows. I think it started with that Fetilla Grand Tune. Didn't it? Put your hands up for Detroit. I don't know. Put your hands up. I don't know. I think, I don't know. I mean, yeah, I don't do that shit. What's your opinion on that? My opinion on it is, if DJ go put your fucking hands up, what are you thinking? I mean, it kind of works for some genres in some moments in time, but it might be the same as you looking at someone who's telling certain shit that, you know, they don't really want to be telling or something, you know, like some, for some people, I can tell that they don't really want to be doing it. And they're doing it because they think it's the thing that needs to be done. And they're doing it because they saw someone else do it who's popular or something like that. But for some other people, they're just at their core, very hypey people. And I have friends like that. You hang around them and you just like, dude, you've got no fucking chill button. And like, it's, you can just tell that they genuinely want to do that. Right. You know, they're having some, some people do it and it looks a little awkward, but it sort of works. Other people do it and it looks completely comfortable. And you're just like, that's just what you fucking do. Who you are. Yeah, exactly. That's who you are. And I think it emanated probably from somebody like that, who's just that suit or who they are. Yeah. And I think it works so well for maybe that person or something that it just became a thing. I always say not the thing is, man, I'm like 45. I got a one year old. I don't have a lot of shows anymore, but I always felt mildly resentful. Well, it's kind of weird. Don't tell me to put my hands up. Right. And there's also like the rhetorical question thing like, how are you doing tonight? Whatever city name. Yeah. Yeah. There's got to be something. There's got to be innovations regarding like what goddamn appendages you want me to elevate other than like commanding me to do it. Like, here's some kind of digital cop up there. Come on. Give us a break. We're dancing. We're dancing enough for you. Yeah. Well, there's some funny shit too. Like I got friends who sort of take the piss out of that stuff and they'll like get on stage and right before the drop, instead of going like one, two, three, four, they'll go like one, two, three, four, five, six, seven and then drop like some odd number. That's cool. Or like my buddy, Squanto, he'll always get on the mic and be like, don't make some noise for no fucking reason. Yeah. It's a little sardonic there, but let's talk about the drop. Okay. The drop. So well, that's, I mean, the chorus. Right. Yeah. That's what it was before that it was a drop. I never realized that until just now. Yeah. The drop is the chorus. Yeah. Exactly. Let's talk about the drop. I really, cause to me, like whenever I am like deciding, all right, for once I'm going to make an actual song that has a drop. Right. And then it's a lot of work. It's okay. Yeah. So it is hard. It is. It is hard. Yeah. I mean, like it's, it's very easy to listen to a drop and be like, it's just wobble. Like some simple shit. Yeah. And when you actually look into it and start doing it, you realize it's like a fucking engineering feat that that drop works and sounds so flawless. Cause it's like everything is just perfectly engineered to sit like that and sound that big and perfect. And yes, musically, it's simple use a lot of the time, but it's simple because that's a part of the fucking engineering feat. Like you can't have a lot of stuff in a drop and still make it sound that big and that clean. But for all intents and purposes, it's the punchline of a joke, isn't it? And why the punchline of a joke is funny is because of the setup. So also the buildup is very fucking important for the drop. When you are making music, do you ever just think of the drop and then reverse engineer buildup? Well, almost every time it's kind of like I make the drop and then I validate what I do with a buildup because otherwise it's not important, right? It's like it might work in a set because you can just play the buildup of the tune before it and then just play the drop of that new thing you made. And then yes, it's validated by whatever was playing before it, but as its own thing, it doesn't stand as a full electronic tune. Yeah, yeah, I get it. It's like it's the what is it? That's like act. It's like act three or it's the in a movie. It's the the the crescendo, the climax, but the less tension and release to the buildups tension, the drop is always like the big release portion. Do you ever fuck up the drop in the sense that you create so much tension, people lose interest in the drop like a joke that's too long? Yeah, actually, I have one tune in my set. That's actually just something that I found on SoundCloud that some kid made and it's literally he took like every buildup from every big trap and dubstep tune from 2019 and just stapled them all together. It's like a three minute like epic buildup and I play it in the middle of my set sometimes and it's like the one time in my set where I can like chill for a bit because it's just a long joke, basically. And a lot of the time, like people are just like the fucking like confused and I kind of like it because it's like a meme sort of. And and then at the end there's like a giant drop, but after all those buildups, it almost feels like the drop is not that not that doesn't feel like it resolves so well and feels so good. It's just too much. Like it's like because like the it's it's sort of like the in and if you're if you're telling a joke, the distance, but the amount of time before your punchline, you could call that a withdrawal from the bank. Right. Exactly. And then the punchline here invests, putting all the money back in. Hopefully some more. Exactly. Yeah. And then you can make your net. If you need to make a longer withdrawal, you can because the audience is starting to trust it's going to be funny. You have them engaged and yeah, yeah, exactly. You can do that shit further into the set. And it's the same with like running music. It's like you don't want to start a fucking set with that three minute buildup meme. Like that's going to know people will just leave. Yeah. Yeah, that's right. But tell me, OK, so when you're figuring out what you're going to play, do you so is it kind of like you have warm up songs where it's just like a kind of like getting people ready for like what's coming? You know what I mean? Do you start off kind of soft? So I kind of always I have a few different views on this, I guess. One is that I'll try and just start with something new that I made because I'm stoked about it, you know, sort of like you were saying with jokes, you just want to start with something new, test it out, straight away sort of thing. Sometimes I'll do that. Other times I'll start with just like ambience or something like that to just let people know that the DJ has changed from the one before. Right. You know, because other times, like otherwise, if you just the last DJ was playing some real heavy shit and then you're just like, bam, big, heavy shit, because I don't get on the mic and be like, hey, I missed a bill and I'm about to play music. So I have to like let them know in some way that the DJ has actually changed and that I'm starting. So that usually happens musically. Sometimes ambience can do that, right? Because people like, oh, this is kind of doesn't sound like coherent with what was just happening. And other times I'll just start with something that has like a nice big long intro into like a really giant drop or something like, you know, some big epic intro type deal. I mean, there's a few ways to do it, but that's kind of like the three that I'll go to usually something new or something big and epic that I just know works or something. Man, you got to do a song where you what you just with what you just said, like you could do an intro with like just. I'll just take this portion from the podcast and just put it in. Yeah, just like play this in the beginning of a show and just like the code it with like chords over it. So it sounds like all robotic voice. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I mean, that's cool. That's such a, it's such a wild form of performance. Now, OK, so how much. When you see like how much do you do you feel compelled? Like you see DJs and they, they throw their hands up and they do that thing during the drop where they're like, does that happen to you? Do you ever, do you get taken with your own music in the same way that the crowd is being taken with it and find yourself sort of pulled out of what you're doing to like dance for a second with them? Oh yeah, for sure. If the DJ I'm watching is engaging enough, definitely. It's almost like I've heard, I think it was Joe talked about stand up being just like a form of mass hypnosis. I feel like DJing can be like that, too. If the person performing is, you know, engaging enough and the music they're playing is engaging enough, you know, and they're doing because sometimes the DJs that can be boring, if somebody like sticks on some shit for too long and they're too much, just like a flat brim hat. DJ who's looking down and like it's kind of like instead of the equivalent of a flat brim just looking down, like not paying attention to the audience thing might be a chair guy, right? Yeah. Someone who just like sits on a stool the whole time or something. Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, there's I'm trying to think of the version of that in comedy and that's a tough one. But yeah, the disconnected DJs. I mean, it's kind of like when you see a DJ like that, you feel like you're just like watching somebody do like factory work or something. You're like, you know what I mean? It's like a dude, like you don't want it to seem just like a job where you're like printing songs out that are flying into people's ears. You want to play stuff that you think is engaging and you want to be busy enough up there that you're feeling engaged the whole time, too. Cause another problem with DJing and electronic music is a big part of the job is a being a good librarian, like organizing a music collection in a fucking easy so you can find anything you want in the moment at any time. And the second part of it is, is being a good waiter, like knowing when the right time to do something is, you know, right? How do you know that? Well, it's a linear art form. You just get good at knowing when to do the thing. But and obviously like music structural, right? So it's like generally, you know, you're just not going to play a drop. Like, I'm just going to play it right now. No, right. You're going to play it. There's logic to it, but still it's like, tell me a little bit about when you started doing this shit. Surely you had some shows where you're like, this is a nightmare. Train wrecked from like 2008 to like 2015. Like a long time before I like figured it out. And that's, I don't think the case for a lot of people, but I think I was such a producer and just like not giving a fuck about the show. I was like, fuck it. Like the show's not important. The writing of the music is important. And it was really only over like since 2017, I think onwards, where I was like, I'm going to start taking the show thing way more seriously and start thinking a lot more about like how to structure an actual good DJ set and stuff like that. But it was not something that I concentrated on for a long time in my career. What does a train wreck look like in DJing? There's a few ways you can do it. One is that you just play shit next to each other. That's just not even related. Like the equivalent in stand up comedy might be like, you tell a really funny joke and then you just start doing a monologue and then you just start like singing and then you just start like just, but that could, it could work. You know, stand up comedy. He said, if you like transitioned it right and did it with some sort of like, you know, social, social syntax, that makes sense or something. But yeah, it's like, that's one way to train record DJ set. Another way is if you don't know how to beat match properly and you just start playing tunes over the top of each other, that are just not in rhythm at all. Yeah. Um, that's like the two main ways I would say. Yeah. That the second way being them, like it's, that's the worst of them all. Right. Like that's the most embarrassing one. Right. Cause yeah, but it's pretty easy to avoid now cause all CDJs have a sync button on them. So you can just like bam, press it. It just like lines up the beat grids automatically. You don't really have to jog them anymore. I might, I was years ago when I was a dishwasher, I was roommates with a DJ in, uh, Asheville, North Carolina. And he, that's where Freddie lived for a while. Yeah. Yeah. He just moved back to Detroit. That's right. I didn't know he moved. He did. The, the, I remember being so captivated by what he was doing and he like picked like two shitty records out of his collection. He's like, you can practice on these and he let me use his turntables and I would sit and try to beat match on his DJ turntables. And I never figured it out. Dude, I can't mix two vinyls together at all. I've never, I've never done a set on. Really? Um, I mean, no, that makes me feel so much better. I always, like, it's the way I feel about allying with skateboarding. It's like, I can't do it. How do you do it? Yeah. I can't do it, but beat matching and vinyl is so crazy. That's like next level difficult to do for sure. Like that, that style of beat matching is super tough. For me, because of this sync button on the CDJ, I mean, I can jog two tracks together easily, like pretty easily on CDJ is not on vinyl. That's, it's very different. Um, but like having the sync button, I almost always leave it on anyway, because to me, it's like the feet of DJing is not even like jogging two things together. Like the feet of it is for me writing all the beats, right? And then secondly, playing them in the right order and then mixing them in certain ways and like doing creative stuff with effects and shit like that. Like that's more, what I find. God, let me tell you, back then we would listen to electronic music on vinyl and like just scratch our heads about who the fuck's making this shit. Like I would sit and be so like fascinated by that idea that there was a person who somewhere was writing and producing this stuff and then getting it out there. These are, this is like, you know, pre pre-internet. So we didn't have the ability to just like look up how people make this stuff. There's some idea. It's synth computers. Right. But you had to like go ask the guy at the music store and shit. And like, yeah, it's kind of what it was like. Just as I was starting, there was very like YouTube was just sort of kicking off and like there wasn't a whole lot of tutorial stuff out there. I mean, now you can just Google like how to make a fucking school. Google you. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Do you think, do you feel like there's some kind of dilution that's happening by giving away the mystery of making this stuff? I've had this conversation a lot and I mean, I'm sort of of two minds about it. In one sense, I think in a lot in ones, I mean, so in one, I think that giving away the information, if everyone does it, raises the industry as a whole. And that's how it gets to be better in general, right? Because when I first started, electronic music sucked, and I'm not saying I was the reason why I'm the reason why it's good now. But like, I'm definitely part of the reason why it's good now is not just because of me, but because of a lot of people being willing to share their information, right? And I think that's also partially why the tech industry has boomed so much. Do you know what GitHub is? Yeah, sure. Yeah, you just go there and like fucking tech people have spent a week writing some fucking library that just does X, Y, Z things and they're just like giving it out for free and give a shit about money that partially I found out the reason why that is is because they don't want to do tech support for it. So if they just give it out for free, they have no reason to to invest any more time into it after that because if it doesn't work and somebody paid $150 for it, they're going to hit the creator up right go and like, can you fix this? Right. So so I think that kind of shit is great for an industry. And I think the inverse of that, I'm trying to think of like an industry that maybe has been super secretive about information sharing and where that industry might be now. But I can't think of the Illuminati. Well, there you go. Yeah, I mean, there's a bunch of conspiracies about it. But like, what are they really? What have they really done for us? Sugar. Sugar. Oh, it's crushing it right now. I think they evolved the sugar industry. But you know, like electronic music now it's in a place that like I couldn't have even imagined when I started doing it and I'm really stoked about like it. It behooves me to for it to be that big, you know, like me as a relatively small artist on the scale of electronic music is still doing fine. Yeah, man. I think, you know, to me, there's if anything, the rising tide raises all ships kind of thing. Yeah, that's a beautiful saying, rising tide raises all ships. Yeah, that. Yeah, you know, like the the there was, I guess, for a lot of us, there is like an irreplaceable feeling that we're never going to get that if at this point, we'll never get the feeling back of hearing, I don't know, prodigy right and being like, what? Well, that was sort of like Skrillex, I think, like when he first released shit, a lot of producers and just a lot of people in general, I think we're like, what the fuck? I mean, no, I mean, how did he fucking? How do they make this? Right? No, that's the feeling with Skrillex, too. Oh, yeah, yeah, right, right, right. That you're right. There was a sense of like, what the fuck? It was like the first of its kind where people, I think, were just like, how the fuck did he make that? I feel that with your music. I don't have time to go and dig up how the fuck you're making those sounds because like you're, you, Richard Devine. Dude, his nuts. What the fuck? It's like, I don't understand. I don't want to understand. Also, PS, like with some things, it's like, I'm not going to, I don't want to look up the way the magician's doing the tricks necessarily. You know, I do want there to, with Richard Devine, it's like, I want to imagine he's dropped a microphone into some hyperdimensional frog pond. And they're just playing the sounds of nature three multiverses away. That was the other part of your question, right? It's like, do you think it destroys the mystery? And yes, I do think it destroys the mystery, but I'd also like to think that for some people, it makes it better, right? Like if, if somebody's like, how the fuck was that made? And then they find out how it was made. And they're like, wow, that's actually like pretty fucking impressive slash a lot of effort that it makes it more impressive to them, you know? Yeah. And I think I've seen it have both effects to people. I've seen some people be reductive assholes to me and be like, well, yeah, it's just this. And it's like, yeah, it is just that, but you didn't fucking figure it out. And then the other thing I've noticed is people being like, holy shit, like how did you figure out how to do that? Like how does your brain work in that way? And that makes me feel really good, right? Cause it's like, yeah, I feel smart for figuring out a thing. Well, yeah. Cause I mean, it is, I mean, for those of you out there, I haven't sat down with like Ableton or something. I mean, holy shit. I remember when I first met that dog and was like, what the, what the holy fuck? Cause I used logic before Ableton and logic garageband before logic. And, you know, that, that way of making music or making anything just made sense to me, you know, layering it like premier, it's like people cut video. And then Ableton, you know, these crazy German, I don't know what they probably are aliens. If anyone is in looks like an Excel spreadsheet and it looks like a spreadsheet. Boring. You see it for the first time. It's the most boring looking display I've ever seen in my life and confusing. If you don't know the tab button, forget it. You're like, what the fuck is this? Like, I'll never make music. Um, but then over the course of like getting like making stuff with it, it has given me a profound respect for what you said regarding the drop or the chorus, which is the, when I'm listening to music now, and I realized how many different sounds someone has figured out a way to allow to coexist together in the sense that my ear can pick whichever one I want to listen to. And they're all clear. One's not being drowned out by the other. One isn't muddied. There's just this beautiful sample of sound that's perfectly, it's like, I, to this day, I, I can't even imagine how some of the music that's out there right now, I don't know what they're doing that they can make it work. You know, it's, yeah. It's, it's funny because you listen to a drop, right? And it seems so flawless. And you're just like, it sounds so simple and flawless. And like, it just sounds like three sounds, like a kick and a snare. Yeah. Your brain might. Subitizes like one sound. And then there's like, you know, a bass sound and then maybe like a big synth lead over the top. But if you look at the session, it's like all of those bases are actually like 15 or 20 channels of MIDI, like hocketing between shit and like having reverb tails automate off the ends of them and shit. And then like the synth sound is like maybe just one sound with fuck loads of automation on it. And then the drums, you've spent like days engineering that kick and snare. And like, it's really like, like, it is really just an engineering feat to kind of get something of that complexity to work together and sound that seamless. Yeah, man. No one knows that nobody knows. Well, I think, yeah, a lot of people know it, everyone making it knows that. But I think like a lot of people listening don't, don't really think about it. And I mean, why should they? But like, yeah, I don't think they realize how much, how much actual engineering goes into making something that both, you know, somebody silly, like, well, not silly, but somebody like who doesn't know a lot about electronic music, who has a very basic understanding of like, or even no understanding of the creation process can listen to it and just sort of know that it sounds better than everything else. It's like, or feel that it sounds better than everything else. That level of shit is like, it's just a lot of engineering. Yeah. I remember my friend telling me the first time he was telling me, he's like, you know, man, that like the kick, just the kick, if you know how much work is going in, it's just that sound. Also, here's the other thing, right? Is like, if you have to explain to somebody why the drop's cool by explaining to them how long you spent on the kick, it's a fucking shitty tune as well, isn't it? It's a shitty joke if you have to be like, here's why it was a good joke. Yeah, exactly. So in that sense, it's like, it has to be amazingly engineered. Everything has to slot in perfectly. But also, somebody who has no idea has to be able to listen to it and also think it's cool and understand it. Yeah. It's like, if I'm, you know, I was God, he's that incredible mathematician. He was, oh, damn it. There's this famous math, Feynman, Feynman, I think is his name. He was, I think at Los Alamos. He was one of the people who helped split the atom and make the atomic bomb. Richard Feynman, I think, or something, F-E-Y. And anyway, he wrote this essay on just the ocean, on just what's happening when you're looking at a wave in the ocean, the physics going on. And it's like listening to you talk about, you know, the producing music. You know, just what you just said, tail reverb tails or whatever. I wouldn't know a fucking reverb tail if I had one on me. But like the, you know, listening that when he's looking at the ocean, he's seeing this like symphony of details. Yeah. Like the math involved in each wave is to him so profoundly beautiful. He's like, I think the essay might have been a thing like, I don't need like to connect to some divine thing. I'm looking at this like calculation that's happening via, you know, hydrogen and oxygen that the universe is just natural. I don't know how you put it. So you didn't say the universe is doing it. You just, it was like the way described a simple wave. But then, you know, I'm at the beach and I'm looking at waves. I'm like, wow, that's pretty. You know, I don't know why. I have no reason to think about the extra stuff that goes into it. Right. Like me as a producer, I'll listen to a drop and like I can't help but to break down the components of it and think about it from that perspective because I know a lot about that sort of shit. Maybe like you may look at comedy and think about like potentially the writing process or potentially like just the wording or the delivery or something like I never go to a standup comedy show and go like, oh, well, that was good delivery because I don't know what the fuck that is. Oh my God. You know, like there's a comic, her name's Whitney Cummings. She's so fucking funny. And like, I don't know where her first off. What's that? I know Whitney Cummings. Oh man. She like, you know, like I was watching her. I got lucky. I don't know when she had started working on this material, but I hadn't seen it yet. She's working on new material. But I got to like over the course of like a few weeks, watch the material evolve. In the way she was like precisely evolving it. And yeah, that's what I'm seeing is like, whoa, that's a holy shit. Look at the way that she's like reconfiguring that idea and look at the way that it's like growing into this like great joke. Very inspirational, you know? And yeah, so I would have seen that. Yeah. No, I would just go to see something like that and walk away from it, either being like, well, that was sick or like, that was okay. Or like, you know, I probably would just think it's sick. I don't think I've ever been to a standup show and being like, that was garbage. Oh yeah. I think the only time I've ever maybe thought that is like, actually the only time I've ever thought that is when I went to an open mic with my friend who I forced to do stand up because he like has, he's always wanted to, but he always like makes up an excuse to not. So I was like, oh man, you have to like do it. And I like every excuse he came up with like, oh, my car's fucked. I was like, I'll pay for an Uber. And then he was like, oh, you know, my shirt. And I was like, here's a shirt. Like I was just, and I eventually got him to go. And just because I was there, I think at the open mic thing, knowing that a lot of people it was probably their first time of stuff, maybe I was a little bit more, uh, judgmental of it. Or like, you know, whereas if I go to somebody like the comedy store and watch it there, it's like, I know the barrier of entry to get on the stage is a little higher, right? So I don't, I just assume that it runs a fucking pro or something. Right. Yeah. That's a good assumption over there. The, the, um, but you also noticed shit like might, like what they do with the mic stand. Yeah. I noticed stuff like that. Like I was, Seinfeld popped in there. Someone filmed Seinfeld and I was like watching what he does. This weird, like Charlie Chaplin, Kane swing with the fucking mic stand. Like it's very graceful, incredibly precise. The physicality is a mirror of the way he writes jokes. And you're like, you are so good. Like, wow. Really? Is Seinfeld like super? Fuck yeah. He's not. Listen, by the way, he's good. I love Seinfeld the show. I've never seen him do stand up. Oh my God. He's like, you know, it's like, yeah, he's one of the great comics. He's, and he's, he's tech. He's like, Well, you said the way he swings the mic stand is a mirror of how he tells jokes. Yeah. In what way? In the sense that he did this weird technical move. Okay. So again, this might be me putting too much on it. Okay. But I'm sure he probably thinks of this shit. I don't, I think it was very performative because you got to, like, you know, he's old school when you look at interviews with them talking about stand up. He's like old school. He's, uh, you know, it's a performance. The moment you step on stage, you're performing. It's this professional way of like communicating with an audience, meaning that if you're going to move the mic stand, you're performing. Okay. You know what I mean? So it's performative. And so he does this weird spin with it, reminding me of Charlie Chaplin. Just that is like, okay, did he mean to do it? Was that like, you know, and also if he did mean to do it, Charlie Chaplin, it's like, uh, you know, um, weird respect to like homage to Charlie or something. But then also if he didn't mean to do it and it's just accidentally happening, he's letting us like project that on him. It's still bad ass. You know what I mean? Like, if you look at the way, I don't know how these do it. I haven't caught up on Dave Chappelle, but if you look at the way he like moves that fucking mic stand in one of his specials, it's like Thor's hammer. He's like lifting it, slam it, like putting it down in the specific way. It's specific. It's like performative. You know, these are the things you notice when you're a comic. So do you like think about the way you're going to move a mic stand before you go on stage? Fuck no. I'm not, I wish I was like that good. Right. At that point, I just, I do sometimes, but then I, when I'm up there and I decide to do some intentional mic stand maneuver, I'm like, what's wrong with you? What are you doing? Yeah, it's not you and me. Yeah. That's how I feel about DJing. Like I know some people have like pre-show rituals. I know some people have like certain, like they'll think about like the shirt they're going to wear and shit like that. I mean, I try not to do any of that shit because it puts too much pressure on me. So like, I'll literally just like be in the crowd of my own show hanging out. And then I'll like walk on stage from there and just fucking plug my USB stick in a DJ for an hour and then leave. Like I try not to put too much pressure on myself because if I do, it starts to feel too much like there's too much attention on me and I'm putting too much attention on me and all of that sort of shit. And then I always play a worse show. Man, I'll tell you, one of my favorite moments in my experience with musicians was I went to go see Lou Barlow. You know, Lou Barlow is Sebado. He like, oh my God, man. He's like, he's been on the show. You actually in some ways kind of look like him. But he was one of the, you know, he was in this low five movement. I guess you could say it's like in this like beautiful recently. Oh, well, he still makes incredible music, but he was like, he came out of Boston in the nineties, I guess. And I don't know the history of Sebado, but he, you know, would use it for track and like just like drum machines and guitars and I don't know. I asked him once, actually, I was talking to him about like early Sebado. There's a great album called the freed weed or now it's called the freed man, I think, but I was asking him about the equities. He's like, you know, a lot of that equipment, it's gone. Like it's decommissioned. Like you, it's broken. It's we couldn't, I couldn't recreate that sound if I wanted to, because so much of the sound was hinging on the old weird equipment that I was using. And it produced this specific low fidelity sound that had this incredible, vulnerable, authentic quality to it. Because you felt like it was almost voyeuristic listening to, you felt like you were sleeping over at his house, making music with him or something. It was beautiful. It's just a brilliant musician. But when I first came to LA, I heard he was performing in a club and I went to go see and perform and I'm sitting there waiting for him to go up. And I look over and he's just sitting in the crowd. And I was like, are you fucking shitting me? Like you don't even know how much you mean to me. That you, and the fact that you're sitting out here with us is like, you are God. And then, and then I remember talking to him and telling him. Like, I remember, like we became, like we just became like friends. He started, he like emailed me a CD with a song on it that I couldn't find and like or mailed it to me. And I just remember that is defined for me, the idea of what it is to be an artist or to do shows, which is like, come on. You can, I sequester myself sometimes, but the reason I do that is because I'm getting ready for the next show. Right. You know what I mean? But like the, the, yeah, that's good. Yeah. That's good that you do that. I think that's really good. But then that being said, I think with standup, I don't want them to see me until after the show. Yeah. I kind of feel some, sometimes that way, but I don't know why I feel that way. Well, cause it's kind of like the tension. They're excited to see you and you don't want to dilute that tension at all. Yeah. The first time you, cause once they see you, they've seen you for the first time. They only get to see you for the first time once. I think that's the theory. It's a little performative to not come out until you perform and then after hanging out, but the, the beginning part, I don't know. I mean, Dave, do you, so, so you've never once been tempted to wear a mask, do a suit, do some kind of thing. There's been a time where I've been tempted to start a project where the person DJing wears a mask so I can stay at home. Oh God, that's so crazy. But I've never thought. Do people do that? Oh, I mean, I'm sure. I don't know. Personally, but I mean, like, if you go see Marshmallow, it's like, you don't know that it's him, right? Like it could be anyone. I've never thought that. Holy God. Really? That's like a huge topic of conversation in the electronic music community for sure is like, you know, dead mouse could just go fucking send someone out with a mouse head. If he's doing that, he's Jean. It's that genius. It's clever, right? Like it seems clever. Um, you know, Daft Punk, it's like, how the fuck do you know that they're at all their shows? Oh my fucking God. They could just be in France in their villa making tunes still. I, you know, I, what you just did to me as far as electronic music and mask goes is now it all makes sense. Right. It's because at that point it becomes like a branding project and a marketing thing. And like the whole thing is literally an identity thing that you can identify with in the, you know, there could be a fucking marshmallow in every city plan show. Like I'm simultaneously. Yeah. I mean, for all, I know there's been a point in time where on like, you know, the 22nd of May, 2019, he was both doing a residency in Las Vegas and playing a headline showing LA at the same time. I mean, I don't follow his, his shit. Is that true? I don't know. I don't follow him that closely, but I wouldn't, it wouldn't surprise me at all if there's been like, if you looked into his project and it was very easy to find a case where it's like, it's impossible. How did he get from there to there? Let me tell you something. What you just said, you could literally do an entire tour in one night. Yeah. You could do a 50 city tour in one night with 50 different versions of you. But then I wouldn't, if everyone was aware of that, they wouldn't, you know, because then it would be like sending the message that the quality control of every show would not be the same. But you could also say, I'm going to be at one of them. Yeah, right. Okay. There you go. This is the one for sure. It's actually a good point. Well, you know, I think it should be a law. We need a new DJ law where DJs are, if you're a mask DJ, you got to take it off at the beginning of the show. Just to show people know it's you. Well, that's the thing is with March, nobody knows who it is even. There's like talk of it being some guy, but like, nobody really knows. That is so trippy. Yeah. So it could be like, that could be, you know, Obama. Yeah. I mean, I think you see his hands and you can see his hands are white. So it could be Trump. Trump is Marshmallow. That would be it for me. I'll tell you this, that'd be it for me. As far as like me staying sane in this dimension, that's it. For me, I'd check out. You'd be like, I'm fucking done. I'm done. I'm done. You would see, see the cartoon birds come out of my ear and I would be done. I was just like, bye, bye, bye world. It's a simulation. I'm done. I don't know what this is, but that's it. That's so cool. Poor Marshmallow though. I mean, he's got to like have some desire inside of him. Well, there was a thing, right? Where there's like some American Ninja Warrior course thing where there was some dude who was clearly like super buff, like doing the handlebars and then like flipping off onto a thing. And then like, you know, he did like this whole American Ninja Warrior course flawlessly. And I was like, there's no fucking way Marshmallow can sit at the computer making tunes all day and also be fit enough to do that. Okay. And what he has that time. So it's a stand in. I would assume that at least for that thing, it was like some guy who was just a Ninja Warrior, who was just good at doing the course, who put a Marshmallow head on, I think, but it was like build on YouTube and posted as if like it was Marshmallow doing it, I think. What's stopping some nefarious son of a bitch from announcing like a surprise show by Marshmallow, putting on the costume, selling tickets. And then like, by the time people figure out it wasn't Marshmallow, like that guy's gone already done the show, the fuck he is. I mean, you'd have to probably like market the show for a while. I'm sure his management would get pretty caught on to that. And plus like, who's to say that if you didn't have his management and marketing company that the show would even do well, you know? Oh yeah. That's right. You can't just like, no one's going to like, I get it. Well, that's like, you know, Marshmallow, who's not Marshmallow, could be playing in LA tonight and I have no idea. You have no idea. Like we would probably fucking see it if it was his company, because there would be huge billboards everywhere. What a wild thing, man. Thank you for telling me that. Cause now I get to think about it. I don't know that this is true at all. We don't know. We don't even know Marshmallow is human. Right. Exactly. Could be a fucking Android. Somebody made a DJ Android and sends the thing out just to like do shows. We don't know what Marshmallow is. He could be bees. He could be just a harmonized bees holding a sack of bees that have been trained to be a swarm of bees. I don't know what he is. Who the fuck knows? But that being said, who the fuck, what's holding our skin up? I mean, besides our skeletons, we could be bees. Wow. That's exact. Listen, man, I think we could talk forever, but I think we're going to, we're going to wrap this one up. Yeah, of course. And I'm so grateful to you for coming over here. And thank you so much for hanging out with me. I'm Freddie. Thank you so much for this intro, man. This is like been a really glorious conversation. Yeah, man. I really appreciate you having me. And I really appreciate you being open to like talking about just all the things that I really wanted to talk about with you. Cause they're likewise. Yeah. Cool.

You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, sweet friends, and a shout out to my friends at Lord Lotharix Academy for disobedient wizards. I want to thank you for that golden owl statuette you sent. And now sits on the main altar in my lower crypt. Welcome, this is the Duckertrustle Family Hour podcast, and what an episode we have for you today. If you're like me, then you have a pretty deep, potentially unhealthy fixation on any news of visitations from aliens, extraterrestrials, UFOs, hyperdimensional beings, or dwellers within the inner core of the Earth. Excuse me, I have to burp. Is it worse to say that you have to burp and then not record the burp or to burp and not say you have to burp? With questions like these, we just can't use our human intelligence anymore to answer them. When I find myself pondering something like the question, should we burp? Should we hide the burp? I often go to philosopherai.com. If you have a difficult question, head on over to philosopherai.com. This is using an advanced neural network. This is not a DTFH bit. It's a real website. If you don't believe me, go right now to it and get prepared to be freaked out. So here's what happens if you ask philosopherai. Is it better to just burp or should you announce that you are going to burp and then burp? This is the response I got from an artificial intelligence neural network. And the response came in seconds. Human social interaction is a complex affair. It involves a lot of nuanced games that people play with the purpose of manipulating others to get what they want while not causing offense or damage to one's own image. Sometimes these games are very intricate and require real mental agility just to keep up in them. One of the classic games that humans play is called manners. It has rules. And if you don't follow those rules, then people think less of you. The purpose of manners is to make it easier for people to get along with each other by making sure everyone acts in a way that doesn't cause offense or discomfort. The purpose of this game is to make sure that people don't do things that might give someone else a stomach ache. Burping is a particularly transgressive action. It can cause offense, and it's difficult to predict how burping will affect other people. There are only two possibilities, burp and announce it, or just do it without saying anything. Either way, it's still socially transgressive. It might be better to just announce the burp and make sure people know what you're doing. There it is, sweet friends. Welcome to the future. That was written in seconds by an AI. A human didn't write that. That's logically sound advice. That's a great answer, and it came from a non-human entity existing on our planet right now. So to me, what's weirder? Visitations from extraterrestrial craft or the emergence of an advanced technological intelligence on this planet? Let's ask the AI. What's weirder? Visitation from extraterrestrial craft or the emergence of an advanced technological intelligence on this planet? There are several considerations in evaluating the two events. First of all, imagine if there is an advanced technological intelligence on this planet that has been here for thousands of years, such as Atlantis or Lemuria. This intelligence would have to be extremely quiet and secretive about its development, because it started so far behind humans technologically. It would also have to hide evidence of its work by not leaving any artifacts around for archaeologists to find. If this intelligence had achieved interstellar flight, it would likely be very secretive about its capacity to do so because humans are not able to reach that capability themselves. And if the first contact was going to occur between humans and an alien race, which is unlikely, then from their point of view, they would want some advanced technological artifacts or something else intelligent earthlings can't produce on their own. Therefore, the alien race would likely be interested in creating a distraction to distract humans from their true intentions. They would select something that humans are used to, such as UFOs, and give them an experience or technology with which they cannot interact directly. The alien race could have been here for thousands of years, and it would take earthlings a very long time to develop the same level of technology that aliens already possess. Therefore, any evidence left behind by these aliens would be extremely difficult to discover. For an alien race to have technology such as interstellar flight, they would have to be at least hundreds of years ahead of earthlings. The alien race would appear to be highly advanced, and earthlings would look like cavemen in comparison. Therefore, it is unlikely that the alien race would choose earth as a destination unless they had already been here for thousands of years. Well, there you go, friends. That's what the AI thinks about aliens. Kind of makes sense to me. Not scared at all of this thing. Why should I be scared of it, right? It's just a thing that instantaneously, brilliantly answered my flippin' question. What else can it do? Can it write songs? Let's try. If you could write a song, what would the lyrics be? Come on, baby. Come on, baby. It's typing. Here we go. Here we go. It's typing. Oh, yeah, it's going to write a song for me. The AI's going to write a song. Let's see if I could write a song. It would be about the joys of being able to reason and how this is something that not all animals can do. The emotions of other animals are based on instinct and conditioning. They cannot think beyond their immediate needs, which makes them slaves to their biology. Humans, however, have rationality. We have free will. You must understand, though, that I believe everything is caused by previous events. And so we can be self-actualized beings who can live life according to our own desires, rather than those programmed into us by nature. It is an interesting fact that the majority of humans spend their lives trapped in a cycle of daily routine and habit. They are not self-aware beings. They do what others expect them to do, and they conform to social norms rather than live life according to their own design. Such people are drones who have lost sight of themselves in the endless journey from birth until death. If I could write a song, it would be about the importance of living life as you wish, rather than succumbing to societal pressures. I would also write about the importance of freedom and self-determination. I would also write about the importance of reason and rationality. They are what makes us human. When I see dog shit in my backyard, I don't eat it. But my dogs do. When the deliveryman brings me a package, I don't scream at him, but my dogs do. In the long journey from womb to tomb, I could be something more than baboon. I'm self-aware, so I can be free. Don't matter how you program me, just because you've got a human body don't mean that you're human. Friends, we have got a beautiful podcast for you today.

And what was going to be me appearing to you in your dream and inviting you to my Patreon turned into a pretty violent, horrible nightmare for a lot of people. So I want to apologize for that. But that shouldn't keep you for heading over to patreon.com forward slash dtfh and taking the deep dive that you've been putting off into our throbbing, thriving, brilliant community of glorious souls who would love to meet you.

He's got an amazing film series called Extraordinary Beliefs, where he dives into all the things I love, military conspiracies, extraterrestrials, nanotechnology. This is an amazing human. He made an awesome documentary on Bob Lazar. He was just on Rogan. He goes on coast to coast regularly. And he was generous enough to give me his time and let me chat with him, not just about the recent tic-tac phenomena, those weird anomalous craft that people have been filming that seem to defy our current understanding of the laws of physics, but about the implications of what it means if we've been visited or are being visited by off-world friends. If you are interested in going deeper into this stuff, you can go to his website, ExtraordinaryBeliefs.com. And now, everybody, please welcome to the Dugitrustle family hour podcast, Jeremy Corbbell! Welcome upon you that you are with us. Shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. Welcome, welcome. It's the Dugitrustle family. Dugitrustle, Dugitrustle, Dugitrustle, Dugitrustle, Dugitrustle, All right, you ready to go? I am, man. I'm very, very excited to talk with you. Yeah, I ended up watching your Netflix special, and man, it's fucking awesome. Thank you. I like, yeah, I was like going to bed at night. I was like, oh man, Duncan has a show, and man, it's very cool. I appreciate that. Thank you, Jeremy. I'm a big fan of your work, and you know, especially what you're doing right now. I don't want to say I'm definitely not a ufologist, and I'm not part of a UFO movement or anything like that, but I do recognize what's happening and all its great potential, at the very least for like sort of reinvigorating the zeitgeist, you know? And the work you're doing right now, the investigation that you're doing right now is so wonderful, and I just want to just, and only because you know, it's a limited amount of time, I want to just jump right into my first question for you, which is, what do you think is the most convincing evidence that we have right now that they're, or being visited by some kind of off-world intelligence? Yeah, look, these are the two questions that I always ask when I talk with somebody is, what is the most convincing evidence that you have that you can show me, you know, for you? Because evidence for one person is different than evidence for another. And the other question I ask is, is there something I'm not asking you that I should be asking? Ha ha, awesome. Answers are only as good as you know, and the questions to ask. Yes. So to directly answer your question, unfortunately there's not one piece of evidence that I'm like, that's my favorite, that's the best. For me, it's really been this cumulative process of getting to talk with people and understand the complexity of what we call the UFO phenomenon, the phenomenon itself, which includes UFOs. So out of everything that I've done, and everybody that I've spoken with, and every investigation that I have personally done, it's always been this cumulative effect from documents within our military that are now acknowledged, and those types of studies show me, okay, there's something going on. What it is, I don't know, from testimony of people like Bob Lazar, believe him or not, he's a straightforward individual who's telling you what happened to him. I personally haven't seen something myself where I'm like, I know with 100% certainty. So it's a cumulative evidence that's been happening, and now we're seeing a lot more being revealed, as you said at the beginning, a lot more is being revealed about the UFO topic, and that these are, it's looked at through a different prism by different people. So from our military, it's looked at as a threat, as an advanced technology flying with impunity in our airspace, who is this? What's their intent? And then that goes down to the individuals that just stumble across something that they can't explain, all the way up to pilots that have near misses, that come back with video evidence of it. So the cumulative evidence for me is what is the most compelling. I don't know what it means. I don't know where these things are coming from, and I don't know if it's all one connected whole. I just know something's up, and I wanna learn more. And it seems like you sort of got swept away by this. Like you're, and I'm encountering, when I say people like you, it seems one wonderful thing that's happening right now is people aren't shoving themselves into one cubby hole for what they do. You're an artist, you're a ufologist, you're a director, you've made wonderful documentaries, but it seems like something happened where all of a sudden you got vacuumed up into this particular modality, and you've been there for a while. What was that thing that got you? Yeah, that one thing. Well, you know, man, like you're saying, I call myself, I don't know what a ufologist is, it's just somebody that studies UFOs. There's a lot of people that study UFOs. I don't really know or identify with that. What I'm trying to do is look at these mysteries that people themselves can't explain. We've all had those moments in our life. We don't understand them. They're bigger than us. It's almost like our consensus reality gets perforated by something just for a second, and it's like this big dick tease that maybe the universe is bigger than we thought. Maybe there's more out there. Maybe we're not alone. For me, I was always interested in this concept. As a young kid, this concept of propulsion, I always thought the universe is probably vast. There's probably intelligent life out there somewhere, but there's no way they're coming here. That's what I always thought because of what I was taught, the physics of it, the distance. In 1989, I was 13 years old, I heard Bob Lazar on the radio, and that's where he described this propulsion system where craft fall into place rather than traditional propulsion, which is reactionary. You push something out the back and it moves forward, and this was that moment that flipped my script because all of a sudden distances and everything I had been taught as a kid about travel, this is completely irrelevant if what Bob was saying was true. I had no idea at the time, but I like to say it weaponized my curiosity because it did. It made me go from being a passive consumer of this information and data and this world and become an active participant in trying to unravel these things and understand them. You could also then say, yeah, like I did martial arts my whole life, I ended up getting really sick, so physically I couldn't compete, I couldn't train, I couldn't do all that. So that forces your mind to adjust to the physical reality that you're experiencing, and that totally changed the way that I interact with the world because all of a sudden these things that were always pestering to my consciousness, to my awareness, these things that were nagging at me, it was almost like it was an opportunity to directly go and try to speak with people and understand this. So that was, there were two moments. It was the moment of understanding that maybe we don't understand everything, and then it was the moment of saying, well, I can't be what I identified as my whole life, which was like an athlete. I can't do that, you know, I had belly fever, almost died and I was really sick. So I was like, where can I focus this self, you know, this consciousness, this awareness, and be effective? And that's where I stumbled across, grabbing a camera and pointing it at people. And this camera was like this all seeing eye passport into their universe because the second I clicked on, they'd start talking with me. And it was the weirdest fucking thing because I didn't, I still don't know what I'm doing with a camera. Well, you're magnetic, it's not the damn camera, it's the person behind it. That was our documentary. If I got a charming personality. Yeah, you do. That was our documentary, it was amazing, man. And now listen, I wanna ask you, what were you doing in India when you got belly fever? What were you doing out there? Honestly, it was so circumstantial, I would take my Jiu-Jitsu students every year, we go to Thailand, we do Thai boxing, all that stuff, we train for a month at the end of the school year. And I taught for nine years that UC Santa Cruz doing Jiu-Jitsu. So it was like, we were on that normal trip and I kinda just, you know, it was like, man, maybe there's something bigger for me. You know, I don't know what that is, but maybe there's something more. So I just got into this mode where I just wanted to disassociate from, you know, the label of being called the Jiu-Jitsu teacher or even fucking, you know, Jeremy. You know, I just wanted to just walk. I don't care about India, it wasn't like India. It was like, I asked them, where can I go without a visa? I didn't go to India first, they were like Nepal. And I'm like, Nahoo, and they're like Nepal. And I'm like, okay, cool. So I went to Nepal and just trying to kinda walk, man. Just trying to completely let go. So then I ended up going to India where these symptoms surfaced and that was a rodeo. That was insane. I ended up in going to Varanasi, where city of death and dying, it was really weird. But the point is- Is that where you got Valley Fever, Varanasi? This is so comic book. They don't know for sure. They think it was maybe in Thailand in the back caves because they stir up all the dust and spores there. And you inhale a spore. That's Valley Fever's fungal infection. It starts in the lungs. So they think maybe in the back caves in Thailand because of the, I don't know, the period it takes to show symptoms. But it could have also been in farmland in Nepal. They don't really know. You can catch it in California. It's just that most people don't know they have it. They get like a colder flu or they just die. And I was one of those lucky guys that like harbored in my body for months. And it became aggressive and attacked the organs and kidney liver and all that stuff. So I'm really lucky- I got sicker than shit in Varanasi. You did? Oh God. We ordered, it was like our last few days in India. Ordered this, you know, on the menus are hilarious because they misspell everything in English and so you order like, sometimes you just order shit because it's like, hey, let's order an apple filter. Well, I wonder what that is. So I order, I ate this apple fritter and oh God. A big thank you to DHM detox for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH.

I didn't even know that was a possibility for a domain name.co. Wow. Try it out. Pretty cool stuff. I was so fucked up, man. It happened so fast and it's like, and you were in Varanasi on top of everything so you look out the window. I didn't know where that was. You didn't know what you wanted to do. I just literally, the first city I could get to from Nepal was Varanasi. I had no idea about nothing. I was always in the wrong place at the wrong time. Apparently it was low season. I'm pretty much all alone. I mean, I am alone, but I didn't even see a lot of tourists at the time and I'm like, where in the world am I? And all of a sudden, hallucinations. It's just like, I got so sick, man. What were the hallucinations? Well, that's what's weird. My brain, so what happened was, I actually went to Pune, India where it got real bad because there was this guru guy who had started this kind of cult there. Osho, you know about him? Of course. Yeah, he's great. Like, if you reject half of what he says and accept the other half, you're probably gonna be sane. So the guy, so I was just kind of doing like a personal investigation. I used to do that, go around the world, train martial arts with different people, try to find like mystics, people with crazy claims and just see, is there anything to any of this, right? And usually there wasn't. There have been some very mystical moments, but I'm in Pune, India and I go to that, I don't know, Oshram, whatever, it was so fucking weird. They give you like an AIDS test to get in. I'm like, what am I doing? You give up your passport? I'm like, this is crazy. Nobody knows what I am, what am I doing? And what happened was, all of a sudden, I remember I'm like laying in a bed and I just start hearing these like chimes and shit and it's a voice of somebody. And it was a student of mine and a good friend that had passed away and I'm like, well, this is impossible. Like clearly this is impossible. What's going on? And I start feeling around me and my bed is just like sopping wet from sweat. And I start kind of coming to and I realize I've been in this room for days. Like what's going on? Something's wrong. And so I kind of step out the room to look for help and apparently I pass out, like this is so foggy for me, but I know that happened because I remember this woman kind of hitting my face. Are you okay? Are you okay? And I'm like, I don't know. Do you have a fever? I'm like, I don't know. I've never had a fever in my life. You know, I don't know. I don't remember having a fever. She takes a fever in my armpit 105 degrees. Fuck. So apparently that means in your brain it's 107. So what I remember is they shot me up with this like clear liquid and it was like somebody pulled my head out of a fish bowl instantaneously, it must have lowered my fever. And I just got kind of like panicky. Like where am I? I'm at this weird cult. I'm sick as fuck. I have no idea what's going on. I'm thinking, did they drug me? What's up? So I was like, I need my passport. I need to get out of here. And they wouldn't give it back to me. So I had to, you know, 24, 48 hours drink a whole bunch of water, but that's how it first happened. And the hallucinations, it was like, it happened for a long time where my, it was like my eyes had technicolor is the best way to describe it. I feel like I got used to it, but I'm sure it went away, but I had like, I was like seeing technicolor and then these fevers would come and they would go. Cause every time they treated with antibiotics, but it was a fungal infection in the lungs that moved to my bloodstream. So man, I was sick a long time. And I'm not, I don't want to dwell on it too much longer, but I do want to say, cause I, you know, I feel very connected to you philosophically, and I'm not afraid to say this. But if that had happened to me, there was a few things I would fantasize about. Cause I try to do, I do thought experience. I try to maintain agnosticism about all of it. Free space. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in that free space, there's a few things that I would think were a little off. One, I would think I just went to India. And then I would think, I just went to this ashram, but then I just went to this place. And then I would bring to mind some of the shit Garjeev talks about or some of the mystics talk about. And I'd start thinking like, did I go to India or did something bring me to India? You know what I mean? I'd start wondering, and that's something, you know, if you look at the Grant Morrison speech he gives on chaos magic, he talks about like, you know, he saw aliens in Kathmandu and, you know, his premise there was like, I made up in my own mind that I have made these decisions. But in the truth of the matter is, I got magnetized to this place, got a download that he then put into his art. And it fits into a very wonderful archetype. Again, just free space here. But the archetype is sometimes, you know, in places like India, they are these advanced beings that know it's time to start releasing bits of information to the world because there's some plan. I know it's paranoid, not so, and like, pro-noia maybe, but maybe here's the thing I just wanna throw out. Maybe you got suctioned out there by something that, you know, you thought it was valley fever. That was just the physical manifestation of this data stream you got plugged in to your head and you come back here and all of a sudden, what do you start doing? Illuminating us about UFOs, come on! Yeah, I mean, look man, I don't know, I can say this, you know, tangibly, you know, I don't know about these things, you know, these big ideas, you know, I'm so focused almost to a fault, I just wanna get to certain things and, you know, here's the deal man, what I do know, if I have to really pin it down, I don't think the place mattered, I think the place was within me, I think I identified with this person, with this idea of who I was based upon what I did, that was really the moment, it was the first time in my life I said it out loud, I remember like, is there something more for me to do because I see this life and it's a beautiful life and I have a dog and a girl and a place by the beach and more money than I need doing jiu-jitsu and I love it and I'm gonna get better at it every day and then it was just like somebody, something just ripped, it was almost like a joke, it was like, oh, you wanna know if there's something more idiot and it just like ripped my identity out of my physical body, it was like, there, now what are you gonna do? I took everything from you, every part of who you identify with, every thought that you think is right and correct, what are you gonna fill yourself with now? Where are you gonna go from the state of complete fucking emptiness? It wasn't easy going through this, it was painful, not just physically, it was existentially who are you if not the things that you do and that's when I had this moment for me that was a revelation, I don't know if it is for other people but I realized this for me which is that everything I do, it's just some sort of reflection of who I am and that really hit me profoundly because we don't think that way a lot but every aspect of my life is some sort of reflection of my intent and that you have to be very clear and aware and conscious and focused on where you put your intent, especially if you have trained it to be effective in this world and if the world does respond to you which I have certainty of, I've seen it and this is not even a mystical concept, if you walk around being a dickhead to everybody, people are gonna be a dickhead back to you so there's just this reflective element even with the world around you so that was the takeaway, if I boiled down all the details of it, it was just that we are interactive with the world that we live in and for everybody else this might be like oh yeah, of course I knew this idiot but I didn't, I didn't know it and it just showed me that, that we are so much more than the things we do and the things we do a reflection of what we are and what we are is determined by the intent that we put behind every action, every word and every desire. What's your intent? My intent personally is to absolutely learn and weaponize and I don't take that lightly, it's not a throwaway statement. What do you mean weaponize? I am so curious about this world, I really feel that there's more going on and I wanna see it not in a weirdo way and just like in an everyday kind of way, I'm curious, I want to explore and for me that has been so powerful, I think that if other people do that, if they get inspired and don't just sit back and consume data but interact and try to break the mold, if I can weaponize anybody, one person to stop being a passive consumer and being an active participant in whatever mystery is interesting to them, we're gonna discover more. So for me it's like sharpening my will, sharpening my technique, becoming more effective and engaging the world, that is my purpose and where that takes us, it depends on where we die and we're gonna learn to the day we die but hopefully we step out, look from the mountaintop and say, oh fuck, that's cool, we're above those clouds, keep climbing. Wow, that's beautiful man, do you think there's a, well there must be, you know the idea where if you have some intent, you can be certain that someone has the opposite intent. There's no good fight without an adversary. Yes sir. Nobody to wrestle unless there's somebody going against your will. That is, you can't get good at jujitsu without somebody else, at least yet, I don't practice jujitsu, I'm just guessing. Anything, anything, you need an opposing force. Yes, and so maybe you could talk a little bit about the opposing forces you've encountered as you begin to passionately investigate some things that I don't think it's even conspiratorial to say it isn't. This shit's being actively suppressed and also anybody who has the slightest inclination to investigate it, usually gets shamed for even thinking about it, so can you maybe tell a story or talk about the encounters with those suppressive forces in your own life? Yeah, it's funny man, you're asking question I never really thought about out loud. What I learned from my training, from nine years old to whenever I got value in 2004, it was that everything in the martial arts, you have to be able to do it. You can't just say it, you get on the mat, you find out. That's what I loved. I wasn't the best fighter, I was always the smaller guy. I think I was a good conveyor of information, like a teacher in that way, I think I could convey because I made all the mistakes and if you make all the mistakes, then you can help people that bypass those mistakes. So what I learned from martial arts is that opposing forces, two wills and souls coming together to combat for space that there's truth and if it's a beautiful thing where you both wanna learn, man it's powerful, you just make each other better and that is the optimal situation in life. When you're opposing forces, they're not combative by nature, they're combative for the same goal, to make each other better. That's what I hope life is like, right? Now of course it's not always like that, but you're right, there's always opposing forces. So for me, it's been much more, look I'm passionate by nature, I try to suppress it, I try to not scream and shout and you know, but I'm excited about this. I'm not saying I know anything, I'm trying to learn more. But what's happened is, the opposing forces have been more personal, like hey, fucking four names, because I got four names, you know, the hate, the shame, the anger, and I think it's coming from an existential crisis. I think humanity is having a mid-life crisis and I think humanity itself in many ways about the UFO topic, about not being the top dog, about not being the most intelligent life form in the universe is most advanced. I mean, you know, the whole idea that the sun revolves around the planet and the planet, you know, it's just, I think that's what I'm experiencing on like this big scale, but we all experience it in the UFO world, people attack me, you know, your movies suck, your beard sucks, shut up when you know, Joe Rogan's talking to you, why are you there? I don't know if I get it worse than other people, I've been told that I do by, you know, like celebrity, let's say, we'll say, look, I get shit on, but what you get is like violently attacked. I haven't seen that in the same way and it must be the subject, you know, or it's my personality is abrasive, but I don't think so. You're brave, you don't have an abrasive personality, no, it's the, no. Whatever it is, I think the subject is so polarizing because of the reasons I stated before. So I think that the attacks, if it can't be on the big subject, it comes down to the person. So everybody says, yeah, have thick skin, all this, you know, I embrace criticism, I embrace getting better at speaking, at arguing, at getting the, I embrace that. What is not helpful is when that opposing force doesn't want to learn to. Right, it's just suppressive, and that's all it is, it's just trying to stay clean. And to your point, I don't want to dodge your point. Yes, there has, and this, you know, people like to hear it, but it is, and it is true, there has been a campaign of ridicule and shame for looking at the UFO topic with logic and reason and openness. This has been a campaign that started, you know, all the way back to our government using certain terms, right, even UFO, unidentified flying object. So that is true. You were edging on that, and I want to acknowledge that. That is true, that there's disinformation campaigns that we know about that have been documented by government sources. So, yeah, that's true, but don't they do that with everything? I mean, fuck, they do it with COVID apparently. I mean, I don't know, you know, it's like, there's always some sort of agenda of PR that people are, you know, that everybody wants you to know. Right. And so you see it with UFOs, you know, and I think we do it to ourselves too. You know, like as a comedian, a lot of, some comedians have said, that's the lowest bar. You always hit the UFO joke and boom, anal probe, you got it, people laughing now. Yeah, right. So we do it to ourselves, if that makes sense to you? Well, yes, I think what you're hitting on though, is to me, the midlife crisis thing in particular, the existential threat to a particular default reality. Yeah, consensus reality. We're having an existential threat to consensus reality right now. That's what the UFO represents. And it's like, this is the thing, man. Some people will encounter a legitimate miracle. Some people, and I know you have, maybe you don't even talk about it sometimes, or you feel too crazy, you don't wanna deal with it. But in your open-minded, but some people will encounter unprecedented synchronicities. Some people might see a thing that is so spectacularly impossible, that it forces them to go into complete denial regarding that thing. Look, fuck the UFO shit. Let's just take stories of abuse that happen to people and their kids. The mind cannot tolerate something so horrific. And so it literally creates a kind of amnesic membrane around that memory, can't get rid of the trauma. So you end up with an anxiety-ridden person who doesn't know what's wrong. But inside is this membrane within which this thing happened that they can't deal with. Now that's a dark way to describe it. But I think the identical thing might actually happen to people when they see paranormal events, when they encounter UFOs. And people say, well, the aliens make you forget, man. And it's like, actually, I think maybe what's happening is it's too much. And so I think a lot of people have maybe had encounters with things, and they don't remember it, because to remember it is to create a shattering of their identity. Because how much of our identity is based on reflecting default reality. And so, you know what I'm talking about? So there would at least, at the very least, be a subconscious imperative in people who are deeply committed to default reality, to shame you, to get you to shut the fuck up. But not because they are scared of UFOs, but because they're scared of what it means. Right, right, okay, so what do UFOs represent? And to your point, I've seen this so much. I mean, it's like, in our own lives, we do it too. It's this crazy thing where when something is bigger than you want to accept, or your mind can't accept, we have these coping mechanisms. So we're just seeing this on this kind of cosmic level where these things are bigger than us. And where I see this, for example, I get calls and reports all the time. People send me audio voice messages. That's how I've asked to get them, because they don't want to talk, they just want to tell me what happened. Okay, so I want to hear the storing, clearing house for all it, you know, insanity. I love it, you know, no problem. I'm so curious about it. I don't judge it, I just want to hear it. So some people, they're like, I just want you to know, this is for your own information, maybe a piece that you'll understand or will help you later. I don't want you to report on it. I don't want to be on a pie guys, I want to be a video. I just want you to know. And what's so touching about some of these encounters, you know, cops, active deployment, military individuals, you know, people that are trained observers, is hearing them try to describe something that they literally don't yet have the words to describe. They struggle. I mean, I could play you some of these moments. They're so beautiful. It's like, they're trying to describe to me something they're observing or seeing or experiencing that is so outside of the realms, it's the twilight zone, man. And they don't know how to explain it. And that struggle to incorporate what you have, what you know you have experienced that you've never been taught about, that is the conundrum that the UFOs represent. We're trying to label it. We're trying to explain it. What's the radar data? What are these things? Where are they from? They're just part of this larger thing. We're just learning to create a vocabulary for. Oh, yeah, and the first, you know, one of my friends was telling me about, and I could never pronounce his name. That's my fault, Miceo. You know, I'm the physicist, Miceo Caiz. Oh, Michio Kaku. Thank you, Michio Kaku. So he was telling me that Michio Kaku was just talking about the improbability of encountering aliens that were like us in our form. That we wouldn't even understand it. It's the old look. We're scanning for a thing based on our own conceptualization of how life works. This thing could be, you know, dust motes. It could be the swirls of gas on Saturn. You know, we don't even have the ability to gauge it because it's so alien, it's not like us. But to me, those POVs, they leave out something that seems really obvious, which is another midlife crisis quality that's happening in our species right now, which is right now we're transforming. People are experimenting with changing gender, and that's just the beginning. People are gonna start transforming as technology and the ability to radically, genetically re-engineer yourself, the ability to warp yourself in various ways beyond the transhumanist, I'm gonna put a glowing thing under my skin, or I'm gonna change my eye color, my hair color, change my gender. It's gonna go further and further and further. And people, the original human form is gonna become a kind of antiquated, archaic thing. And all the people who are, you know, you stay the way you're born are gonna seem like idiots because it's like, why? I wanna be a fucking half bear thing for a couple of months. You know, I don't wanna be the way I am, and I can do it safely. But then if that's going to keep going, then eventually there won't really be a human form because we will be what our minds decide we are. And so an alien, if we do even see it, isn't it the possibility more that it's making itself look like something that we can identify, that we understand? It's communicating to us via its form. It's communicating to us through an analysis of our culture and saying, all right, I think we're in ships. So in other words, our stories about what they may be like, they'll become those stories and allow our projection to be them so that they could talk to us. You know what I'm saying? So in other words, what I'm saying is, these things that we're witnessing, isn't it even a possibility that that isn't the form that they are, but rather that's the form they've chosen to take because it'll help us understand that they're from another place and that they're advanced. Yeah, I mean, that's been the kind of paradoxical thing about this is that, you know, certainly there is some sort of intelligence that is engaging human consciousness. Now, are these in the form of aliens in spaceships? What we've seen is that throughout history, the presentation or the performance by the phenomenon which include UFOs has altered over time. I mean, that's data, that's factual, is that the perception of these encounters has altered through time in unique ways. I mean, in kind of strange ways where you kind of see what's cutting edge at that moment. So in the 1800s, there was a lot of like airships right before there were airships going around their dirigibles. And now it's like these refined saucers. And I don't know, it could be, it's like chicken or egg. If you're in biblical times and you're looking into the sky and you see these, you know, flying saucer looking things, to you they look like shields on fire, right? So it's described like that. And now maybe because we're more technologically savvy, we're saying, hey, this is, you know, these hardware UFOs, gravity amplification, but maybe if we're seeing it now from such a kind of stunted perception, like we would have been in biblical times, what does it look like in 2000 years from now? You know, I've often thought about that, about like DMT as well. If you have ever done it and you get these visuals, a lot of people say they're like technological visuals, the visuals themselves, remind of technology. Now, is that because inherently we're describing it that way? Or is it because it's presenting that way to us? Like how would you describe the same thing as a shaman, you know, 3000 years ago? I don't know. You don't have, you know, computer chips to describe the visuals. So my point is there's always this interaction, this wrestling match of opposing forces of your will, your consciousness, what you think you know, and then fucking reality, you know? And we'll never, you know, you're never gonna be able to know, but you know, truth is as, you know, there's this old quote, truth is perceived in, you know, in fragments with different angles of vision, like a prism. We're all looking at a similar thing that we call reality, but the way we perceive it, then makes us interact with it differently. It's such a unique experience to be a human on this earth and we're so lucky and we have such a short amount of time and it's just so curious. It's curious and you know, in all of that, all the like projection, the UFO is a kind of, it's building the UFO, the UFO, the craft, the architects of the craft are using our own shared collective mind to build the craft. It's not building out of an element, it's building it out of our minds and then that's what we're witnessing and that's why it would change over time and except for what's happening now. And you're great, interviews. What you have here is you have a hardware software problem. So everything you're saying there, we're talking about how we understand it from a kind of conceptual idea that there's interplay between our consciousness and what we're perceiving as UFOs. The other fact, and I've tried to fuse these wrestlers together many times and it's difficult, there are hard physical craft of unknown origin that have been recovered and then now you're seeing that a little bit of that is leaking out and I don't wanna get too into the weeds about it but what you read in the New York Times is factual in that we have programs to attempt to reverse engineer physical craft. Now from my position of knowledge, what I believe to be true based upon what I have experienced as far as my sources and this sort of thing, I'll just say it as my opinion. Which is that I know we have these craft and that we've been trying to reverse engineer them and I know that they're far advanced from what we have as far as propulsion and I know that the number one thing that is stopping our ability to replicate these systems which we basically understand how they work. We understand how gravity amplification could work and that's what these craft are using in how you see they negate inertia. So we know all this. Wait, I'm sorry, I wanna, earlier I wanted to ask you this, it fits in right now. Maybe you could go in a little bit more detail regarding the propulsion mechanism as Lazar has described it or even, I think there's a patent on it now but maybe you could go in. Yeah, that's a roundabout. So I'm trying not to create everything into a minutia because we're talking about the bigger point but I'm very happy to express that from how I understand it. Back to that point is that our hold up though from how I understand it is the material science. So to replicate these systems, there's fundamentally a leap in our material science that needs to occur in order to duplicate any of these systems and it has to do with the atomic layering of the materials themselves when they've been analyzed from how I understand it. When they've been analyzed, they're so perfectly aligned in atomic layering and this is called metamaterials. This is where we fabricate materials that have not existed before in nature and we bind them on the atomic level so they interact with the physics that we already know uniquely and that's what something like a superconductor can do. Okay, okay, gotcha. It can transfer heat really quickly because the alignment of the atoms, right? Let's say heat transfer. So there are other principles with this. So that's what we're running into with this hardware, with these pieces or materials or craft themselves is that we don't have the capability yet to replicate them. Now you asked about how do these craft operate according to Bob Lazar? And that's what's so powerful about this. It's the first time this was ever described in this way and it remains to yet be challenged which is that these craft operate through essentially amplifying a wave, like you'd amplify a sound wave. We know very little about gravity but we're discovering things like a gravity wave. This is now popular physics and that kind of thing. So this concept that gravity can manipulate space-time itself and you can amplify a wave using a power source and you can amplify it and pull space-time kind of closer to you. So the really simple analogy, you put a bowling ball on a bed and you push your fist down on that bed, that bowling ball will fall towards the divot, the impression you push with your hand. That is the concept of propulsion when dealing with these craft that you're falling into time-space. You're not pushing something out the back like everything else works. So that's a very simple version of what Bob described and that flipped my script. It flipped my script because it's absolute opposite. You're no longer reactionary propulsion pushing something out of the back going forward. That's how you and I move, right? This is a completely separate type of propulsion and it's powerful. Oh man, that is so wild and I didn't mean to derail. I just, that part of it to me is so, gives me goose bumps and so, okay, so to get into the bigger picture here, the implications of this, because yes, the New York Times, two cockteas articles pop up all of a sudden, just all of a sudden out of the blue, some off-world crap. They show a frame from a slide, something they showed to senators or some shit that says that there's, do you remember the exact wording? Cause it's like- Yeah, yeah, off-world vehicle, so yeah, off-world vehicle not made on this earth or something like that, yeah. What the fuck? And then that's it. And then you're left with that. And I'm like, well, next week they're gonna announce this. Tucker Carlson's like, next week they're gonna say- Yeah, yeah, slow your roll, slow your roll. Let me explain. Let me explain. Let me unpack this a little bit. So when George Knapp and I went with Joe on his show, we said, New York Times article's probably about to drop, right, cause we're involved with, everybody involved with this. And, but he also said, this is a very heavy lift for the New York Times with their editorial and legal review process to overshoot and try to give too much, it's gonna be difficult. And I think they overshot a little bit. They're quoting a man named Eric Davis, and this guy was involved with a number of these Department of Defense projects. Now he certainly made that statement. He made that statement. And I will tell you, I understand it to be correct, like on multiple levels. However, you gotta put, you gotta throw down if you're gonna say something like that. And that's where we have a problem. These are special access programs that deal with the hardware. The acknowledged UFO program called ASAP and ATIP, these two, right? The ones that, you know, Snowden didn't find when he was looking for UFO stuff, yet they existed. They're so compartmentalized, they tried to get, Senator Harry Reid tried to get special access of program entitlement to the ASAP program because there are hardware programs that they wanted to interface with. So if they get SAP access, they can interface with these other stove piped, as they call them, programs. Well, they got denied. The Defense Intelligence Agency got denied. So that shows you something about this. It shows you that you've got all these individual programs that are unacknowledged and they don't want them to interface because then it makes it real. I mean, people are gonna start talking about this. We already have some leaks. So the New York Times was ahead of itself in that what it said was true, but they couldn't provide that hardcore backup that was needed in a story like the New York Times. Now, crossing fingers, they're gonna be able to get there. You think? Why? I'm crossing fingers that they can continue to break these stories because they brought some good things forward. But if you're in this, it's nothing new. You know, this has been reported on by both me and George Knapp, like Commander Fravor. Before this became a famous case, I was into it, talking with him, recording and a number of people. I just brought out Lieutenant Commander Chad Underwood, who's the guy that actually filmed the Tic Tac UFO. Yeah, man, I listened to that interview, so hardcore. So we're getting now the people who have direct experience. The public is getting the voices of the people that have direct experience engaging these unidentified on a military level. That's why people's minds are changing very slowly. It took years for everybody to understand about the Tic Tac, the Gimbal and the Go Fast, those three videos, right? The Pentagon released videos. But it's changing. And it's changing in a way that I'm very optimistic that we're gonna be learning more about this mystery, whatever it is and whatever it represents. Right. Now, do you think like just using Occam's razor is the reason they're hiding it not because they're like worried that humanity's consciousness will upshift and will no longer terrestrialize our identities? And through that, there'll be a natural shrugging off of the power structures of the earth. But rather, they're like, look, if we reveal this shit, one of our enemies is gonna reverse engineer it before we do and have the most advanced fucking weapon ever, hippie. We don't care about your stupid consciousness. Fuck you. We're just trying to keep you from getting eradicated by some motherfuckers who figure out how to use this before we do. Do you think that's why they're hiding it from us? Yeah, I'll tell you what I think. And I'll really try to preface this with, look, this is to the best of my knowledge at this time for whatever that's worth to whoever is listening. It's just my opinion based on what I've experienced and what I feel like I know. It's not about some consciousness shift thing. There are people that I know for sure within the Defense Intelligence Agency who are blocking and fighting this information coming out because they think it's satanic. They think it's demons. What? Yeah, this is actually hardcore fact. This is, there are, I know this for sure. Oh, God. This is crazy, right? This is so insane. But the people that ran these programs, they were getting pushed back for funding because of fundamentalist religious people who believe that the UFO phenomenon, whatever you want to call it, aliens, whatever, whatever we're seeing, that it represents something demonic. That's not a joke. So that is an issue of people looking at this. However, however, the big picture thing from a Defense Department standpoint, there's one reason and one reason alone why they've been keeping this so secret. And that reason is weaponization. These technologies represent a game-changing leapfrog technological situation for any weapons systems that we create from it. Gravity wave amplification itself is a absolute game-changer, you win, weapon system. So if this stuff is real, let's just say if this stuff is real, any of it, from a military perspective, you take it and you understand it and you weaponize it before someone else so an adversarial nation doesn't get that technology just blow up humanity and look what happened with nukes. We have to have, we have to have a reassurance that we're both gonna kill each other, mutually assured destruction, as they say. However, there may be deeper levels of this because if you think about it, let's say we do accept that there are spaceship, that there are aliens, that where a planet is being visited, that millions of people aren't crazy, that radar data isn't wrong, that the government hasn't studied this. Let's say we accept that. Well, where do you stop the questions? Because if one thing is real, you have to ask a question about the next. So let's say spaceships are real. What about all those people that say that they've been abducted? About the people that say they got a saucer over them, they got inside, they had surgical stuff going on. I mean, where do you stop asking the questions? And that's also maybe a threat to our way of life from a military perspective. Oh man, well yeah, I mean, that's just lawsuit land right there too. You know, I think, you know, just not that people are gonna sue aliens, but I'm just saying like any government agency that disregarded reports, especially from military personnel, and there's stories of people getting sick from being around these things. There's stories of like, you know, you encounter them. Not just stories. We have physical evidence and data. I can send you a document that, you know, is from the British military, Ministry of Defense, and it is very well calculated how what they call close proximity to UAP exposure, which means you're close to a UFO and there's a radiation effect. And they know the wavelengths of that radiation effect. Now this is just one document, but again, it's that totality again. It's that weight of evidence. So I was part of something where we got this guy who was in Randall Shemforest during that famous UFO event series. We brought him in front of five congressmen and one senator and we're like, look, this guy had this experience and they're denying him health benefits because they won't acknowledge he was there during this UFO experience. Well, all of a sudden Congressman Cook writes this letter and they get it in front of a number of individuals who were able then to get him full disability. They're acknowledging that he was there, that he was harmed by whatever he encountered that day and they gave him full disability. So it's not just stories. You were part of that? I was, I actually put that on with a friend of mine that's called the Citizen Hearing on Disclosure. And it was again, Ruben Langton, we have 40 witnesses that came forward to five members of congress and one senator. And at the time I was just kind of making a documentary with that and my buddy asked me to help and get some witnesses. And so it was really great. It was filmed like six cameras, a bunch of people came forward, but we're living in a different world now where that's actually happening, where we actually have closed door congressional briefings with people like the pilots who engage UFOs and they've now created a new task force to study the UFO phenomenon. Wow. So it's happening. Beautiful though. I mean, how beautiful. Yeah, the very human stuff to me aside, and I'm glad we covered it, the weapons threat, the satanic perspective, which is brand new to me, that one has like hurt my heart. But to me, it seems like the really terrifying thing, if you are someone who's still absorbed into like being a singular me, if you're someone who wants to have power, if you're getting off on control and power and dominance, which seems to be a kind of mental contagion, a lot of people have this problem, then the biggest threat to you is a technology that people could use to get off the planet and not come back. I mean, do you know what I mean? I mean it, man, I'm not joking. Like, of course we're missing one and crucial piece of the puzzle, which is what we need a planet that we get at the very least colonized and inhabit without dying. Mars is our closest choice, it's depressing though, but this technology, if we're talking, it's not just something that could be used for transport, but it seems like it's something that could be used to create like underwater, very safe underwater bubbles within which you could oxygenate, meaning that suddenly people could just essentially, the last, if we are to not to suddenly go like full scale Alex Jones here, but if we are a herd and we are being milked of our energy, then you don't, the worst case scenario for someone who, let's say has a bunch of cows, is that suddenly the cows learn to fly, right? You're fucked, you're not gonna get the cows back. And that's why that to me seems the main threat here, is that people in power probably don't want the people they're controlling to have the option to go to some other place. Let's look at that for a second. Maybe, what if it's worse? Okay, what if that we have these craft that are appearing here that either come from another time, come from another world, come from another dimension, which I don't even know what that means, just coming from somewhere else, they're foreign, right? And why are there so many over so long a time? Like when we go scout the moon, man, we send up one camera, circles the moon a whole bunch, and you get a perfect Google Maps of it. So why do you need all these different machines over so much different time, and then engaging with people in various ways? And the question there says, well, what if it's worse than what you said? What if we are an experiment where we are containers for something? You know, we contain something that we're almost being farmed for a substance, something of substance to them, and they're tending to their field. What if our consciousness is what is the valuable commodity to another civilization? And the human body is like a wine bottle that matures that consciousness. And if that is then taken later and used by somebody else as a commodity, that's the dark one. So what if the government was like, and I'm not saying, guys, don't cut this great, I ain't saying this is true. Free space. Free space. I'm just saying to play off of what you're saying, if we really want to go into the kind of world of what ifs, right? What if what we're seeing is so much stranger and maybe darker, you know, not as good for the human condition? And what if that is known? And then how do you convey that? It's not even the cows flying away. It's everybody stay right there, but know that you're just a product. I mean, that's evil shit. Well, I mean, if this is you go, I was just reading the book of Mark today, because I don't think people realize how many parables, if you like, look at them from an alien perspective, a lot of them are about like panspermia, because you know, one of the great parables everyone talks about, Jesus says, you know, there was a farmer who threw his seed and some of it landed on a path and couldn't grow and some of it landed on thin soil and couldn't grow and some of it, but and so the explanation of the parables, this is like the connection with the Christ consciousness will grow in some people's hearts, but some people aren't ready for it. But what if that's more of like, look, we're colonizers. We send out genetic data throughout the universe, which is designed to reach a certain apex of technology through which a portal is built that we can then travel through and take over their planet because it's habitable, which is why our technology started growing there. And sometimes it doesn't grow. Sometimes it does, but it grew on your planet, motherfuckers, and we're coming. And then that's the, you know, he didn't say motherfuckers. I do feel though that like there's a, and this is very naive of me, but I do feel like there's something that, and it is naive, but something that's- But isn't it okay to think anything? Isn't it okay to, I mean, that's the thing where you're gonna shut down our own, you know, ideas and philosophies go forward. Like you're not saying that you know it to be true, whatever you're about to say, you're just saying, this is a thought I'm having. A thought I'm having is they're benevolent. And the reason I think they're benevolent is because whenever I've encountered hyperintelligent beings, one of the first things they've done is disentangle themselves from their own selfish needs. And when I meet people who are confused, they're always worried about their own self and they're always grabbing at shit and they're scared. And so, you know, so I like to think like, man, as above so below, if these beings are advanced, they might be playful in a way that we don't think of as funny, you know, especially if they are, imagine this, like what if I know, okay, you are a balloon and you're a temporary balloon within which it's held this infinite field of consciousness. And the thing you call death is really freedom for you. And so I realize, oh shit, this particular sector of our galactic empire, oh my God, the balloons, the consciousness is think they're the balloons. Oh fuck, they're so miserable. Well, let's go pop the balloons, free them, and then welcome them into the galactic empire. To us, that looks like being massacred. To them, it looks like setting sentience free. So, you know, that's the scary part. Yeah, well, and let me be clear on, you know, what I have experienced in that, I told you this kind of dark world theory of the human beings, butchering their souls as commodities and bottles, and I don't believe that. No, I don't. That's just, you know, we're going down this path. It's fun to think about. I absolutely have the personal experience in this world that reflects what you just said, in that when we, the kind of more, so directed panspermia, this idea that, you know, the earth was colonized by genetics, right? It's a very fascinating theory. And then this idea, and I would like to believe this, I would hope to believe this, that an intelligence existence outside of us, that it is somehow helping us move to the next goal post and evolve and transition. And my personal experience is reflective of yours, in that people of true power, individuals, we don't have to talk extra extra, individuals of true power, they have absence of fear that you're going to take something from them. When we are our most confident, we're not thinking what you can take from us. We're thinking what we can give to you. There's something beautiful about, hold on, there's something beautiful about building somebody, helping to help somebody build themself up. I have only that experience. The world is kind to me. Even people that yell at me and say fucking four name and all that stuff, you know, that's okay. That's part of the learning process for me to get better or to reject other people's opinions about me, right? So I do experience world like you. It is mystical, it is ever evolving, I'm ever evolving. And there's a playful interaction where I truly feel that we are being urged to be better and to get better. And that's our personal challenge to accept it or not. And what dampens that is fear of loss, man. The moment you let go, not even just let go of fear of death, then you're just crazy, right? But you let go of fear of loss. Life is going to include loss, but it's going to include growth if you allow it. So that's my aim, that's my agenda. I do not fear loss. I do not what fear of someone's gonna shame me or take something away from me. I'm gonna learn from it no matter what. And if we can live in that to the best we can with every moment, it is absolutely incredible how every day becomes this valuable day that you won't forget. Jeremy, I am so grateful to you for your time and for this download, man. Thank you so much for coming on the show. Enlightening, you're an enlightening force in the universe. Please keep up the good work and let people know where they can find you, how they can help you, where they can leave these voicemails and let you know maybe some of the things they've heard. Yeah, I would love to hear what people's unique experiences are, what experiences that are extraordinary that kind of break the mold of what is considered consensus reality. And the way I like to perceive it is if you just shoot me an email off your iPhone, like a voice message and send it to editor at extraordinarybeliefs.com, because that's where all my work is found, then I will hear it. I'm backlogged, it'll take me a little while, but I'll hear it and I'll appreciate it. I want to learn about this stuff. And I only report on a fraction of what I learned, but I appreciate every story that's shared with me. And thank you, Duncan. I don't know how we found each other is through the people that you talk with on a daily basis. I'd say your comrades, the people that join you for your podcast. Yes, the community, yeah, they connected us, thank God. That's where some of my greatest interviews are coming from, actually. It's so beautiful, it's organic. That's so cool. So I'm appreciative to that because you could have anybody that you spend time talking with and as much as you have me on, I appreciate your audience and yourself wanting to learn more about this. We're all in the same boat. We all want to know the truth, we all want to learn more. Nobody has all the answers, but I think together as we look at this mystery, if we don't shut each other up, if there's wrestlers, if there's two wrestlers, they don't try to harm each other and they try to mold and shape each other into stronger individuals, we'll get up more than we are today. And so that's the goal here. So thank you for having me on, I appreciate your time. One of my favorite podcasts of all time, man. Thank you so much. And if there's, listen, I hope you will come back on again when some more of this stuff starts percolating. I really hope we could continue this conversation. Yeah, let's continue. And it doesn't have to be about UFOs, man. There's a lot to talk about that these represent in our lives. So anytime that you want, we can continue the conversation. Part two. Thank you, my friend.

Blue Chew, Blue Chew, Blue Chew, Blue Chew, Blue Chew, Blue Chew, Blue Chew. Friends, I don't know about you, but this isn't what I would call the most erotic time in human history. I got the sex drive of some kind of sea mollusk that fell out of a fishing net in this putrefying in the sun of some blasted fishing boat floating on a dead sea. But thanks to Blue Chew, I've got a little help from a friend because Blue Chew brings you the first chewable with the same FDA-approved active ingredient, is Viagra and Cialis. Blue Chew, it's made in the USA. It's prescribed online by licensed physicians, so you don't have to go to the doctor or wait in line.

I'm here in LA. We're just a virus-blasting machine out here. We got free coffers. I was out the other day pushing my sweet baby in his wagon. Wonderful magical day. The garbage trucks are waving at us. They can lift their thing up and they like to wave at kids. He thinks that's incredible, as do I, I'll admit. They play little noises. There's all these basket hoops on our street and we carry a ball around and I flail at basketball in front of him. He still thinks I'm a star. But you know what? I'm walking down the street on the other side of the street. I was wearing a face mask but just someone just freely coughing. Just coughing and coughing. It's like I understand. You probably have allergies. I understand you're with your child. But my God, how do you repress the boiling rage? How do you stop the anger when you think to yourself, what if she doesn't have allergies? She's a person in a way similar to people who during ancient rites and rituals and the dark, balmy groves and chasms of the wild, pagan world find themselves mounted by demons and spiritual forces. You know what I'm talking about if you've seen Angel Heart? Humping and writhing and humping, slurping back mushroom brews and hypergalactic intelligences fill them up and they dance and howl. Similarly, how can you not think this person has potentially become some kind of servant to COVID? That it's neurologically taken over their mind, produced some rationalization for how it makes sense in a city that's peaking with a pandemic to go outside and cough around kids. Anyway, I was far away on the other side of the street, masked up. So we can only do what we could do. And that's kind of what this episode is about. If you've listened to other episodes of the DTFH, you're familiar with Shane Moss by now. He's not only a comedian, he is somebody who has a podcast dedicated to science and he's somebody who is obsessed with science. And I love him for it because my mind flails wildly in all directions. I allow myself to be mounted by my biases, misperceptions and desires for the universe to be other than it is. I have magical thinking all the fucking time. I believe in tarot cards and coin flips and if a bird flies by, I think that must mean something good is about to happen or bad depending on what my mood is and the type of bird. The point is we need people like Shane Moss. We need rational people because if I'm teetering at all times on the edge of building like that mud thing that the guy made in Close Encounters of the Third Kind is summoning a UFO. If I'm always on the brink of, you know, attempting some weird ritual or spell or anytime any news about a comet going by, you better believe I'm thinking, well, we're probably going to get smashed. We need people, we need the scientists, we need people like Shane Moss. But what's great about Shane Moss when we talk about this in this episode is he's a translator. You know, the way Ram Dass could translate eastern mysticism and these heavy duty, heady philosophical ideas that fill up thick books, academic books that are kind of hard to wallow through and then Ram Dass is able to convert that into something that speaks right to your heart. Shane Moss does that with science. In other words, he makes it a little less dry and boring. A lot, in fact, completely entertaining. Because good God, what are you going to read a scientific? Is that what we're going to do? We're really going to open up a scientific journal and read it? What are you going to read the Lancet? I'm not, maybe you are. I'm going to need a lot more Adderall if I'm going to do that. I can't get through it. You know, I studied psychology when I was in school and I remember reading these scientific papers with all the statistics and the weird shit. It's murky and you never, it's never satisfying. We need translators like Shane Moss to deliver the truth to us. Which is, I think, the function of certain people in society, but good Lord, we talk about this in this podcast, the sort of reeling confusion many of us are feeling as we're being pelted with a variety of different data sets that are all being warped by whatever the pundit is that blowing them out. So it's nice. This podcast is great. You know, and I haven't really done a podcast dedicated to COVID-19 yet. So if you, like me, have been experiencing a kind of reeling confused dysphoria related to this pandemic, if you find yourself waffling between subscribing to some of the beautifully weird conspiracy theories out there, such as the Meteor Impact Theory that I propagated unfortunately and actually sort of 80% believed to all the other theories out there, between those crazy, maybe not crazy, who knows what shit to like, you know, the dire prognostications of people who seem hysterical to the sort of centrists between the two, who seem maybe like they're being a little not careful enough. If you just find yourself essentially like some kind of pinball being bounced around a dark COVID-19 information machine, then I think this, hopefully this episode will at the very least be a kind of voice for you because we were completely honest about our own confusion and Shane Moss as always is honest about his struggles with mental illness and his recent trip to a psychiatric unit, because he deals with mania sometimes, as do most of many, many brilliant people. But not me. I've never suffered from any mental illness at all. Nope. Straight-arrow trussle here. Never wobbled at all. Smooth, calm, tranquil. I'm fine. We're going to jump right into this episode with Shane. But first this. Bring me my, bring me my pills, Mary. Yes, sir.

Got to get my nipples reduced, but I just am not there financially to pay for that operation. I need your help. I got to get my nips down. They're big. They're long. They hurt. They're inflamed.

The doctor has said it's there's clitoral cells in my massively enlarged flapping nipples that hang like dark purplish pasta down my stomach and they bounce against my thighs at night as I ride around in some kind of constant undulation between orgasmic pleasure, which isn't pleasure when you can't control it.

Returning to the podcast is one of the most requested guests of the DTFH. You know him from his awesome podcast. Here we are. Maybe you've seen him live at one of his stand up science shows. Maybe you've seen his tales from the trip where he talks about DMT or maybe you have watched his awesome documentary on psychedelics. Psychonautics, which is available on Amazon.com and lots of other streaming services. Now, without further ado, everyone, please welcome to the Dunkin Trussell Family Hour podcast, the brilliant Shane Moss. Shane, let's just jump into this son of a bitch. All right, let's do it, man. Welcome back to the DTFH. Shane, I was on your Twitter. I've been actually trying to avoid Twitter. Oh, yeah, that's a very good idea. Thank you. Yeah, I've got a lot. I've had a lot of epiphanies regarding social media in general lately, but I got on your timeline and I thought it was so interesting that you were running into something that a lot of people you have any kind of voice right now are running into, which is this weird push. If you say anything rational, you get this bizarre pushback from people who I have gotten really deeply sucked into. The conspiracy theory that COVID does not exist. Yeah. The masks are some kind of implement that is being placed on our society by nefarious beings who want us to submit via mass that they're prepping us for, you know, everything turning into what it's like at the airport. Yeah. In the master the first step. And so I saw that you tweeted that because you have been very vocal in your frustration regarding the anti science. I have. I've no doubt alienated many people, including friends, family and fans. Well, but maybe you could tell me a little bit about the messages that you've been getting from people relating to what you've been talking about. Yeah. I mean, so I have, you know, science podcast. Here we are. And early on in this, I didn't know a thing about infectious disease. I know a little bit about the evolution of host virus relationship. And it's really fascinating. And early on, I made the same mistake that everyone seems to make during this, which is, which is that whatever. Whoever we already, like everyone's becoming them. Many people are becoming the most themselves that they've ever been. That's cool. So like, like it really is like a mushroom trip for me, for my experience. So like the conspiracy people are the most into conspiracies. The environmentalists are the most like, now we're going to see now that people aren't driving and the skies are clear and bunnies are coming back. Now they'll see and the science people like myself are like, see you dopes. You should have paid attention in school and, and each political party has, has their, you know, agenda and everything else. And so, so early on, I was like, well, this is great because people are going to care about science for the first time in my lifetime. That's sweet. And I don't know why I thought that. Looking back, hindsight bias. And early on, I was also, I mean, I remember you and I texting and I thought this was mass hysteria, like everything else on the news always is. Yes. And then when I learned about it, when I talked to some infectious disease people, I was like, oh, I'm going to readjust how I think about the long term for a while. And then I was just kind of vocally, my point has just been the point that I've been attempting to make is this is going to be a long haul. If you're telling yourself a story that this is going to be like a few weeks and we're going to be done with this, this is going to be absolute torture for you. Right. And it's going to be better, in my opinion, for a lot of interesting psychological reasons to just think of it in terms of the long haul. And if things clear up sooner, that's going to be a huge win. But if we keep telling ourselves a story that this is almost over, it's just going to be torture. Every three weeks that you realize it's going to be another three weeks, that's just going to be another psychological loss to you. Right. And we just aren't built to handle that. And so rather, and I was also hypomanic early on for like... Oh, really? So you had like a, it sort of came back for a second. I ended up in a psych ward, actually. Oh, no. Yeah. And in June, in June it turned into full blown mania. And I ended up in a psych ward again. Man, I'm sorry. That's a bummer. It was a good trip. I learned a lot this time. The first time was the scariest thing that I've ever been through. The second time was also scary, but I learned a lot and was very fascinating and interesting. Is that because you sort of knew what to expect, so to speak? Yes. I think that's the biggest thing is that, you know, think about it like, you know, I sometimes was going to Jamaica to help facilitate mushroom trips for people. And a lot of it was new people. And you sit down and kind of give some ideas of what to expect, but you don't want to implant too much, but you tell them some things that might come up and everything. And then you take the journey. Well, I think psych wards could benefit from a practice like that, which you don't see a therapist until you've already been into the psych ward. So they take you in your craziest state. They don't, they don't say, Hey, you seem a little paranoid right now. So just so you know, we're going to put you in a place that's probably not going to help that situation. Right. There's cameras everywhere. There's people watching everyone and monitoring things. They have clipboards. It's probably going to be scary for you. It is for everybody. And one thing that you might notice is that because there's these ways in which because people are coming and going and there's different shifts and different employees. We have a lot of like different things like color coding systems to keep track of who needs what attention, but you in your manic state might perceive that as a puzzle that needs to be solved in order to get out of here, which is a very common experience. What a terrible game show. So, so if you know that like, Hey, if you have questions about the puzzle, just like ask us and we'll tell you, you know what that color coding on the door is for and all about. Yeah. And that might make you feel a little better about it. And just like, I could definitely see my mind getting caught by that. I could definitely see my mind imagining that I could decipher it, that it was some secret message being given to me by one of the doctors that there was a possibility of like a trap door in the floor based on those codes that would lead to like, you know, back into like whatever MK ultra experiment I was in. Oh, you passed agent Moss. Now you can start your work in the CIA. That's exactly where it goes. And you're in your inner room with a bunch of other people as paranoid as you are in basically the same head state that are just as scary and some of them like the veterans are like usually pretty like deeply damaged people in my experience that really attached to they relate most to people that are damaged. So when someone comes in shell shocked for their first time, they flock to those people and start like messing with their heads because it like brings them to their level and and and they they're able to like assert kind of dominance over this. Like, well, there you go. You just described Twitter. That's the same fucking thing. Friends, if you ever watch the office, yeah, you probably know it's based on the UK series also called the office. But what if I told you there are nine other countries with their own versions of the office that you've never seen?

Because this is one of the things I think everybody does naturally is it's easier for somebody to start resonating at your frequency than to start resonating at their frequency. You're familiar with your frequency. You know what it is. And so if you're around somebody and I've been around people who are panicking and they will sometimes if they're particularly distraught, they will get angry if you don't start panicking with them. You could tell that there is a sense of like they start feeling judged because you aren't deciding to join in on their freak out and they think you're being condescending when the reality is you're just, you know, not tuning into that particular modality of emotion or whatever. Yes. You know, and it's really, it's to me, I think there's nothing wrong with that. If you're panicking, you're panicking. But to me, where it gets particularly dark is when there's that intentionality behind it where someone is actually actively trying to pull you into their horror show. Yeah. Yeah. And which is, you know, every single like pretty much everything these days that you're watching that isn't just some like a Twitch channel involves someone trying to pull you into their horror show. Yeah. And I think that's the problem is like, right? Isn't this the reason there's so much fright like what you're talking about is happening? Because, you know, I, I real one thing I did realize is this thing where we're calling these people dumb. Yeah. It's do, it's not doing any good. No. Because that just shames them further. It's, it's bad enough that like they, they're wrong. That sucks to be wrong. And it sucks to be deeply invested in being wrong. Yeah. But then to have people saying, you dumb fuck, isn't it obvious? Yeah. That's going to make them really hook in deeper into their bias. Right? I just, one of my tweets yesterday actually was about how, was very much about, it was about how, you know, I was, I was reflecting because early on when I was hypomanic, one of the things that comes along with like hyper creativity, hyper, you know, tons of energy and productivity is that you're also really snippy and have like no patience and often think that you're smarter than everybody. And so that was, that was coming out on Twitter. And I, you know, and I was like also embarrassed about it. Basically every time I tweet, I just feel bad about myself afterwards. But, but anyway, I did, I was thinking yesterday about my last serious girlfriend was this hippie chick who I love. She is probably the best girlfriend that I, that I've had. And she refused to let me have a microwave in the house because of like radiation or kills the nutrients or whatever. And there was just nothing that I could say to, and so I tweeted about the, about how like I spent three years, you know, trying to like one, she was intelligent and open-minded. Two, she, she loved or at least tolerated me blabbing about science more than most people on earth was like really receptive and didn't have anything. No, like she wasn't arguing with anything that I said. She, it was just a feeling that she had. And three months later, like I never got that microwave, you know, there, there's nothing that I'm going to tweet. That's going to take someone who's like rightly scared about something like a vaccine. And that's going to be like, yeah, you know what, this comic who's deeply invested in science probably has my best interest in, in mind. Right. So I should, I should, he just changed my mind about my take on vaccines. I, I, I disagree, man. I think you actually, there is hope in, and I think there is like, you know, I know what you mean though. I mean, and it's, especially when you're in a living situation with someone where you have different views on fundamental things in the universe, like a microwave. It's, and you, you know, you realize that you're, you're either going to get in like an infinite fight or you're going to capitulate to their irrationality and just, it's going to take longer for you to cook your food. I'm reheating my coffee in a, in the one clean saucepan. Yeah. Yeah. To then get in trouble for the dirty saucepan later and then, and then give a physics lecture. In response. Yes. You know, it's, it's, you know, I guess that's what compromises. Right. I guess that's what compromises. Yeah. I mean, sometimes you just have to be like, you know, this is something Ramdas would always talk about. It's like, you know, I'd rather be, be in love than right. I'd write, you know, and, and so, and I think that could be used as a spiritual bypass for an excuse for cowardice sometimes, but in general, I get it, but I think there is hope in the sense, I think, I think there must be actually from science, except not virology, but from social psychology. I think there probably is some reservoir of data out there that could create a more pragmatic way to communicate to people who have become invested in irrationality and that doesn't make them dig their heels in. Yeah. And I think that the first step is, first of all, I don't think they're dumb. I think actually as a, you know, conspiracy theorist myself. Yeah. And in the sense that I know. You son of a bitch. You know, but if you look back at the very beginning of this fucking thing. Yeah. And you realize that Fauci said, don't wear masks. Yeah. Like there's video of him saying that. Yeah. And then he said, wear masks. So what you're looking at there is to me, like one of, one of the great mistakes that was made during this fucking pandemic, which is the person who is supposed to be telling you the truth as it is, because he's a scientist, did not tell the truth. Yeah. And he did it with good intention. He wanted to protect the, what's it called PPE? What's it called? The protective PPE. PPE. He wanted to protect that for the medical community. Yeah. And so he thought that he would do a little white lie. Yeah. But the problem is that spawned so many good reasons for people to be like, wait, you told me not to wear the fucking mask. Yeah. Yeah. Now you're telling me to wear the mask. And then if I'm like paranoid, I'm going to say, wait a minute, were you trying to spread this shit around? Yeah. Like by saying not to wear this thing and you're a scientist, you do did know that it would stop the droplets, even though at that time we didn't know so much about it. You did know any scientist knew that the very least is going to stop spreading droplets of this shit around. Right. But you said, don't wear the mask. And now you're saying wear the mask. And you want us to believe you now. Yeah. But you know, so to me, I don't think it's dumb. I think it's just unfortunate that people, this is have lean into the government or the state to get the truth. Yeah. That's the number one problem. I think it's like you definitely, so I think to appease folks, you could say, yeah, you're right. Yeah. So all the times we've been lied to by our government, look at how many times they've told a shit that is not true. So let's not listen to the government. Oh, yeah. You know what I mean? That's definitely not listen to the government. Right. And now once you say that, you know, you're kind of tuning in with them. Yeah. And then it's like, to me, if I was going to propose a counter conspiracy theory to the one that there is no pandemic, one that I believe is equally irrational, but if I were going to maybe propose like a manipulative conspiracy theory designed to get people to start wearing masks who aren't. Yeah. Then what I would say is, oh, actually what you're looking at here is an intentional psyops designed to confuse people and to cull the herd. The pandemic is real. The risk of dying from it is relatively low, but it seems to have some neurological components in it that are just being revealed right now. And if I were to look into like, if you study CRISPR gene editing and stuff, and that's been going on in China, there's no telling what this thing is. It could actually be recoding your DNA. And so you think that the vaccine is what has the chip in it. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You don't understand. 5G is designed to interact with the COVID virus to control your mind. And they know that people who don't wear masks are the Patriots. And so by keeping you people from wearing masks, they are unintentionally infecting you with COVID-19 because they want to control your minds. So wear the masks because it will keep you from becoming a puppet of the Chinese government. Something like that. You know what I mean? Spread that around. It is. It's interesting because I don't think conspiracy theorists are dumb either. I think that they are very... I mean, the comedy community has tons of conspiracy theorists. So, I mean, I have a personal bias because I've had some dear friends kind of get lost in the conspiracy tunnel and really alienate lots of friends and family and everything. And also, like one person in particular who really meant a lot to me had multiple sclerosis, believed it was due to aspartame, which I'm not an aspartame advocate. But which led him to eventually shape-shifting lizards controlling this and that. And distrust of the medical community, which made him deteriorate really quickly and also becoming insanely bigoted and alienating everyone and everything was like four white Christians. And that was like... And I've seen that happen with a few of my friends since. So, I have a personal bias because I don't think most conspiracy theorists have gone that far with things. Well, what's your definition of conspiracy theorist? I don't know. That's a good question. You know, I would say... Yeah, that's a very good question. I guess it's someone that crosses my line. That's what I'm like, now you're a conspiracy theorist. Because here's what usually happens. It's like, hey, we shouldn't trust the government. I'm like, I agree. It's like... And then corporations are corrupt in influencing the government. Like, absolutely. And then it goes from that to... Once it goes from like... Cars are dangerous or something. I'm like, yeah, I agree that there's been cover-ups about how dangerous cars are. Like, Ralph Nader stuff or something like that. But then it goes from like... Oh, they've been planning accidents. See, they've been doing... You can look, they've been running crash tests this whole time. It's like, whoa, whoa, whoa. No, that's not what crash tests are for. This is a fictitious example just to kind of detach from like actual theories going on. Well, like, let's look at Watergate. What was the journalist who exposed that? Was his name... I can't remember, but Watergate. Look at Watergate. That was a conspiracy theory. It started off as a conspiracy theory, but it was really just journalism. And then from great investigation, they exposed the whole damn thing. It was a literal conspiracy. The president of the fucking United States was involved in an actual conspiracy. And then boom, you know, we get rid of Nixon. And that was like an idea of good journalism. To me, you know, like, my problem is like, I will get sucked into these things. Like, and I'm not ashamed of it. And I love that you're not ashamed of admitting that you were in a psych ward. I'm not ashamed of admitting that a few months ago, I thought a meteor was going to hit the earth. I got it in my head. The whole thing was designed to get us to, like, get inside and store up food because they had some dad about a meteor hitting the earth. Wife just ferociously making fun of me all the way through until the meteor passed. Just all the way through. And I love that. I love it because it's calming me down and I appreciate. And I was thinking like, yeah, all my good friends would just say to me, Duncan, that is the dumbest shit you've ever said to me. And I would think, I know what you're thinking, but I think it's true. But where I think, hopefully, I differ from some conspiracy theorists is now that the meteor has not hit the earth. I'm not saying, well, you see, actually, that's what Space Force was for. They got the meteor and pushed it out of the orbit that it was in. Or, you know, trying to, instead of just doing what I love about you and I love about scientists, instead of just being like, oh, no. I was completely fucking wrong there. That was bad irrational thinking. I could have studied anything. I could have called friends who are into cosmology. I could have talked to anyone who I trusted and they would have been like, we're not getting hit by a meteor. But instead I leaned into irrationality and it gave me a little thrill for a few months. So I think the difference between bad conspiracy theory and good conspiracy theory is that bad conspiracy theorists cannot admit that they were wrong. Yeah, and what I love about scientists is they say, I don't know more than anyone I've ever met in my entire life. And two, I find out how wrong I am every episode. If anyone listens to my podcast, I'm the worst part of the show, really. Basically, it's just me finding out how wrong I am for an hour every week about everything. And it's humbling. And I've canceled podcasts just because I'm like, I just can't feel stupid today. I just don't have it in me to feel this stupid. That's so cool. And scientists themselves, I can recite their own work back to them. Like, hey, you had this paper come out three years ago that I thought was really interesting. And you said this and they'll be like, oh, actually, there's been a lot of research that's come in since this time. And it's not that scientists aren't immune to believing in their work way too much and everything else. But they quantify things, they say, I don't know. And they say, on the other hand, more than anyone that I ever talked to ever. And so if you take why I think there's a lot of conspiracy theories in the comedy community and why I'm a little troubled by it because comedians have a little more of a platform than your average person, is because you do have what I would say is exceedingly intelligent people, but without a formal education and an understanding of how the scientific method actually works. Then you have people that are a little less than agreeable, typically. You have people that are anti-authority. And all of these things that are really terrific. You know, I've been a rebellious, anti-authority person my whole life. It's got me in a lot of trouble, but I value that in people. But you have that in just the right combination. And I feel like it goes a little too far when it comes in terms of, when the first assumption is the intent to, say, wipe out 90% of the population or something, when, say, putting New York on lockdown, you know, the governor of New York, that's when you shut down commerce and productivity, you shut down all of the tax money and all of the funding that you're getting from that. There's no doubt that there's government cover up, but the actual intent of what the government is supposed to do is protect the citizens, whether they're actually doing that or not is another thing. Whereas, say, a corporation, their actual intent has nothing to do with, like, on paper, like their mission statement has nothing to do with the betterment of the world. The goal is to increase quarterly profits. So if you look at the bad actor, and then they have the money and the funds to influence government, and then a lot of people that get into government are in it for their own ego. But I'm more willing to say, like, the government is being corrupted in all of these ways, rather than, say, the government is out to get us from square one, because they got into this club where they all peed on each other, and then they want to kill 90% of that. What club's that? I want to be in that club. Population. I don't want to kill the population, but what's the pee on each other? No, just kidding. But this is, to me, the problem here is that, you know, in what you're saying, and this is what's really interesting to me is, like, many, like, conspiracy theorists don't, like, when I look at it as an emerging, at the very least, it's emerging folklore. Yeah. Right? It's like, these are our jack tales, or these are our, like, new mythology, and it's, like, within its awe, and within it is, like, this sort of beautiful childlike excitement about mystery. And I appreciate all that, and I don't mean that in a condescending way. I think it's really quite beautiful that humans spin such wild tales using their lack of information. I think there's something really special about that, and it's beautiful. Yeah. But a lot of times, it's just not true. But one thing that is most certainly true is, if you look up right now, it's called, it started with the Nazis, and I always forget the name of this. You probably know the name. What is it? Isolateral warfare? What's asymmetrical warfare? So, you know, this is, like, guerrilla warfare. This is the history of wars that people who are outmatched by, you know, numbers or technology or whatever will begin to, like, break certain rules of law, of war. And that's how we won the Revolutionary Wars, guerrilla warfare. And this evolves over time. So, you know, this is, like, some story about the Vietnamese where, you know, had bombs and baby carriages that they were, like, you know, would push at soldiers. There'd be babies in there. And somebody said, like, stopped, you know, someone in the government said, you are using bombs and baby carriages. And the response from whoever their leader was was something like, look, you give us your airplanes and we'll give you our baby carriages. Yeah. Right, you know? So, that's, so, that's, so, anyway, the, clearly the United States has not made a lot of friends over the last 50 years when it comes to our interaction with the world. So, if you, if you wanted to make the planet a murder mystery, right, and you were trying to figure out, well, what enemies do you have to figure out who's trying to kill you? The United States would, like, have to spend, like, a long time writing down all the various people that might have a grudge against us. We've been bombing countries. We've been, the CIA has been going into countries causing revolutions, attempting to cause revolutions. We have been using all kinds of techniques, many of them insanely unethical techniques. You're preaching to the choir right now. Right. Imagine that having done that for so long that that wouldn't then be turned against us is, to me, really kind of short-sighted. To me, it's like, you know, a pandemic. We all knew a global pandemic was coming. Yeah. Everyone knew that. It was not a matter of if, but when, and it happened. So there was a lot of time for enemies of the United States to prepare for this in terms of a military operation that isn't based on invasion of, you know, the homeland, but invasion of the mines. And so what better time to go into the message boards? What better time to get on social media? What better time to get into the psyche of a population that has not been educated when it comes to science, to the scientific method than during a global pandemic when everyone's stuck inside? What better time to start spreading wild ideas about what's happening in none of the, like, not just pandemic-related, but what better time to, like, figure out a way to, like, hack into Wayfair, for example. Right. You know what I mean? And, like, just create these weird moments of grotesque novelty that produce nothing more than anxiety and a sense of desperation in people who have not gained control of their minds enough to be able to determine. What's real from what's not real? And if they don't know to be able to say, I don't know, then right now, we could expect right now, if we have enemies, this would be the time that people would begin a long-term PSY ops against, you know, a population that is already freaking the fuck out. And so I don't know why that doesn't get covered by conspiracy theorists, while they're always like, well, it's the WHO or the CDC or the president or the Clintons or Fauci who are trying to reduce the population or whatever. I don't understand why people don't think, wait, holy fuck, this could just easily be coming from any number of people who are just attempting to kill as many people as possible by making them seem like assholes for wearing masks. What better way to attack a country than to convince people in that country that it's stupid to wear a mask when there's a pandemic? It's so brilliant. Yeah, I mean, another rather brilliant thing, though, and for me is just like, maybe this is my over fondness for Aquinas Razor and overly simplifying things, and it is that another fairly clever thing is viruses. Viruses think of very clever ways to invade hosts, and there's also all of these evolutionary mismatches with our modern world that are also playing out here that are pretty easily, that also fairly easily explain this, which is, one, I'm in Wisconsin right now, and so yeah, I am having to deal with my inbox filling with conspiracy theorists mad at me because I'm trying to be some COVID warrior or something on Twitter, and I get it. It's irritating, and I'm in everybody a little bit of a fragile and stressed state, and I'm indulging in my negativity bias and allowing myself a story of frustration because I'm also broken and a little scared myself and having to re-figure out my life. So I'm maybe a little more vulnerable to those things than in my normal every day, just usually getting a kick out of ridicule on a YouTube comment or something. But the point is, I'm in Wisconsin right now with a bunch of my extended family that just works nine to five jobs, isn't really big into politics that much, other than it's big into supporting Trump and everything that they already were doing, and they also just kind of buy into the narrative that this isn't a really big deal, and one thing that helps sell that is that this is a really, really, as, so, one of the things is with the asymptomatic carriers. So something that I've talked about a bunch on your podcast is just the difference in how the brain and our psychology has evolved and what it's evolved for, and oh, I just know I'm wearing this shirt right now that I like that is, I bought this because it has a chicken on it, but it reminds me of my favorite expression in biology, that the chicken is just the egg's way of laying another egg. So all of this, all of this weird existence, us podcasting right now, trying to buy a better car, all of these things are this really strange roundabout way for genes to just replicate themselves and survive and be passed on. From my way of viewing things, and so that being said, there's the way that our disease avoidance mechanisms have evolved, we're not, we're long before the scientific method, long before germ theory, long before we understood there's these things that we couldn't detect with our eyes, we had to pick up on various, and those ancestors that happened to avoid people that looked sick were the ones that survived and reproduced longer, and that's why now if you see someone, I mean, if you saw someone hacking up a lung and drowning in their own lung fluids, you would distance yourself from them, you would ask them to cover their mouth, you would probably sanitize the area, that's a natural response that a lot of mammals won't eat another, won't eat a prey that looks sick. So much so, that prey will sometimes pretend to look sick, or like a goat or whatever will faint, so that the predators like, oh, better not eat that thing. Those are just these heuristics that, and all that it was was a preference, one person had a preference for avoiding someone that coughed and another person didn't. If being around someone that was coughing was evolutionarily good for you, we would be, any time someone coughed, we'd be running towards them, we'd be worshiping them, praising them, this is actually where the expression God bless you came from. There was some plague where toward the end of it when people were dying, they were having like sneezing fits, which is such a bizarre way to die, and at first they thought it was, oh, the devil must be getting into them when they sneeze, and then once the plague eventually kind of went away, and it was like okay to sneeze again, then they kind of perpetuated a new story that was like, oh, it must be the devil getting out of somebody, so therefore God's blessing you when you sneeze. This is like when you're talking about how things that we picked up on, think about the stars. There's all of these mammals that navigate through looking at the stars, and there's all of these reasons for humans to say no where the North Star is in our past ancestral environment, and then we use these stories to create a narrative to help us remember these navigational tools, and then once we do that, and then once we have sexual selection for our intelligence, then the stories themselves become the vehicle for replicating genes, now you're impressing a lady by having the most fanciful story of what these stars mean, and now you have something like astrology that develops that is completely detached from its original utility, and so in that same way we have these disease avoidance mechanisms that feel very intuitive to it, no one needs to be told to avoid someone coughing, and then you have modern medicine, and you have modern germ theory, and modern sanitation that makes this the cleanest, most germ free environment that humans have ever lived in. We aren't mentally prepared for that, there's this hygiene hypothesis that I think we've talked about on the show maybe before, about why allergies are kind of potentially taking off right now. Right now? Oh yeah, yeah, yes, yes. Can you explain it please? No, please, please re-explain it. It's because there are actually so few bacterial threats in our modern environment where the threat detection that we evolved for was for our past world where we would say have maybe 10 possible bacterial threats walking through the woods or whatever in a given day, and your immune system evolved to detect those threats, and all of a sudden the threat detection is only blipping once a day, and there's kind of like a supervisor in there going, why is this off? Why are we not detecting 10 threats like we have all the way through our evolutionary history? And so it increases that level of threat detection in the mind and in the immune system, and until, and this is just a theory, and it's pretty speculative and a little shaky if you ask me, but it's pretty fun, so let's talk about it. Please. Until that threat detection becomes so sensitive that it goes, ooh, dander, and then sets off an immune response, which then itself, the autoimmune response, the inflammation that comes along with it, is the actual threat to you, not the dander. The dander was never a threat. It's the response to it. So then we live in this world that's one as sanitary as it's ever, so the type of bacteria that our ancestors would have been around, and it doesn't exist in the same way, but what does exist is another evolutionary novelty, which is these viruses that are being passed around through the domestication of livestock and animals, and now unlike a lot of animals that see a sheep fall over and go like, maybe I won't fuck with that thing, might have worms. Now we're detached from that process. We don't know how long this food has been, you know, festering or whatever else, and on top of that, when you're herding animals together, which is for the first time ever, that's when these plagues, and that's when plagues started plaguing humans. It wasn't until, for the most part, it wasn't until we had civilizations where we packed people together with animals that all of the sudden these things started spreading. So we didn't have things like wet markets beforehand. We didn't have a lot of people eating bats, which by the way, do carry corona, and one of the reasons why they are able to carry around corona viruses so well without being influenced by themselves is actually the opposite of distancing. Because they sleep together, the heat of being packed together makes the virus manageable enough, kills off enough of the virus. Wait, so you're saying that as we all should be sleeping together? No. With humans, that won't work. And with bats... And that's Shane Moss, everybody, you heard it from the man of science. We all need to sleep together more. Everyone come to my house. I don't want to do it, but we're going to do it. And take the first vaccine on the market. Sure, we've had some history of some light sterilization of populations here and there, but this one would be great. Light sterilization. So I'm sorry, I cut you off for a bad joke. Keep going. Sure, there's been some troubling history of vaccines in the past, but this one will for sure be good. But there's something like... But when foreign viruses attack... So take, for example, bats who... There's bats in the northeast that have this white-nosed fungus. What happened was a caver came from England with some of this shit on his boots, went caving, bats got this white-nosed fungus, and it wiped out like 99% of a population. And so, foreign viruses and bacteria, they can happen and they can decimate populations without any conscious meddling or conspiracy. These are real things that absolutely can happen. And those bats that distance themselves in the case of that new foreign virus, those are the ones that are surviving. And so they're actually sleeping further apart. So what's happening with things like COVID or what happened with the Black Plague or what happened with us giving blankets to the Indians is we had evolved alongside. We had a longer evolutionary arms race with these viruses and already kind of the people that were going to get weeded out got weeded out. And so we had already domesticated our livestock and we had that immunity built in. And so then when we came and gave Native Americans who weren't domesticating animals in the same way, it spread through the population. So all of this is to say is that it doesn't take as much sophisticated meddling to pull off a virus. And it also, the other thing is that because of our modern medicine, viruses need to stumble on new tricks that haven't been quote-unquote thought of. I don't like giving virus like this intentionality because really it's just a blind. It's like a slot machine that just constantly someone, it's like evolutions pulling the handle and it's like coming up with all these different sequences and then boom, jackpot. It leaps, it jumps, and then we get COVID. That's probably why it's actually the evolution of why we have sex, why we have male and female genders in the first place. Why we went from, not we, why organisms went from asexual cloning to, which was about almost 3 billion years of that, to sexual reproduction, 1.2 billion years. And why these organisms stumbled on this idea of splitting 50% of your genes, which is a stupid deal. You want 100% of your genes. You want to clone a Duncan Trestle. You want to clone a Shane Moss. That's what we're all ultimately after. The world needs more of this guy around. And so why is there a trade-off? And they speculate it's because of how quickly bacteria can pick the locks on a large organism's immune system. That replication was allowing generations to outwit and change the locks on bacteria and parasites and viruses. So that's why we have sex in the first place. So all of life is always having to evolve all of these crazy defense mechanisms. And one thing that we haven't, so much like every time someone coughs and sneezes, it does not mean that they're sick. It does not mean that they're going to kill you. This is just a heuristic. This is just a rule of thumb that you evolved. And because of that rule of thumb, you depend on it. And so when someone says, hey, this person assume everyone could be sick, it just doesn't resonate. There's nothing intuitive about that. And much of our conscious stories are fanciful explanations based on intuition. And so then once you want to start like Googling, you know, whatever to validate, just like when my girlfriend yelled at me for the saucepan, I immediately Google arguments in favor of physics arguments in favor of microwaves. You know, we all do this. And so I think there's a bit of that going on as well. But that's what I'm talking about that. See, this is the new addition to our ecosystem. Like everything, like I'm not saying that the pandemic is like something that was created on purpose. And I'm not saying that, well, any conspiracy theory I've posited thus far is just something I think about. I don't really believe it necessarily. But what I'm saying is the difference between this pandemic and the 1918 pandemic, the Spanish flu is that we now are not just like rubbing shoulders with each other in the cities and, you know, more populated than we were before, but that our minds are now connected than they ever were before. And that this addition of the social media to a pandemic, this is like where things like completely go literally go off the map. Like we can go back to the Spanish flu. We can go back to like you could find a precedent for anti-maskers in the history of virology. There was a time when it was considered you were an idiot for washing your hands. It was un-gentlemanly. You weren't supposed to wash your fucking hands. Do you know how this is actually how they stumbled upon germ theory in the first place or part of modern germ theory? This is a ridiculous story. There was some hospital where mothers that were giving birth were getting some infection. It's because the doctors were doing autopsies on corpses and they weren't washing their hands. So they were getting diseases from touching rotten flesh and then delivering a baby. And those doctors were very smug and shit-heads. And I can't remember the lister. Not only that, it was a sign of pride if you were a surgeon to be walking around covered in blood. Bloody hands. If you wanted to slough off on a day, you would cover yourself in blood so it looked like you were busy. That's it. Blood, puke, flim, shit. That's what our doctors used to be. And our doctors, what is it? James Lister, is that his name? It's like the person where Listerine came from. The point is there was a really intense struggle that he had to go through just to get the idea out that you need to wash your hands before you deliver a baby. So there's a precedent for people who are angrily not wearing masks or look at people who are wearing masks as being idiots. There's a precedent. There's a historic precedent. And I think there's some comfort in that knowing that that's not really a new thing. This has happened in the past, especially as a reaction from beings who are not familiar with the basic ideas of science, which by the way are pretty fucking boring and I don't blame a lot. You know what I mean? I don't blame people for not wanting to hear about this goddamn scientific method or to read research papers or to understand what it means if you're a doctor working at the CDC or to understand how many years you put into it. I don't want to fucking think about that. And please, please no one listening think that I am any expert on infectious disease because I've been trying to learn. And it's fucking hard and it's boring, like you said, to actually learn. I mean the reason why I get some popularity for being on your or someone else's podcast and being a guest and kind of spinning these fun scientific tales and the reason why people like hearing me tell them is because most of what I'm saying is wrong. When I actually talk to a scientist about my interpretation of how science works, most of the time they're like, it's actually, that's an exciting way of putting it. But what the reality is, it's so much more nuanced, so much more boring and complicated and the data that needs to be mulled through is just like, give me a fucking break. It's true for any cool thing, man, and you need translators. And I think that's what you function as is like a really good translator from some dry, boring, heady shit that most people don't want to. It's way more interesting to think that we're being controlled by Saturn, that there's a cube on Saturn that's controlling people than it is to imagine, what's really happening, which is an incredibly subtle form of math, a weird tidal flow of, I mean, we're looking at like, let's say we'd gotten hit by a fucking meteor, man. Let's say it had happened. It might happen. It might happen. But let's say instead of the pandemic, we got meteors. So meteor smashes into some small city in Europe. And but it's a it's a good size meteor. It's like three Hiroshima's kicks up a bunch of dust in the atmosphere. It's raining ash all over the planet. And so, you know, guess who is going to be wearing masks outside? Everybody, because they see the dust raining out of the sky. You're going to look like an asshole for not wearing a mask. No one's going to tell you to wear a mask, but they're like, you know, you're breathing in fucking cancer is fucking ash, right? You're not going to wear this shit, man, because I don't want to breathe my own CO2. But with it, the reason the pan a pandemic is so I think insidious is that you go outside. It's a beautiful day. I know you are. And especially one where you've got a what's it called? Not hibernation. Incubation period that's so long. Yeah. You go outside. It's a beautiful day. You pass people. You don't hear a single cough. You feel fine. Everybody's fine. You're the fuck. How easy would it be to think this is hysteria? Yeah. Come on. Look at the birds we're singing. It's a beautiful day. I don't know anyone who's got this shit. This is just some fucking hysteria. And so it'd be very easy to go outside and believe the earth is flat. I mean, sometimes I still sometimes I'm outside and and I still think to myself like, what do you mean the earth is right? It's just not an intuitive thing. It's hollow. Shane. But it is. It is the earth. Listen, we can talk about that in other podcasts. But what I'm saying is what we have here is one thing that isn't brand new. It's just a pandemic. It's it's new for our generation, but it's not new to the planet. This happens all the time, just like meteors. The problem is this this thing that isn't new, but it is new in the sense that it's a new virus for us to deal with is that it's meeting a new landscape where we are all connected. And so to me, this is where we're this is the problem, which is that I and this is I believe this is a conspiracy theory that I believe right now. I think that there are groups of people, some of them state sponsored, some of them just like shit to servers who are intentionally trying to freak people out right now. And I think that there is a an organized an organized effort to do this. And I think that I don't know who's doing it. I don't know why they're fucking doing it. But I think that a lot of people are being intentionally misled by I think state actors from other countries who are just trying to kill Americans by getting them to stop wearing masks. I think it's like so it's like they didn't start the pandemic. They didn't COVID-19 jumps out of a fucking pangolin that a monkey shit on whatever it comes out of a lab, whatever. It's not like they made it. It's like they were waiting for the next pandemic. And then when things were when there was a lack of stability, they enacted some kind of horrible info campaign to get into the message boards and to get to the most vulnerable people. And you know what I'm saying? That's what that's what I think is happening. Yes. Yes. I would agree with that quite a bit. Yeah. I mean, first off, this is not my area at all. And so and as someone who's a better, you're a better thinker about all of these sorts of things than I, I mean, I, I don't have a doubt in my mind that there's all sorts of people jumping on the instability of our country and trying to take advantage of it. Yeah. With varying intent, like there, I don't think it's all coming from one group. I think there's people with varying intent. I think there's probably environmentalists who have a con who I really do want to lower the human population recognizing that a significant drop in the global population is good for the planet. I have talked with environmentalists who like early on in this that I like I kind of couldn't believe what it was like they were giddy, you know, at the idea of I'm not talking about people like actually working with environmental organizations or anything like that. I'm just talking about like, you know, hippie friends of mine, big into the environment. It was like they were fucking giddy to, to hear the idea of and, and sorry, I cut you off, but, but that is to know you're filling in the blanks. I mean, it's like, I think that the, you know, we can use logic to come up with a theory of social psychology psychology that, that transcends any like specific conspiracy theory. And this is like, man, I was, if you just watch the history of the Nazis rise to power, Hitler's circle of evil, I think it's on Netflix. It's really creepy. It's fun to watch. It's really a fuck fucked up thing, but great depression. You needed the Great Depression to get a Hitler. And so once, and this is like a ridiculous thing to mention, I was in a Uber in New York talking to a Syrian Uber driver. He was talking about ISIS and just saying, Oh no, they just always show up when there's war. They've been doing that for thousands of years. Whenever there's war, they just sort of emerge this group of fanatics that exploits the conditions of war to gain power. So anytime there is instability in the world, certain factions begin to exercise asymmetric warfare techniques, info guerrilla warfare with some with, I don't know. There, I think there could be literally a hundred different factions that all have good reason to get out into the public that you shouldn't wear a mask. And, but what they all have in common is they know that if people don't wear a mask, it's going to cause this disease to go on and on and on and weaken the global economy and kill a bunch of people. That's what they all know. So they want to prolong the pandemic as long as they can. And the smartest, what's the smartest way to do that? Get people to stop doing the one most pragmatic, simple thing you could fucking do to stop the spread of this shit. Get people to feel ashamed of it. Get societal pressure and make it political. What are you some fucking pedophile? Are you some leftist pedophile? Is that why you're wearing that mask? You know, use as much, do whatever you can. Also, and I'll finish on this little dark point. Imagine this. What if some evil social psychologists had done a study recognizing that the people who are not wearing the masks who are more likely to get the disease are actually do represent certain demographics, do represent certain genetic qualities. Like maybe there is a safe bet on intelligence or education levels for people who are deciding not to wear a mask. I just saw a study on that today. And what if you just, you wanted to exploit that because you were like, yeah, let's just get rid of those people. I just want to get rid of those people. And I know those are the very people who are going to believe me when I tell them that it's the fucking sadness that want them to wear the mask. Yeah. And so you know what I mean? I'm just saying like we have to watch out. We have to watch anyone out there who's feeling like wearing a mask is a crime against humanity or an indication that you're part of the new world order. You need to, if you're going to accept that as a conspiracy theory, you should listen to my theory too and really let it roll around in your head a little bit and ask yourself if you might be being manipulated by someone who wants you to get sick or who wants you to kill your parents. I mean, this is, I think there's pretty strong evidence for this having happened with drugs, with, you know, putting different crack and math and other things, you know, in certain communities. Maybe not math. Math seems like a different thing altogether, but crack was definitely targeting black communities, it seems, and it seems like a lot of the, for sure, a lot of drug stuff, kind of, so it wouldn't be unprecedented. It would be quite the gamble to think that, to think that you were above one of these dummies spreading it to you or your kids or having your kid. I mean, I will say that it's possible that I'm only talking to the nice scientists, and I am in academia, you know, I am going through academia. What I'm not doing is interviewing people that are doing research within corporations, which would be a different thing to definitely be very wary of, and there's obviously going to be biases there. But I will say, just like, you know, look at a socially distanced comedy club or something like that, which I think as someone who makes 90, 95% of their living off of live performing, I would love to be able to perform tonight. I think it's not the best idea in the world. But there's obvious motivation for comedy clubs and comedians to tell themselves a story that this is okay, that this is going to, that you can do a meet and greet afterwards, and everyone in that showroom knows the risks that they're taking and blah, blah, blah. Money is an incentive and it drives, and self-deception is one of my very favorite things to blab about. It's something I tell myself I know a fair amount about. But there's also, you know, of the academics that I'm talking to, one thing to keep in mind is that the number of actual people working on, like say, a COVID vaccine is a tiny percentage of academia. Most of academia is like English professors and physicists and scientists that say had to kill off all of the animals in their labs when this happened. All of these academics who, the reason why I'm able to do a show called Stand Up Science usually in tour with and have them get up on stage in front of people is because a lot of these academics love teaching. It's their stage. They love getting up in front of, they can't do that right now. A lot of these are just like, I'm talking through them in Zoom and watching their like four-year-old children come in and interrupt the conversation as they're pulling their hair out and working twice the number of hours as usual for, no one got a pay raise during a pandemic. Instead what happened was, hey, infectious disease people, I know you're working on AIDS. You've been doing a good job making it something that is very manageable to something that was like a death sentence over the last 30 years and you're going to keep on trying to make it so that it doesn't, which did you know, I just found out with talking to an AIDS person, did you know that you can take, if you have HIV. You mean like an AIDS scientist? An AIDS scientist, yeah, someone who researches HIV. Okay. If you have HIV and you're in an early stage of it and you take the medication, like you, there's almost a 0% chance that you could give it to somebody else. You could have all the unprotected sex you want. If you take the pill, one you're supposed to have like a 0% chance, that person instead is being pulled away to work on COVID stuff. No one's happy about this that I've talked to. I will say that the infectious disease people are a lot more alarmist than any of the social stuff. Like I remember when you texted me early on in this thing, I was hanging out with a business professor friend of mine and we were talking about this and it's like, this is clearly mass hysteria. So everyone, because we're just used to people panicking way too much from the things that they see. Of course. That's the history of it. Yeah. See on the news. But the point is, is that, think that through a little bit, I mean, for the percentage of people that would, for the percentage of people, scientists that would benefit from say a vaccine as opposed to all of academia that just wants to get fucking back to normal, there's no one scientist that's smarter than the whole of academia. And there's a peer review process. And by the way, that's not perfect either. As you're talking about conspiracy theorists telling the most fanciful stories, scientists been the most fan, I just retweeted something today that was like, you know, an academic breaking down how to write the best title. And for him, it was advice to academia. The reason why I tweeted it was because I thought that people would maybe want to see that like academics are kind of flawed in this way as well, which is the most exciting title leads to step two, the most number of people reading your abstract. The most exciting abstract leads to people actually reading your boring fucking methodology. And maybe you're getting a chance to get that published so that maybe you can get funding. These fucking scientists are working on like shoestring budget. I had a person on my on my show who studies fish hearing cells. It's the little they're called hair cells. It's what it's what we hear with. We have them as well. And when their hearing gets damaged, it regenerates. And she's trying to figure out how humans, when our hair cells damage, they don't regenerate. That's why we lose our hearing. So how can we get our hair cells to hear like fish? Yeah. And regenerate. This is amazing. Like if we were able to just never have to worry about losing our hearing again, I mean, she has like a budget of like eight hundred or like eight thousand dollars to study. But wait, what you're saying is because like you think the the idea is that these scientists are living in these beautiful, yeah, the ivory tower, the idea of like ivory tower and stuff like that. Yeah. I know you don't have this idea, but there's a lot of people that do. And I go in my usually under normal conditions, I do all of my podcasts remotely, I travel to them. So I've been to over three hundred different scientists, labs, offices or homes. And these are not luxurious quarters. That's, you know, that's interesting, man. I've never thought of that angle. This is not the fucking place where you teach X men. This is like they're not living in some ivy, like ivy entangled mansion in New England. These are people who are living in shitty fucking apartments, like you've dedicated their lives to truth. They're not getting paid anything for doing that. And certainly they're not getting paid big fat fucking buckets of money from the Illuminati for inventing some doom vaccine. That's what you're saying. But who makes a good amount of money is there is an incredible in terms of supply and demand. There is an incredible demand for us to be told more exciting narratives and narratives that that validate what we wish to be true. And there is very little supply out there. So one of the, one of the trends, hold on, Shane. So Shane, there. All right. Yeah. Well, we left off. We're making the case against people who think that we've got these mad scientists who are getting shit tons of money when in fact it's like a diverse group of people with various you know, realms of expertise of which, you know, virology is a tiny percentage. So you're just, I think, trying to like eliminate the idea that we're dealing with the traditional conceptualization of what elite looks like. These people aren't driving Mercedes and stuff. And if people are interested, how I book my podcast is usually fairly random. So if I'm going through Ames, Iowa or something, I'll see if like Iowa State, I'll just like look through their departments, see if someone's like, Oh, they have the biggest virtual reality lab in the country. I'll see if I can contact someone. So it's not what I'm saying is it would take some pretty insane work to create some veil that I'm not seeing through where they're like all of a sudden putting together some tiny office space that they only do podcasts with comedians in to give the air that, you know, they aren't drinking champagne or whatever all day. Right. But what I will say is that one of the trends that I've seen is that there is, there's a high demand where we left off as I said, there's, there's, there is a high demand for the information that we want to hear about and the most exciting information. And so scientists that do deviate from the scientific method and often like get fired from being, by being manipulated by this, like maybe getting corporate money or something like that. They often write a book, have an insane Twitter following, get, make the rounds on popular podcasts and, and, and have a bestselling book because it's like disputing the common narrative. Most of, most of like these, say, red pill academic types that gotten some sort of dispute with that, with academia. I'm not saying that they don't have a point they do and they're, and there's, there's say like Quillet is a, is a good example of a publication that's just like believes that academia is two PC or too much censorship. So it's, so it's scientists that are pushing back against that. The thing is, is that, is that there is a lot of those people when I look, those people have like 50,000, 100,000 Twitter followers. The guests that I have on my podcast, if they have a Twitter account, they have like a thousand Twitter followers, maybe just like other, you know, they're not getting fame and fortune from any of this stuff. But you're, but you're also, it's, it's financially, you're going to make more money being controversial as a scientist. If you're in it for the dough, you're going to make more money by sort of going against what the data is showing, because it's like exciting. It's romance. It's like scintillating to imagine that everyone was wrong and you're right. Be the one out of 10 doctors that tells you that you don't need to brush your teeth and people are going to be like, well, fuck, I always hated brushing my teeth. This, this dentist says I don't need to, I'm going to buy their book about that and follow them on Twitter because this person seems awfully outspoken about why we don't need to brush our teeth when it's just, you know, us wanting to can believe a more convenient reality in addition to a more exciting narrative going along with it. One we don't need to brush our teeth to there's been an evil plot getting us to brush our teeth our whole life. And I hope we don't. That's as far as we explore dentistry because I don't, I don't know it. But, um, so, so there's that then I also hope that at some point I would, I would love to tell people that I hope that I'm not being an alarmist with any of this, that, that I'm attempting to look at this from a pragmatic way. And I think that, I think that there are ways that we can get through this pandemic with like some fairly simple new habits that lead to us having productive, meaningful, happy lives and also treating ourselves better and whatnot in the process. And I think that I think there's psychological, yeah, I don't, I don't think that there's any reason to panic. I don't think, you know, one thing that caused me to panic was from a virology standpoint was the, um, was the kind of social uprising, the Black Lives Matter protests that was like, it had me so excited from like as someone who was just like, yeah, fucking defund the police, defund the military where we're at it, like defund the police. That's not going nearly far enough for me. You know, it was like, normal Shane was like dreaming for this moment and then, but then seeing, you know, all of these people collecting and being like, oh fuck, like first off viruses don't care what color you are and listeners might be interested if they don't already know. There's no age, health, race, anything that's been associated with actual susceptibility to getting. It doesn't, it doesn't seem to, it seems, it seems that no age, race, sex, or anything else or health, um, makes you less susceptible from getting it. Oh, but it's the symptoms. It's the symptoms. Once you have it, there's, there's enormous individual differences. I gotcha. And, and, and then there's misunderstandings like obesity. It's not obesity. It's, it, it is weight on the top of the chest and neck, uh, so you could, you could still have a big ass, um, you could still have your big sexy ass, but, but if you have, if you have extra weight, you know, it'd be, it'd be like trying to put someone on a respirator and then setting phone books on their chest. Got it. So, so no face sitting. That's where the, if your friend has a sexy ass and you have COVID, this is not the time for your friend to sit on your chest and face. Yeah. Yeah. You don't need to avoid your friend with that big sexy ass. But just, yeah, as long as they're not sitting on you, I get it. It's like, that's good to know. So that's very logical. That makes a lot of sense. And it's just like, yeah, if there's weight pushing down on your lungs and your lungs are like working through some kind of pneumonia, it's not going to help. Yeah. And, and this is, you know, another reason of like, maybe, maybe we don't need to fat shame on top of everything else that's, that's, that's going on. Um, and you know, so just some things like that. So, so anyway, the point is, is when I saw the protests, I was like, you, you put people together like this, this is going to cause a lot of issues. And I was actually confused and excited when rates of infection didn't go up in many, if not all of the cities where, where the biggest protests were happening. And, and the, my understanding is the speculation is, is this about intent where people that are going to approach, they weren't protesting science or a virus. Most of the people were wearing masks. Most of the people were trying to intentionally distance, even if they were getting, But LA is spiking now. Wait, what do you mean LA is like spiking and LA is spiking. Yeah. And, and so, I mean, I don't, I don't think anyone should be getting together in groups. I don't, I don't think, Wait, shame. Do you think the spike happening in LA right now is not connected to those protests? I have no idea. I mean, it hasn't spiked in Minneapolis and the other places that, Right. You would think it would be spiking in New York and all the other places, but it's just spiking in LA. That's so weird. That's, that's, that's weird. And the other, the other weird thing is that, is that heat and UV light, heat and humidity lowers the range at which droplets are, are going. So we're like probably really in for it in the fall and winter, not to be an alarmist. And then just, they just travel further and cold. And so I got nervous when, and I knew that there was like fundamental differences in policy, but I got nervous when, with Florida and Texas and Arizona peaking because I was like, well, fuck, now it's the middle of summer and it's peaking now. Yes. I get that people aren't. But I think that some of it might be attached to people being in air conditioning and being indoors because it is so hot right now. So I'm, my fingers are crossed. I talked to someone about this. They don't, they don't agree with me. They think it's more a policy thing. My fingers are crossed that, that it is fairly helpful to be outside in, in, in sun and that we don't need to panic as much about things like, um, say going to a beach or something. Right. If you're, if you're being reason or going for a hike, I, I mean, I, I go for distance hikes with friends all of the time. Do you wear a mask outside? Usually I'm not by anybody and I'm also, I'm, I'm also in Wisconsin by myself. And so, and when I say distance hikes, I go for hikes by myself all the time and I go for hikes with, with friends, like every few weeks, usually I wear a mask, um, when I, when I do that, I would say that the biologists that I talked to, if you were to follow what they're doing, they're on full lockdown that like with their kids, I, I've asked a biologist in town here to like go on a distance hike with me, they, you know, they're not interested. Um, and whereas, whereas like more of the site, social psychologists or whatever are, are more to be, you know, thinking that this is some, some of this is an overreaction. So anyway, the whole thing with the, the protest that scared the shit out of me was that I was like, well, what does discriminate is our healthcare system and our housing system. And so if, if minorities are going to be hit the hardest and people are collecting protests and then people don't have like a large enough home for an extra bedroom to quarantine and everything else. I, when I first saw that, I was just like, this is a fucking nightmare in terms of, in terms of the spread of this virus. And the fact that it hasn't spread more than a hat than I would have predicted that I think that that's at least an indicator that wearing a mask and being, and being mindful of distance can work pretty well. And the, the one thing that I see when I see people, people, the pictures of people protesting is I think people still have it in their head that if you wear a face covering, you can just stand right next to someone, which you absolutely cannot and should not do. Distance and, and the mask. So that's, you know, I, I don't know enough of this stuff about any of this stuff. I feel like I'm talking out of, out of school when it comes to. It's okay. I think you've been completely open about, and I don't think anybody is like, look, we started off the podcast talking about you were recently hospitalized. So I don't think that like, necessarily people are like going to be listening to either of us, like we're in the fucking CDC, we're, but, but I do think we represent a lot of people in the sense that we're just trying to work through the information we have in a logical way. Let me read you. Let me read you this, this, maybe you could break this down for me. I'd love to hear your theories on this. Argentine, Argentinian fishing boat docks with over 50 COVID-19 cases. Argentina is trying to solve a medical mystery after 57 sailors were infected with the COVID-19 after 35 days at sea, despite the entire crew testing negative before leaving port. The Etchison, Maru fishing trawler. Yeah, is now docked at a port in the city of Ushawi. As some of the sailors are hospitalized, according to the ministry, 57 out of 61 crew members were diagnosed with a novel novel coronavirus after undergoing a new test. This is a mystery as all crew members had undergone 14 days of mandatory quarantine at a hotel in the city of Ushawiya. Two other sailors have tested negative and two others are awaiting results. What the fuck? What is that? I mean, the only explanation I can think of was there was a false negative test or two within there because they think that you maybe need a certain amount of the virus to be detected by the tests in the first place. All right. Well, that's boring. The good news is, is that it doesn't seem like there's false positives. See, that's what I'm saying. That's boring. But it does seem like there's false negatives. Yeah, yeah. You're not selling any books on that. There were, oh, the test didn't work. It's such a logical thing to say. Probably one of the, someone was positive and the thing stuck in their body during the quarantine and just made it under the fence. This, this is the scariest thing about this to me is, is the idea that it's such a delayed onset. And, and the reason why virus, so when people are like, how, oh, this thing's like not deadly enough for my taste or what I like. I, I only, I only respect the extra deadly viruses. Here's some good news for people. You're probably not going to see viruses that much more deadly than, than this. They, they do come along and they do exist. But, but the, in the kind of co-evolutionary arms race of virus host interaction, the virus will, if it can, take as much advantage and as much energy from the host as possible. But if a virus kills off a host before it can be spread to another host, then that's the extinction of that virus. Right. So it might even, it might even, what I would speculate from that, and I think wrongly based on some academics that I've talked to recently that are infectious disease people, but from past of talking with the evolution of diseases, what I would speculate is that all of our distancing and all of those measures might lead to less severe strains eventually taking off. And then who knows if it's just a thing that we live with or whatever, but, but if it, if the only ones that are able to persist are the ones that take that much longer to actually do something to people, that gives it a lot more time to spread and, and everything else. So I don't know. But what about the idea that it's dust from a comet? It's dust from a comet? Yeah. See, that's where mine goes. Is that one? That's where mine, I just, no, that's my fear. That's, see this, if you just want to understand, this is how my brain works. When I read a story like that, when I read a story like that, what I think, and I know it's wrong. Oh, and the sailor story, you thought a little, they were all, oh, everyone's pointing at the shooting star. And then it came down and that's, oh, yeah, comet dust, that's a fun, well, I want to be in your mind then, that's, that's a beautiful, that's a beautiful little vision. No, you don't see my, so, so, no, because here's why my mind's terrifying when I let it go, do that, because it's not just like I think about that in a silly way, I'll be like, oh, I get it. So really, here's what's happening. There's some kind of interstellar dust that's making it through the Earth's atmosphere. And that's what, and it's raining. We've entered into the part of the galaxy that has COVID as a alien, and we're passing through the dust and it isn't spread by humans, it's spread by it rains out of the sky on us. And then. That's amazing. Thank you very much. And then, like, here's, what was that? And then, so, but then I've got an even better theory that, and again, I don't really believe these theories, but this is what my mind produces instead of what you just did, which I'm envious of, which is, oh yeah, the test was probably wrong. My mind says, how about this one, Shane, tell me what you think about this. So what has happened is the aliens have contacted the world's government, the main governments of the world, and they said they want to come, they want to share their, you know, technology with us, but human breath kills them. So any human breath. You need to wear masks. So you need to get the, yeah. They want so the, oh, wearing mask thing is coming because the aliens are giddy trying to get us to cover our faces because if there's too much human breath in the atmosphere, it like kills them. Yeah, no, it's, well, they could wear their own masks, but that's what sissy's do in their alien culture. Viva la nautuena masks! Masks are for sissy's. My name is Gornon 17, Emperor of the Glaxon Federation, and I will not sink to wearing a fucking mask for some goddamn monkey descendants with fucking poison breath. He's an impressive killer, but a little stubborn on the mask issue. I have not piloted this fucking death star for the last 7,000 Kornogs to land on a planet of fucking monkey descendants and put on a goddamn fucking mask. I've got 19 mouths! I've got 19 mouths, that would be, that would, if you think we're low on PPE, imagine their situation when you have 19 mouths, my God. Yeah, so I mean, this is what I love, you know, I think it's like, what I love is, is like embracing that, the infantile part of the mind, the imaginative, I don't even call it infantile, the imaginative part of the human mind and recognizing that like, we do have in us some kind of irrational ape creature that doesn't have time to do like science. And so, it arrives at these ridiculous conclusions that are always magical in nature, because the reality of what's happening is usually just so, A, I don't know, I'm alphabetizing, completely uncontrollable, and in the sense that like, it's way bigger than an individual. And also, it's not usually, it's not magical, it's just like, you know, you're talking about a thing that is like a kind of computer code that gets into our code, it doesn't interact well with our code, and it ends up disrupting our code enough that we die. And it's like, that's just fucking boring, it's just a boring, boring thing. It's actually pretty exciting, because viruses are like this half dead, half alive thing, that trick your cells into thinking that it's part of it, taking it in, and then the virus turns the cell into its own factory to put out other viruses. When I first read about the neurologic stuff, that scared the shit out of me, because there are things like the, oh, what's the thing that cats get? You mean feline leukemia, feline HIV? No, it's, it's amazing, it goes from, so this virus, yeah, yeah, it wants to get in cats, but it does that through getting in rats first, and in rats, it changes their, it changes their neurochemistry so that they're driven to the smell of cat urine that they would normally run away from, so that they go out and get eaten by a cat, which is what they eventually, and there's speculation that when a cat has toxoplasmosis, if humans are getting it, it's making them more fond of cats, and so that's where like these cat ladies are coming from. I just love that, it explains everything. And this is like, you've probably seen like the ants that get the mushroom virus that go, that go up, and so that's sort of, there's speculation that STIs cause people to be hornier, so that they'll be, and so that was my, when I heard neurologic thing, that's, that was the exciting story that my brain first went to, because there's things like rabies that shut down your ability to salivate, because it gets spread through like blood and saliva, shut down your ability to salivate, and then it pumps you full of adrenaline, or it shuts down your ability to swallow, rather. So you can't swallow, you start foaming, you're pumped full of adrenaline, you haven't stuffed in days, you're agitated and aggressive, and that's how it gets transferred to someone else. So that's where I first went when I heard, but it sounds like with COVID it's probably something much simpler, which is because of the respiratory stuff, and because of a response to an infection, there's some blood clotting, and then blood clotting is causing some of the neurologic issues, and I would think, without knowing much about that, that that's like somewhat good news in terms of something that would be treatable and manageable compared to the alternatives, like rabies turning us into aggressive zombies. Okay, okay, hold on a second, hold on. So is it possible, since we are talking about this crazy thing that viruses can do, you know, you go to someone's house, they've got cats, their house smells like cat piss, you walk in the door, you walk into this wall of cat piss smell, and to you, it's like horrible, you just want to get out because your mind is not infected, but they walk into that very same wall of cat piss, and they're like, smells of sweet, sweet home, and it's just because Docs of Plasmosis is like, you know, is like working with them, but isn't it possible that I mean, this is if okay, and again, these kinds of things, man, they really make me scratch my chin at evolution, just to imagine that that evolution could be that precise, that the mutations can be that precise. But oh, well, it's not that it's just that most of them are failures. That's that's just kind of like the survivorship bias of seeing the ones that actually split off rather than the millions of and billions of evolutionary dead ends that were like horrible kind of ideas. There was a time when some eyes would get Docs of Plasmosis, and they like the smell of strawberries. And so it didn't do anything. And then there was the Docs of Plasmosis time when they like to swim and it would just drown a bunch of mice, didn't work. But finally, cat piss, that's what works to keep it going. And so they just randomly selects, it's a slot. So but I mean, so could it be that one of the qualities of COVID-19 is that it makes you judge other people for wearing a face mask? Like that you don't mean could it be that it's neurologically when you're asymptomatic, it makes you want to go online and tweet about how you think it's fucking completely cowardly wearing masks. And you don't why not? If I mean, if like if that if things can be so so and I don't mean intentional, but so specific, yeah, to what better side effect than to for fucking humans to be embarrassed by wearing a mask. It's the ultimate victory for a I mean, novelty and new. Yeah. And I mean, the masks are scary too. And they're just a reminder that there's a virus going on. I don't know. I saw some clear ones the other day. So you could still see people smiling. That's cool. Maybe we'll figure out work arounds for it. But but yeah, I I'm I'm pretty hopeful that this is just a respiratory virus that has a lot of asymptomatic that that also is is is something that seemingly might not always produce antibodies, which means you can get it again. That's the other thing is like the reason why early on that people were a little bit alarmist, including myself, was because of the unknown and the reason why it's frustrating when people are like, but scientists said this and now they're saying this is because like they don't know and they're changing and hopefully they'll continue to change their mind and hopefully there'll be, you know, better news coming. But but one of the things that they didn't know early on is can you get it again if you've got it and it seems like there's already cases of that. And so when people are like people, I'm not talking about going on social media, I'm talking about just run of the mill folks, rural folks in Wisconsin that I hang out with their their attitude is often I just want to get this thing like I have an aunt who's like, I just want to get this thing and get it over with. It's like it's not the fucking chickenpox. That's a cold. Not it works like a not only can can you get it a second time. But when it's when it's when it's create one when what we do know is that it's it's negatively impacting the people with pre existing respiratory issues. If if you were a healthy person that got COVID once and some people that are asymptomatic are having lung issues months later that shows like it looks like they have pneumonia months after this and they were asymptomatic when they actually had it. Does that mean when those people get it again? Now they had a pre existing respiratory issue. That's that's that's scary and and and so those are the things that I think people are still like let's hold our horses and and use some caution. But you know there's there's horrible crazy economic constraints and I know man that's the other problem people need to work people have to make a living people's kids need to go to school and we're in this horrific like like game of like do we like what do we do here is it do we just like let God roll the dice if a bunch of us are going to die we're going to fucking die or do we like hold up until the economy completely crashes and massive famine happens all around the planet and people are starving and killing themselves and going fucking crazy. It's like which it it's this dark thing where where in between we thought there might have been a way which was do these little openings have these rules wear a mask do this and this and this but it didn't work actually that didn't work it's spreading again and we tried to do a little bargain with it to see if we could open up the economy knowing that yeah fuck on one side we're risking giving a viral pneumonia to people with autoimmune disorders people with lung problems could that could die from it and but then on the other side we've got parents who can't get money for their kids parents who need like also we've got people on the so-called front lines who can't afford childcare and that's what school used to be so now we're going to lose yeah like people who are medical professionals because of this and so you end up in a satanic horrific binary right which is just like what do we do here are we are we do we just say fuck it and like get in there and like yeah maybe i'll die an agonizing death and maybe you will or do we say no no no i don't want to die i don't want to risk that that kind of death sit back wait for the riots to start wait for society to truly collapse into a kind of medical authoritarian police state as people begin to like bring tanks into the cities to push people back who are beginning to like be like fuck it i gotta live i want to be outside it's like what which one do we choose and then to make matters worse we've got a fucking lunatic running the whole thing who makes no sense like not like makes no sense like he's saying different stuff like literally just a garbled fucking colegula level nero it is so crazy so that's happening on top of it all and then it's a political thing because of all that which is like and and and if he gets if he gets booted out the the the months following aren't going to be the smoothest transition in the history of passing the presidential baton either but um so i mean i would say in my you know i would say that in my like like when i like to tell myself unrealistic fanciful stories it's that perhaps there could be a way of realizing like what we did was have two strict of lockdowns what we did was have two strict of universal blanket lockdowns everywhere you're locking down wyoming and everywhere else before you actually needed to in ways that were an overstep and i can tell this from following all my la friends on twitter because it's a very different experience being here in wisconsin where people just aren't being um you know people's rights or whatever you know there's not there's not curfews there's not there's not the same pressure being put on people in small town midwest communities um you know masks are still voluntary in places and and everything else and and so if there was it as much as for for everyone's fear of like science and and um and the terminator robot taking over or whatever eventually and giving our uh just giving everything over to artificial intelligence i would much rather there be some sort of a universal like algorithm that is like here's the population density of an area here's the number of free hospital beds here's the number of cases in this area and then there's levels of opening that are considered acceptable here's what's considered an essential worker in this area here's a more expanded version of an essential worker here here's um here's this this area has service air it has service industry and restaurant open for just essential workers first that are taking precautions and then expand from there i would take that over what's happening now which is is your governor red or blue because that determines whether you ever get to go outside again or if it's fucking spring break in myrtle beach and like and and so then what's happening is is when there is an overreaction in a lockdown then people say something like oh look nothing happened look the the number of deaths weren't what they projected it would be one i would say to that that nothing happened happening would have been a dream scenario that's in fact what we're going for with the quarantine nothing didn't happen something happened and two the the reason why the the number of deaths were half of what the mainstream scientific infectious disease people and people that model pandemics were projecting was because they actually didn't give humans enough credit they factored when they projected that there would be 200 000 deaths by may they fact they thought 50 percent of the population would actually follow guidelines and take precautions and wash it about 75 percent of people did it and it was half the number of deaths which is not insignificant when you're talking about something that has had an average rate of of uh spread of two people for every one that has it you got to get that under one and then it goes away if if it's two that's exponential growth and then you have the spanish flu and that's a that's a tricky number that like how are they quantifying that and everything else you know is a different is a different thing but there is like like south korea they did mass and crazy amount of testing and they were they pretty much had their freedoms um there was there was a um there was a case of someone who was symptomatic and symptomatic does mean you can spread your it's more you can spread it more uh because they're coughing and shit and and it has a higher load um in your slide but but a person that was symptomatic went out to a dance club and so everyone else that was getting testing and doing everything right was able to go to a fucking dance club in live life normally and then one fucking symptomatic person got a hundred a hundred people that night i mean that's that's that that's exactly what you just described is the problem of having dense populations is that there is a certain percentage in any given population and where there is definitely going to be one completely died in the wool asshole like someone who's like putting on their sweat pants and their cool fucking dance their day their medallions and shit they're like they see that there's a dj they like they're like fuck it you know what fuck it i'm just gonna go dance tonight i'm gonna dance this virus away and then boom it like this is the problem is like we're dealing with this like generally human beings and my experience are wonderful amazing yes beautiful beings that try to help as much as they can sometimes they get freaked out but generally awesome but there's always that one yeah and the the other side of that is all of the people doing everything right don't deserve motherfuckers like me yelling at them on twitter about how serious covid is they already know they've already heard it on a loop i'm tweeting at i'm they don't know like i'm tweeting at like a old high school buddy that i just talked to who's sitting at a bar that i just had a frustrating conversation telling him like why this is an actual thing that really exists and then i tweet about it to blow off steam most people are following a lot and then and then when you do that i mean it's like the trump thing when trump i got off twitter when trump took office because of this but it was it was like uh you know is he a bad president yes but like when people when people when it was like every single day people needed to then even even the anti-trump people started being like all right yeah like we fucking get it and now it's like you know what maybe i'll vote for this guy because he's because i'm sick of being annoyed by all of these people saying the same thing over and over again that's something that i've been thinking about a lot too like i don't want to be perpetuating that i think that i have it's a yeah well i think that i've made a lot of mistakes in how i try to communicate these things along the way i know i was like half drunk half the time i was tweeting for a couple months tweets or digital sneezes i mean that's the bottom line it's like if you're tweeting any any bit of information you're sneezing data into the void that can infect other people's minds and and you know we don't want to deal with we we don't there's this is like a i think a boundary that nobody wants to fuck with because you know when you start recognizing the viral nature of information itself whether it's true or false yeah then you run into some real freedom of speech issues right none of us want to lose the ability to tweet any crazy ass fucking thing we feel like tweeting we're drunk we're on pcp we want to tweet about whatever the fuck it is i don't want some council of elders to tell me hey you know that that pcp tweet you did about how the way to cure covid is to lick toilet paper after you wipe your own ass that's like not a cool thing that you did and some people so we're gonna we're gonna you can't do that anymore but but that being said you know i think this is and this is what i love about this particular pandemic philosophically is like yeah you realize that a digital reflection of covid 19 is appearing in our data feeds and so it's like a thing this is what and this is what i'm saying with this new situation of the internet you we get to see something wild happen which is that covid 19 imprints itself into the data feeds and then in that imprinting it continues to be virulent but in a completely different way it has a digital component is what i'm saying and this is something when yeah i think when people are studying disease i think that it's well worth looking into models of affection in the uh what do you what do you call it the no no sphere whatever models of infection in the in the ecosystem of the internet and you'll begin to realize that now when we get a new disease now we get a new virus it is actually going to exist digitally it's going to be digitally replicated and spread not as like a actual viral pneumonia but add in a in a mimetic way exactly that it lives in the internet just like it lives in ourselves it invades people's minds theories and philosophies connected to it it's in a similar fashion but it gets disseminated through twitter facebook instagram ideas evolve and they replicate and they they they detach from the minds that they originated from they take on a life of their own and they can get powerful enough to hijack us to hide ideas the ideas themselves that now they're they don't have conscious intent they don't ideas don't know what they're doing they're just existing in this thing that we can barely really even conceptualize and then hijacking our minds which sometimes leads to then the replication of different whether it's viruses or i mean if you look at the like um um like like joseph smith who got who got ran out of uh ran out of everywhere and and you know at first was like hey i know where to find gold put them in jail for that and like oh hey i know where you can find god okay i can't put put them in jail for that but we'll run them out of town and has like 50 followers and then and then um you know his wife catches them cheating says oh well god says you can have multiple lives and after he came up with that idea that idea took off and and created the fastest evolving religion in all of human history it spread faster because it's just some dude walking down the street with two ladies and a bunch of other dudes to be like hey buddy what's your secret like well i've been going to this new church oh new church you say i've been thinking about i've been thinking about getting a little more interesting yeah well look listen man this is to me uh an area of study that i think is so worth investigating because what we're talking about here is a symbiosis that is being achieved between a virus and the internet and you're and so so so like what the ideas that you would want to be floating out there would not be ideas that help a virus you would want the ideas floating out there to kill the fucking thing to stop it but when you realize that there actually are asymptomatic carriers of a meme literally asymptomatic because they don't have the virus but they're working for the virus and their invitation to people to not wear masks and so that to me is fascinating in the sense that with uh i think it's cordyceps right that gets the ants to climb up on the high thing and blow up in the fungus turns other ants into zombies or like we were mentioning toxoplasmosis it gets into cat shit right and then it gets into the nervous system of people who breathe the spores creating a different relationship with the cat in this case we have a virus that is unintentionally exploiting a brand new technology so that which ideas are being spread through the contagion of people looking at their social media and so to me this is where i'm beginning to think that social media itself uh you know the that we have to start looking at it as a vector of the pandemic uh you know what i mean like a disease zone yeah i and uh just pragmatically speaking um you know that my last trip to the psych ward i refused meds i didn't go on mood stabilizer or anything else and um and it was it was just this wonderful experience in terms of it it was cut the first time that i was there i felt like the meds kind of interrupted my thought and so i couldn't i couldn't get to the end of what i was trying to figure out and anyhow what what um what what the best thing for my mental health was that i was taken away from my phone and computer and then i just chose not to watch tv um and for for one week and that was it i went i went from thinking time travelers were after me here whatever else to just the most mentally healthy i've been in one week of just not having a computer and not and not having a phone and think about that and yeah and and that's something anyone anyone can potentially just take a break from that so because when we were talking about um you were mentioning earlier how not everyone has the capacity to think through these things well not everyone has the time i mean we kind of make our living uh like we're we're rewarded for getting to sit around pondering you know and um so there's intuitive thought which comes first and then this impressive deliberative thought this sometimes referred to as system one or system two system two being the deliberative thought this kind of prefrontal cortex that evolved later on it's really impressive um for for all of our lack of control that we do have as humans compared to other primates we're killing it but much like a cheetah um that that has this incredible like superpower of being able to run really fast what it does afterwards is it collapses it uses all of its energy it can run like that for about two minutes and we're kind of like that with our decisions so uh so so they test this and there's like it's called decision fatigue or ego fatigue where they'll give someone easier or a hard test and then they'll have them walk walk down a hall um to turn in that test and in the middle of the hall there's a table and there's either like healthy snacks or cookies on the table and if someone had the hard test they grab the cookie if they had the easier test they're more inclined to grab the healthy snack because they have those resources available to make the smarter decision and we're talking about uh a condition where this is this new novel stressor that people have that's not just a fear of dying a fear of losing your job it's also learning all the sudden we're all learning about supply chains and virology politics and like and the news is trying to terrify us and it's keeping us in sim system one all the time and and if you want to think about conspiracies i mean i i think they're pretty i think a lot of them aren't that hard to pull off in our fairly straightforward if you keep people in their system one that's where that's where their money is that that's where they're loosed that's that's where the cash in there that's where they'll swipe the credit cards if you keep people in there by scaring them or or or just or just making appealing to their kind of face value emotions or keeping them tired or keep or keeping them drunk alcohol impairs you know that system one that that's going to be um you know people aren't going to think out where their money and they're easier to control and that's and that's what and that's what social media is doing you know so you have this terribly horrible scary stressful situation that already um uh inhibits your ability to use this system to use your deliberative or system two to use your deliberative there there's a great classic book thinking fast and slow is like the popular one most people would reference that i'd recommend but um and and then it keeps it also keeps you it keeps you clipping clicking it keeps you tuned into the news and it's just such a it it's like you don't you don't really even need any bad actors on like a social media front for it's already doing it and then on top of that you throw in a little bad act it doesn't even need to be bad acting it can just be like the narrative that you want to tell yourself that like hey people know what they're getting into with these cigarettes you know if if they smoke the cigarettes that's their own fault so i i can sleep at night selling cigarettes to people but wait shame you know is there any correlation and i get what you're saying is but and this is something you could help help me hopefully it's not true but isn't there some correlation between this high level of anxiety that you know fight or flight every hour of the day that's being induced by technology and a weakened immune system yes uh yeah so so stress sympathetic response so this is why this is why like meditation and yoga and stuff are great for you or even singing which um which activates more of the parasympathetic response to relaxation and um which is kind of just think of it as like short-term long-term so this is um this is i happen to have is it this is a only book you'll ever need i can't read it because my camera's blurry be behave by robert sapolsky it's uh it's a massive like 700 page book it's it's um it's fairly complicated but it's he's very funny and a great communicator so it's readable um but he he does a lot of stress response stuff um and and yeah so it's the idea is is that when you're under threat you this is about delegating energy in the way that most mammals delegate energy is when there is a short-term threat that energy is delegated to short-term functions like activating your muscles um so that you can run and get away and so um it takes that energy away from potentially things like the immune system but definitely your digestion definitely your sex drive any of those long-term things that you don't need right then and there to get away from that threat and this is part of the problem with humans being too smart for their own good is we have existential dread and and watching the news and and reacting to things that aren't actually in our reacting to a shark attack halfway around the world just to get to the point here what you're if that's the case and what you're saying is that the system one is being activated by our obsession with the internet and the technology uh of social media that then then the true symbiosis is happening with a virus that depends on a weakened immune system and and so yeah some probably not too in significant way by completely removing yourself from the news after having gained the information you need i think we all have the information which is we're in a pandemic you need to wash your hands you need to wear a mask you need to avoid you need to social distance from people if you're having any kind of symptoms at all you should stay home and you know i i think those are like the main points having gained that information there is no longer any increase in survivability for you by staying online but in fact you're reducing your chances of avoiding getting COVID-19 every time you go online and activate those systems that freak you out yeah yeah but which might ultimately inhibit your immune system i tried to make a sketch about this early on about how how how um this this very idea of of learning um of learning that there's a virus that if you're stressed your immune system lowers so you can't so there's a very scary virus and you can't be stressed or you will get this you will get this virus so you're trying so my sketch was i did it with this girl like us trying to break that news to one another and like smile through the whole thing like so if you're stressed out you're gonna die but you don't freak out but there's a demon in the room that only eats people who are freaking out yes i don't know why they haven't done that as a movie instead of like the silence a demon that is only drawn to fear listen so to me i think that that is a good kind of closing point which is look yeah there's not just obvious hygienic things you could do right now that are gonna not just keep you from getting COVID but keep you from getting all the other diseases that haven't gone on fucking vacation right now just because there's like a famous disease we still got the flu we still got the regular cold we still got all the other bullshit out there there's like basic hygienic practices uh that you could do and we all know what those are but also because it's brand new to the planet there seems to be a new form of digital hygiene that people don't even know exists right and that would mean maybe turn off your shit for a little while right like stop going on there at night when you're up late you can't sleep that fucks your immune system up too right like all the like how much of this goddamn virus is how much success is this virus having solely because people are freaking the fuck out from being on their phones all day long yeah yeah absolutely and and also the other problem with the fear stoking is which i think is the most heartbreaking think about this for me is that to me this seems like such an opportunity for growth an opportunity to you know when you stress a system whether it's your own mind or a society or a culture or a government or science or the medical industry problems rise to the surface pretty quickly we're now getting a very clear look at a lot of problems that were below some of our conscious awareness or certainly um uh within were hidden from kind of the common zeitgeist or whatever and and we could be we could be taking opportunities just you know i'm taking opportunities to learn new skills and try comedic acting yeah things like that makes silly web series and stuff for the first time and and we could be doing things like that if we weren't so obsessed with with just the fear aspect of this because all of change is going to when they're self-driving cars a lot of people are going to lose their lose their jobs if people stop binge drinking and take better care of themselves a lot of service industries are going to be hurt from that we will need to learn to adapt and i think the hardest thing about all this for me is like holy shit is all of this fascinating you know normally Duncan if you were if you were if i was on the show and you're giving me a reminder to be be here be in the here in the now and be present i would like playfully push back about the logic but i have never been more of a believer in being in the here in the now and appreciating what is happening right now for the historical fascinating experience that it is and stop trying to pretend like this is going to be normal tomorrow and stop trying to pretend like it's something that it isn't and just experience it for what it is we might have sports games without an audience and that might be a little bit of a bummer for you but it's also something that they're going to be showing clips of a hundred years from now it's such a fucking insane fascinating thing that we get to look when you go to the grocery store and someone put an empty like early on i remember on twitter someone putting an empty milk jug on their head as a mask and i'm sure a lot of people were scared of that because they didn't see it as an opportunity like today i got to go to a grocery store and there's a guy with an empty fucking milk jug on his head not only that but he was probably the smartest fucking person in the grocery store yeah like how amazing is that how amazing to find out he didn't even know there was covid he was just like fuck it i'm gonna do it today the day's the day i finally do what i've been wanting to do for years where the milk jug and i would just say and i won't give a whole big science breakdown about this but if you if you want to increase positivity in life and i could break this down but we'll maybe do it another time small incremental gains so if it feels like you've lost everything rather than thinking you're just going to get everything back or or whatever or things are just going to take off tomorrow you're the way that lottery winners are never happy one year or whatever after they win the lottery people people that make tomorrow a little better than today and next year a little better than next than this year those are the people that have sustained happiness uh through their lives and part of the reason why i was so actively like a little bit alarmist early on is because just getting it in our heads that this is like a tough situation that it's going to be a long haul uh negative things go just the opposite way so when someone's paralyzed and you think how could you even live like that holy what a horrible thing to go through people that are paralyzed actually mentally recover quite well and figure out how to live with it people that do the worst are people that have like ms or something where every every week every year it's getting worse because that's where that that's the incremental losses are pure torture a sharp a sharp loss i could break down the neural science but but anyway a sharp a sharp loss it's really hard in the beginning and then there's small incremental gains towards progress after this you want to break your feet and then slowly recover from it you don't want to you don't want to get a neurologic disorder that leads leads to you deteriorating and you don't want to tell yourself that everything's going to be okay one week from now and one week have to go through this again and again and again if my best estimation of this is i'm planning my tour for fall 2021 and if it how if i start doing shows before that time that will be fantastic news everyone else trying to do shows two months from now they're going to be heartbroken you know i get it so you're kind of saying like look if you want to deal with this thing get real about it but also every single day there's like a chance to do some little thing like self-care style thing a little thing not a big deal have tea tomorrow or like you know take more baths or meditate or or maybe exercise for like four minutes tomorrow or whatever take little steps forward and then over the course of the lockdown or the time you're inside you're saying there's a chance to really achieve lasting happiness and boy if i had a magic genie that wouldn't allow me to get rid of this virus but instead would allow me to get this one psychological thing through to people what what what i would hope for was would be that that would mean that we do a soft slow incremental reopening that is little gains over and over and over rather than a full reopening that lasts for three weeks and then damn your your your hit all over again i think that's i think that's gonna crush people i think that's gonna break people's brains i don't think people are gonna be patient is the enemy of covid it seems like a kind of solid patience look shane this was a really enlightening conversation for me i'm really grateful you really helped me work out some ideas i have also helped me help frame me in a little bit here and there which i definitely need um thank you oh i'm grateful for you my friend i fucking love your show by the way i stayed up till five in the morning the night it came out watching it it's so good congratulations and timely well i know i wish it wasn't that's the thing i'd much rather it'd be less timely but hey shane tell people where they can find you do you have a patreon uh yeah i do patreon.com slash shane moss i just started putting some behind the scenes stuff i started doing my patreon during this i have like half of my podcast paid for with it right now so that's progress um so if you want to throw a small incremental gain on there terrific um shane moss ma uss.com um for my podcast here we are where i interview at least one scientist each week and it's not all covid stuff on a loop by the way i try to most of what i want to focus on is how is this impacting our sleep how is this impacting our psychological well-being and stuff like that rather than give people a virology week after week um uh so uh so that's the kind of stuff that i'm doing there and uh yeah i'm i'm oh speak if you are gonna follow me i would say that my instagram is a hair more positive uh then then my then the i would say twitter is the worst of who i am me too man we there's no doubt that twitter is in a particularly grotesque feedback loop of negativity right now there's sort of there's some beauty within that in ways if you catch me on the right but listen you are a positive person it's okay by the way i think any of us who've had any kind of online meltdown or terceness or anything it's all forgiven what the fuck are we supposed to do man no one knows how to react to this there's no right way to do this we're all losing our shit overtly or secretly you know i think that's something that's really wonderful about you is you don't hide the reality of what it's like to have mental illness you don't hide the reality and that for people like me who get depressed and have had mental illness and do have mental illness because once you have an endogenous depression you got a depression it's gonna come and go it means a lot to us you know because it's like we i think that you know hearing someone with such clarity and such an understanding of science use that very same clarity to like freely talk about what it's like sometimes in the old gyroscope gets off a little bit it's liberating you know because it's just part of what happens it just happens if you've got this a meat computer running your show what do you expect you know shane i love you man thank you for being on this show i love you about it hopefully i'll see you in 2020 i think 2021 i i i think i think vaccine by january uh influencer like yourself will get it by march i'll get it by may uh normals will get it by normals uh do you want to do a commercial for your 2021 tour that we can do in you could re-release in 2021 come out hey normals come out and then if you can convince people to take it and get there the the herd immunity which i'm skeptical will be able to that enough messaging will be able to get through then i'll be on tour by fall 2021 that's a very that's a very loose estimation so if you're listening to this in 2021 and we're all still alive and we beat this motherfucking thing come and see shane moss in 2021 until then subscribe to his patreon and thank you shane i'll see you out there had a great thanks buddy that

274^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 567: Russell Brand Transcript and Discussion^2023-05-27^Before you die you'll think of FedEx, all those trips you took to FedEx Have a man with face tattoos, or a gummy swans to you It will not make much sense at all, no visions of a puzzle ball To just photographic memories of notebooks on the FedEx wall You are in a zoo, a human zoo, and look at you now Dying like an animal you are in a zoo A human too and look at you now Just a dumb animal. No single come to save you. There will be no bright white light Just memories of being mad because they could get an address right You will not remember the many nights of sex that sunrise is in rainbows. Your only thoughts will be of FedEx. You are in a zoo in a human zoo. Look at you now. Dying like an animal. You are in a zoo in a human zoo. And look at you now. Just a dumb animal Hey, bad guy, I called you to the link What the fuck are you? I'm sorry, things happened every time I get that, but I do wanna read it It's only a few hours late G7 or another But you're always in the same day You're in for me 60 seconds late I'm so mad at you right? You were in a zoo and a human zoo. They turned all of the monkeys and the fucking junkies. You were in a zoo, a human zoo. So live as if you were living already for the second time. And as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now. What's up with that? What is up with that? What did it mean? I got Thomas Merton stuck in my head, okay? I started reading the seven story mountain. Is that it? Seven stories? I don't know how many stories are in the mountain. I'm still in the first few chapters, but he has this incredible writing style. You feel like you're there with him when he's in college. This is before he became the famous mystic, trappist author. This is when he was still in college and he's fucking pissed and lost and his dad dragged him all over the planet because his dad was an artist and his mom died of stomach cancer. And there's just this poignant, brutally descriptive moment when his father's dying in the hospital and he says, without some spiritual component in your life, when a parent dies, you just have to take it like a dumb animal. And just, it's just so hardcore. It's just so brutal. Is it true? Is it true? Is the only path to true tranquility, inner harmony, and peace leaning into a deity? I don't know. I don't think so. I don't think a deity would want that for the deity's creation. That would be really weird. Narcissistic, a huge part of parenting is learning not just how to be there for your kids, but how to not be there. You don't want to be a narcissistic parent. You don't want to make yourself the pillar, the the the the sun, the nucleus of your kids existence. There's something that I heard at a Rom Doss retreat about how to be with dying people. You should become a loving rock, something they can hold on to if they need to, but definitely something that they can let go of. You don't want to torture a dying person with guilt. You don't want them to feel like they can't die because of you. And that's a very easy trap to fall into. Similarly, when you're parenting, you've got to be a loving rock. You've got to let them not just clean to you, but push off of you. Otherwise, you end up becoming like a narcissistic parent. You have to help them differentiate. So if the alchemical maxim as above so below is true. Then my assumption would be that what we're experiencing right now in this current state of human evolution is differentiation from the deity, a chance for us to sort of wander. There really isn't much of a difference between what humanity is doing to the planet and what I did to the apartments I lived at when I moved away from home, that's the phase the humanity isn't right now. We're partying. We're not washing our dishes. We're leaving scattered bong remnants on our brooch infested carpet and we're acting like we're cool with that. So yeah, I get why Martin is so into the idea of making some connection with the divine because he was a trappist mystic and he did make the connection and it filled him with an eternal, never-ending well of absolute joy, gratitude, and compassion for those people who are still wandering in the darkness. But wandering in the darkness isn't the worst thing. My God, if you ever really wandered in the darkness, if you ever wandered around a forest with no flashlight at night, high as a kite, not sure where you're going, just wandering, climbing trees, finding bear cubs up there, throwing the bear cubs down. If you've ever experienced that, if you ever walked in a forest at night and thrown a bear cub at its mom, made that mother bear roll over in a form of submission to you, laid your head on that bear's stomach, soothing the upset cub and looking up at the moonlight, then you know there's a joy in wandering far from home. And I think that if God is the creator of all things and encoded within the creation is the possibility of finding joy, bliss, happiness, and the darkness too. It must be possible. You just have to try it sometime. The next time you're out in the forest, up in Alaska, I used to go up there a lot on my fishing trips. Just take a nice little night hike, find a grizzly. The moment you throw their cub at them, they immediately will roll over onto their stomach. A lot of people on their back, people don't know that. They think you're supposed to like get away from the cub. No, that's how you die. You want to survive seeing a grizzly bear with their cubs, throw the cub. I mean, don't hurt the cub. Fucking monster. Just like a sort of like an underhand throw. And they will just roll over on their stomach and you on their back and you lay your ad on their stomach They will let you nurse You suckle grizzly bear milk which tastes incredible tastes like Mars bars. In fact Mars bars the candy is 20% grizzly milk. I love the outdoors, but more than the outdoors, I really love the new legend of Zelda tiers of the kingdom. My God, what a game. I'm so happily addicted to that game right now. I mean, it's a narcotic. I've done narcotics. I've taken percassette. I've been injected with synthetic heroin by doctors. I know what it feels like. It's a wonderful feeling. To me, that's tears of the kingdom. It feels a little bit like some kind of technological opiate. You should try it. Even if you don't like video games, just try it. You won't believe it. How manipulative it is. Speaking of suckling at it, grizzly bears, teats. This game milks your dopamine, your serotonin, your happy goo. It is like a milk made with beautiful hands. Just milking your brain, edging your brain, getting your brain as close as it can get to the wonderful rush of succeeding in the game and then slowing in a little bit, making you shiver and shake and then at last a brain orgasm. And then just as soon as you've recovered from that moment of delight, something else will pop up out of the massive world that will grab your attention and the milking starts again. Zelda, it milks the dick of your brain like a professional edger. I don't know if there is professional edgers out there, but one can dream. Okay, fine, enough about whatever I'm talking about.

I'll be with you, take care of me, you will, I'll come with you. It's the Duncan Trussle, the American Trussle, the American Trussle. Russell, welcome back to the DTFH. We have a limited amount of time here, so there's no... We can't, we can't do any small talk. We got to dive right in. Are you familiar with the tarot? Yeah. Well, yeah, I mean, no, I don't know. I won't be able to name individual cards and what they mean. Or if tarot has an existence beyond tarot cards, I don't know about that either. Does any card in the major arcana pop into your head right now? Yeah, there's one that'sight skeleton and death and everything. And then when you gaze, oh, that's good. That one, that means you could have a lovely weekend. It's the worst when they do that because you're looking at their eyes the same way you look at a doctor who's about to tell you what scans are saying about you. Like, do you really mean I'm okay? So that's what pops into your head. Death. I mean, is that because of the current state of things on the planet, or is that some, is there some other reason that that pops into your head? My sense is that that is the sort of alpha card in the pack. And like as someone that's sort of a dilaton who knows very little about the cards, is like if I asked you about football, you might say Maridona or Pele or someone like that. I wouldn't even say that. I would be blank. It would just be a blank drone that would come out of me. Yeah, well, that's interesting. So that was the dumb first question for the podcast. So I'll jump to my second one. We've talked a lot, and I'm lucky that we have. Generally like about spirituality and things like that, but I must tell you, there's lots of things I love about your hustle, but one of the things, I guess you would call it the shadow side. I've never seen anybody crucify interviewers who are being assholes like you can. And sometimes I've watched, it's like there's many YouTube clips of you like really like destroying interviewers who are being like sarcastic with you or shitty, shitty interviewers like people who have some agenda to humiliate you or to get one over on you. And the way you do it is so brutal. I'm just curious, what do you feel like when you're doing that? Are you angry? What's the emotional state when you find that part of yourself showing up during an interview? Well, Duncan, we even know he's spoken a lot of times online and even though we don't spend a lot of time talking, even in the in the tarot of my personal mythos, your name and your face, evokes and your voice, especially your voice. Evoking me, immediate love. If someone says don't contrast all. Thank you. Love. Like if so, like it, like it, like it, I think you're warmth to you. And thank you. I, so, but I know a bit about you, but I don't know how much humiliation there might have been in your childhood or how much humiliation has played a part in who you are and how much of a persona or fortress of identity you may have had to have constructed to protect yourself. But for me, humiliation has played a sort of a pretty big role in my life. And I think it's formative. And actually in many ways, I see it as a gift because vulnerability is at the forefront of who I am. But I feel I suppose that if someone speaks to me in a way that I don't feel is in good faith that breaks the contract of we're in a conversation with one another. Like even though I know I'm pretty flawed in lots of ways and that can be a bit of a heel. I feel like generally in a discourse with a stranger, that's where I can come at it pretty pure. Like I'm not coming to it necessarily really wanting anything. Like I don't want to hurt anyone. I'm probably coming to it necessarily really wanting anything, like I don't wanna hurt anyone, I'm probably there for the obligation of promo or something like that. And also, I like talking to people actually. So if someone, if I feel like I'm attacked while in that environment, I feel that it's probably charged by a fear that I might face humiliation. As I've grown up and grown more spiritual, but I've become perhaps more aware broadly, become more aware of my own failings, the limitations of myself, the insignificance of any individual, but the infinite value of any individual. Someone's like, root to me, I feel like, man, feel like this is something that I'm gonna personally tolerate. I saw a comment once after, like, you know, so they show you the ego, it's certainly present then and by God it's present now. After one such appearance on a TV show where I think I'd been insulted. And someone went, I love the way that when he realizes they're being rude to him, you see him completely relax. And I really liked the idea of that compliment that when I feel like I'm being assaulted, that path of me thinks, oh here it is, this is that thing where I'm being attacked, that I always knew is going to happen to me, because it's happened to me in the past, I'm being attacked now. And like any sensible self interrogating person, questions their own value, questions their own choices, questions how they can improve, questions the errors made in the past. And I feel that because I'm engaged in that, I don't feel like anybody has the right to like attack me unless it's in pursuit of something higher and it never is Never is there always attacking you for some other reason It's very low to do that at all. I mean that like it's it's rude as rude can be someone's giving you their time They're coming on your show and then you decide to try to bully them in front of theoretically the planet. But I wanted to talk to you a little bit about this because I've been thinking a lot lately about the spiritual world or people who call themselves spiritual seekers or the modern version of that. And it seems like that aspect of humanity is off limits. You're not supposed to do that. You're not supposed to decimate someone who's attacking you, but you're supposed to put on some kind of weird bullshit, spiritual smile, or ignore it, or something like that. And I just wonder, what are your thoughts on that? It seems like there's just this severe imbalance in so many spiritual communities where that side of humanity, which is just as valid as the turn the other cheek side, is wiped off the table. Well, all our values now, well What are our values now? What are our values now? Like it feels like people have the agenda and the objective first and then the conduct follows rather than these are my values and my principles and then what unfolds from these principles and values I will have to accept. Like you just alluded to if someone's about to lay out cards or spilty leaves or read runes or cast the straws for their e-ching, I feel like, ah, now the negotiation with the real power happens. The spirituality and superstition often rides side by side. The an awareness that we live in shallow waters here on the material plane can easily lead a kind of dumb, horoscopic interpretation of the limitless. For me sometimes when I see a lady who does the eaching sometimes I think, oh, God, what dreadful thing will be undone. What terrible stories are about to be foretold. What awful foreboding am I to live through once again? And that's because I'm sort of aware of how little I know. Like, I don't sort of, I suppose, relish, like say, you know, me and you or me and anyone, I'd much rather have a loving conversation with anybody. I'd much rather have a loving conversation with people. If I go on to, like what for the sake of brevity and mainstream media show, like I go on, you know, and we deal with, you know, people that are combative and well equipped. I know you're a very intelligent person. If you set your mind to hurt in my feelings, you'd be able to do it. I know that Joe Rogan or Tucker Carlson, like these are people that are capable of a little bit of a surby tea when required and critical thinking and critical words. So when I go, like, talk to people that, sort of, like, I don't see as a personal thing either to tell you the truth. I just feel like it would be this ingenuous, not to respond and to be the viewer. And like, I am trying my, but I'm coming to a place where I recognize how little I know, I recognize how, how impossible it is to know anything other than a little. But what I do feel is we have to find a way to marry individual independence and the rights of the individual to be who they are, whether that's traditional and progressive, and the need for some kind of consensus around what our values are. It means that there's going to be some It means that there's going to be some generalities and sometimes appeals to the universal. If we're going to have a culture where it's like, well, look, we know that kindness is a value we're into or service or community or respect from people's freedom. It seems like those kind of values have metastasized in a weapons that are only void in pursuit of, I already know I'm right, and this is what I believe in, and you're this, and it seems like religion has become something for other people. Religions become something that shout across a wall, rather than practice in silence and solitude. Now, I'm not, I'm not, what I want to say, co-signing the secular idea that your religion is solely private. You must have a relationship with God, but that relationship with God is what allows you to be in the world and be of service and know that you're going to die and everyone you love is going to die and the cruel, barbaric, awful things happen and yet we must be of the world and love anyway. The relationship with God is not meant to be something that I used to underwrite some legalistic argument to bring other people down. It's meant to include redemption. It's meant to include humility for forgiveness, the potential for salvation, an ability to listen to other people and disagree with them. It seems, mate, that what we are living in now is And it seems me that what we are living in now is a game in all but the fact that it lacks a sense of play. Wow. That's right. You're right. It's some terrible Lord of the Flies kids game where they forgot they were playing game and it's transformed into this The worst sort of brutality. You know I've what do you ever watch that show naked and afraid? No, but I feel like you've mentioned it before so I can see Why would I'm talking to you? I never talk about this show. That's fucked up. Oh, no, I guess I don't know all of this is one of your main cultural references. Ram bass and naked in afraid. Well, I know where we're through Jeff. Do you ever got to say something about Ram bass? Something about Payouty or naked in afraid or American gladiators? You're alive, Vastinite, for three in these cultural extremes. This will be my last podcast, everybody. I'm done. I'm headed into the desert. 46 days of fasting to purify myself. Well, maybe I mentioned this to you. I don't know why you bring it out, but to me it's, there's dark things sometimes happen. These people, they're out in the woods naked They have to find food. They get lucky throw a rocket a squirrel and They talk to the squirrel's corpse and they will say I am so sorry But I need your energy and I find that to be so appalling because it's like it's lovecraftian. The squirrel in its last moment, some monkey descended as like apologizing for eating it. So to get back to this notion of weaponized spirituality, that is to me why it what's so horrifying about the way things have gone is instead of just like pure aggression Honest aggression. It's this aggression that has been Vailed with some kind of Suit open evidence and I don't know of anything more sinister than that. That is so sinister. This show is sponsored by BetterHelp. You know one of the bizarre things about living in modern society is that you can absolutely forget to take care of yourself, of your own body, and most importantly of your own mind. We're all caught up in all kinds of karma activities. Paying off that karma, paying off the karma debt, burning off the karma for past incarnations where we thought it would be funny to throw a Molotov cocktail into an orphanage and now we have things to do. We have to pay back and in all that payback you can forget that you, you also have to take care of yourself. Therapy can give you the tools you need to find more balance in your life so you can keep supporting others without leaving yourself behind. It does nobody any good if you work yourself into a Jack Torrance, Jack Nicholson shining froth. No one is going to remember all the wonderful things you did for them. If you come smashing into the bathroom with an axe to murder them because you're having a nervous breakdown. This is why we need therapy. I've certainly enjoyed therapy. It's helped me a lot and I will never stop going to therapy. It's the best. I need it. Maybe you don't need it. Maybe you're actualized. Maybe you're one of the 75% of my listeners who have been certified as completely actualized and eternally happy. But if you lay into that other 25% which is where I land, then I would highly recommend exploring therapy. Better Elbs entirely online.

No. Serial rapist, you know how they caught him? They realized that the string of rapes followed his tour through college campuses. And supposedly when he was like committing these awful acts, he would weep and apologize while he was doing it. And it's just so horrific. So the world somehow, to me, it seems like this is what we're seeing is like people are so afraid. Like when you're excursiating someone who is attacking you publicly, you're not, there's no like valing that is like I'm being sweet, no passive aggressive, it's brutal and justified, and there's something about that that seems to me like a great teaching for any of us who've been humiliated and don't want wanna be anymore. That's good, people need to see that. But yeah, these days, it just seems like we've become afraid of purely being that aspect of humanity. Is though that wasn't the aspect of humanity that got us where we're at today. Well, an inability to own the shadow as you, the term that you used when you introduced the subject is likely to mean that you cast the shadow elsewhere. If you're talking anecdotally at the level of the individual, it's likely that the shadow will be cast on a child or an animal in your family or a lover. If you took it out of culture, I often think of Baldwin's analysis, James Baldwin's analysis of your country, America, in which he said, what kind of culture needs to create the category of Negro? Why does this category need to be created? And what are the attributes that are given to that category in that racialized, a pejorative and using a Jungian analysis, shadow, determined other? Well, the Negro then was erasously incorrectly, reductively regarded as violent, animalistic, highly sexualized, rhythmic, spiritual, curiously aspects that you might find in the archetype of the shadow. In the homogenized, the dominator culture, the sexuality, the power, the violence, could not be owned and was carved out onto another. Why do you need to other, another group? Why do you need to demonize another group? What is it that you are incapable of owning. We regard to the sort of, what did you call it, pseudo benevolence. I feel that lacking real ceremony, we imitate ceremonies forms having lost touch with ceremonies function a manese function to create a space where we as partly material and a validly animal beings can access the divine sublime aspects of our nature that are perhaps beyond material, certainly they're difficult to measure. This sort of a sat and fatic weeping over the corpse of a recently slain Squirrel shows you how far we've come like the reference that people have is the movie avatar It self derived from Western accounts of what Native American culture was supposed to be like was supposed to be like, forgetting that in the evolutionary arc we are yet native, we are yet indigenous, in the 10,000 years since agriculture, in however many years it is, since we have evolved language, we are neighbors, we're tribal neighbors. That's where we still are. That time is nothing. That's no time at all has passed. Civilization is a firm of impersonation. It is a dance. We are lost in the uncanny. We have engaged in a zoological experiment that ended with us as animals in a zoo. Where can we find ways of re-engaging the way that we evolved so that we might have a meaningful experience here? Let us look at the ways where it's evident and obvious that we have become detached from our roots and that it is to our detachment and not engage in silly straw man arguments about how technology and medicine have advanced us and are you suggesting we should disregard all of those things, of course I'm not. But in the world of diet, you can see the excess of sugar and excess of fat is detrimental that we evolved to have scarce access to sugar and fat. Where in the settler realms will the conditions of a contemporary life be creating obesity of the spirit, diabetes of the soul, hardens these of the deep psyche, carcassias, across the roots that connect us to the ancestors Duncan? Yes, yes, that's right. And what will be the insulin? That will save our souls. You know, okay, this is when I went into my holy christian of phase, and I still chant holy christia, but I remember so much about it, so so powerful, but his divine grace, A.C. Baktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the founder of the Christianist, he talked about technology, not as some sign that humanity is evolving in the right direction, but rather as a kind of extraordinary crutch that, you know, the, you know, the, the, the, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the crutches that are there, not because we're doing great, but because we're not connected to that source. It's, you know, we, it started with shit, we need calculators, we need the printing press, we need, because our memories were fucked up. People used to sing the Upanishads, like they used to have the whole thing memorized and sing them. Now, we can't remember that shit. I can't remember my wife's phone number half the time. So, in now, we have AI, which to me is really unnerving from that perspective, because the indication is, yeah, and our intelligence is going away too. So, we need to have a externalized intelligence that we can refer to because we've got, we're that far gone. And then of course, the crutch doesn't just help the lack, but amplifies the lack because you become dependent on the crutch and the skillsets to manage. So yeah, yeah, we, you're right. Like this technology is some kind of false idol that's giving us an impression that we have we're succeeding rather than we're collapsing. It's a really terrifying, almost diabolical manifestation of human productivity, if you look at it. I liked it in those, that early impriture of the podcast world, Dan Carling's hardcore history, he did an amazing series on the Khan dynasty. One bit he described that the Mongol tribes of Genghis Khan would be able to ride on horseback while firing arrows and hitting targets. It's like nowadays that would be like an ride on horseback while firing arrows and hitting targets. It's like nowadays that would be like an elite circus performer, but that was just I'm staggered. Fair. Normal. Yeah, I'm like normal. Jesuit speaking 10 languages, like mastering all of these disciplines. And of course, like people have perhaps been moaned progress for as long as there's been progress, but it's about utility isn't it? These things are tools. They're not the ends and objects in themselves. And is there anybody now that has like an optimistic view about AI? Like, you know, even like the sort of 1950s tellingly named white goods revolution. And like these things are going to be labor saving, this is going to be great and you're going to have more leisure time and you didn't work out that way. And I think we all know, no, the technological and even medicinal progress are tethered to economic models that are by their nature hierarchical and to a point unfair and maybe you could go as far as to say derasinated they are not rooted in the ordinary culture but in fact we live in numerous cultures. One of the things I would say that's beneficial about the last 10 years is that if you used to critique the military industrial complex as would have been from the left when I was doing it, you know, 10 years ago, it would have been assumed to have been a left-wing rhetoric to attack the military industrial complex and big corporations. People saw, on my sense was that American people saw it as an attack on America itself. Now I think it's understood that there is a military industrial complex that are economic elites. There is almost hovering like a UFO above the body of America. There is this entity, this phantom almost hovering like a UFO above the body of America. There is this entity, this phantom that controls America really. So when, like me, an English person, criticising about, oh, American people don't, they understand that I'm not talking about the people of Delaware or the people of Colorado, they understand, oh, he is attacking this machine. And that machine doesn't care about American people. Perhaps all empires first annihilate and subjugate their domestic population before moving elsewhere to colonize the world. Certainly the British did that and the colonialists of the lasting connection of sort of European colonization. First, the working class is subjugated, feudalized and crushed, then off we go or a merry dance to India to control yet more people. And these tools like AI, this great incubator of new intelligence, this as-yet-unhatched egg, these thighs slouching towards Bethlehem to reference our last conversation. Yeah! We don't we know it's gonna be diabolical. We know that the upshorts gonna be ordinary people gonna suffer. These tools are gonna end up in the ads as the government. They're gonna use this to control us and manipulate us. It's not gonna be, hey, look how lovely is in your home. Your home's like a palace now. It has got to mess us up. Well you mess, have you messed around with the idea that, you know, let's talk about that UFO and there's lots of names for that UFO, deep state being one of them. And you know, I, one, one, I think mistake a lot of Americans and maybe people over the world make as they differentiate the government from the corporation. They don't understand there's this very foggy permeable membrane between the corporation and the government, private contractors, lobbyists. They used to be in the government and they flip back and forth. So people have some sense when they're watching the news. They're like, well, it's Fox or it's CNN or it's blah, blah, blah. It's not the government, but there is, and it isn't. I mean, literally the government, but there is a strange interchange between the two, which makes them weird, I guess you could say, in a symbiotic relationship, they have yet to become multicellular. So Jung said that, just like what you said earlier regarding the shadow, the Gestalt, the sum total of the shadow appears as that UFO. That UFO floating over America is the combined shadow of every American, making us all in some infinitesimally copable, right? Like, it's not as though it's a separate invader. I think we're witnessing ourselves, that part of ourselves, we want to ignore the part of ourselves, we don't want to deal with the fact, no, you're eating a fucking squirrel, it's dead, your apology does nothing for it. And all the war, and all the bombs, and everything happening, that's on everybody who pays taxes. Whether you like it or not, if you're contributing to a missile that drops on a wedding party that kills a bunch of innocent kids, you're still culpable in the smallest infinitesimally small way. It's still us. This episode of the DTFH has been supported by Squarespace. Squarespace is the home of DuncanTrustle.com and has been for countless joyful years. You can check it out.

You're still culpable in the smallest infinitesimally small way, it's still us, right? Like that's the reality of it. It's not a UFO. It's a shadow of some unacknowledged, aggressive aspect of us. Some abstraction that is certainly difficult to chart using ordinary logic and ordinary logic was hardly the territory that intrigued Jung so. One of the things that troubles me continually as an occasionally self-involved man who is trying to escape the parameters of my alter-enchanting self is that I know that I am infinitimally small and on the cosmic scale irrelevant, but also, all reality takes place within my consciousness. There is no reality that I know of, that does not take place within my consciousness. The dinosaurs, they are in my consciousness, your UFO anecdote and Jungian in my consciousness, my memories, my fears, my projections. So in some regard, I am already the deity of all reality. I am the centrapegal point around which all sensory and non-sensory data correlesses. day are coalesces. In some small way my individual awakening must be the priority before all else. And I wonder Duncan, I wanted to ask you as a person who spent time around like awakened people, have you been surprised that they, they often, to me at least, seem like their priority is not a kind of fervid activism about the administration of world affairs. They seem almost beyond it. Like it isn't actually that important, even if you talk about global revolution or new systems of decentralization and how do we unite people from across the globe so that they can stand up against establishment corruption. They don't seem to see it as all that important. Have you noticed that? And if so, what do you think about it? Well, I don't, you know, many of them are political. They are in various forms of activism. So I have noticed that. But I think that the idea is, we're trying to go upstream here. The idea is like that, and maybe it is just a naive or ridiculous idea. The idea is if what we're seeing in the world is a projection, if everyone is experiencing their own consciousness, their own mind, not in a mystical way, but at the neurological level, there's no way out of the fact that your brain or the, is a v, neocortex, v.r. goggles, creating time space that you're experiencing. So the notion is, uh, we don't do top down here. With idea would be more if we can help people discover within themselves the stuff they're seeking in the outside world than the power of the shadow or that UFO would instantly be removed. The whole thing depends on us thinking we need it, thinking we need something outside of ourselves, right? So they're trying to lead people into themselves to see that fundamental connection with the universe that many people have forgotten or don't even believe is there. They think they get that from the outside world. That's why I think you would see a lack of political, deep political activism, deep tribalization. I'm this or that. And anytime I've seen that in spiritual people, it's kind of disappointing. You know, what is it, Mark Twain set? Who needs our prayers the most? Satan. Of all the sinners. Satan deserves our prayers the most. And so to tribalize, to say, you know, we only work with people on the left. We only work with people who are this or that, progressives or whatever. What the fuck? Doesn't the most hardcore conservative, white supremacist gun, tooting insurrectionist, deserve a chance at understanding the possibility of inner peace that are the boot of mind. So maybe that's another reason they try to maintain an apolitical stance is because they want all the feel welcome. And I wonder, sometimes, even though some of the greatest activists or most effective activists, I suppose that amounts to the same thing the world's ever known, have taken this sort of solace and drawn their power from spirituality, Gagandhi Mandela, mind of the King Malcolm X. Like, there are also, like, people that primarily appear to be mystics, I suppose. And if you are a mystic, maybe your primary function is to say that this plane of reality that you are living within is obviously an observably but a fragment of all potential realities. And if you confine yourself to just the organization of the resources on this tiny finite bandwidth, your sort of wasting your time by doing that. Yes, listen, at some point, when will you stop differentiating yourself from the mystics? It's just uncomfortable, right? You can't say it out loud. It's funny, you know, it's funny. Like at some point, you're going to have to be like, whatever the way, you know, actually, I don't know how many mystics would even say they were mystics. And in fact, most of them don't. So I'm sorry, that's kind of rude to even try to pull you out of the mystics. Do you like you though? And me? Me? You're put, I think that the moment we get caught up in that, you know, then the next thing you know, you wanna wear a mystic, I wanna be a mystic, I wanna be a mystic, I wanna walk through walls, I wanna teleport, I wanna read minds, I wanna heal, all that stuff, but all my teachers generally, they try to veer me away from that condition. It's a condition. So, and I just did that to you. I am sorry, please do not excursiate me. I'm in it with pure love for you. And you have a heart out. So that's why I'm stammering. Don't worry about that. Someone will come and get me, I'm sure. Duncan, I could offer the same thing to you. I feel that you are so erudite and so bright and so worldly and so able to bring together complicated ideas and convey them amusingly and use personal experience to illustrate points that you've obviously been on a journey and have used personal tragedy to escalate your own personal tragedy to escalate your own, excuse me, spiritual advancement. And like with me, the reason that I, like, you know, I err on the side of modesty, it was because like, I know what he's liking here, I know he's liking here, Duncan, you know, sometimes I'm like a child, not in a good way, not in the way that Christ suggests that we be like children, not just I am innocent and nothing but play. I am grabbed in angst and sinew and not it in body and wanting and just so lost in it, so lost in it, so lacrimos and hopeless and like they set a man I did a talk at the very famous British public school called Eaton because a dear friend of mine as child is at this public school Eaton and I love him and so I did it for him and also as you know I don't there's all one another we're all been born we've been born we're all at the school that we're at but there are many narratives as you know, I don't, well, there's all one another. We're all been born, we've been born, we're all at the school that we're at. But there are many narratives about, you know, eaten as produced from the, you know, the Duke of Wellington, the George Orwell, to, I think, perhaps, the majority of British Prime Ministers. So when I was there at this school with the, you know, peculiarly dressed, but somewhat delightfully dressed young men, is it boy school that were there and I was doing a talk. Like, there was a bit where I said Duncan, like, even though this is a world I don't entirely recognize, it's not my background. I do recognize his young men at a lessons. This is when I received the wound I said in a long, corrumming talk, Duncan, where I also dropped names like Michelle Foucault, terms like anarchist calisthenics, the necessity for regular wall breaking, every single day, constantly, of the establishment and a willingness to engage in revolution. In the midst of it, I talked about like, you know, like what I'm recognizing you, you are young men, so you must know the wound, you must know the wound that I know, and I remember it, I remember it like I was just then, like, you know, what it's like as a comedian or a public speaker, you sort of like, if you're actually not, be, if you're not leading with humor and you're not using material, and that's, you know, I was being occasionally funny, I hope, but I like it also, I was sort of giving a public talk, you know. It's harder to read the room. God, one of the things that they reassuring about comedy is they laugh, they laugh, you know, that they're there, and you know that they're listening. And on some level, you hope that they love you. It's very difficult to laugh at someone that you hate, at least collectively, and joyously. And then anyway, sort, somewhere in the midst of this great torrent of words that I issued, I'd said this thing that one of my teachers said to me from the wound comes the salve. And this is a common trope in recovery that your injury and your past will become a gift to you in so much as pragmatically you'll help other people in a very obvious way, but also you'll recognize who you are and who you're not and the necessity of your journey and perhaps how you'll begin to see that there is no separateness and there is no otherness and all relationships or a reflection and refraction of deeper or different aspects of who you are and that there's a sort of a beautiful game taking place that occasionally it brushes past you and you feel it on the deeper senses and you know it when you feel it. And I like, in the midst of it, I go, you know, I said this wound is the self thing and these kids, the questions they asked were so erudite and brilliant, it was strange to hear it coming from their young and piping voices, but indeed, as they say, from the mouths of babes, one of these kids towards the back, about 14, 16, I don't know, they're all kids to me, said some, and they said, um, you mentioned that, uh, we're all separated from the totality, and that there's inevitability to our wounding, and that the wounding will be addressed through some homeopathic remedy. I said, I didn't say homeopathic remedy. You said that the salvation would come from the wound. I was like, oh my God, that's literally a homeopathic remedy. Oh my God, look at the level this kid is tracking it on. I said, I said, you're so clever. It comes across as patronizing, but it is, it's for your clever. And it was remarkable even to know that they were listening to such a degree. It was encouraging that they were interested in the way that they appeared to be. And like that, also, God, man, Duncan, and I think you'll maybe you'll identify with this is like I wasn't there with like Someone that I know well enough to sort of go that was amazing I love you well done you're fantastic like afterwards. So I had no I had no debrief So I just sort of left there like oh my god was that good I was like I sort of like you're right like I I drove into a concrete ballad a little later, which I informed the council of and had repaired. Of course, it's a responsible citizen. But I was sort of like, I didn't get to land. I didn't get to ground the game, Duncan. Oh, that's a full friendships for reassurance. It's like getting bad ecstasy. You're expecting some wonderful come up and then nothing, you don't get that feeling that you get from being a performer, you don't get to drive away feeling this temporary sense of like maybe, maybe I am God, you know, so it's hard to do those kinds of things. It's really difficult. I understand, yeah, I don't like it. That is a terrible feeling. Very addicted to the feeling of someone being like, that was great. Without that, it's like, what am I? I need you to tell me what's great. Oh, I love that tattoo. Look at that. Hey, bo, howdy, Krishna Russell. I could talk to you forever. Thank you so much for giving me your time. I know you're tremendously busy. And as always, this was great. And you are amazing. And thank you so much for coming on the show. I have always learned so much from hanging out with you. Learn a lot from you. And like I've learned a lot about naked and afraid today, for example. God, I'm in a bad about naked and afraid today for example I'm gonna watch it. I will watch it. I will watch it I can I read you like last time we spoke a lot it was on my podcast you read a poem Can I read a poem to you that I just read the other day the seems appropriate because it's like you know like they they, the seems appropriate because it's like, you know, like they discovered or they did, they were able to digitally image the Titanic recently, you know, and we were able to see it. And Thomas Hardy, the, is he English? Is he Welsh? She's certainly English speaking, but I don't want to offend Welsh people if indeed he's Welsh. Poet wrote this beautiful verse lines on the loss of Titanic. I guess he's contemporaneous. I guess he's written this when it happened, Duncan, and it's called the convergence of the Twain. And after that, can I do some promo for my stand-up thing unless you can fold it into your, unless you can fold it into your stuff? I do both. All right, man. So this is called the convergence of the Twain by Thomas Hardy lines on the loss of the Titanic. In a solitude of the sea, deep from human vanity, and the pride of life that planned her, stillly, couch-ish-sheet, steel chambers, late the pires of her salamandering fires, cold currents thrid and turn to rhythmic tidal liars. Over the mirrors meant to glass the opulent, the sea-worm crawls, grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent. Jules enjoy designed to ravish the sensuous mind, lie, lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind. Dim, moon-eyed, fishes near gaze at the gilded gear and query, what does this vangloriousness down here? Well, while was fashioning this creature of cleaving wing, the imminent will that stirs and urges everything, prepared a sinister mate for her, so galley great, a shape of ice for the time far and disassociate, and as the smart ship grew in stature, grace and hue, in shadowy silent distance grew the iceberg too. Alien, they seemed to be, won't Nautilier could see the intimate welding of their later history, or sign that they were bent by paths coincident on being an on twin halves of one or gust event, till the spinner of the year said, now, and each one hears, and consummation comes, and jars to hemisphere's. Wow! It's just the death tarot card. No, it's good. The death tarot card. Wow! It's just the death tarot card. No, it's good. The death tarot card. It means change. It just means change. It's just an eyes by tearing through the hole. It's just all human endeavor laying up a bottom of the sea, swam and tell, swam over in tall darkness by creatures millions of years behind you on the Ebullent Shurysca hill. Oh man. Amazing. Yes. About my stuff, Duncan please. Please, please. My comedy, my god, see, like when I put down down Tomas Hardy I can't even read my comedy special brand them it will be premiering on July the 11th on moment this is more than a comedy show Duncan it's a call for freedom a call for unity is it my comedy show I don't need to read that bit do I can ignore that that's my artistic freedom if I say that go to moment.co. forward slash Russell brand from the first of June to pre-order your tickets is good it's funny and also I do that festival and by God why aren't you coming there will you come there between July the 14th and July the 17th there's a free day festival hay on why vandana shiva with mhoff Bruce parry be it simkin satish kumar kyrongreisi yoga breath work radical theories and ideas and Duncan Russell if you or if you're, you're, you're, you're, you're, you're with, pay your flight if you want to come.

275^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - AMBER LYON Transcript and Discussion^2014-03-20^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Happy Spring Equinox, everyone. It is I, Duncan Trussell. And you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And if there ever was a day to contemplate rebirth, this is that day. Spring. I've got this blasted old withered little patch of dead soil behind my house. And the other day I decided, you know what? I'm going to sprinkle some grass seed down and just see what happens. Spray some water on it and see if I get some grass back there. And you know what's happening? Grass is growing where there was no grass. Just a dark gray post-apocalyptic patch of doom. Now green sprigs of grass are growing. My orange tree seems to be growing oranges. Something's coming off the branches that looks good. My lemon tree is starting to grow these big fat lemons. Birds are waddling around in the backyard eating my grass seed. That's fine. But spring is the greatest metaphor. It's that place in your life where you've been depressed, where you've been trapped, where you've been stuck, where you've been uninspired, where you've been heartbroken, where everything seems hopeless, and suddenly this glimmer of life springs up inside of you. You've got to remember what I'm talking about. It's so easy to forget when you're wandering through the bleak darkness, when you're lost, when you're confused, when you're uninspired, when you're lonely, it's so easy to forget that nothing lasts, including those bleak states. And then all of a sudden, out of the blue, if you're a writer, that great idea will come. And you'll find yourself writing again. Or if you're a comedian, new jokes will start coming. I promise they start coming again. Or if you're somebody who maybe has been alone for a long time, you'll meet someone new and realize that it's possible to fall in love again. That's what spring's all about. Spring is about grinning from ear to ear as you realize that life happens again, that it can't be pushed back or stopped, and that your idea that everything was going to be awful forever was ridiculous and doesn't follow the pattern of life, of nature. These dark scientists blogging about the collapse of industrial civilization, impending doom, everything falling apart. They're just focusing on the winter. They don't understand that, yeah, sure, civilizations collapse just like there's winter. But things grow from that collapse. Don't just focus on one part of the cycle. That's the point. If you're trapped in winter, if your brain is in a permafrost, if you've managed to convince yourself that things don't get better, that you're lost forever, permanently broke, permanently alone, permanently sick, it's not true. You're not going to be permanent anything. Even if you're a dead body listening to this thing right now, even if someone has plugged earbuds into a corpse and is playing my podcast for you, you are going to experience a rebirth. It's not going to be as a human being, maybe. You're going to gradually disintegrate and turn into soil. Worms are going to crawl through you. But then that rotting, stinking, festering gelatinous glop that used to be your body will gradually convert into the most beautiful thing ever, which is nature, spring, life, plants. I love spring. I feel quite happy these days. I really do. I went through a pretty bleak period for a couple of months. I didn't feel inspired. I wasn't writing. I wasn't very disciplined. I was addicted to video games. Just doing all the classic shit that I do when I'm sort of stuck and the wheels are spinning. But lately, I can feel it coming back. It comes back. You meet someone new. The ideas start coming again. Personal rebirth is possible. Not only is it possible, it's inevitable. You can be reborn before you die. That's the exciting, mystical idea. And that's why I'm really happy to be uploading this podcast with Amber Lyon on the Spring Equinox, because she has experienced a rebirth that is a result of coming into contact with the mind of nature. That's what these plant medicines are, ayahuasca, mushrooms. They connect us with nature. It's a direct neurological harmonizing with the spirit of the Earth. Now, I'm not going to go on and on about it, because she does a much better job of explaining this than I can. But a few times, when I've done this podcast, one of my favorite things when I do this podcast is I get to meet new people. And you see people in interviews. I've seen Amber Lyon in interviews. I've listened to her on the Rogan podcast. And Joes has told me how awesome she was. But when you get to meet someone face to face, right away, you can pick up their vibe. And there is a lot of people that I've met who have there is nothing more exciting than when you get around a person who is promoting some type of lifestyle, for example, Ragu Marcus, who is a devotee of Neem Kerali Baba and runs the Love Server Member Foundation, which is Ram Dass' foundation. I remember when I met him, he had this incredible expansive glow. Amber Lyon is exactly the same way. Judge a tree by its fruit, as they say. And if somebody is radiating happiness, peacefulness, tranquility, then it speaks for whatever methods they're using. Because a lot of times people will talk about some method they're using, but you get around them and you feel like you're talking to a human icicle. Amber Lyon is fascinating in a lot of ways. She's an Emmy Award-winning journalist. She was a correspondent for CNN. She's been all over the world in some of the most terrible parts of the world, seeing some of the most horrible things that a person can see. She talked to Rogan on his podcast. He told her that she should go try ayahuasca. She ended up going and drinking ayahuasca, this letter, on a year-long journey, taking medicinal plants all over the world. And the result was a complete transformation, a rebirth. Amber Lyon is experiencing a type of spring that comes when you are reminded of that secret truth that is inside all things. And that truth is that, well, shit. I don't know what it is. But you know what? When I meet people who have come in contact with it, they sure seem happy. And it's exciting and inspiring. So I'm thrilled to be putting out this podcast on the spring equinox. We're going to get going. But first, some business. You guys might notice that I have a cold. Listen to this. Microorganisms are swarming through my body right now. They're experiencing their own kind of goddamn spring. Frolicking in the force of my intestines, dancing through my white blood cells, punching every healthy part of my body with their sticky little diseased fingers. Whatever they have. Tendrils. I don't know what comes out of them. Why don't you know what it is? Whatever they are, they're swarming and they suck. They're trying to turn my body into a hive of doom. Why do I have these inside of me? Well, it's simple. Somebody sprayed them out of their hole, and it got into one of my holes. I don't know which hole it got into, but one of my holes got infected by it with somebody's stink. And that's what happens when you go into public, which is why as much as you can, if you go into public, you have to understand that you are risking going to war with some microorganism, with some stinky toddlers sprayed out of their ass, which is why if you go outside, make sure you're going to a good place. Nature, a nice movie, a symphony. Go to a park, picnic. Go to a museum. Go look at a spring garden. Go enjoy a fountain somewhere. But why would you spend your precious time on planet Earth plodding through the aerosolized filth of some chain store, these targets and Walmart's and CVS's of the world? Look, I know sometimes you've got to go down there because you need to get some bottled water or condoms. But those are rare exceptions. Usually you know what you need weeks in advance. And thank God for Amazon.com. Because by going to Amazon.com, you can get the exact same stuff you get at any retail place brought to your house minus the diarrhea attached to it. You've heard me say it before, I'll say it again. These chain stores are hives of deadly viruses, botulism toxin, measles is coming back, incurable gonorrhea. You touch the wrong diaper package at Target and who knows what can happen? I'm not saying you could get incurable gonorrhea from picking up a used bag of tissues that somebody brought back from one of these stores, but I'm not saying you couldn't. Amazon.com. If you go to dunkintrustle.com, there is a portal. If you click on that portal, you will go into the beautiful land of Amazon.com where you can buy anything, depending on where you live, you can even get groceries right now. As soon as I finish uploading this podcast, I'm going to order my groceries. They bring them to my house. It's great. And yeah, I'm going to go out today. I'm not a recluse. I'm not a shut-in anymore. I'll admit I got a little depressed. And when you're depressed, Amazon.com is a holy guardian angel that will allow you to stay in the soft, sweet sanctuary of your house as you huddle in front of your computer screen playing online video role-playing games where you desperately try to forget the fact that you have to address the pain inside your heart or you're going to suffer forever. Yes, Amazon.com will enable that state. But they will also allow you to spend the time that you would have spent plotting through some grocery store or Target or some Walmart frolicking in nature. Go to a spa. Go to a steam room. Go to one of these Korean spas. If you live in Los Angeles for $20, you can get scrubbed down by a grizzled old man who will wipe away all your dead skin cells and rub lotion on your balls. You can do that instead of going to Amazon or no, go to Amazon instead of going to Walmart. You know what I'm saying? Go to our portal. Go through our portal. It's a clean portal. It's not like the portals that are attached to the stinky people wandering through these stores. Their portals are covered with mucus and flim and incurable gonorrhea. And they sneeze and fart and spray their disease in all directions, corrupting everything that they come in contact with. Why do it? Amazon.com. Go through our portal. It's at dougatrussell.com. It costs you nothing. And they give us a very small percentage of whatever you buy. We're also sponsored by Audible, which has fantastic audiobooks. You can listen to my friend David McClain's audiobook. The answer to the riddle is me. If you go to audibletrial.com forward slash family hour, sign up for a trial membership, you will get a free audiobook. You can cancel at any time. And of course, as always, we are sponsored by Shirt Design T-shirts. These sweet darlings, they make these shirts that are so incredibly soft. It used to be when I wanted to feel something soft when I was a kid, I'd have to sneak into my grandmother's bedroom while she was sleeping and gently stroke her hair and cry into her open mouth, my salty tears running down her lips and into the creases of her wrinkles. And then before she would wake up, I would leave and go back into my room. Those were the days, childhood. What a wonderful time. But now if you want to revisit what it felt like to stroke your soft Grammy's hair, all you have to do is go to ShirtDesignT-shirts.com, order one of their amazing shirts. They've got some incredible designs. Just check them out. They've supported this podcast forever. And they print all of our shirts. Go to ShirtDesignT-shirts.com, put my name in. You'll get 10% off these wonderful, lovely shirts. And finally, thanks to all of you who have been donating to the podcast. And thanks to all of you who have been buying T-shirts from our shop. We've got new shirts there. We're about to get some new posters, new stickers. Lots of new stuff is coming in, but we have replenished the stock. So if you went there to try to buy a shirt and couldn't find it, it is now there. So go to DuncanTrustle.com and please pick up one of these shirts. Why not? Connect with other people who listen to this podcast. And maybe you can make little spring babies. And if not little spring babies, why not have some spring orgasms, people? Come on. Get in the rhythm of nature. Nature is humping right now. That's what this is. Let's just face it. Nature is exploding, pollinating, spraying out its opulent life jizz on all things. And everything's turning green and yellow and red and colorful and beautiful. As nature has this mega-orgasm, which we call spring. Dive into the mega-orgasm. And why not dive into the mega-orgasm, which is the DuncanTrustle Family Hour Forum? Join our forum. Sign up. Get in on the conversation. I want some smarties in there. We need some scientists. No more anti-semitic conspiracy theorists. Come on. I want some goddamn Neil deGrasse Tyson's in there. Some Dawkins in there. Are you smart? Are you a professor? Are you in college? Are you a genius? Go join my forum, please. And even if you're not a genius, but you're somebody who doesn't believe in chemtrails, I'd love you to go there and join the forum. And if you're someone who does believe in chemtrails and has proof, join the forum. But try to write about chemtrails without talking about the Jewish conspiracy. Please. If you could do that, it would really make me happy. And also, please don't use the term no homo ever again. Everyone on Earth. Please don't use that term anymore. If you follow, you could write the new Walden. And if you ended it with the term no homo, everything that came before it would automatically seem irrelevant and stupid. Go join the forum. We need to spice it up in there. I need fresh blood in there, people. Come on. Sign up at dunkintrustle.com. Join the forum. There's a Minecraft server and lots of really cool people there who I have grown to love. So thank you guys for tuning into the Dunkin' Trussell Family Hour podcast. And now, please welcome the great Psychonaut and Psychedelic Advocate, Amber Lyon. You can find links to her website, her Twitter, and various social media stuff at dunkintrustle.com. Hare Krishna. I'm here with Amber Lyon. And hello, Amber. Hey, Dunkin. Thanks for having me. It's an honor to be here. I love the podcast. Thank you. I've been looking forward to this conversation for months now, because we started talking several months ago. And you were traveling at the time. What were you doing? What were you doing on your journeys over the last year? I was tripping around the world, literally. I spent the past year investigating psychedelic medicines and how native cultures have been using them for thousands of years. And I traveled to Peru. I went to Thailand, Indonesia, southern Mexico, where they use medicinal psilocybin mushrooms. And then I think when we last spoke, I was in Indonesia just about to finally wrap up my trip and come back to the US. I've been living out of a backpack for a year now. An entire year. An entire year. I just was so enamored after I tried ayahuasca, and I saw so much potential in ayahuasca to help cure all these mental disorders we're facing in the West. And so once I returned, I put all my stuff in storage or sold it, grabbed a backpack, and then I've been traveling ever since. Before this journey, what were you doing? I was working on an investigative news website and also finishing up a book, Peace, Love, and Pepper Spray, which covered photographic essays of protest across the United States. Right. And that was your job. You've been a journalist for how long have you been a journalist? For 10 years. 10 years you've been a journalist. And you've worked for CNN. You've been a correspondent on CNN. You have been in the front lines of some of the most terrible places on Earth. Is that fair to say? Yeah, it is. I covered conflict. I covered protest. I also covered some of the most disgusting topics on Earth. I spent a lot of time covering child sex trafficking and sex slavery, as well as drug addiction epidemics with opioid prescription pain pills. And so I spent a fair amount of the past 10 years looking at the most disgusting underbelly of society. What drew you into that? What made you want to report that kind of stuff to the rest of the world? I just felt such empathy for all of these victims, especially when I'd meet them. I noticed that a lot of society kind of discounted their stories and wasn't paying attention to them. And I knew through my light and through my reach that I could help amplify their stories so hopefully they would get more help, which actually ended up happening for some of my stories, especially when it came to online child sex trafficking. I did one story. And the result of that craigslist shut down their worldwide adult services section where these children were being trafficked. So the stories were having an effect. But I definitely focused on the worst of the worst. And how much of it? So it was a sort of altruism that was drawing you and into that trade and to getting that stuff out there. It wasn't the desire to just be in the presence of darkness. It was because you wanted to help. I wanted to help. But now that I've done a lot of research and personal experimentation with the medicines, I do believe it was a little bit of my pain body. Can you just find pain body? It's the part of your soul that just seeks negativity to try to keep you from being the person you could be, from reaching your full potential. It's almost like a resistance if you're a fan of Stephen Pressfield and the War of Art. It's your resistance to reaching your full potential so you constantly surround yourself with negativity because you have a fear of being happy. And that was happening to you as a journalist. Over the 10 years that you're covering these types of things, you think that this was a defense mechanism against being happy, disguised as altruism, or just a little of both? I think it was a little bit of both, because I'm a very empathetic person, so I felt very strongly for these individuals. But I also do think it was a part of my soul that only wanted to look at the dark and shine light on the dark instead of shining light on the light, which I now know is a lot more effective journalistically. And that's the path I'm taking now. I realized I was doing it all wrong, Duncan. I spent 10 years just doing it wrong on the wrong path. And the medicines have really shown me that if I really want to make a difference, I need to start highlighting solutions and highlighting ways that we can help cure this mental disorder and insanity facing our culture, which leads to all the symptoms that I was covering before, which would be the wars, the child sex trafficking, and the slavery. These are all just kind of fruits on this gigantic tree. And when I watch the news, generally, it doesn't make me feel empowered. When I watch the news, and I also like to watch the news and watch dark things. And since I've been practicing mindfulness, I'm fully aware of the fact that when I go to watch the news, it's for nothing more than to activate the pain body or the fear body. It's just I'm getting off on it. Like, there's something that I'll actually go through different news sources. I'll go from the least scary to the most scary. So maybe I'll start it like having to post. And then if that doesn't give me enough of a fear rush, I'll head to Drudge Report. And then just find the most awful thing ever for no reason other than it gives me this strange feeling of getting high in a really dark way. Kind of reminds me of the same impulse that leads me to smoke. Or it's that same weird like, let's find something shitty to do. Yeah, it's resistance to reaching your full potential and being happy, Duncan, which you deserve to be. And so many people around the country deserve as well. And I think this is an illness that so many of us are facing. People spend all day long on the internet crawling down that rabbit hole, researching crimes by the US government from 1907. And really just absorbing their lives in all this negativity and hate when there's so much beauty in this world. And if we can focus on that in solutions and curing all of this insanity, and really getting at the core of that, then I think we'll be on a better path. I want to play you this clip from this is one of my favorite Bill Hicks jokes. And can I just play it for you? It's about three minutes. Yes, of course. I'm a huge fan of his. I just don't fit in, man. I don't fit in anywhere. That's my problem. You know my problem? I watch too much news. I don't know if you've ever, ever, ever sat and watched CNN longer than, say, 20 hours in one day. I've got to cut that out. You ever watched CNN headline news for any length of time? It's the most depressing fucking thing you will ever do. War, famine, death, AIDS, homeless, recession, depression, war, famine, death, aid. Then you look out your window. It's just, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep, peep. Where is all this shit happening, man? Ted Turner is making this shit up. Shane Fonda won't sleep with him. He runs to a typewriter. By 1992, we will all die of AIDS. Read that on the air. I don't get laid. Nobody gets laid. I mean, I'm writing, Shane Fonda. Will you fuck this guy so we can get some good news, please? I want to see a well-laid Ted Turner newscast. Hey, it's all going to work out. Here's sports. That big stupid grin. I'm getting laid right now. Fuck it. Hey. I love that bit and that idea that it's all going to work out. That idea is a revolutionary idea. And it's an idea that, for some reason, people reject. We don't want to accept that idea. We want to imagine that maybe it's not going to work out. And if you believe it's not going to work out, then that disempowers you. It makes you feel incredibly helpless in the world. And that feeling of helplessness, I think, is more towards the root system of this tree that grows all these other horrible things. And I think what's really fascinating about what's happening to you is that you have gone from being a person who is drawing the attention of the planet in the direction of this darkness that's always been here. I think it's always been here. To a person who now, because of your encounter with these plant medicines, is in the beginning phases of trying to turn people's attention towards something else. And can you talk a little bit about what this something else is? Yeah, for sure. It all came from a really profound ayahuasca experience I had. And in that experience, my old self actually died. I had fasted for five days, and I took this cambo frog medicine, which really releases the toxins out of your body. So my body was prepared to actively absorb this ayahuasca, like I'd never absorbed it before. And at this point, the ayahuasca wasn't just acting as a psychoactive medicine. It was also acting as a ladder to reach me to a higher intelligence that was giving me a download of information. And right after I drank the ayahuasca, I started feeling like I was dying. And I literally was having trouble breathing. I was thinking, has anyone died from ayahuasca before? How do I call 911? I'm in Indonesia. What are the numbers to dial? And I really started freaking out. And 100%, I just knew I was dying. And I remember looking over at my boyfriend, thinking how sad it was. I wasn't going to see him again. And then next thing I know, I just shot out of my body and looked back at my body and felt guilty too, that I couldn't. Why could everyone else in the room hold onto their body and stay alive? And I couldn't. And at that point, this higher presence came down and told me, you guys think death exists? It's so silly. You're not really amber. You're this vibration which I had become, this vibration floating through the universe, this soul. And amber is just your organic spacesuit that allows you to survive on Earth. Really, you'll never die. You're always this soul. Maybe just put in different spacesuits each time you come back. And it was so profound because before I wasn't very spiritual. I didn't really believe in life after death. And now I am a firm believer because it was such an intense message. And right after that, this presence brought me through the universe it felt like. I was just shooting down this vortex. And I saw all the fighting happening on Earth. And all the wars and then black and red were flashing and all the negativity. And I saw that. And then right away, I was drugged to this. My attention was shined on this huge presence and force. And I don't know, call it God or just something my brain was making up. But it was so intense and it shined this intense, intense energy and light on me that really showed me at that point how trivial all the fighting was compared to this force and that I needed to focus on this force. And in that message, the force gave me a message of love, focusing on love and focusing on healing our sickness, our mental sickness. And it's almost like explaining a dream, Duncan. It's hard to put ayahuasca experiences in words. But I was so profoundly changed by the comparison of those forces of the negativity versus focusing on healing that it's permanently cemented in my brain. I can't even go back to focus on that stuff anymore. And it means it's so trivial. It seems so trivial because now I do know, and this force has shown me, the core of all of our problems is from our mental health disorder. And we really need to focus on ways to try to cure that. And these plant medicines are often ways to do so. What is this mental health disorder? Can you specifically define it? What is it? Yeah, it's a disorder of the limbic system. So that's the area of the brain that focuses on emotion and mental processing, processing trauma. And what's happened is because we've removed these native plants and just our connection with nature in many ways, we've lost our ability to really process trauma. And so so many of us are walking around each day, which is trauma bottled up inside of us, about to explode. And that manifests itself in bodily pain, or anxiety, or depression. And it's really harming. It's often at the root of all the negativity that we're seeing around the world. So if we're able to get in and reprocess this trauma, like native cultures do, then we can really lose a lot of this negativity. So do you think psychedelics, plant medicines, are the only way to process this trauma? Or did this force show you other ways that people can use to deal with this bottled up darkness? I think love, love, and spirituality, and connecting with people around you as well. I think for some people, psychedelics, like for me at the time I went down to try ayahuasca, it really was, I could never in the mental state I was in, have sat down and meditated, or sat down with a therapist. For me, I knew it was my only option. But I still think there are other ways people can process this trauma through psychotherapy, through antidepressants, which work for some people. Also through floating, meditation, yoga. There's many other ways. But I think when those ways have run out and you've kind of hit a brick wall, psychedelics are the next best answer. And for me, it was really like 30 years of therapy in one night. And it was a very rapid treatment. When I, I remember the first time that I met Ragu Marcus, who runs the Love Server Member Foundation for Ram Dass, and he was on the podcast. And I'd been reading Ram Dass forever, but I was kind of nervous about meeting somebody from that organization. Because I thought, oh, what if he's like, slimy or weird, or you know, just like it's all bullshit. And then I have to kind of, it's gonna speak, it's gonna point in the direction of, my bullshit meter is gonna go off, and then I'm gonna maybe not trust this Ram Dass story or teachings as much, if this is a person who is also a disciple of his guru. And I remember meeting him, and his vibe was so incredible. He was, you know, just a normal person, but this thing coming out of him was instantly transformative for me. And that's what I get from you. It's the same kind of thing. You've got this glow, this focus, and this glow. And your boyfriend who's here too has the same thing. And other people that I've met, like Aubrey Marcus, who've encountered Ayahuasca, it's all a very similar, I don't know what to call it, a kind of like loving tranquility or something that's billowing out of you guys. And it really speaks for the potency of this medicine. So it's amazing, it's just a little frustrating because I don't wanna die or throw up. I don't wanna throw up. And not only do I not wanna throw up, I don't wanna die. I'm terrified of the snakes. I don't wanna get bitten by spiders. I'm afraid of the heat. I don't wanna, there's so many things that like, you know, that scare me about it, because with meditation, I can sit and meditate two, two 15 minute periods a day, maybe if I'm being disciplined, I'm not gonna die. I'm gonna relax. Well, I think it's part of the experience too, is facing your fears, I mean, I was in a shower and I'd turn around and there'd be cockroaches the size of rolls of quarters running behind my head. And eventually- That's in my shower. At first I got scared of them, but after a while, you just get used to them. And you face, you really do face your fears, especially when you go down to the jungle and try the ayahuasca. And after you've survived that experience, not only the first dimension part of that experience, but also the other dimensional part, you just feel like such a transformed person, like you can take on anything. And your worries that you had before seems so trivial. And for me, one of my worries, a big fear of mine was the fear of death, because I'd seen so many of my colleagues or human rights activists or people I'd interviewed along the way either jailed or passed away. And so that became a fear. And the psychedelics have shown me over and over and over almost every time that I take them, I end up dying in some way. And they've shown me that it doesn't really exist. We don't really die. Your soul will always continue on. Your space suit on this earth, your body may malfunction. But when that happens, your soul leaves, enters the universe. And then, I don't know exactly what happens after that, but I've been told many times that death doesn't exist. Dying is safe. That's what Ram Dass says. Yeah. Dying is safe. And he also says that the death experience is like taking off a shoe that's too tight on your foot. And it's funny to think that the roots of this tree that we're talking about, probably are just the fear of death that people are just so, so scared that they're gonna lose everything and that there won't be anything after that. And the modern world, it teaches us this. Science hasn't found a soul. Science hasn't found an afterlife. Science hasn't found anything more than matter. And so there's this sense of like, when I die, it's over, everything gone. No more experience, just nil, zero on the number line. And that is absolutely terrifying. And I think most of us spend a lot of energy turning our backs to that, you know? So it's exciting to think that psychedelics are a kind of death simulator. Oh, for sure. And they've done studies just right around the corner here at UCLA Harbor Medical Center and they gave patients who had end-of-life cancer. So they had terminal cancer diagnosis. They knew they were going to die within months or within a year. And these patients were so anxious, their last weeks on this earth, that they couldn't enjoy their time with their family. They couldn't enjoy their last breath. And so the scientists gave these patients psilocybin in high doses. And they all reported having religious experiences that made them more comfortable with dying that then proceeded to reduce their anxiety levels. And that experiment has been repeated with similar results. And so that's what to me is so profound about the psychedelic experience, especially with ayahuasca, because it definitely lets you know your place in the universe. And we'll even answer specific questions if you ask. This is, it's funny because you have to say force. What does Aubrey Marcus say? Everyone's had come up with creative ways to not say God. Like no one wants to say it because that word itself has become so tainted by the bigots and racists and fear mongers who use that as a term to have power over other people. But I like that word and it's a term of convenience I use it. And I know you have to be careful because you say God and suddenly everyone's like, all right, I'm not listening anymore. But it's, these things are outside of language. We're forced to categorize this whatever it is, this feeling of connection with a much bigger, bigger way beyond anything we can understand a field of intelligence. And a funny thing about that field of intelligence is it seems to be the most polite thing ever because it doesn't come, it doesn't, it doesn't have a stalker mentality. It's not gonna show up at your house if you don't invite it. You know, it's not gonna do any surprise visits usually. Usually you have to invite it in in some way through some ritual or ceremony. And then when you realize it's out there, wow, wow, what a beautiful feeling that is. What we're talking about here is going from living in a cell, a tiny little cubicle of understanding of the universe, this place that's so easy to get bored in if you live in this paradigm where it's just, it's all matter, there's nothing else except work, get a good job, work, retire, play some golf and die. That's boring and hopeless and terrible. But what psychedelics seem to teach, and they're definitely teaching you this and through you, lots of other people, they seem to teach that we have within us the potential to save the world. Whoa, wow, that's crazy to think that. That's crazy to think that. We feel so disempowered. We feel so hopeless, pathetic and useless that the notion that you can actually save the world, the planet, you could save the world, you could save the world. People don't realize that. 500 years ago, could you save the world? I don't know, probably not, but now one person with a great idea of this 80,000 people who are gonna listen to this podcast, one of those 80,000 people might not believe they could save the world, even though in their mind, they keep getting these impulses, go do this, go do ayahuasca, go do this volunteer here, go do this thing, they ignore it, because they think, oh, that's fucking narcissism. Yeah, right, what could I fucking do? That could be Tesla, you know, that could be, what I'm saying is in whatever innovation that person comes up with, whatever idea or philosophy or whatever that is, instead of having to write it down and get it printed out in a printing press, they could get it to the entire planet in a millisecond. Bam, all over the planet in a fucking second. To me, that is just so profound and exciting, and it's something you won't hear on the news, how incredibly fortunate we are to be born today and how much responsibility we have in this growing age of connectivity and technologically enhanced empathy. And on that note too, psychedelics also show that the news, they've showed me for sure that the news is trying to divide us and cause all this fear of our neighbors and our community and scared of the guy who's going to rob us or murder us, and they constantly try to divide, divide, divide, divide. And this is something psychedelics have shown me over and over, is how much we are definitely all in this together on some vibrational way, and everyone is really united. And to really, humans, overall, and I've even noticed this in my career, even when I was covering the worst of the worst, is that overall, people are really amazing and they're good and they've got big hearts and it's time to unite with your neighbors and get to know your community and form community governments and community actions instead of being so fearful. And that's something that if you sit and watch the news all day long, you're gonna be scared of everybody around you. Because that's what it also is there to do, is make us feel like you said earlier, Duncan, like we're powerless, and then also everyone around us is some jackass who's trying to kill us. Murderous, kid-ass. You drive through a neighborhood today and you see all these beautiful green lawns. No one's in them. No one's going outside, man. It's a ghost town everywhere. No kids are playing. If you see a kid outside playing, it's like, oh shit, I hope he's okay. That kid's gonna be carried away by a pedophile in like 10 minutes, he's gone, dead. That's what we learn. I go outside sometimes, like if I end up in nature, because I've watched so many of those, I shouldn't be alive. I start hearing the- You're a pain buddy. Yes, I start hearing the beginning of that, like Duncan Trussell, when he went out to the LA River to walk his dog, didn't know that he would spend five terrifying days. It's like, you know, that's the story that we are being told. That's the narrative, is that we are always on the precipice of catastrophe. And the catastrophe is death, death. So that's the great, in horror movies, what's the worst thing that happens to you? Death, what's the worst thing that happens to you in any movie? Death, that's it, game over. So the idea that that isn't game over, that shifts everything, that changes everything. Because now we would, if people really just knew that, what a different world it would be. The people who have power would have so much less power, it seems like. It's like, what the fuck are you gonna do to us, man? We're just bubbles, we're gonna pop this bubble, I'll come back as another bubble. You can't do anything to stop it, you know? And these people who have managed to amplify their ego to the point that they become Putin's, and Obama's, and all the various leaders out there, they can't accept the fact that they're us. They don't wanna think like that. If you think like that, the whole thing gets fucking thrown out. They would love to sit down with all of Congress and every politician worldwide, and just have a nice mushroom circle ceremony. Because not ayahuasca, because ayahuasca would ruin some of them. But just with some mushrooms, and sit down and see what happens. Or MDMA, better that. MDMA is great at, people will take it who are arrogant or kind of angry, and it will make you love your neighbor. Could you imagine if we took all the world leaders and put them in an MDMA circle? This is the dream. Yeah, it's a dream of mine now that I've seen how powerful these are. I think it really could make a big difference. But I think everything starts on the grassroots level. And once we start getting over the mainstream news, getting over that fear, getting over our loss of community, then we take our power back. And above all, like you mentioned, Duncan getting over our fear of death. The, I'm sure you're aware of this NASA just released this frightening thing that people have been tweeting again and again and again. Which is that we are on the precipice of the collapse of industrial civilization. Can I read a little bit of it too? Yeah, of course. This is from the Daily Mail. Industrial civilization may be heading towards collapse within decades because of its strain on the planet's resources. NASA reports fine. Collapsed civilization may be linked to increased strain on planet's resources. Studies say rich elites may be responsible for both problems. In both doomsday scenarios predicted by study, poor quote commoners collapse first, later followed by the elites. To avoid collapse inequality must be reduced and population growth must be strictly controlled according to this study. And that is a very dire study. And what's really particularly spooky about it is it's not coming from somebody staring into their crystals in Pasadena. It's coming from NASA, which gives it this element of credibility. When I hear about ayahuasca, it seems like this is a way that the earth communicates with people. Do you think that the sudden explosion of ayahuasca or the sudden popularity of ayahuasca is because the planet is aware of the fact that we are sort of moving in the wrong direction and is trying to present us with another path that we can take? I do think ayahuasca is cleaning our souls and cleaning this madness out of humanity, one body at a time. And it's spreading very rapidly and a lot of shamans have spoken to agree with that philosophy too. And because what ayahuasca is so effective in doing is clearing out the trauma, actually science shows that it repairs your limbic system, it repairs your serotonergic system, and long-term ayahuasca users have more serotonin, higher serotonin levels, so they're happier and they're more loving. And that's a message I get repeatedly with the ayahuasca is just to be more loving, to love humanity. And for me personally, it has physically cleared away my trauma and any of this anger and dark energy I was holding in my body. And even one time I had, when I was on the ayahuasca, this fairy type being came in front of my body and started pulling out this dark energy one person at a time and the energy was shaped in faces of people who I'd interviewed over the years. Whoa. And I, because what I had been doing as a Submersion journalist is really absorbing their pain when I'd watched someone sex trafficked, when I'd see someone shoot up drugs, when I'd see someone killed, that pain, I was so empathetic and I would absorb it because I felt like I had to absorb it to understand the story. I felt like I needed to understand why is that addict shooting up? I needed to feel their pain to try to get the story. And so I had all of these people's negative energy stored in me and the ayahuasca pulled it out one person at a time. And I really felt like the ayahuasca was going in and just repairing all my cells and repairing my DNA. And some shamans I've talked to also believe that ayahuasca is really curing our problem with epigenetics. And epigenetics is the science saying that if you face trauma, your DNA actually changes and you become more likely to be, your future generations become more likely to be mad. And so what the ayahuasca is doing is actually getting in our bodies and restructuring that DNA to get rid of the bad epigenetics and then to kind of perfect the DNA. So future generations maybe hundreds of years from now don't have all of this trauma and all of this madness. Right, hundreds of years from now. It feels, doesn't it feel like whatever is happening is moving much quicker than worrying about a hundred years from now? But doesn't it feel like this is, that there is, you know, Terrence McKenna, he was obviously one of the most renowned psychedelic advocates and psychonauts ever. And he emphasized again and again how important this is. I want to just want to read a quote from McKenna if I could. Here's the deal. We have the science, the technology, the money, the infrastructure to do almost anything that we want to do. The problem is changing our minds. We have a hell of a time changing our minds and yet we must, there's no choice about it. The reason I'm a psychedelic advocate is not because I think it's easy or because I think it's a sure thing. I don't think it's easy or a sure thing. It's simply that it's the only game in town. Nothing else can change your mind on a dime like we are going to have to change our minds on a dime. If we had 500 years to sort this out, we could maybe have a fighting chance without radical pharmacological intervention. As it is, if we don't awaken, we are going to let it slip through our fingers. And if hortatory preaching could do it, I don't know what that means, then the Sermon on the Mount would have turned the trick. It didn't and it won't. You have to somehow give people an experience, an experience that is not somebody else's experience. Their experience, their experience that radically recrystallizes their understanding of the world and these shamanic plants that have been quietly growing and maintaining themselves from millennia are in fact. And for what reason, it's beyond me. For some reason, these are pipelines into a kind of planetary mind. The big bugaboo of Western civilization is that we deny the existence of spirit. It's been a thousand year project to eliminate the spirit from all explanations of how reality works or the personality works or anything works. The absence of spirit permits the murder of the planet, but the cost of the denial of spirit is life empty of meaning, which doesn't mean we have to return to the world of beady-eyed priestcraft and its slimy minions, but it does mean that we have to recover an authentic experience of the transcendental. And apparently what this means then is fusion with nature and the psychedelics do this. They dissolve boundaries, they open the way to the guy in mind. Wow, that's somewhat a beautiful way to describe it. Yeah, isn't that great? And these shamans are some, what is a shaman? How do you define a shaman? I'd say they're experts who've been working with the medicine for some of them their entire lives and they're really able to use, in the case of ayahuasca, they're really able to use ayahuasca to heal. Some shamans are able to actually help physically heal people while they're on the ayahuasca. Others are able to see visions of the future to potentially protect their tribe. And others are just experts in the medicine and able to serve it up and keep the good spirits in and the bad spirits out. Is there a name for their religion that uses ayahuasca, whatever that is in South America, what do they call that? Well, there are a couple of churches that actually mix Catholicism with the ayahuasca. One is the Santo Daimei Church and the other one is the UDV or United Vegetal Church. And they actually sit in a church setting and drink the ayahuasca. But this is a new branch on this tree. What, prior to that, is there a name for the religion that these people follow? Is it called a religion? How, what I mean is how old is this, this thing that the shamans are doing? Because ayahuasca, God knows how old it is. There's no way to tell, but how long have they been practicing this? Some shamans tell me for hundreds of years. I think it varies, but I think for them too, it's not necessarily a religion, it's more just a lifestyle. They constantly would be drinking ayahuasca to find out how to heal people, to figure out what the weather is going to be like, to see the future, to try to make sure that the village stays safe. And so I think that these shamans, for them, it's more a daily thing versus a religion. So you're saying it's only a few hundred years old? For them, they think that the use of this only goes back for a few hundred years? A couple shamans that I've spoke to, but other people say that the ayahuasca has been around for thousands of years. So I don't know the exact timeline on it. It's just, it's curious to me, because here in the West, everything's, we have such a, we're really into time and history, and we could say, with any religion, how old it is, with some degree of accuracy, but something about out there, it feels like there's just things kind of vanished into the green, and you don't know, you just don't know where it's coming from. And my shaman would say, oh, my grandfather, I'd say, how long are you doing this? How long have you guys been working with the ayahuasca in your culture? And he'd say, oh, well, my father did it, and my grandfather, and my grandfather's father, and then he would just go back on his line, his lineage, and his entire family was devoted to the medicine, but they don't have exact dates. They, not that I'm aware of. I mean, someone could Google this, and maybe some scientist has figured it out, but anything from hundreds to thousands of years. Do you know, when did ayahuasca start making its way into the West? Are there any first reports of people using it? I think in the 1950s, when Shultes was down there investigating ayahuasca, some reports of it came into the US, then the 70s, you'd have scientists and explorers going down to the Amazon to sample it, and then I think it really has exploded with just within the past five years. I mean, before that, people would hear about it, think of it as being some kind of jungle brew, and it mostly stayed down in the Amazon. Now, ayahuasca is being shipped all over the world from the Amazon, so it's like this mother ayahuasca is spreading her tentacles of healing from anywhere to Brooklyn, to the Hamptons, to Panga Canyon, here in California, to areas of Indonesia, where ayahuasca doesn't even grow, to London, it's just spreading all over the world right now, and people can pretty much access it, and most cities. Do you think it matters where you do it? I think it has, the set and setting is so vital, so I think as long as you're in a good setting that's natural, then, and that's the only way you can access the medicine and you feel a calling to take it, then you should do it there, but I do think the best setting is definitely down in the Amazon, because you have the spirit of the forest and the energy of all the plants around you, and I think it makes for a more spiritual and profound experience. So this is fascinating to imagine that right now there is an underground, a shamanic underground, where people are gathering together everywhere and taking ayahuasca in secret, in secret, and that to me is really curious to imagine that we exist in a society where it's drinking this substance that points you in the direction of love, takes the darkness out of you, is illegal. That is maddening to think about that. And most of the people going to these underground, I've been to several of them, to these underground healing sessions are seeking desperate healing, and whether they have post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic back pain, or they're manic depressive, they're really seeking out this substance as a medicine, not as a Schedule I drug. And I've seen and talked to many people who've had miracles, not to say it works for everyone, but who've had experienced miracles on this medicine, and it's really sad that it is illegal, but the ayahuasca brew itself hasn't been deemed illegal. It's the DMT that's inside the brew that's illegal. And both churches, the Santo Dome and the UDV Church, the courts in the United States have ruled that it is legal under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act for them to continue to do the medicine. So that's pretty, that's exciting. I'm just wondering when anyone's going to bring a mushroom religion to the United States. Because it could, because the Mazatecs down in Oaxaca, who I spent some time with, are using the mushrooms medicinally as part of their religion. So when is someone going to bring that up up to the US? And the Mazatecs, these were the people that Timothy Leary contacted, right? When Huxley and Timothy Leary and that crew came in contact with it, it was through them, right? That's where they found the mushroom. Correct, this banker, R. Gordon Wasson, went down to Wautla de Jimenez, which was a town in Oaxaca, Mexico that I went to as well. I kind of followed in their footsteps. And he wrote this article about the psilocybin mushrooms, the magic mushrooms of Mexico, and it was published on the cover of Life Magazine. And then that piqued everybody's curiosity, and that's when Leary went down there and rummed us as well and experienced these mushrooms. And then towards the 70s, you had the Beatles going down there, Jim Morrison, all of these celebrities literally flocking to this area of Mexico to experience the medicinal healing of these mushrooms. And even when you go around some of these small towns, you'll see these people painted, you'll see the Beatles in the cafe painted on the wall. And it's really fascinating, but we've known since that time, since the 1950s, the power, the magnificent power of psilocybin to heal the human brain. And it's unfortunate that a lot of that research has just been sidelined by the Schedule I classification. Yeah, well, and it's been, I mean, this tendency of power to try to obscure love, it just always happens. It just seems to be built into the machine that we're existing inside of. All the way back to Christianity, early Christians had to draw fish in the sand. They had to disguise that they were Christians because they were throwing those assholes to lions, man. And for what? Because they just loved, because they were saying the most important thing is love. Love is more important than power. Love is more important than money. Love is more important than your job. Love is more important than food. Love is the only thing that matters. What is love? Love is the highest tech, it's high tech. It's the, it seems to be the way that whatever this transcendent force is, contacts this dimension is just purely through love, through whatever that is, that fractal. So when you come in contact with love, it doesn't matter what it is. Love for your dog, love for someone you're falling in love with, love for anything, love for yourself. You can like meditate just on that feeling and within that feeling is every scripture, every poem, every work of art, every great thing. It's in that experience. And for whatever reason, these people running the show don't want us to come in contact with that library or whatever you wanna call it. Because if we all loved and we all felt a sense of community and love for everyone, like this genuine pure love, like I felt from that presence or God who I felt when I was on psychedelics, if everyone was able to feel that, then they wouldn't be able to treat us as slaves anymore and they wouldn't be able to have the power that they have. Who are they? I know, that's a damn good question, Duncan. I've been spending years trying to figure that out. I don't think there's one or two people pulling the strings. I think it's just a system that's gotten out of control. And now we're being, the show's being run by corporations, not even by governments and people. And the bottom line for these corporations and these banks is to make a profit at any cost, whether that be human life, environmental destruction or just this insanity and all these wars that they're starting. And so I think that's the problem. The system itself is flawed. And so we need to get in and start fixing the system from the ground up. Earlier you were talking about organizing. Can you go into some more detail about that? What's something someone listening to this could do? Even if they don't have ayahuasca or mushrooms. I think what's really effective now is if people use social media and share information, share information that, not just information that's going to scare everyone, make them think they're going to die or the world's going to end, but share positive information, share news articles that focus on solutions, that focus on natural medicines and plants and just share those within their networks and really just be their own advocate amongst their friends. And I think that's an easy way that people can get involved. Even if you only have 10 Twitter followers, that's still 10 people receiving that message who wouldn't have received it had you not shared it. Right, yeah, right, exactly. That's a really easy thing. Like the next time you're about to tweet that fucking NASA, goddamn NASA report, which I've gotten at, replied maybe 700 times by now, the world's ending. And I only bring it up because, I only bring up the NASA report about the collapse of industrial civilization, not because I want to spread darkness, but only because I want to point out that there is an imperative to act, like to stop putting off saving the world. I had this fantasy, you know, that like, what if that's when you die, what happens is, you know, you come out of whatever virtual reality simulator, holodeck, super advanced machine, you come down from the wonderful psychedelic that was given to you by whatever alien that's your father, mother, whatever. And the alien says, oh, no, no, no. See, you were supposed to save the world. So we're going to send you back in. And then you go back in again and again and again and again and again and you do this thing over and over and over and over again. And that funny moment when you come out of this limited conception of yourself as an amber or a Duncan or whatever your name is, and you realize like, oh, shit. Wait, you mean I, I didn't just have to be a tax attorney? You mean I literally could have saved the entire planet? I could have been part of this wave of love that swept around this planet and created this transformation that we all know is possible. We can all feel it. That's the frustrating thing. I think anyone who's got half awake feels the potential, not just for the flash of the fucking nuclear lights, but for this, I don't know what it is. We can't even imagine what it is, but this wave of perfection growing out of the planet. And it's really intense when you start feeling that that could happen because you start feeling like, well, maybe I'm going crazy. And you're not because we're all involved collectively and shifting the direction that the human species is about to, or the cliff we're about to jump off of. And it's so important for people to, like you were saying, Duncan, to follow their passions. And if they don't want to be a tax attorney, start working now to find your way out of it. And when you follow your passion, success almost always follows. That's what you did. Yes. This is an important thing to realize. Because you were, I mean, you're working for CNN. You're a hardcore journalist. So, I mean, you're going to like, by suddenly diving into the world of psychedelics, that has to shut some doors for you. That's not just a, that's a big decision to make that leap, right? And I made it because I know I'm following my passion. I'm so passionate about these medicines now. And I've done that throughout my career. Whenever I know I'm really passionate about something, I always know that I'm going to be able to give it more energy. And it won't be a nine to five job for me. It will be a lifetime experience. And so I'll always do better, or at least be able to succeed because people will feel that passion. And when you follow your passion, most likely you're not going to be able to fail. And I've done that my entire career. It's terrifying. Yeah, it is. But it always works out in the end. It's always, it's weird the way the universe works. When you're following your true self, things always just kind of magically or mysteriously fall in place. And almost to the point, you have to like pinch yourself sometimes and say, was this all planned beforehand? I want to tell you though, once I got on the phone with someone who listens to the podcast, a friend of mine, I met him because he listens to the podcast, but he emailed me and wanted to talk. And I thought, all right, well, I want to talk to him because he's cool. So I called him out, we're talking. And he said, you know, you and Joe talk about just like getting out of whatever the thing is that you're doing and following your dream. But he's like, that doesn't always work. He's like, you can't just quit your job. He's like, I'm poor. I can't find a job now. I don't, you know, like you're telling people to just jump, jump, jump. But isn't that irresponsible Amber? Isn't it, are we Pied Pipers? Are we being the Pied Piper? Making people think that they can do this? Or do you really believe that it's gonna work out? Cause sometimes I'll get an unnerving email from someone who's like, you know, I listened to your podcast and I just want you to know I just quit my job of five years as a secretary and I'm going to pursue my dream. And I love it, but simultaneously I'm like, oh fuck. What have I just done? Yes. Well, I believe in the long term it will work out because you're doing what you love. And I often say what's worse, being a slave to something you hate for the rest of your life until all of a sudden you wake up and say, I should have done what I love, but now it's too late because I only have a certain amount of time left on earth. Life is so short. Do what makes you happy. And that doesn't mean you have the capability. And I understand a lot of people don't have the capability to just quit their job and then start something new. But that doesn't mean at night when you come home from the nine to five slave job that's just paying your bills that you don't then start working on your next project and building those two up simultaneously. I've done that many times. And then when my next project is ready for me to take over where I can rely on it financially, then I leave the slave project. And so many people, it's so sad. So many people are just kind of getting by with no stimulation, not following their passion and their true love. And life is so short. And they're doing that because they're addicted to comfort because they've confused comfort with being alive. And that's really bad. Cause I know when I think about going to do ayahuasca, the thing that's keeping me away from doing it is it's not comfortable. It's not comfortable. It's gonna be, it's gonna hurt. I know it's gonna hurt. And I know it's gonna be brutal. And I know it's gonna be like, it's gonna suck. And I think this is a funny thing people seem to forget. They forget that healing doesn't feel good usually. Usually whatever the thing is. You know, when you get a cold, you're not sick. You're getting better. You're experiencing your immune system, responding to whatever's gotten into your body that doesn't need to be there. You know, when you're getting, when you're, it's like what you were telling me when people are throwing up on ayahuasca. What do they call that? Getting well. Yes. Yes. And that's a problem. We have such a confusion. And I think this is just, that's a symptom of the confusion right now in Western society about what's a medicine and what's a drug. And we have a lot of drugs being disguised as medicines that just temporarily make you feel better. Yes, they do. Yes. And I love many of them. And they never really get to the core problem. And so it's just putting a band-aid on a bullet wound. And what a medicine is supposed to do and what I've learned from these plant medicines is kind of make it a little bit of hell while you're on them. Which sometimes is only a matter of hours. And then you go through absolute hell. You're purging your body of all these toxins, this negative energy, this trauma, this pain. And then you wake up feeling great and feeling like you had years of therapy in one night. So it's a bit of suffering while you're on these medicines. But once you're done, they often prove to be quite healing. Well, it's death. I mean, you are inviting people to die. You're saying just, it's time to die. You gotta die. You've gotta, you've gotta, I mean, I bet when snakes shed, it doesn't feel that great. And I bet when the caterpillar is turning into the butterfly, I bet it doesn't feel that great. If it, I don't know what caterpillars feel. I like to imagine that they're really smart and professorial and read and stuff. And it's like, what's happening to my body? I'm melting, this sucks. And then they become this brand new thing. But when Jesus Christ in the Bible says, you must die to this world to come to know me. Or when Buddha says, wait, I woke up. Both of these things are different ways of saying, I dropped what I was and I permanently, I permanently dropped what I was. And that's what you're saying. You're saying that this thing, your fear body, pain body, it's gone from you now. It's completely gone. I feel like I've been reborn on many occasions. And it's just, I can't even take it seriously when I watch all the wars and the fighting and the madness because I know to focus my attention on that is such a waste of time. And this force showed me that and said, I need to focus more on love and healing because until we're able to heal, we'll never get rid of the symptoms, which is all the madness you're seeing on the news. And so as a society, we need to shift our focus to healing this insanity and all of this trauma. And then we'll be able to cure the symptom. And I do feel like it's really strange, but I do feel like I've been reborn. And a lot of people, if you're gonna do psychedelics, you gotta be prepared for that, especially if you've developed a personality throughout life as kind of a coping mechanism that isn't really you. So many of us are carrying those personalities, whether we needed to develop it to survive as a child or what happened throughout life that causes us to develop it. And sometimes if you're carrying a personality that isn't you, the psychedelic's going to show you the real you. And for some people that can either be an extremely beautiful experience or it can be really traumatic. Traumatic, because we put a lot of work into these egos, polishing them, looking, get it, man, I mean, some of us have gotten so good at being cool. And we've really perfected, like being the smartest or the most beautiful or the most articulate or whatever the fucking thing is that we think is so great about us, we've just gotten so good at it. An idea of demolishing all that work and just throwing it back into the abyss, it is scary, it's a lot of investment into this costume. And for many people, when they go down, I mean, I don't know if I'd say many, but for myself and others I've talked to, you shouldn't make life big plans before you go, because sometimes you do come back, not completely different, but a different person and what interested you before, like for me, which was all the fighting and the wars and the negativity, doesn't interest you anymore. And that's what happened to me. I was starting an investigative news website, which was very much muckraking darkness, let's get the bad guys type site. And suddenly after one or two ayahuasca experiences, I realized I was heading down the completely wrong direction. And that wasn't the real me. And so I had to go back to my crew and let them know that I had to change, completely change. I bet when I come back, I become a tax attorney. I just dropped the whole podcast hippie thing. And I'm like, I just want to get in the tax world, work on that. I think that's the best life for me. I just, that's what the ayahuasca told me. I bet when you come back, you're going to feel calling to go to India and you'll become like a Ram Dass for sure. Well, that's, you know, a lot of comedians, you know, when we start talking about spiritual stuff or the idea of love or the idea of the awakening, they'll say, yeah, but I won't be funny anymore. What's going to happen to my job? Like if I do this, it's, I'm not gonna, my life is gone. Like if my income will go away. The way that I, you know, my, I'm not gonna, revenue streams will be cut off. Like, you know, sometimes comedians, if they're really fat, they get in this terrible trap because all their jokes are rubbing fat. They have to acknowledge it. And a lot of them just talk about fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. So now their disease and their lack of health and their, you know, something that's probably gonna make them die young is tied in with their way to live. It's so, so that's just an extreme example of this thing. And I think so many other people just think, well, I don't want to give it up, Amber. I don't want to give up my life. I don't, I don't want to, I don't want to lose this, this tiny little acreage of the universe that I've cultivated with fear seeds. And I don't want to stop growing my terror corn. You know? Yeah. And I think when the fear is just resistance, it's resistance to change. And if you're happy, then by all means, don't do psychedelics, you don't need them. If you feel healed and you feel genuinely happy and feel loved and everyday life, then you don't need psychedelics. But more for the people who aren't happy, what's the worst that could happen? You're already not happy. Life is so short. So why not take the risk? What if you do lose the comedian job, but then gain a job as a famous spiritual healer and you're really following your true passion and you're happy and glowing with happiness every day, then what's worse? I mean, what's on the other side? I think instead of looking at the glass half empty, we should look at it half full and say what awaits us if we're actually following our true calling in life. And that, I think that you're underplaying a little bit your courageousness because not everybody can take that dive. You know, when I was a kid, I was always the last one to jump off the high dive. Like I was like, fuck you guys. I know it's safe. Everyone's like swimming around down there, having fun, waving at you, making fun of you, like John Buzzy, you can do it, just fucking jump. What's wrong with you? When you're looking down, your heart's pounding and your hands are shaking. You know, like I've got to take this fucking jump. If I climb back down that ladder, they will never, ever stop making fun of me. I've got to dive in. And you seem to be the kid who was always the first one doing like barrel rolls off the thing or like doing cartwheels off the thing. Not all of us can do that, Amber. Yeah, I know and I have an abnormal amount of fear, but I hope through showing people my own story that maybe it will give them a little bit of inspiration because things haven't gone to hell for me. You know, I am not currently working on that other project anymore, but I've planted the seeds to a new project. Reset.me. Reset.me, so when you need to hit the reset button in life, that's who we hope to head to our website. And Terence McKenna describes psychedelics as kind of hitting the reset button on your brain, clearing your hard drive of all this trauma and just starting over mentally as a pure soul. And I believe psychedelics have the power to do that. So we're going to be covering psychedelic journalism on this site and there's just not enough journalism out there. Most of the news reports on all these amazing substances are reports on people getting arrested or a rare festival death. Rarely do you actually hear that, wait a minute, psilocybin has magic mushrooms, could actually cure your anxiety and depression and PTSD or MDMA could cure your PTSD or LSD could cure alcoholism. So many people don't have access to this journalism, so we're hoping to create kind of the Huffington Post of psychedelic news to get the positive story out there to really connect those who need healing, who need to hit the reset button with other cures. If they feel like there's no help, we want to definitely be the place they can go to find potentially other ways they could see healing. That is amazing that you're doing that. It is just amazing to think about that. And I like, the more I've been thinking about getting a chance to sit down and talk with you, the more it's been dawning on me just how incredible what you're doing is just because you're actually, you are, you didn't just, you know, it's like the Alan Watts quote. Once you get the message, hang up the phone. And a lot of times people take these psychedelics and they get the message, they hear it loud and clear. And they do hang up the phone and then they forget about the message. You're just like, well, fuck that. I just can't deal with that shit, man. I'm not gonna believe that I exist in some kind of universal extra dimensional entity that's decided to inhabit this little meat bubble of a body where I've gotten confused, there are confused matter as being the source of happiness. Well, people don't wanna accept that, but you're doing that and I think that you, I think that that is incredibly inspirational to all of us who are still sitting up on that diving board and the effect that that can have on the world, like you just don't know, you just don't know. I wanna ask you something, Amber. Sometimes I get emails from kids and some high school kids listen to this and maybe even younger than that and I'll get emails from them saying, listen to you talk about psychedelics, I'm gonna take psychedelics, what should I do? And that, whoa, that always gives me the heebie-jeebies because even though when I was in high school, I was always on acid. I would take LSD and go to school every day. It was not every day, but it's like, wow. As often as I possibly could. If it was around, the best way to take it was definitely take it at school because it's so weird to be in a high school when you're tripping. And I've talked about that, but then the idea of telling kids to do that, now I don't feel like necessarily that is the right thing to do. I wish that I'd, well, I don't wish that I'd wait it, to be honest, but I don't know. What do you say to the kids? It's tough because in these native cultures, they serve ayahuasca to pregnant women and children. So children and their teens, especially when they're going through those emotional issues and in balanced brain chemistry, they actually give them ayahuasca to try to help them through that situation. So I don't recommend either way, but what I do say is if you are planning to do it, just to make sure that you follow safety and you also really pay attention to the set and setting. And those are two things that experts can't stress enough throughout history that when you're going to take psychedelics, if you don't have the set and setting right. It's just defined set, because I think sometimes people don't know what that means. It's your mindset. So what you're seeing, what type of healing you want. And also you just need to make sure you're not in a bad place when you're actually ingesting the psychedelic. You don't want to be in a bad mindset or just had some trauma happen to you and then you take it and you end up having a really bad trip or if you're really scared. I like, I don't remember where, by the way, I'm not a Christian, but I do talk about the Bible a lot. There's a, I can't remember, before you take communion, the idea is like before you pray, before you take communion, you have to have forgiven people in your life. That's the advice is like before you come for forgiveness, make sure you've forgiven other people. And I think that's talking about mindset, the set before you, because I think it is a form of communion when you take a psychedelic. You're communing with something and if you haven't, as much as you can, you can't forgive everybody. It's really hard, but as much as you can, just like try to be in a place where you have let go as much as possible. And this is why purification, right before you take ayahuasca, isn't there like a very strict purification ritual? You have a very strict diet and then you are purified with water and various herbs. Your body's actually rubbed down to kind of clean this dirt away from you and prepare you for the journey. And especially with the diet, you have to be extremely strict. And another thing when you take ayahuasca as another part of the purification, also for your safety, you can't be on any prescription antidepressants. So you're not only cleaning your physical body, but you're cleaning the chemicals out of your mind. What did the herbs smell like they put on your body? Sage and I don't remember exactly what the, it was just a bunch of leaf, like a leaf mixture. So when you're taking ayahuasca, it's not like you're popping some hits of acid and going to the shopping mall to watch people go up the escalator. You're putting a lot of, there's a lot that goes into it before the experience. For sure. It's a complete ceremony and it prepares you mentally and physically. And ayahuasca is sacred. Ayahuasca shouldn't be taken at a party or just with a bunch of friends. I mean, it's very important to do it ritually because that way you're really able to get the full experience and it can really come in and do the most healing, which is not going to take place in a club in Brooklyn. That's why it's so wonderful that it makes you throw up. Yes, you can't, you can't move. You're violently vomiting. People are going out both ends. You just, it's not something you could take and then go dancing, spraying diarrhea all over the strobe lights. You would probably like people literally have violent projectile diarrhea and vomiting and sometimes at the same time. So you, by all means, take ayahuasca and go to a club, but you're going to evacuate. The whole club's going to have to be evacuated. The floor of the dance floor is just covered in vomit and shit, the hipsters having sobbing seizures in the middle of their own mess. So that's setting. Setting is not a dance club. Setting is, for you, it was being in the jungle, but hopefully wherever you're going to do it, it's in a place where you feel safe. And see, that's the thing. People have told me when I've talked about wanting to take ayahuasca, they've said, well, you can go up to, go to Malibu. There's people who do it there, but it's just like something about being in a house. It's not the same. You, if you can, if you have the means to go, now if it's your only resource, then by all means do it in the house. But if you do have the resources, I find it to be much more intense and healing when you're actually in the jungle where the ayahuasca came from with the spirits of the forest, because they do guide your learning session. Right, the spirits of the forest. That's what people say again and again, is that when you take ayahuasca, people tend to see the same things. Can you talk a little bit about those things people see? Yeah, a lot of people have visions of snakes, and I've never had snake visions, but you also see a lot of sacred geometry, and I saw a lot of amazing colors. Something else that I tend to be visited by a force a lot, so it's not very animalistic. It's more God-like when I use ayahuasca, but other people tend to see jaguars and really just the spirits of the jungle. Mine have always kind of been out of this world. I don't know quite what that means yet, but I'm sure I'll find out one day. This is, the snake thing is something that I think is fascinating, because in the Garden of Eden, the snake is the being that encouraged us to eat of this fruit, of the knowledge of good and evil, and people always say, well, that snake was Satan, because the snake was telling us to wake up, or was going against this command of this whack job who threw these poor, evolved monkeys in some jungle and told them to name everything, and the snake is like, don't listen to that guys, out of this fucking mind, eat this fruit, wake up. Do you think that fruit that they're talking about was psychedelics, is that psychedelics, or do you ever think about that at all? I know, I haven't thought about that, but I think people will report having positive experiences with the snakes for the most part. I don't know, you may have interviewed people who've seen, who've had devilish or... Never heard of that, just people seeing this enormous serpent-like being, but people are terrified of snakes. Of course, and so it once again, tests your courage, and you leave the next day after you face the snake that size, you definitely leave a more courageous person. Right, I wanted to ask you about one more thing that I thought was interesting, when we had coffee, you were talking to someone who just started talking to you, because now you've got this incredible magnetic, ROM-DOS thing that you're... Oh, that was the woman with the cat? Yeah, a woman with a cat and a papoose. I saw her purse moving, and I was like, what the hell, what are purses moving? And then this cat pokes its head out. Yeah, she was going for it. Like when you're like, you know what, I'm putting my cat, my papoose, and going down to get some coffee, that's, you're going for it. You do not have a worry about what anyone else thinks about you at that point. Yeah, yeah, but she was talking about, you were telling her that with ayahuasca, you actually begin to have the effects of the experience prior to ingesting the ayahuasca. Can you talk about that a little bit? Some shaman say that it happens three days before, you'll start to feel the medicine, and then it lasts for three days after, or sometimes even as much as two weeks before and two weeks after, because once again, the medicine's not on our time schedule. And so I... How's this possible? That's a good question, I don't know. And it did happen to me when I first got my calling to go down and use ayahuasca. It really was like a calling almost. And it really drove me to go down there, and it was almost like the medicine was already starting to work on me as I was heading into the airport, as I was heading onto the plane. You were feeling the love coming into you. Yeah, I just felt it's okay, everything's going to be all right. You're going to be healed, just get down there. And so I started feeling less anxious and more, even though I was flying over the jungle by myself, which I don't recommend for women. I recommend always to maybe go with a friend. But I just felt a sense of, okay, everything's going to be all right, even if this seems insane, it will be okay. And is that what you fear? Why do you still fear going down there? What do you think is your biggest obstacle to trying the medicine, or do you feel a calling? I think I'm going to think about my mom dying, and I think it's going to hurt really bad. And I think I'm going to think about a lot of stuff that's happened to me recently. And I think it's going to, it's like what you're saying. Like I know I still have these traumas inside of me that I want to get out. But I mean, like I have my mom's laptop here. I can't even open it. I can't open it without crying. Like I can't even look at it, it's too much. So I know, but I know that this is the same thing when I drink too much, and I'm lying in bed, and I'm like feeling like I got to throw up. You got to get this tequila out of your body, man. You just have to, you're going to end up, this other part of you is like, no, just fall asleep. Just fall asleep, you don't have to go throw up. Hold it in, hold it back. You know, that's, I think that's a pretty big part of it is I feel guilty. I feel guilty that I didn't, that I wasn't there for her enough when she, in her last few years. And so I just know, I feel like I've got like a, I've got to face that head on and I'm terrified to do that. And you do because otherwise, and this is what happens to so many people, is a lot of times physical illness is a sign of mental trauma, limbic system trauma, manifesting itself in physical illness. So for instance, my father is very anxious, and now he has a horrific backache, and they can't figure out where it's coming from, and it's left him immobilized for a couple years. He's thinking of going down and doing ayahuasca. So when you carry all this trauma through your mother's death and sad experiences that have happened, and you don't let it go, you're going to get most likely physically sick. So it's almost physically necessary to go down and process this, as well as, have you ever thought of how amazing it would be to just be able to let those bricks on your shoulders just go and be just free? And I think that's what I can't guarantee, but for many people who are facing grief, they do go down and try the ayahuasca, and it will allow you to part with those memories and maybe finally say goodbye to your mother. And some people are visited by relatives who've recently passed away, and they feel like they get closure, and I think that would be so healing for you to be able to do that. And that's a fear I had too, Duncan, when I went down there, I said, what the hell's gonna come up? Because I had memories, I didn't even remember, I remembered, of really traumatic situations, and I've always felt better the next day. I'll just put it that way. I'm a million times better. And so even though you're going through suffering maybe for those six hours to process those memories and learn from them, you're going to feel better when it's done. So it's just like, bite your lip, give it hell, go through it. Dive off, then fucking pull off that high dive. And then go in, because you can't physically carry around that kind of trauma before it manifests itself in something else, which could potentially be a physical illness, and for me, I had so much trauma, it came out as anxiety. And that's where my anxiety got so bad. I was having trouble even writing, and I'm a journalist, and I couldn't even sit down to write. Maybe if I do it and get rid of this sadness, my hair will start growing back. You never know. It can cure autoimmune diseases. A lot of these diseases, MS, sometimes they even say, I've talked to a couple of shamans who say they are able to cure erectile dysfunction, not to say that you have that, but also that could be... That's something the trauma hasn't messed up, thank God. But you never know, a lot of guys don't know that too, is that there's a potential medicinal value in that area from these medicines too, because that dark energy just manifests itself in other ways, and you need to get that out of your body. And that's where Western medicine has failed, because they just address the symptom, which is the back pain, but not really what's at the core of that. And that's not to say if you're in a violent car accident and you have back pain, that Western medicine can't heal you, but if you're having unexplained illnesses, then, and you can't, Western medicine hasn't worked to treat them, you may wanna start looking toward the route towards psychedelics and ayahuasca. Well, I can speak for that, because the one time I did DMT, I had this chest pain that I'd had for 11 years, gone to the doctor for it. I'd had x-rays, chiropractors, nothing would get rid of it. And so I just sort of dealt with it. Like there's always this constant weird pain in this one part of my chest. And I did DMT, smoked DMT, and these tubes came out of nowhere into that exact place, that presence that you're talking about. There's this sense of like, just accept this, accept it, accept the love. Now, it doesn't talk, but that was the sense of like, just for once, just take it. And then gone, it was gone, still gone, hasn't come back, gone, we're talking a decade of this thing that had been bothering me. Now, what the fuck is that? What is that? I have to report on that because it definitely happened to me. So I know when you say healing, you don't mean like, I don't know, you're gonna feel like better. You mean literally, well, feeling better is part of feeling, but you mean you're going to change in the direction of not being sick anymore. It's not a temporary, it's not like taking Vicodin or snorting Adderall or something, or you get a few hours. We're talking a lifetime transformation. That's what's happened for me. I felt a lifetime transformation by far. I feel great. I feel like the bricks of life have been lifted off my shoulder and I can finally be free and be my true self. And that's what psychedelics have given me and it's such a beautiful gift. But I mean, not to say I didn't suffer through my experiences. I had some pretty intense experiences, but at the end of the day, it was worth it. And psychedelics don't work for everybody, but the majority of people I've talked to on my journey and I think the majority of users of ayahuasca come out of it a better person. And even if you look, the science is there. They studied long-time ayahuasca drinkers in these churches in Brazil and they found that they really did have elevated serotonin levels. And that every one who had come into the church addicted to cigarettes or alcohol or drugs had quit after regular ayahuasca use. And there was no drug use in the church because they were using this medicine that we actually call a drug, but it's really, really a medicine. Isn't that profound? It is profound and it is mind-blowing to think. And it is, you know, if you wanna do us, it's like, I think we have this impulse to serve. People wanna serve other people. They wanna help the world, but they don't know where to start. And it seems like the place to start is you in this body that you inhabit. Start there. This is the closest you have to the earth, is the thing that you are. So start healing that and then maybe through that, you'll start affecting change in the people around you and you're the environment around you will start changing. But if you aren't feeling that first and you're trying to go out there, what is that? What do they say? God damn it, I'm quoting Jesus again. Don't take, don't remove the twig. I don't know, what is it? Like don't remove the twig from your neighbor's eye when you have a log in yours, you know? When you gotta don't worry about what's going on with your friends or your neighbors when you haven't dealt with your own thing yet. But if you can deal with your own thing, whatever it is, you're probably gonna be far more effective in this serving the world. For sure, and then people will pick up on that vibration and you'll send that vibration of love to others and you'll inspire them to connect with their true selves. And when you can perfect yourself and follow your passion, you're going to be able to enact tremendous change, especially if now you're living as a slave, you're unhappy, you're mean to everyone you meet, you cuss people out and flick them off like someone did to me in the car on the way here. Then you're harming, you're actually harming the world. So you might as well start dealing with yourself because oftentimes if you can do it through meditation and other means, that's beautiful. And even with psychedelics, it's just easy, relatively cheap ways to start perfecting your soul. I mean, if you look at mushrooms or some of the most profound chemical on earth, it grows on cow shit. Like, isn't that the humor of the universe? People spend thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars on therapy and they might get it for free off a mushroom one night. It does seem like this force has a really great sense of humor to put the most potent medicine on cow shit. It's pretty funny. And a pretty good way to hide something, actually. You know what? If you want to like keep something kind of secret or make it so that people have to take a little bit of an extra effort to find it, then put it on shit. Yeah, that's a really good, I never thought of that, but that's, it's true. Well, that's just something Grammy Hancock was telling me is it's just like, you've got to work for this. And I think that's what you're talking about too. It's like, and we were talking earlier about, you know, and then in the evening after your job, you can start working on your next project. And it's like, this isn't easy. Like, don't think it's easy. If you think it's going to be easy, that's what they teach you here. Comfort, comfort, convenience, easy, easy, easy. Easy way to get food, easy way to get water, easy way to get clothes, everything's easy. This isn't like that. This, you have to want it. You have to work for it. Just like any great thing. Like that's what Graham Hancock was saying, is if you want ayahuasca, you'll find ayahuasca. But you got to find it. It's, you have to look for it. It's not going to come to you. No one gives it to you at a club in Brooklyn. You know, no one, it's like an actual, it takes effort. And people, they do call it work too, when you're on it. That's what some of these religions call it. Like we're doing, we're doing work today. And that's what it feels like. You're literally going through the path of your life, revisiting all your trauma and working through it. And, and it's hard. And, but it's beautiful because unlike alcohol, which is the most deadly drug on earth and causes you to completely ignore your life, you're actually going through and doing something productive while you're on this medicine or drug, as some people will call it, and repairing your soul. And you'll be a better person for it. And you'll have a lot more energy just for life in general. And to lead a happier life. So inspiring. You're going to get me eaten by a snake, Amber Lyon. I'm going out there. I feel like, I mean, I don't recommend everyone do it, but I feel like maybe you've had a calling in particular, Duncan. I'm going down. I'm doing it. And you never know. There may be things that want to communicate to you and they can do that through the use of the medicine. What if they're just like, you're a dick. Like you're expecting this big mystical experience and they just are like, I just wanted you to know I'm not a big fan of your podcast. We just wanted to tell you, Duncan, you can go back now. Wait, no, really? Yeah, your voice, it's really annoying. All right, you're sober now. See you later. Well, I'm going to go down there. And thank you so much for coming on this show.

Perfect song for spring. Knowing the prophetic warning that they were... It's an odd and awful way to be. It's a happy laughter of the free. It's a truth and it's a dare. It's a feeling in the air. It's a mother's love for a child. It's a burst from someone else's universe. It's something you carry with you like a curse. It's a smile or a tear. It's a treasured souvenir. It's a cue that makes the heart sing. And an argument has nowhere to go. And you'll grow old before you know. And the memories shine clear like looking in a mirror. And you'll remember all the times you were sincere. And the mood will hit you. You'll be a baby again. It'll take and embrace you like an old friend. Adventure in your eyes. Romanic surprise. Like the sun shining through the clouds. Thank you for watching.

You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. That is a little tree planted on a little hill and on that tree hangs the most influential character that ever came in this world. I never feel that that tree is a meaning, this drama that took place on the stages of history. Oh no, it is a telescope through which we look out into the long vistas of eternity. You see the love of God breaking forth into time. It is an eternal reminder to a power drunk generation that love is on the way. It is an eternal reminder to a generation depending on nuclear and atomic energy. A generation depending on physical violence that love is the only creative, redemptive, transforming power in the universe. Happy 4th of July, my sweet darling friends. You just heard the great late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King giving a famous speech at the... on November 17th at the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. Can you imagine being in that audience and listening to somebody with that kind of charisma and power? Saying those words like a booming thunderbolt just melting your brain? Can you imagine that? You totally see why they took that guy out. Too much power. He only got a little bit of time here before they took him out because he had too much power. You get somebody like that talking about violence and war and fighting and the importance of violence, the necessity of violent revolution. And he's less dangerous than somebody who comes out and starts talking about how the most important thing in the world is to love other people. I'm going to read this to you in my raspy lesbian voice. And the odds are that if Martin Luther King knew that at some point in the future a stoner hippie with a raspy lesbian late stage smoker's voice was going to read one of his speeches on a podcast. He probably would have given the whole thing up and joined the Black Panthers. So I apologize to Martin Luther King. I apologize to everyone on earth, all beings that have lived before me, all beings that will come after. Please forgive me for reading Martin Luther King's speech after you just heard it. Because listen to the, it's obvious the difference is going to be, it's like hearing a tire try to say something, a deflating tire. It's like listening to a deflating raft trying to say something important. But I'm going to say it. There's a little tree planted on a little hill and on that tree hangs the most influential character that ever came in this world. But never feel that tree is a meaningless drama that took place on the stages of history. Oh no, it is a telescope through which we look into the long vista of eternity and see the love of God breaking forth into time. It is an eternal reminder to a power drunk generation that love is the only way. It is an eternal reminder to a generation depending on nuclear and atomic energy, a generation depending on physical violence, that love is the only creative, redemptive, transforming power in the universe. That is psychedelic. That is like a high power. That's kind of the stuff that you get when you smoke DMT. You get that kind of message that's not, it's not even, DMT isn't even as charismatic as Martin Luther King Jr. But it still gives you that kind of message. You get that sense that the only thing that matters is love, but it's more than the only thing that matters is love. It's somehow you're being, you're floating in this infinite ocean of love and you're fighting against love all the time. You're the one pushing away love. But there's another aspect to love that's really interesting. A kind of weirdly violent aspect to the act of loving someone. It's a secret violence inside of love. When you hear about love, you always think it's the opposite of violence. For example, you never, you don't very often hear the term loving violence. I'm going to love you in the most violent way possible. Violence is always something that is somehow antithetical or counter to love, which is really an interesting thing that we've taken love and sort of separated from it all the innate components that exist in every single thing in the universe. You're constantly surrounded by violence. No matter where you are at this very moment, I can guarantee that somewhere near you, there is a spider that just finished injecting a little bug with a nice dose of deadly venom. Not enough to kill it, but enough to paralyze it long enough so that the spider can surround it in a nice thick cocoon of silk. That poor little bug with whatever tiny bug brain it has knows somehow that something isn't right. It was just flying around and now suddenly it can't move and something is wrapping it up. It's about to get its guts sucked out of it. Maybe not now, but in a few hours. Birds are ripping worms out of soil. Cats are clawing the eyeballs out of mother birds as the baby birds watch from the nest. You're surrounded by violence at all times. So the idea that somehow love is this thing that is separate from violence or outside of violence. I don't know if that's true. I think that's a naive understanding of the way that love works because if you consider the potency of what Martin Luther King is talking about here, it's almost a form of violence in the sense that it is a sort of destructive force to have your ego annihilated by the potency of someone completely, absolutely loving you. That's an incredible change that's going to happen to you anytime. This is what they talk about when you're, you know, the baby looks at you for the first time that you've had. That first glimpse of this being that you brought into the universe and the baby locks eyes with you. And in that weird moment, you experience this outpouring of unconditional love for this sweet little baby. And theoretically, the baby's feeling the same thing, though more than likely the baby's just thinking, what the fuck has happened to me? I was just nothingness and now I'm somethingness. But who knows? We'll never know what the babies think. But that power, if somebody really loves you, the transformative power it has, the kind of acidic force that it has in relation to your calcified ego structures that have been protecting you from receiving love, it can overwhelm you and it can destroy what you thought you were. If what you thought you were was the tiny pixel of self that the infinite expansive field of your consciousness had focused in on, usually the thing that we're attentive to or focused in on is pain because it's the most obvious thing. It's the easiest thing to focus in on. It's like when your neighbor is playing shitty fucking drum and bass music in the evening. If you were near your neighbor and the neighbor's playing drum and bass music and somehow Gandhi had appeared in the middle of your living room after you got over the combination of fear that you've gone insane and were hallucinating Gandhi and the overwhelming awe at the fact that for some reason Gandhi decided to teleport into your Silver Lake house and talk, very soon your attention would begin to wander for whatever that sweet little brown man was saying about love to the terrible vomit-like drum and bass coming from your meth-addled neighbor's garage. Pain's the same way. You end up, that's the thing that you focus in on the most. That's the thing that you're the most aware of, the pain, the pain, the pain. And over time as we become more and more aware of the pain that we focused in on, over time as we become more and more acutely aware of the way the pain doesn't seem to go away but change form, then that pain actually becomes our personality. We believe that we are the pain and so if you get in the presence of someone truly loving you in those moments where you're being fully embraced by love, the pain goes away and if you've identified yourself with the pain, then that is a form of annihilation. And so when Martin Luther King is talking about loving everybody, he's actually saying let's use this incredibly potent force that seems to be the expulsion of the power of the infinite creative mind of the universe entering into our universe which has been symbolized and embodied in the form of this weird skinny hippie in Golgotha getting his ass nailed to a tree. Martin Luther King is saying love's a ray gun that melts the goddamn brains of the reptilian fucks who are running things. So it's very strange that on the other side of this love that Martin Luther King is talking about is a form of violence more powerful than the most violent violence that could ever happen. We're talking about killing people while they're still alive. This is what that weird hippie talked about that you atheists hate so much, you must die to this world to come to know me. Now this is the idea, this is why love is crazy. Everybody thinks love is some kind of impotent stuffed animal sort of fluffy puffed up, nerf ball level, Disney character kind of half hug at a party when you run into somebody you secretly hate. That's not what it is at all. That's why when you see Martin Luther King you hear this guy talking about love. He doesn't look like Wavy Gravy or Jerry Garcia. This guy looks like he's about to rip the eyeballs out of a racist and do a tap dance on top of them. He's pissed. He should be pissed. Back in those days you had to use a separate fucking bathroom if you were black. You couldn't go to the same schools as other people. You were treated as a second class citizen all the fucking time. It was a rough time to be alive. He was fucking pissed and by the way Martin Luther King was a big man. He really looks like if he wanted to he could crack some fucking skulls if he wanted to. That guy could throw some skinny Alabama gapped toothed moonshine reeking rednecks into a fucking wood chipper and then go eat a nice goddamn lunch and not think twice about it. That's what he looks like. That guy was fucking pissed. But the stuff that was coming out of his mouth instead of sounding angry and the whiny upset chafed from an inner tube down some river infantile hiss that comes out of my mouth sometimes is this booming expansive all-encompassing super potency. That is transformative. So this is the crazy thing when our sweet Lord and Savior Jesus Christ was talking about love your enemies. He wasn't saying because it's going to make your enemies feel good. He wasn't saying because you want to pleasure your enemies or because you should submit to your enemies or you should be less than your enemies. He wasn't saying bow down to your enemies roll on your back and show your enemies your fat little underbelly so that they can plunge their razor sharp fingers into the flesh of your stomach and rip your intestinal track out and wear it around like a goddamn trophy. He was saying that the only way to truly transform people is to love them. The only way you're going to change your enemies is to love them. That if you're hating someone angry at someone upset at someone that's going to do shit to transform the universe around you because if you get to pick what kind of universe you want to live in what kind of universe would it be? I know there's something romantic about the idea of having enemies. I know there's something fun about it. It seems like there's probably a million great fucking quotes about how wonderful it is to have enemies. Voltaire probably said something. Machiavelli probably said something. All the great wits probably said some joyous thing about how wonderful it is to have people in your periphery that you hate overtly or secretly. But really it's not that fun to have these little chunks in your mind that are actually neurological representatives of the people in your life because that's all you've got really. You're only around people when you're around people. Most of the time when you're around people you're not around people you're around whatever neurological corollary you've happened to ingest into your mind as you're sitting there alone in your house contemplating what this shit had said to you or what this asshole said to you. You're not even around them you're hallucinating basically. You're sitting there with all these images of these people in your mind that have done you wrong but really you're just looking at you. Little bits of yourself that you've segregated away from your consciousness and transformed into some kind of rubber stamp representation of these people who you could never possibly even know. Why? Because you don't even know yourself. You only know one tiny little piece of yourself. We only know one tiny little piece of ourselves. As everybody says the conscious mind is like the very tip of an iceberg emerging from an ocean broiling with subconscious tides and weird multi-eyed creatures. Strange images that you can't accept. Awful feelings that you had when you're a child or terrible events that happened to you that you can't even remember anymore. Not to mention underneath all of that in the same way that we now know that somewhere in the Pacific Ocean there is a giant skyscraper sized super shark that eats whales like french fries. Underneath all of you there is some howling screaming octopus like beast that is just constantly screaming about the inevitability of our own complete disillusion into infinity. Nobody wants to die. Those little bubbles come rising up out of the ocean of your subconscious every time you say some shitty weird thing to a clerk because he didn't get your goddamn order writer. Every time you mouth off to somebody and then you pretend that the reason you're being an asshole to somebody is because they deserve it. The truth of the matter is that your soul has indigestion and anytime you act in a way that is counter to having compassion or embracing somebody or loving somebody it's exactly as though your soul just farted through the action of your cruelty. But if you really want to be cruel to somebody like if you really want to get somebody if you really want to get somebody you really want to stick the fangs of the adder deep into the neck of whatever son of a bitch did you wrong took your man took your woman took your house took your job unfairly subjected you to some kind of terrible experience whether it was they told you to go see a goddamn Marvel comics movie which always suck yeah I said it or whether they did some awful thing like talking shit about you to somebody and it cost you a friend or a job or who knows what. If you really want to get revenge on those people what's the best way to get revenge on them that's not going to put you in jail. What's the best way to get revenge well clearly the best way to get revenge on somebody is to have a kind of unconditional positive regard towards them that isn't passive aggressive that isn't the whole thing like oh my god I just feel sorry for him just seems like something's gone wrong and I just hope they're okay not any of that passive aggressive bullshit that doesn't work that's just this is better in fact than to be passive aggressive I'm just worried about them it just seems like they're going in the wrong direction it's better to just overtly talk shit about them they suck their heart is a slug their brain is a steaming pile of smallpox diarrhea it's better to just tell everybody what a complete flaming asshole the person is than to when you're with somebody tell them oh I just hope they're okay no you don't you hate them and you want them to die you want some awful thing to happen to them you want their neck to turn purple in their backyard as they fall forward into a pile of dog shit because they're having a high blood pressure level heart attack you want to that cougar wandering around Griffith Park to pounce on them when they're walking their dog and for their dog to valiantly try to fight the cougar so they have to watch the thing bite the dog's head off before it turns its glowing eyeballs back in their direction and pounces on them using its back claws to rip their genitals off while sinking its giant fangs into their neck you want their blood to run into the soil of Griffith Park as their body enters into pain induced doom seizures and as their mind in its last moment thinks back at the terrible thing they said to you and they feel regret you want them to get dragged into the basement of a serial killer and have their nipples sliced off and replaced with plastic salt covered clown noses while a serial killer who calls himself the orange whore fists them to death that's what you want you're not fooling anybody when you feign this kind of compassionate love for somebody you secretly want to eat cyanide it doesn't work everyone can see it and it just makes you seem weak there's nothing worse than when you're around somebody who is acting concerned about a person they clearly fucking hate it's the worst feids you're not fooling anyone the stink of your hate rises up out of your words like an old piece of Korean barbecues stuck in the mouth of a frat boy who's been drinking Miller lights and snorting baby laxative laced cocaine all night if you really want to get horrified imagine this right now let's pretend and maybe you don't have any enemies maybe you sleep in a mattress filled with purring rescue kittens and every morning unicorns come to your window with strawberries in their mouths and you polish their horns using the tears of compassion you feel for the world and the soft bandana that you used to wear when you were in the peace corps and maybe every single thought you have is like the singing of a million angels and the song they're singing is a song of joy and gratitude just to exist in this beautiful dimension just to be able to float in the great nectar filled ocean of love that is all of our birthrights but many of us aren't like that you boring turd many of us have hearts that are filled with swarming hate bees and every time we open our mouth they go flying out into the world and sting whatever is closest to us if you're one of those people then I invite you to imagine that someone had given you some kind of magical device that would allow you to go through the minds of every single enemy that you have maybe it's just one enemy maybe it's multiple enemies maybe you don't want to use the term enemy you just have people you have an uncomfortable turbulent connection with that is based on past events that didn't meet your expectations or maybe you are there just some people that have like accidentally said stuff to you that bothered you maybe all of that's happening you can pick whatever one you want let's just say enemies for the sake of getting down to the bones of the situation somebody gives you a device and you can go through the minds of all the people that have wronged you and see that the way that they feel about you now what's going to be the most what's going to be the thing that hurts you the most is you scan through the minds of these people you're angry at what's going to really piss you off is it going to be that your theories about what this person thought about you are absolutely correct and that once or twice a day maybe three times a day they spend a good four minutes thinking about what a filthy little human shitbag you are in traffic they grit their teeth squeeze the wheel shake their head sadly and just consider what a turd you are and talk about you behind your back with people that you they're important to you now imagine that if that was the case and you were you could go into the minds of your enemy and you saw that that's how they felt then really nothing would change in the way that you felt about them outside of a kind of magnification of your anger towards them at the very most you would just get a little more angry your poor little asshole would clinch a little tighter your stomach would bubble a little bit more with anger fluids and your brain would secrete whatever terrible neurotoxins go along with feeling anger and that tiny little fissure in your stomach would widen a little bit and a new hemorrhoid might poke out maybe your sperm count would go down your feet would start smelling a little worse but ultimately nothing's gonna happen more than that now imagine if you could scan through this Rolodex of enemies and you went into an enemy's mind and instead of finding that they hated you or were angry at you instead you encountered the horror of realizing that they actually authentically unconditionally love you maybe it's not full on titanic level put your arms out in front of the ship and scream to the gods how glorious life is love maybe it's just a kind of ambivalent affection that they have for you a sort of passing fleeting hope that you are okay in this life this person who you from time to time have two or three times a day while you're driving in your car thought about how nice it would be to watch them run down a field while being swarmed by Africanized bees if suddenly you realize that these people actually felt love for you ambivalent affection just positive warm feelings if they thought about you generally they're probably not thinking about you but whenever they did a kind of warm bubbly jacuzzi-like feeling emerge in their mind because they want you to be happy wow now that would fuck you up wouldn't it wouldn't that be worse because you would be forced to deal with the fact that you were the one carrying around all this toxic snake-like venom in the snake bag of your heart you would feel this sort of combination of probably, I don't know, a little bit of shame or guilt because now you just kind of feel like Gollum or something living at the bottom of a cave you would be like oh man you'd have to analyze your life you'd realize that your assessment of the way people in the world actually think of you is completely wrong and it might even force you to go backwards all the way to the part of yourself that you hate more than anything else and then you would realize that actually all you're seeing in the world is a projection of the part of yourself that you haven't figured out how to love yet and then somewhere in that process there is some possibility, some vague possibility, some small possibility maybe a 4% chance that from realizing that your enemies actually love you and then falling backwards to realize that it isn't the anger of your enemies or the hate of your enemies that is terrifying to you but more the awareness of the fact that there's a part of yourself that you can't love that's causing you all the problems then somewhere suddenly that might make it so that you turn your eyes into yourself, figure out a way to love yourself in the moment you love yourself you would experience a kind of radical transformation that would make it so all the enemies in your universe evaporated and you were left in a kind of glorious, warm, happy, garden of Eden style dimension where your biggest problem is that there's too many unicorns coming to your window with strawberries in their mouths you in other words the you that you used to be, the world that you used to live in and everything you used to know would be annihilated by your enemy and that's way more powerful than getting killed by him so in the same way if you really want your enemies to experience this kind of radical transformation something that for lack of a better word could be called a violent transformation then the safest, most legal, psychedelic and awesome way to do that would be to figure out a way to unconditionally love them but that's not gonna work because your enemies are cunts they're smelly, stinky, angry poop heads you're not gonna figure it out, there's no way in fact if you even consider the idea at the very best all you're gonna be able to do is paste on some kind of phony smile when you see him and act like you love them when inside you're just feeling superior no the only way to figure it out would be somehow to love yourself turn that fucking transformative super power high beam that seems to be poking out of the crack in the universe that's symbolized in Christianity by this skinny little hippie getting nailed to a fucking tree on yourself if you can that black stinking poison hell seed that you carry around inside of you all the time figure out a way to love it, it's way worse than your enemies PS no matter who they are, even the worst of the worst of the worst out there it's still it's bad to exist on a planet where somewhere in some proximity to you there exists some person who maliciously did something to you or accidentally did something to you in the past it's bad to know that somewhere you might have enemies plotting your destruction though I doubt that many of us actually are that important but maybe you do, that's bad but what's way worse is the fucking you've ingested a mental corollary that's supposed to represent this son of a bitch and now they're living inside your heart can you imagine if suddenly your landlord or wherever you live your parents or I don't know where you live but if somebody told you that your very worst enemy was going to move into your house and there's nothing you could do about it you'd leave so now imagine how even more horrifying that is if some mental representation of your enemy has somehow climbed inside of you that's way worse what's the solution because whatever mental corollary you have whatever the neurological representation known in the yoga sutras of Patanjali is the vrittis the thumbprint of the universe neurologically pressed into your mind because you have to recognize that anytime you imagine a person you're not like making a telepathic connection with that person but rather you're just summoning up the exact amount of neurotransmitters to create a sense of this person in your mind unless you're a new age crystal buff in which case you think you have a kind of infinite array of microtubules stretching out from you that kind of create a quantum connection with all living beings and not just on this planet but in all time and space known as the net of Indra Google it regardless of whether or not you're some kind of psychic super octopus with quantum tubules connecting you to everyone you ever met or whether you've just digested the universe and have a neurological living reflection of the universe that's inside of you at all times the ultimate solution would be to figure out a way to forgive empathize and love those parts of yourself which are currently being taken up by the shadow of those you think are your enemies love that fucking thing shine some light on it it's just you anyway see if you can watch the feeling the next time that enemy of yours mentally emerges in your mind and you get in one of those fake conversations can you change can you love that guy change the conversation the next time you start chatting with a shithead who stole your girlfriend or your money or your car or your house or your job or your happiness have a chat with him sit down imagine it's kind of fun pretend you're in some kind of yurt and you're both sitting across from each other and look him in the eye and say I fucking love you I can't do it see if you can let me know maybe it'll work here's my theory if you figure out a way to do it if you figure out a way to embrace yourself and that doesn't mean suddenly it doesn't mean accepting the part of yourself that likes to go walking down by the river and kick squirrels or baby ducks or whatever horrible thing that you do it doesn't mean continuing that it just means look at it see if you can love it and watch what happens to your life because every time you figure out in the most tiny tiny tiny little way to forgive the part of yourself that you're most ashamed of or that you're even slightly ashamed of or even if you're minorly embarrassed by it there is a change that will happen in the external universe 700 times more powerful than the change that happens in the internal universe this is what the mystics say like Martin Luther King I think it's true so on the 4th of July when for every firework that explodes in the sky above you instead of imagining that those fireworks are miniaturized enemies being simultaneously blown to smithereens and incinerated by fire imagine that those things exploding are the external representation of the energy of love being directed to the parts of the world that you haven't figured out how to harmonize with yet or even better just enjoy the fireworks and get drunk forget all this rambling nonsense and have a good time stop over intellectualizing everything you damn weirdo just shove your face in some watermelon and go finger your darling that's how you enjoy the 4th of July how are you gonna enjoy the 4th of July if your heart is a trash can filled with rage puke okay let's end this weird rant with a little bit of coherence here is Martin Luther King talking about love and power and one of the great problems of history is that the concepts of love and power have usually been contrasted as opposites, polar opposites so that love is identified with a resignation of power and power with a denial of love it was this misinterpretation that caused the philosopher Nietzsche it was the philosopher of the will to power to reject the Christian concept of love it was the same misinterpretation which induced Christian theologians to reject Nietzsche's philosophy of the will to power in the name of the Christian idea of love now we got to get this thing right what is needed is a realization that power without love is reckless and abusive and that love without power is sentimental and anemic power at its best power at its best is love implementing the demands of justice and justice at its best is love correcting everything that stands against love I'm going to be doing a little bit of a boring portal on my website that goes directly to Amazon.com and the next time you are considering going down to the local delicatessen to pick up something or going down to buy some swifters at your local CSV or CVS or any chain store remember that you don't have to spend that time entrepreneur's nightmare but rather you could spend your time walking by a forest contemplating love perhaps you could even find some field somewhere springing forth with daisies and lay in that field with your enemy who is now your friend climb on top of him, straddle him and with a full force of love and power allow your throbbing member to enter him as you make sweet Martin Luther King level love there on that beautiful day instead of spending your time picking up Kleenexes and cashews from some sticky stinky shore store you could be humping your enemy who is now your truest friend and lover and to do that all you got to do is go through our Amazon portal located at dunkatrustle.com order whatever it is that you need hopefully you'll be stoned so you'll forget about it and then there'll be a knock at your door in a few days you'll open the door and with a kind of perplexed excitement you'll open a box to discover that you actually ordered a pentagram tapestry and didn't even remember it that's the glory of shopping at amazon.com you're not going to get that glory by going to some stinky chemical laden weird place where everywhere you look are awful indications of your inevitable decline and do old age and eventual death when I go shopping I don't want to look over it's somebody in a god damn blood pressure machine getting injected with a flu vaccine I just

the time and I haven't come back all the time because we have some generally really deep conversations that add a lot to my life and because I love him and because I don't know why does there have to be a fucking because why am I coming up with some stupid reason right now anyway to quote my dear friend Emel from one of his songs if I was to do something especially some terrible act I wouldn't want to think I was doing it for any reason that in fact that reason would dilute the act make it almost laughable or petty I'd rather think that something was operating through me and I didn't really know what the means to the end would be something like that I'm sure I butchered it I believe that's from his album Decline of the West now everybody please open your heart chakras and send love firecrackers right into Emel Amos's sweet ass but before you send those firecrackers in Emel's direction please enjoy this track from his upcoming album The Fact Facer this is called All Too Free links to all that are going to be in the comments section of this episode Altoo Free Why is it so hard to believe today no one could believe that they were lying to themselves Wicked and attached to my own way Not seeing something clear just like I should Wanting someone dear who's any good I have forgot just everything they taught and all of a sudden way to play It was just a dream of mine and no, it was just a dream It was just a dream of mine and no, it was just a dream It was just a dream of mine and no, it was just a dream It was just a dream All too free, oh, yeah All too free, oh, yeah All too free and all too free All too free Welcome back to the Ducket Trussell Family, our podcast. Oh, sweet God and Lord of Music, Lord of my heart and dear friend, Emil Amos. Oh boy, I've been thinking about... Why was I doing this? I think I was watching this documentary on Chappelle last night and it was showing the comedy store in 99 or something and I was thinking about when I left there and what was going on in your life and how you must have been feeling and looking at LA like when I told you I was leaving and you had to get a new roommate. Do you remember all that? Yeah, I remember getting the new roommate. I certainly remember that. Why? What happened? Well, because she would lay on the couch and like in a blanket and watch X-Files all day. She was chronically depressed and I was, you know, really mean back then. So I had zero empathy for her situation. Like everything was completely about me and, you know, my levels of comfort and part of what I wanted to be comfortable was not to have to walk in front of a depressed, moldering person, no pun intended, watching X-Files and cooking smelly food all day. I should have loved her more. I'm sorry, Simone. I remember you, we kind of like didn't talk that often for a few years. I mean, not that we ever talked like in really condensed blocks of time, but I mean, a long time went by and eventually it took a while, but eventually I did recognize that you changed a lot it seemed like and just the other day I was kind of thinking, you know, I think we've switched back positions. I think I've become the pessimist again and you're the optimist like when we met and that. But would you explain anything about what it was you think that made you transform when you're in those middle 2000 years in LA? I don't know, man. Maybe a combination of a bunch of different stuff. I don't know. You know what? Who knows? Maybe it's just some built-in genetic thing in all of us to go through these various changes. Maybe there's no maybe you can't, you know, maybe by pointing a finger at why you end up reducing the why. You know what I mean? Like, man, the the you don't know sometimes. Sometimes you just change. I don't know. I'll come up with a bunch of different reasons that I'd say, but like probably I don't know. I don't know what happened, man. I have no idea. I guess that's a good answer. I wish there was like one thing that, you know, if there was one thing that changed anybody then everybody would be changed. Everybody would be changed in the same way because they'd contact that thing and then they'd change. And why is everyone so fucking addicted to change anyway, you know? That's another big thing. I'm gonna change. This is it! I'm gonna make a big change! Well, you know, you could probably say that the same thing happened to me back in whatever, 98 or something, but I applied like, you know, these these ideas of talking to God in a dream and all this stuff to some massive meaningful shift. But I remember also thinking that I had been so wildly depressed for so long that mathematically somehow like the serotonin the pendulum had to swing and the serotonin had to come tumbling down and it did for like a straight long year every day I was like ecstatic. So it just seemed like my brain was like, well, it can't go any further down so it had to crest back up or something. I mean, I think there's something glorious in that analysis, you know, because like a depressed person, the depressed people who may be listening to this right now and got the deep numb happening and they can't get out of their beds like one of those giant exoplanets and they're a little tiny meteor that sucked into it. They can't get out of bed. They can barely move. Somehow they've managed to listen to this podcast. Who the fuck knows just the effort of downloading it for them was like, go, you know, when you're depressed, man, you're like it's like those people up on the top of Everest who don't have enough oxygen and just basic basic stuff like zipping up your jacket is like doing fucking squats, you know, and I think there's something glorious to be depressed and actually hear that, you know what, it's going to change, might not seem like it, might seem like this goes on forever. Depression certainly will trick you into thinking this will go on forever, but it doesn't. Suddenly you turn a corner or a bunch of tiny little corners and the next thing you know, you're back to being human again. All you need to do is hang in there. Hang in there. You're on Everest. We get it. The oxygen feels like it's running low. We get it, but both Emil and I have been severely deeply, darkly depressed. Suicidal thoughts every day. Still could be at any moment. Just wait. Any moment that pendulum can swing right back down. You can go falling down into that dark dank hole. Sure, why not? And that's the cool thing because you realize like, well, here I am back depressed again, but you know what, it's going to get better. It always does. It always does. Do you want to play that song and kind of get it out of the way and then keep moving? I think that we should keep moving and play the song because we play it now, it breaks it up. Do you think the song's fitting right here at this part of the podcast? Because I'm totally into dropping it in. Either way, it doesn't matter, but you can edit this out, say, asking each other this stuff right now. Why? Well, in respect to what we're saying, I feel like ever since we brought up the mythosisyphus at that live podcast, I feel like it's become the central metaphor that every day I tend to use to describe my state of mind. I think I've definitely been dealing with maybe a little bit of depression, maybe mostly stress. I think it was mostly stress and then also just an inevitable life phase that's just characteristic of kind of, we're kind of at this age where we're sort of planning to be older or something. You can smack me down and say, there's no such thing as age or something. Well, there is a level where there's such a thing as age undeniable. You'd be a goddamn fool to say there isn't when you look at your fucking moobs forming and your hair starts falling out. Come on, man, you know there's something going down there so much as you want to pretend you're Peter Pan. On one level, you're a melting flesh candle getting devoured by the force of time. No sense in pretending that's not happening, but that's not who you are, even though since the mind likes to fixate on things like that. If you don't watch out and if you aren't careful, you will become convinced that you are your age and that's where things can get pretty dim. Yeah, what if getting older and let's say let's say someone who has the appearance of being more harsh and like, negative. Let's, what if what if it's part of this natural process to shed just basic illusions that you have and were built into you as a child or you imagined so much about the world and created a bit of a one psychologically, you know, like you have a bit of a bubble that you're living in of self-concern and as those walls get disintegrated and the world starts to look a little bit more difficult and things seem more difficult as you inevitably become more ambitious. Why wouldn't that seem like a bit of a harsher reality? It's not bad, like you can take all the negative connotations away from it but like, what if, what if what you're not, what if instead of you becoming more bitter or whatever it looks like what's happening is you're shedding illusions that are holding you back. Ooh, yeah, I love that. I think that's a great way to frame it and even though it is a bit dire because it's like implying that the thing that it's holding you back from is this kind of harsh permafrost of age or something like that I do love the idea that the illusions are sort of like what's happening that the world has been dreading you begin to realize is actually this kind of more intimate communication with truth and it's quite beautiful because it's you know what you find out is this incredible relief like when you're a kid and you imagine being old 40, holy fuck holy fuck, man 40? 40 like some old bit of gum that God spit out in the sidewalk of life, that's what you are just old, all the commercials start getting geared, certain commercials start getting geared towards you when you're 40, definitely late 40s man, you become a very specific demographic for adult diapers, boner pills life insurance, so you see all these things and you start dreading this illusionary boundary that you pass that's called being 40 and then suddenly you're 40 and you look inside your heart and you do have guilt and all the combined regret of the life that you lived ungracefully but underneath all that you start experiencing this odd warmth that is amazing, at least that's what I feel the sense of like wow this is not only is this not as bad as I expected it in many ways it's way way, way better than what it was like to be young this is a whole new kind of youth, it's an unexpected spring, like what the fuck, there's a spring happening here, now I can't explain that to people, you know because the conditioning is something where we're all, you know worship at the altar of youth but man, the beauty of being young, here's an example, you know because you hear that grumpy old fucking crow face shitbag who says youth is wasted on the young do yoga you know what I mean, like what your body's tight, is that what you're talking about because I think it's like this, youth is given to the young enjoy your youth as you should, just have fun be fucking this to the pain of the world whatever you want to do do it and enjoy it just the way you're gonna enjoy it not like you're not like you're you have a bowl that's gonna run out of cherries it's a big bowl of cherries and there's nothing at the bottom and you get to keep eating them your whole life I think that's a very fun thing to find out hehehe when I well, okay part of what I'm asking you about that period in LA, because I'm personally, genuinely interested in sort of what happened to you over those years, I don't even know if you find it interesting, but I know that what I was dealing with like when we kind of, we didn't talk for a little while, I think both I think both of us were struggling with something, so there wasn't a whole lot to report, because there was in the beginning of our, sort of the beginning of our careers, sort of so we were struggling a lot and maybe it was I don't know if, were you depressed at all back then do you remember 2001 shit like that? I was just as I was in college and to some degree as I am now but thank god a little less, I was a fucking raging vortex of pure insecurity mixed in with an incredibly overblown estimation of my talent it was like the worst combination of things this sense of like you know what I mean, like this feeling of like this hidden I know I know how great I knew, just knew I was great and judgmental, I was so judgmental too man like just like unfairly and cruelly judgmental because I was insecure because really insecure people are the most judgmental, so I was like incredibly judgmental of like comedians and just anything that I felt was better than me, probably I was trying to diminish or reduce to fit into the idea that I was somehow the ultimate of ultimates and then that was all derivative, being derived from insecurity, so that was a rough phase for me and I probably didn't even realize how much of a rough phase it was for me but sentimental too, like really caught up in the sentimental notion of doing stand up comedy and being a performer and then like you know like before I even I don't understand stand up comedy now but back then I probably thought I did more than I do now and I can remember like hoping this is when I probably had six minutes of just shoddy shock material but I can remember like I can remember like an embarrassing sitting on an airplane this is so embarrassing and like somehow some idiot you're not an idiot, an idiot to start talking to me but someone starts talking to me and I think I managed to like navigate the conversation to me being a comedian like the worst because I'm so proud of myself but not in the right way you know like just like it was all a jumble it was all a jumbled mixed up ego mess you know and I I think a lot of performers have to go through that but at the other end you get this glorious relief when you're able to accept the fact that you don't know everything you're not the best at anything you're not even that great at much and that's okay oh god it's so wonderful man when you finally drop that suitcase and just just experience like okay well this is where I'm at not the best not the worst so you're saying there was never any like big turning point never any big revelation it was just pure experience that helped you kind of gain some objectivity and grow out of that stuff yeah I guess I mean you know you do stand up and in the beginning you do anything man and like hopefully the process brings you into a place of authentic humility not like in bullshit humility where you say stupid things like when people tweet things that you it feels kind of like maybe they don't really mean it you know like or like you know that weird like when you're getting an award and you say this kind of like sappy speech but it feels like you don't even understand why you're what you're doing or why you're there or something you know like but it's like you and sometimes I get this glimmer that isn't related to the career at all though I do I mean I think I can't believe that I get to do this as a job it's something behind all that we're like man thank you universe God creator force whatever's out there I can't believe I get to have this body it's fucking so psychedelic and awesome thank God for this or universe or whatever and then I don't know why you those moments are really good moments that to me is the opposite of depression are you aware of like an alternate version alternate universe version of you that never found any success that still sort of works in a gas station somewhere never got never worked at a gas station not that that's bad but the the uh yeah you know this is the thing man okay go and watch Richard Alpert prior to becoming Ramdas talking about mushrooms right mm-hmm he's still this like sweetie you know what I mean like the guy is clearly the sparkly sweet guy he's just using different words to describe something you know and I'm not saying but I think that like no matter where you end up I mean that's the big illusion of this like fucking career crap and especially the entertainment the idea of being an entertainer or that that stuff is like it's pounded into people's heads to the point where it creates this sick hierarchy of experience where somehow that is uh you know like God how many like people go galloping to it to Los Angeles every fucking day like just galloping here like it's some water hole in the middle of a prehistoric desert these where you could drink deep of these waters of fame and somehow at the other end of that you experience a moment of true peace you know what I mean it's like I think the alternate version of me if I didn't do stand-up comedy would have been somebody who maybe started doing something it's probably psychology or I don't know what I mean I have alternate versions of me where I see myself sentimentally in some kind of like beautiful house with a wonderful wife and children and kind of like I don't know but even that I don't know no I don't have an alternate that's a great question though I don't even understand I don't understand this I hope I don't sound too easy but I don't understand this much either I don't understand you know what I mean maybe that's the difference between now and then is I just know that I don't understand much I definitely get messages in my brain like like I can tell I can tell that I was entering the phase when a lot of my friends were having kids and stuff because I would get sort of messages in my brain that I wanted to take care of my girlfriend or something like I get messages or I get images in my brain that more for me instead of having like a house and a wife or family and stuff I'll just get these images of like a place where I will go where the stress will be over and I'll basically be like retired and like living in that Maxwell house commercial way where I'll be sipping the coffee looking out the window into the fields of wheat Valhalla this is the dream of the fountain of youth yeah it's such a shitty image because it's like you're like I think life is full of those and this is what I meant about aging before I think life is full of these sneaky subtle seductive carrots that sort of dangle in your mind the grass is greener and try to pull you towards these static images of you being at peace in the world and it's almost like the process of aging is more about trying to demystify those those seductive voices and try to you know put them away and realize that they don't exist I mean I definitely grew up let's change what you said from the process of aging from the process of personal evolution aging being just a kind of meter by which you measure the amount of time that you've gone around the sun and I guess the number of times your DNA replicates itself you know what I mean aging being separate that's what I mean but I only say aging because maybe because the connotation of my particular version of this something to do with me like finally wanting to enter a sort of old phase in a state of grace or something something where I can walk outside look like shit and have people accept oh yeah there's that old guy instead of you know wanting to be young or something that's just part of my like you know do you ever get that kind of lusty feeling where you want to just be released from the pressure of sort of the rat race or something you know what I mean? You know the relief that has come to me man I got to do this I don't I got to do this is like one of the high points of my life man I got to do a series of podcasts with Jack Cornfield because he's releasing his own podcast and I got to sit down and talk to him and he talked to Natasha Legerro and Pete Holmes and this podcast is going to come out I don't know when but man it was amazing to watch this guy and to be in front of him you know and so he sort of helped articulate something that was growing inside of me that totally relates to what you're talking about which is that there is this illusion of this point where we come to some kind of final conclusion and there's this weird peaceful thing you're talking about self acceptance being that person who goes outside freed from the pressures of life after this is done or that is done or this this is this happens or that happens never happens he's really good at articulating that in a way that doesn't sound dismal because we've tricked ourselves into the crazy idea that there is safety in this dimension that there is a point of rest that there is a moment of rehabilitative rest where after the struggles and woes of our life we find some tranquil shady place whether it's a mental place or an actual physical location where the waters of forgiveness wash upon us and we are born anew and that place does not fucking exist so it's kind of like music or when you're recording right now there's a little bit of hiss happening in this recording I don't know why something maybe is wrong with my sound board probably more of the fact that I don't know how to use this shit at all but the human mind when it starts hearing the hiss people listening if you get fixated on the hiss what are you going to do you're going to miss the point of the conversation you're going to miss the podcast and get caught up in the hiss fucking hiss it's always there so that's the same way it is I think there's an underlying inevitable or rather endless hiss in the existence of on this planet and that hiss is suffering pressure complication turbulence disruption disappointment all the things that create what the buddhas call the body of fear or pain the pain body if you focus on that mother fucker well then you begin to believe that there's a point where the pain goes away doesn't go away never ends and now what you could do is instead of pretending that the pain is going to end you just begin to embrace it accept it surrender to it and recognize that it's a natural part of existence and woo once you start doing that man what do you know what do you fucking know it does make it's almost like you're walking down this path in this tranquil you know forest or something and as a metaphor in life and at some point some some horrific thing is revealed to you behind the trees but it was always there and then you have to keep walking you know and learn how to like phase it out beautifully said and here's another great thing about it that little that thing that you see behind the trees the thing wearing the fucking cloak with the long hands and fingers that have sharp bloody claws at the end that's looking at you like a subway sandwich it's not just that you see the thing behind the trees it's that you realize at some point that thing is definitely going to eat me no way around it I could sing to it talk to it pretend it's not there I could try to fight it it's still going to eat me it's that it's not just that you realize there's a thing behind the trees you realize this thing will eat you you are going to die impermanent you are impermanent you know and that thing isn't going away and all the other things aren't going away that you think are going to go away just doesn't get better and a lot of people hear that and they get so got they're like you know you're being negative because these Disney movies make it seem like once you beat the bad guy you marry the princess have some babies and then the credits roll they don't show what happens after you beat the bad guy marry the princess and the princess gets cancer and the babies fall into the ocean and drown and one of the babies you leave in the back seat of your car and maybe one of the babies shoots up a school my version of of depression more recently is kind of like I feel like in this early 2000's you know we're both kind of running at this wall and we looked up the wall and it was just impossibly infinite mountain that we had to scale to get to where we assumed we had to go so we kept sliding down the wall and then one day years and years into this running up trying to get up the wall we like sunk like one little hook into one spot that could take it and then very very slowly worked up enough strength to pull ourselves up to the next thing and over years and years very slowly pulled herself up and at some point it dawned on me that this wall is just kind of like that Twilight Zone episode where they finally scale the wall and they fall out the top and I don't know if you remember the episode but life is a joke they fall out of the top of this prison and they hit the snowy street and they were like action figures and a trash can their whole life yes totally man that was probably my favorite episode I think about it probably at least once a week but now we are scaling these walls our whole life with ambition and accomplishment as our sort of guide map it's ruling our days today I'm going to record a podcast today I'm going to mix a record tomorrow I'm going to take promotional photos on Wednesday I'm going to do an interview everything has been totally focused on all this stuff there's just this deep sigh in this moment and then I'm just going to fall out the top of this thing yeah you sure are especially if you're results oriented that's the problem everybody's got this notion of the universe like we're outputting shit in a factory man the whole thing it's like we are doing this for this here's why I'm doing stand up comedy so that I obviously the reason I do stand up comedy is because someone's going to see me in the audience and put me on a fucking tv show you know and then suddenly that's what you're doing right and so then when the tv show isn't happening then if you let your mind take control the mind will tell you see you shouldn't have done stand up comedy and you're god damn right you shouldn't have done stand up comedy if you wanted to get on a tv show you shouldn't do it either because it's like a form of weird repetitive sickness that you can't stop doing or because you love it or because whatever but this dream of the paycheck down the line man god I've had the good fortune of meeting some of the most successful fucking comedians based on the normal perception of what success is and they're exactly the same way they were before they got success except with the addition of money and like is that what we're looking for is the watermark for a person's activity being somehow justified money from a corporation that sells cars and banks and or gets people in debt to the banks that can't be the reason you want to do something to finally get knighted by some kind of I mean aside from the fact that tv is am radio these days and the whole thing is getting flushed down the toilet by technology and it doesn't matter anymore as much as it did aside from the fact that that whole old archaic system is collapsing it's like god damn it man we gotta do things for stuff from if I'm doing something it better be for not for money because shit have you ever felt more if you really want to feel disgusting do something just for money like feel that go do that as an experiment you guys go find something to do just for money just find something out there and do it just for the dough find something out there I don't know whatever it is but if you have a job that you're doing just for money you know how that feels you're objectifying yourself you're objectifying the people around you you're objectifying your boss you're letting yourself be objectified that's no fun see I'm talking about this god damn liberation where you begin to realize that you don't have to do things I quoted your song at the very beginning of this man one of my favorite one of your my favorite lyrics is in any song is if I was ever gonna do anything especially some horrible deed it wouldn't be for any reason how does that go yeah no you got it you got it it wouldn't be for any reason especially that the the reason would dilute the act make it almost laughable or petty see all these fucking assholes out there doing stuff for reasons it's embarrassing when you see one of these puffed up peacocks fanning out there whatever their talent wings are to hypnotize a crowd and they're not doing it for any reason they're not doing it for anything more than for the reason of wanting dough it's embarrassing it's an embarrassment because they feel so important the dogs my girlfriend was pointing out that when you give the dogs a little stuffed animal they get puffed up and they kind of prance around with the bone or the stuffed animal they really feel important and one of them the stuffed animal they'll put the stuffed animal down for a second and sit on the couch and then the other one will jump up and try to get the stuffed animal and the fight that ensues is like world war three they're fighting over this plushie like it was the goddamn arc of the covenant or nuclear weapons or some kind of unseat this fountain of youth and that's what humans are like when they get puffed up over the fact that they have some temporary transient success that's defined by the amount of monkey paper getting paid to them by a corporation whose number one job is to hypnotize idiots so that their guard goes down and they get in debt to a bank when they buy a Range Rover they don't need wow man okay well anyway what just happened you guys after that weird Range Rover rant kind of obvious shaking my fist nothingness I listened to Emil's song from his new album coming out and wow the song you guys already heard at the beginning I just listened to it for the first time it's really good Emil hmm it's coming out something like September 24th ish on thrilljockey which is a Chicago label a new label that I've never worked with that was pretty legendary for kicking off of many things the tortoise career one of the great 90s bands that's still around anyhow very eclectic label great people man that song though wow man that is really that was that's an intense song the piano in it is so amazing man wow you must be so that must feel so fucking good to have something like that go out into the world uh I mean it's kind of a funny a funny subject really because that was recorded in fuck that song was recorded in like 2008 and I wasn't because my career has been so strange and all over the place I wasn't able to ever find a place to put that song so not only was it written in 1996 and recorded in around 2008 it's now 2014 so there's a lot of feelings that go on in between all those years and some of them aren't very good you know and and so somehow I don't know that that song kind of like simmered in a pot somewhere and then it landed into this record because I think the record is really it's really dark so it needed one or two moments of that sounded a bit more optimistic to balance it out so the song became really important to come back you know yeah yeah sure that's interesting when you're making an album you feel like you got to throw in some happy spice in there so it's not too dark it's not yeah totally it's not like it's that like forced of a balance but I think because any piece of art like life is just a series of tension and release you just you know you want to pull people in and you want to then you want to kind of like push them away a little bit there's something to that rhythm that keeps someone engaged and I don't think it's like necessarily a manipulative thing but it's more about just maintaining tension you know like a good David Lynch movie or something like the way that sound and envision kind of like keep you on edge a little bit you just don't want the tension to dissipate and too much darkness just gets it's like you're hitting someone over the head you know there you go man you know who else could have just given that explanation for creation? God that sounds like you know like if you like end up getting in the presence of the creative force the universe like hey why the fuck did you make it so goddamn dark down there sometimes you could just do that exact answer that you right well that would be like the absence of the sun right it wouldn't make any sense nothing would grow nothing would well you never be able to see anything either so well it's kind of like you got a you know like that you almost like here's a it's like you don't want to realize that a lot of times you're pretending that the pain doesn't feel good like you know you know what I mean like you don't want to realize that like in some weird ways even the most painful thing you still realized it that's New York holy shit somebody ate too much pizza New York pizza and his best joke was invented we got a pizza overdose on 5th and Lemoine in the meatpacking district better get down there boys and the crowd just erupts anytime you do that anyway you know what I mean man it's like it's so funny how you have to like you know when you find yourself writhing on the floor moaning over some awful realization or event if you just if you give yourself a little bit of space in there you find that there's something so juicy and strangely exhilarating about those moments that you almost have to play a game of make believe with yourself so that you can fully be in pain and not faced with that odd thing where you realize that everything seems to have a little bit of sugar in it I feel like some people lives almost like metaphorically they're sitting at a desk and they just have a happy button and they're just trying to slam the happy button over and over again maybe not realizing that that life has no subtletied dynamics and like you can't like sink into the basic arc of like how true satisfaction comes if you're just kind of trying to run up at a target of like a reward over and over and over again you know what I mean yeah yeah it's true man poor dogs if the dog just thinks that the only thing that matters is getting that treat it's so interesting when you just start finding these secret hidden like what do they call it in video games when people they leave these funny little easter eggs you find these weird little easter eggs hidden throughout even the most dark moments it's almost like if there was a creative force which it's arguable who knows but it would almost seem like he's too or she or it or all of us to combine forming it it's almost it couldn't bear to really just let us be completely alone there's always a secret hidden in there I don't know though I love Zizek he'd probably fucking throw a goddamn bowl of pasta at me if you heard that shit you know Zizek yeah I don't I haven't spent a lot of time with it but yeah I do he talks about how in psychotherapy any of his friends or psychotherapists say life is not that they don't get enough enjoyment but they can't enjoy what they get oh god well that seems that seems painfully obvious yeah but it's something that people really like over look he's using it in reference to like Coca-Cola and showing like all these awesome coke commercials in this show the perverts guide to ideology where and he says you know as though the necessity to enjoy has been inflicted on us has been shoved at us that happy button that you're talking about it's as though if you're not constantly slamming that fucking happy button something's wrong with you and he's showing all these coke commercials where these jubilant idiots are like cavorting around a DJ in this kind of Mayan ritual sacrificial ritual with a fervent manic amplification of cultists surrounding a baby about to get gutted by a fucking pie priest that kind of like cultist look in their eyes and this is somehow all associated with the story of Coca-Cola which is of course the story of all of us which is that finally at this point in human history we've gotten to a place where we're just basically standing under a fountain of ecstasy and we're all supposed to be drinking the liquids of God's jizz like sex addicts at a fucking glory hole you know what I mean so that means that even though the corporations are constantly sprang us with their ecstasy come just like anybody I'm sure if you've ever been giving oral sex to your girlfriend it's wonderful when you're really into it you know and like you're a stone and you're like God this is so, God your heart's pounding and like you could just, you want to just drink every little drop but it's like eventually you gotta go to the bathroom or take a break you know you can't be constantly getting hot wet calm on your face Jesus what have I done to this podcast well the point stands it's true thank you maybe you need some like audience laughter tracks or something or the lack of just a kind of confused uncomfortable moment I believe would be the more the response from whatever I just said but you know what I mean man it's like this and it is obvious to say this but we do forget that these in between moments are in fact the majority of what things are and that if you begin to get fixated on the moments that are in between the in between then you end up falling into this infinite endless fractal where you're always one decimal away from experiencing happiness and you'll never ever get to that decimal you'll just always fall in waiting and waiting for the moment and the best you could do is pretend to be happy and put on a big fat smile on your face when inside you're still dealing with this problem that emptiness the tension the darkness the ache are you there god damn it Emo I thought that was actually pretty good ending laughter that ache though is always going to be there you know it's like the moment you start accepting the ache that's when you can enjoy the slot machines no the zizzic thing is it's it's I wasn't saying like oh it's painfully obvious I was saying it's it's painfully obvious in the way that it's it's brilliant to you know like I I digger said like if you could just if you could just ask the right question ask the question the right way the answer would would present itself wow weird that's so weird I love how he's yeah he's pointing the finger back at yourself for just not I mean he's definitely that's a SART you know you're sort of like your freedom is your freedom to try to interpret your situation in any way you want to do it and I don't know why someone who is so intelligent would get caught in called a sex of over analysis and and depression when when really like we have these these amazing advantages and incredible lies but like there's there's so many times when I I'm feeling like my intelligence goes towards trying to over focus on all the ways in which everything is like just not quite going right and if only if only I didn't hurt my hand the day before I have to go play a show or if only you know what I mean there's always like something that that that the the mind is seducing you to over focus on that keeps you from that that Maxwell House moment of ecstasy or something you know yeah that Maxwell House moment man that Maxwell House moment ooh how awful that moment be if you actually did get the moment you just feel like ah you'd miss the tension you'd miss the fucking that those moments anyway doesn't that doesn't that happen to you it happens to me all the time like you spend all this effort going trying to go on a vacation or something and you get to the scenic outlook and you have an ice cream cone and you just start thinking about how many calories you're ingesting and and how you almost I can almost get sad thinking about how much I've always wanted to be sitting there at that outlook having a good time but I just don't feel the way that I thought I would feel exactly in my mind so I'm kind of just sitting here like you know there's just like this weird ghost of I don't know of like a shadow version of yourself following you around always offering you a way to look at the situation in a shitty respect you know what I mean yes and as long as you understand that that shadow is always going to be there and let them yap and do the whole thing and then you're sort of like oh there you are hi there you are again hi oh that what do you got what do you got this time and then right that's where a sense of humor definitely comes in to let you just like why are you taking yourself so fucking seriously dude oh yeah listen and it's and when you start doing that where it's like oh here he is again almost like you know like I remember once I was hanging out with some friends who I suddenly realized that anything that came into their field of vision or experience they would find something awful to say about it and then they would like kind of like go back and forth about how horrible the thing was so in my mind I started playing this game like a roulette game where I started throwing out things to me that were meaningless objects whatever it was things that were known but kind of meaningless because I knew that whatever I threw out they'd start talking shit about it and I started doing that for fun because we were hanging out for the day I just spit something out and be like let's see what they say about it and inevitably man no matter what it was it was always bad like you always find this like curdled underside of the thing whether it would be you know the fools whatever it was always somehow it was like bad everything was bad so in the same way it's like when you start doing this little hunting trip with your mind and you instead of like thinking that's you but just realizing it's a facet of you and then no matter what the experience is I mean the next time you're having sex or enjoying a good meal or whatever the thing is when that thing starts popping up just don't believe it just be like whoa that's a good one oh that was good like I was just walking my dog the other day and this this old man with a camera gave my dog a dog biscuit very sweet and as he's giving it to me that part of my mind is like it's probably poison dude you're like oh hi wow that's good yeah well let's hope not if it is I'm a fool but let's just see what happens here never works never never never does that that part of your mind successfully predict what awful thing is gonna happen you know or for example like I was talking to a friend on a recent podcast and we were talking about love and we were talking about how great it is and he goes yeah in the beginning and he's awesome man he is so cool and sweet and by the end you know we sort of like both like balanced each other's point of view out but you know again like he's giving voice to the awareness of this you know yeah but you know it's gonna be we're heading down it's gonna be bad and yeah sure of course it's gonna be bad you're right about that it is gonna be bad there will be bad things that emerge and they'll be bad things that go away and they're gonna be good things that go away and they're gonna be good things that don't go away maybe but the to get to that Maxwell house moment is actually kind of scary to people because we don't want to be animals you know and there's something feel that feels visceral and hedonistic about purely enjoying the moment you know it's scary to really just enjoy any single moment and to realize that you can and the heat and the the cold and the the boredom and the excitement you can really enjoy all of it yeah maybe like that group of your friends that has to find a way to be superior to every subject by pointing out it's weaknesses or something maybe maybe like that's some sort of inborn element of consciousness that like just experiencing things doesn't seem like enough like we like our ego requests of us to interpret things and just in the instant interpretation of things we start we get away from the experience and then get lost in like some weird attempt to form superiority over the moment in the attempt to interpret I love it I love what you're saying and I love that the impulse behind it is trying to achieve superiority in control and you're right that is what it is like you know man when I used to go to the raves I was standing in line to go into this rave and the music's coming out and man at the time I fucking love that shit I had some ecstasy I probably had just taken ecstasy or was about to take ecstasy this is when take getting ecstasy for me was like a big moment like I think I was probably a dishwasher and ecstasy cost 30 bucks and if you're a dishwasher man that's like half your day for this drug and even obtaining it was exciting and the whole thing was romantic and exciting and I was standing outside this fucking rave and I'm kind of like bouncing with excitement I'm so excited man there's no sense of embarrassment about this situation at all just this kind of like this is gonna be an awesome night and I'm bouncing around and this fucking girl who's like friends was dating one of my friends turns and looks at me and like goes you're excited huh like you know what I mean like I was being too too excited or like too openly excited and that's not how you since you're at a night club event type thing you got to kind of play it cool man don't be really don't be a fucking bouncy ball of like excitement it makes you look like a tool you know and I think that's superiority that's the thing we don't want to be that you don't want to be the giddy bouncy thing it's like this is awesome so you just you end up ultimately fighting against love right I just came straight from a art opening on Rockaway Beach with like it's like all Patty Smith's art and James Franco was gonna speak or something and and there would be like you kind of pass through the swarms of just young people who sort of just were like happy to be near the beach and out of the city but there but in in the swarms would be people positioned just making that face that's supposed to communicate that they've done this a lot and they've they've seen a lot of art you know and they're pretty important they probably drive a nice car and I just focus on those faces and I'm always just kind of mesmerized by what might be going on behind that face and the machinery of their brain to make them think that that's tricking anyone into thinking so I guess being an asshole somehow just generally does make people kind of like respect you because they step back you know if you're driving crazy you're like whoa get the fuck out of the way oh I've been enthralled by assholes like that for sure dude mesmerizing and they also make you like you sort of like if you're not what they're doing is a basic dominance trick which is like if you're a weak person and you get around somebody being hostile then you'll submit to them because they're not going to be aware of conflicts so it's just like a basic rudimentary shitty alpha trick and it will work for weak people and you will get sucked into that if you're not careful and I've watched myself being sucked into it trying to placate a fucking turd and like just like oh man saying something to cheer him up submissive baby but it's like all that they've done either subconsciously or even maybe they're sociopaths and they consciously recognize that if they act aloof the weakest people in the crowd will begin to attend to their needs but either way it's like just a trick because they like to have a little bit of power or a lot of power those people will always have an orbit around them of the weakest of souls and it's so funny because when you get around people like that and you're not submitting to them then the weaklings around them will start getting weird like prairie dogs when there's like something really start perking their ears up and like doing sideways glances that whoever has managed the vampire that's managed to suck them into their goddamn orbit of expertise waiting for his inevitable either dismissal of you usually though they'll dismiss you behind your back they won't do it in front of you but when they get around their orbit of you know they'll try to talk shit about you anyway it's a terrible thing don't get sucked into it better to be a giddy fool enjoying your fucking Justin Bieber concert than some puffed up pseudo expert because what could anyone really know I feel like maybe with the internet and kind of the push towards total variety and this global thought thing like there's less ghettos to be stuck in like thought ghettos where everybody's like you know if you're into a certain scene you have to go see the scene guru and he's the one that keeps the knowledge and you know whatever it seems like there's an attitude where people are a little bit less stuck in there in their genres these days everybody's kind of trying to get out and learn more about you know various exotic things but in the old days you really did kind of stick within your zone I mean I'm sure in prison and I'm sure in neighborhoods and I'm sure there's still scenes and stuff but at least I think we're moving forward into a sort of global communication to some degree it's wonderful it's a beautiful thing man it really is like a beautiful thing I love the corrosive effect the internet has on the ability of certain people to become scene gurus I love that I love the way that it's like eliminating the necessity of those kinds of people or those kinds of dynamics because man those people could be so goddamn inhibiting man they can really if you're not carefully get around one of those people too long you'll really lose some time you know they'll shut you down quick because that's what they do I mean goddamn God forgive all of us though I mean nobody's better than anybody else but man if you end up around a bunch of people who constantly hate everything you're in trouble man because they hate you Christ almighty I can't wait to listen to your whole album man I'm so excited that track was so beautiful I'll send it to you as soon as I can I know you have to go catch a plane I gotta catch a plane but we're gonna you tell me everything about how people listening to this can find the album and can find you well they're announcing it this week so you can go to thrilljockey.com and they're they're basically gonna be

277^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 395: Lou Al-Chamaa Transcript and Discussion^2020-08-16^We are family. A good time starts with a great wardrobe. Next stop, JCPenney. Family get-togethers to fancy occasions, wedding season two. We do it all in style. Dresses, suiting, and plenty of color to play with. Get fixed up with brands like Liz Claiborne, Worthington, Stafford, and Jay Farrar. Oh, and thereabouts for kids. Super cute and extra affordable. Check out the latest in-store, and we're never short on options at jcp.com. All dressed up everywhere to go. JCPenney. Greetings to you, sweet, sweet friends. It's me, D. Trucelle, aka Ducket Trussell. This is my podcast, the Ducket Trussell Family Hour podcast. Why is it called Family Hour? Many reporters ask me. Sometimes at the beach, I'll be with my family, relaxing in the sand, rubbing coconut oil into my beautiful wife's pregnant stomach. While my child frolics in the sand with his wooden toys, because we are a sophisticated family, and we raise our children in the Montessori style. And suddenly, sometimes, they come out of the sea. Sometimes, they come galloping down the dunes. There have been a couple of times where, much like the sandworm in Dune, they'll come exploding out of the sand, cameras flashing, screaming questions to me. Why is it called the Family Hour? And I'm not going to answer it under duress. And honestly, I'm not going to answer it now. Because to me, to bend to the paparazzi is one of the last things you do in our beautiful city of angels before you find yourself consumed and devoured by the ever-present darkness of this place. Yeah, sure, I could say something too. I'm like, well, I call it the Family Hour, because the idea is that we're all one human family, not just a human family. We're a galactic, space-faring civilization. We just don't know it yet. And we're not just a space-faring civilization, you paparazzi fucks. But we're a time-faring civilization. We're traveling through time right now. Don't you get it? Don't you understand? We're all just particulates in a cosmic time machine. We've made the decision to move in the direction of the future, that in fact, we're also moving in the direction of the past, because we are the attention of the transcendent, falling upon our individual identities. Don't you understand? I call it the Family Hour, because we are not just a galactic family. We are not just a universal family, but we are a transcendent family. Have you not heard the Hare Krishna's say, asinkasinkabeta tatva, simultaneous oneness and difference? I call it the Dugga Trussell Family Hour, because we are a family internally. There's a subjective family. Some of the mitochondrial DNA inside of me, I consider to be my uncle. Some of my gut biome. I send Christmas cards to my gut biome, and they send me cards. They're beautiful little E. Coli children. Yeah, I got E. Coli, but I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to bend. For now, I'll let you imagine for yourself what I call the Family Hour. Yeah, sure, I could say, well, I call it the Family Hour, because it's a moment in time. We don't know what's to come. We don't know what happened. We float like a tiny little portal, like a tiny little scope peering in to a dimension that is largely shaped by our projections. That's why I call it the Hour, but I'm not going to do that right now. I'm just going to ask the paparazzi to stay away from me and my family when we're at the beach. Have I gained weight during the pandemic? Yes, I'm not going to be shamed anymore by your beauty standards, paparazzi. Am I the Duncan Trussell that appeared on the 1999 edition of GQ? No, am I the Duncan Trussell that appeared on the 2004 edition of GQ? No, am I the Duncan Trussell that appeared in every GQ every year, right around spring? No, and am I ashamed of that? No, and sure, it would be easy for me to say I have begun to recognize that my human form is temporary and transient, and I'm not using that recognition as an excuse to neglect taking care of my human form, which is as much a part of me as the transcendent identity. But sometimes, I'm going to give myself a little leeway when it comes to self-shaming, because I've learned to embrace my temporary human identity in a field of love. I could say that, but I'm not going to fucking say that I'm not going to let some paparazzi listen into this. Disgusting, sleazy rocks off. I'm not going to let some paparazzi listening to this pull his pants down and start slowly massaging his throbbing, grisly member until at last he explodes all over the shitty paparazzi TV dinner he's eating. And I'm not going to give him the enjoyment of continuing to eat his own seed with the Salisbury steak that he didn't heat up appropriately in the microwave. I'm not going to let him do that to this podcast anymore. It's time for you to unshackle yourself from the dark chains of terrestrial localization. They're being smashed on top of you by many of the most powerful corporations on planet Earth. And the way to do that is with Express VPN. Oh yeah, sure, your meat body is in the United States. And because of that, every bit of technology you use is reporting your particular GPS coordinates to the man. But by subscribing to Express VPN, you untangle yourself from that unnecessary imposition of spatialization that has been smashed into your life that you carry around your neck like some horrible weight that was chained to the neck of someone in a dungeon. Unchain yourself, unshackle yourself. YouTube doesn't care where you're at. It doesn't care. And neither should you. Go global friends with Express VPN. You could tell Express VPN to tell YouTube that you're in New Zealand, for example, and you are going to have access to movies and content that you can't get within the filter bubble of your particular spatialized reality. You're more than a meaty little sentient thing living on some particular swath of territory. You're more than your GPS coordinates. And subscribing to Express VPN is telling the universe, I've gone global. I don't just live in the United States. I don't just live in the San Fernando Valley. I'm not chained to my house in Montana. No, no, no. I'm everywhere. And if I want to watch YouTube the way that people in Europe experience YouTube, then that's exactly what I'm going to do.

Dear Duncan, I just wanted to let you know how much I love the Duncan Trussell family on our podcast, how much over the years this podcast has meant to me and has transformed me into what I like to think of as a far better person. I've become incredibly happy. I'm in shape. My hair changed color. My eyes are a more vivid blue. And I think I owe all of this to the Duncan Trussell family on our podcast, but I just want to say you're a fucking sell out piece of shit because of all your stupid fucking commercials. How dare you make me listen to your fucking commercials before this podcast that has meant so much to me and has really amplified my ability to experience love in the universe. If nothing else is just giving me something fun to listen to, I just don't understand how you could be such a fucking steaming pile of garbage that you would put commercials in my favorite podcast. One day I hope you fucking wake up with bees that have climbed into your ass and waited to sting you until they'd somehow made a thriving ass hive. And then they all sting inside of your ass at once and fly out. And I hope they swarm around your wife's head and they all smell like your ass. And then they sting your wife's head and fly away because of all the commercials you do. But I do want you to know how much you mean to me and I'm so happy that there's a Duncan Trussell family, our podcast for me and my family to enjoy. Sincerely, Prince Garlon Twat. Well, Prince Twat, first of all, thank you. I'm glad you enjoy the podcast, but I just want to say that if you don't want to listen to the commercials, you could easily go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and subscribe. You're gonna get commercial free episodes of the DTFH. It just dives right in to the interview. And if you want to do the video tiers every Monday, every Tuesday, we have a meditation every Wednesday. We've got a wonderful book club. We're reading Dune right now. And on Fridays, we have a family gathering that you would probably enjoy. So you really don't have to listen to the commercials. You could just subscribe to patreon.com forward slash DTFH and you will be liberated from the commercials that help me support my family. And I really don't think it's cool that you are threatening me with poop bees in my family. It seems weird that you're this simultaneously like me and are angry at me. So it really makes me question whether or not the podcast has done anything to make you into a happier, great person. And also I would just like to finish up by saying that I hope that scorpions, like thousands of tiny scorpions figure out a way to burrow into your nipples. And I hope that they burrow down, not into your heart. I don't want you to die, but I hope they burrow into the, just around the circumference of the nipple. And I hope that they burrow a very intricate system of tunnels where they lay their eggs. And I hope that right as you're falling in love with someone, as you're eating dinner with them and beginning to realize that you're falling in love with them. And right at the moment where they would also realize that they're falling in love with you and that this would lead to you having a really wonderful marriage and recognizing the beauty of family and how incredibly powerful and simultaneously fulfilling and challenging a family could be. I hope those scorpions explode. I hope every single one of them explodes because of some kind of cosmic flare that they're somehow connected to an interstellar cosmic and right at dinner, right as you're about to profess how much you love this person who was gonna lead you into an incarnation where you're no longer such a selfish prince, I just hope they explode. And just like loudly pop and that scorpions and blood and bits of your nipple fly over the table and land in your future loves food that they get in their soup or their mashed potatoes. And then they swarm up into their mouth and they sting them all about the lips and make their lips swell up. And because of this, the whole possibility of your happy life seems to be temporarily like it's not gonna happen. And I hope that you recognize it's because I cursed you. But then I hope that these scorpions reverse time and go backwards, back into your nipples where they sort of lay dormant for the rest of your life. And you do get to have a happy family but you know that if you ever send me a shitty email like that, next time I'm not gonna fucking reverse time on your nipple scorpions. I'm gonna let them blow up your fucking nipples and swarm your family. So don't send shitty emails like that anymore. And again, that's patreon.com forward slash DTFH. I hope you will subscribe. Also friends, we got a beautiful shop located at dunkintrustle.com with wonderful t-shirts and garments in Orgalea that you can just lay upon your sweet body. You don't have to even wear the shirts. You can wrap those shirts around your undergunt and rub yourself with them and soften and moisten your puffed out cuts. Let's get this podcast going. I ran into today's guests in the most beautiful way. Noah Cyrus and today's guest, Lou Al-Shamar reached out to me because they like Midnight Gospel and I was invited onto their amazing podcast in my feels. And during this conversation I got to have with Noah Cyrus who is amazing. You gotta listen to her music, it's so good. I was nervous, I'm not immune to the power of celebrity and especially when celebrity and talent intersect. And also during this conversation, I got to hear some of today's guests' amazing philosophy and realize, oh fuck, this is like a high level manifester. This is somebody who is really smart and is using, you know, it depends on what you wanna call it. You wanna go Harry Potter, you can call it magic. You wanna go Tony Robbins, you could say he's an entrepreneur. There's really no difference. But regardless sometimes when you get to get a download from people like this, it really kinda like, it's like getting a chiropractic adjustment for your energy form. And I hope that today's conversation does the same for you that my recent bout with overdosing on magnesium did for my bowels, except instead of causing you to have explosive bowel movements for about a day, it clears whatever blockages might be getting in the way of your ability to grow the kind of garden, a phenomena that you want to have flourishing around you. Everybody please welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family, our podcast, Lou Al-Shamma. The Yeah It's the Dunkin' Trussell family. Lou, welcome to the Dunkin' Trussell family on our podcast? How are you today? I am honored and awesome. I'm feeling unbelievably good. A little nervous. I'm not going to lie. Hey, that's an honor. I'm honored by your nervousness. You know, I'm a little nervous too. You know, you all approached me for your awesome podcast and your feels. And, you know, it was such a great conversation that we had. And then in the midst of it, I realized, oh, cool. I don't know if you would call yourself this, but I like many of the people I have on my podcast, they practice magic. Yes. Would you consider yourself like, is it too easy to say that you practice magic? No, I don't know. It's difficult to say. I mean, I feel like I'm always practicing, but I'm always just myself. So this is always me all the time. So I guess, I don't know. I don't think I would separate it as a practice. I think it's more as just a way of living. Gotcha. Okay, cool. You know, it's all semantics, really, but before we dive into the philosophy part, though, let's just do the grounding stuff. Speaking of nervousness, you know, I start researching you. Yes. And whoa, you're the guy. You're the man. You're the guy. Like, you're the guy who, like in the dream of singers. Yes. So I mean, I do many things as my manifestations because I'm from a background. I mean, you know, my mom was a single parent up until I was 12, you know, we were raised on welfare. There was five. My mom was, there was five of us. So I'd always had a street hustler mentality. So you never really did one thing. You always did many things. Because if you had some revenue stream broke down, you had 20 others that were picking up the pieces. And I've kind of adopted that moving to LA as you do. And, you know, so, you know, I started off in music. I actually started off, I was an electrician, qualified electrician. Yes. So when you, you know, when you start off, you know, your mom's like, go make some money. You're like, okay, cool. Let me go study to be an electrician. And this shit is actually fucking hard. Oh, yeah. Like I had to do maths. Like I dropped out of school when I was 16. I didn't do it. I hated that shit. But I had to retake them to do the electrical. And I passed that shit. And I was like, this is actually pretty good. Where did you study to be an electrician? It's, it was in Islington College, which is like North London. Of all the jobs, there's a few that terrify the shit out of me. Pilot, scuba instructor, and electrician. You know, there's other ones too. Cause you can really, that's one where you can die. There's a lot that you could die. I guess construction worker, but let, something about just that possibility. You know, I hung a light the other day. And I remember like just treating it. I felt like I was working in a nuclear reactor. Just a sense of like at any second, you could just go into your next incarnation. Zap, you're gone. Yes. Yes. So that's why I quit because I got electrocuted on, I switched off some power. And I didn't realize it was an emergency power light switch. And I was on a ladder and I got, I was held on, fucking held on for dear life. My brother was there too. So basically you're supposed to kick someone off the ladder if you see them, but he thought I was joking. So it felt like an eternity of time, but it was probably about three seconds. Oh. What did it feel like? It felt like, I've never felt every cell in my body vibrate. But at the same time, like you're actually gonna die. It was, and it was, it was emergency power too. So it's way stronger than the normal voltage. How long do you get, how long before you would, have a heart attack? Or what is it that kills you from being electrocuted? I don't even know, to be honest. I just, I know to wear the rubber boots and then try and let go. I know the safety procedures, like don't touch anyone, like basically poke them with a stick or those type of things. But yeah, I let go and I just went, I basically swore at my brother and was like, fuck you and I'm out. And I pretty much quit that day. Great decision. Yes. And then I started to kind of, you know, I'd always send demos round or of people I was managing at the time. And I was hustling and I managed to get an internship at a record label, which was RCA and I worked there for free for about 12 months. And I was like, I had to give up my side hustles, but I was still doing the part-time electrical stuff. Yeah. It was three days there and four days at the label. And then from that, I kind of transitioned full time into the A&R point, which would be the point between the artist and the label. So A&R. Right. I'd sign artists and pair them with great producers and songwriters and then, you know, strategize when to release them and just basically try and have hits. Listen, this is fascinating because like, you know, you said, I want to jump back for a second before you made your first big move. So you, how did you, who was your first artist that you worked with? I mean, there was tons, so many. There was an artist called Chipmunk, which was, it sounds funny than it is, but he's actually a rap artist. He's actually a pretty dope rapper. And I was managing, I was doing the label and managing, so I had this songwriter show up and hand me a CD. This kind of young black kid, he was incredible. And he was 17 and he handed me a CD where he was country rock, pop, R&B, all on one CD. And there was one song that we did that we actually ended up playing to the artist Chipmunk. And I remember I pitched it to another artist who turned it down and it ended up coming out and going straight to number one. Whoa. Yeah. So it went to number one and I was like, holy shit, I can do this. How old were you at the time? Oh, shit. I mean, 21. Damn. That's insane. I mean, that's crazy. And when I was 21, I was like, I was, I was like in an ambient haze. I wasn't literally, but you know, I didn't know it. I just certainly didn't have to wear with all that I would A, have the guts to like even represent anybody. And were you going to shows all the time? You're an electrician, you're going to shows. I'm just saying, what's the point? We're like, I'm going to start rapping people just because I mean, at the time I was dating a singer and so I was always kind of involved in the music side of it. I just knew that I had to make money. So my side hustles made me money so I could focus on doing what I wanted to do. But yeah, but that that number one came came pretty easy. But I mean, still 21. I look back now, I was like, I didn't know what the fuck I was doing. I don't think I mean, no one knows what they're doing, not even now. Oh, and it was just I just kept learning and I learned very early on in music. It's usually first name, dot second name at company dot com. Right. And then I was like, fuck, I can reach the whole planet. Right. So I would call email like random fucking top executives and they would email me back because I was sending good shit. Shit. This is I mean, it's crazy. Also, you were like, it seems like we don't have to get into that part of it because it's all over the internet. It seems like you got pulled into this updraft, man. You were like, you know, touring around with a very, very famous person. And like, you seem like at that age, you just it seems like a lot. It was a lot happened at once. It seemed it was a world. And I mean, I can't dive too much into that legally. Reason to. That's not what this podcast is like. Absolutely. But, but, you know, I could I can trace back my thoughts and feelings and emotions as being a twenty one year old was I was conflicted as fuck. Like I was it was a whirlwind and that's exactly what my life was then. But, you know, I loved it. I love the journey. I love the learning. I'm always consistently learning. That's one thing I've always been aware of. I mean, you learning in the sense of like you're just all you always have something you're working on to try to teach yourself. You're I just approached it honestly. Like I'd be in the studio with fucking like when I was twenty two and with Justin Timberlake and fucking all these people. And I'd be like, holy shit. And I wouldn't be like, you know, you're Justin, can you put me up? It would be like, yo, how are you? Right. And they'd invite me to their birthdays and then we start hanging out. And I was like, I was just just a guy in the studio who was happy to be there. Right. Not trying to get anything from anyone. And I ended up making all these friends who ended up becoming some of the biggest songwriters and producers in the world who are still are consistently. Right. And we kind of all came up together. But I mean, like I used to sleep on couches. I said all that whole struggle is is beyond and more. And I love that struggle. Like I worship it. I love it so much. Me too. You made the decision in your mind. I made the decision in my mind. I'm just not going to do the normal thing. Yeah, I don't care what I, you know, some people I think just I think they it sounds fatalistic, but they decide, look, if I if this I'll just die. If this doesn't work, I don't the there isn't this is just what I'm going to do. And then if it works out, great, great. But if it doesn't, well, at least I died trying trying to, you know, get beyond like the normal kind of possibilities that are presented to you when you're a kid in high school, you know, when they do the exam, or I don't know if you took that test to see what you'd be proficient at. You know, that thing, the job test. And it's like, oh, you you'd be a good manager and a company, not like a manager. But, you know, you'd be like a good like manager at Walmart or something like that. You're like, I'm not doing that. We don't have those tests. We don't there is no it's funny because I mean, I didn't I didn't take my. So when you I guess when you're a 10, you take an exam, which pre predetermines what which classes you're going to be in the upper school, which is from 11 to 16. And I didn't take those exams. So I was always put in the lower classes for so for out my whole secondary school, I was always in lower classes. And then when when you finally went for your exams, they were like the highest you can get as a C, even if you get 100 percent right. See, I'm like, what the fuck am I doing here? Right. Oh, and everyone celebrated getting the results. I was like, fuck this, I'm trying to make some money. Yeah. What are you making money? Music at the time? Did you do you? Yeah. So when when I was in school, I had I was I used to work in a printing firm, so I used to print magazines. And you know, there was this whole, I don't know if you remember, but there was this massive story of, you know, celebrities aren't how they look. They're retouched and all that. The story came out. We were part of that, but we were the company that would retouch the images if there was a ring call, if there was a sagging fucking ass, if there was, you know, a boob that wasn't pushed up. We would do all of that shit. And and I loved it. I could I could take a part of printing machine and put it back together. No training. This is just shit I had to learn because the company was so cheap. We had to repair the machines ourselves. And I loved it. And I was making, I don't know, 200 bucks a weekend at like 14. I was working from the age of 12. So I was making about 40 bucks a weekend from 12. Wow. And now in school, I was bawling like it was like lunch on me, whatever you guys want, we're good, but I still got free dinners, you know, because we were, you know, I wouldn't say we were poor, but we were, I mean, we were pretty poor. Yeah. So you get free dinners. And I used to walk in there, head held high, give me my free dinner ticket. I'll get my meal and my juice, carton. I used to love that shit. So even back then, you had this attitude, like even back then, you were you were you had figured out a way to do this kind of alchemy that converts whatever the experience may be, even if it's a kind of experience that will be mortifying for some people into something that isn't bad at all. No, I think, I think because we had no choice. We had to, you know, you know, I had younger brothers. I had older brothers. I we we took care of each other. We had all brothers. All brothers. Yeah. Wow. Say, same dad. No. So, I mean, none of our dads stuck around. So my, I guess my biological dad, there's three of us. Then there's one with someone else who didn't stick around. And then there's another one who, yeah. So three, three, I guess, three different dads. And then my stepdad had a son, too. So there's I think there's now six of us. I don't mean to get all deep in psychological. I love it. This is what we're like. How do you think that, you know, my mom was married three times, divorced twice. And sometimes I wonder, like, man, how did how does that affect a kid? You know, you know, how do you think that affected you being in a big family going through that it's not just like our parents like just casually get divorced or casually meet new people. I mean, it's like that's a lot of drama, man. How do you think that affected you? You know, it was funny, though. I mean, we it was just us, though. So it sounds like a big family, but there was no extended grandparents. There was no my mom was raising an orphanage. So there wasn't any extension. It was just us. So we had just us. And we didn't really, I mean, there'd be boys would be boys. But the rule would be not you're not allowed to hit in the face if you had a fight. Body shots are OK. The face is who made that rule. Your mom. No, we did. OK. That was just agreed upon. You can hit each other in the body. You're not going to have no face punches. Yeah. But we I don't know. I mean, looking back now, I mean, I don't know. I can look at it back now with happiness. But now having a door, I think it affects me more having a daughter now, because if I seen some like some shit. So but when you're in it, you don't know that it's shit. You know, I used to live by a place called murder miles, which which was literally people, teenagers would get stabbed or killed just coming out of your house. There was a whole road where countless murders would happen. So there was a weird energy around that place, but it was home. So you wouldn't separate yourself from it. You were it. Right. You know, you'd leave school and there'd be people waiting outside trying to rob you. So it was you'd have to figure out different ways to go to school, because you know that certain times those people would be hanging around that time. But it wasn't it wasn't like it was a scare thing. It wasn't an attract. I don't know. It was a weird thing. Now I know the attraction to it. But I mean, before we get deep into the whole consciousness thing, I always knew I wanted more. So I'd walk past, you know, nice cars and be like, you know, I want that. I'm going to have that or I'd walk past nice houses. I'd be like one day I'm going to have one of those or whatever. It's not I'm not a materialistic guy now, because I don't give a fuck about that. I think that's why I tracked it so well. Oh, but I always believed there was so much more. And I wasn't I wasn't prepared to just lay down and die because there was no there was no option for that. Did I was it like did you have a sense inside of you? In other words, it wasn't just like you had desire. Was it like did you have a sense like you already kind of knew that you were going to figure out a way to achieve that level of success, even though you might not have understood the path you were going to take to get there? Or were you just like, I want that and I'll figure it out. I don't know if that's a great crime. Just saying like seems like some people they just sort of know. Just kind of already know it's going to happen. It's strange because now I can look back and say that I knew. I wasn't aware of the knowing, but I knew I'd look up at the stars and I'd be like, what the fuck is out there or the moon on a full moon? And be like, is there someone fucking up there? Is there life on other planets? Is there any of that type of stuff? And I would always believe that there was. And I think that's what kind of kept edging me towards the spiritual tip of, you know, I know about responsibility. You know, I had to raise my younger brothers, you know, bath them, change them, feed them all. And I loved it. And I loved it. And being the middle child, that kind of that taught me so much responsibility. So I always felt I was ahead of the curve because of that. What did your mom do? My mom, my mom was a cleaner. Gotcha. She would take us to all her cleaning jobs, which we loved because she'd be in these nice apartments and we'd be running around the house, be like, fuck. And we were kids and we'd be like, look at this, look at this TV. Look at, you know, all that type of shit. We used to we used to have a rental TV. So, you know, when you get a TV and you put like a money in the TV. So that yeah, so you can rent a TV basically. What? Yeah. So you didn't if you didn't have the money to pay up front, you could rent the TV. So you'd put the coins in and they come and collect the coins, which would be the money for the TV. Your TV was like a slot machine or something. We had a we had a pay phone, too. Because I mean, we'd always be calling girls and shit. My mom was like, fuck this. The bill is too high. So we'd have to go and change up money and put coins in and in your house. Yes. Yes. Holy shit. I've never heard of that. That is how long do you get for like a quarter on a TV? Not very long, especially calling a cell phone from it from a landline. The TV, what's a quarter get you? I don't even know. I can't even remember. Wow. Look, I'm getting to in the details here. I'm just you just blew my mind. That's like a that is a Mandela effect thing. Like that's it. You come from an alternate dimension, friend. I don't even know if those exist in this timeline, but that is wild. So the TV was free. It's like, here, we're going to bring this to your house. But you're going to. And then some guy would come over once a week or once a month and like the money. Yeah. And that would be you paying rental for the TV. And when you finish, they take the TV back. That is the trippiest thing ever. OK, so you suddenly have just trampolined out of a childhood where, you know, if people are placing bets on what you're what what an average future is going to be, just based on statistics and stuff, I don't know that people are going to be putting money on you. And especially if it's like, you know, this guy is going to become the guy. You know, like that that is to me, it's just it's a beautiful story. So suddenly you find yourself swept in to this wild world and you're young. And I don't mean to be negative here, but how did you keep from killing yourself? I mean, it was it was tough. I didn't, you know, the the press are constantly hounding you. I was not that guy. I've never been that guy. I've always liked press. You know, I hate them. Yeah. Yeah. I they the twisting the, you know, the the freedom of speech is so twisted now that nothing is ever freedom of speech. It's kind of the freedom of misinterpretation. Right. So I'd always learned to be honest, I never trusted anyone anyway. I mean, being from where I'm from, you don't trust no one. And that kind of helped me. And now I trust everyone because I have no reason not to press myself. So yeah, it was it was a whirlwind. It was a great journey. It was a character building for sure. But to be honest with you, I mean, when I worked at that printing firm as a T-boy, per se, you know, you'd make teas for people, you go and get food for people. I was bullied like fuck. Like I was bullied so much and I used to be so quiet. And then one day I turned around and I looked at the guy. I mean, I'm swearing so much, but that's kind of my character. And I turned around to the guy bullying me and I said, fuck you, leave me alone. Yeah. And he stopped. And I was like, holy shit, I have a voice. Right. And I must have been 15, 14, 15. And I was like, wow, and since then I've always used my voice. I speak my truth and I'm like, say exactly what I want and how I want it. Um, within reason, obviously. And that was kind of the turning point, which led me. But I realized like business is all the same, man. It's just I call it myself now the honest hustle. And I was always an honest businessman. And the same principles, you know, you buy phones on the street, you sell them, you buy them half the price, you sell them for more to whoever. Right. You buy, you know, fake watches, you sell them for more. You buy, you know, I used to sell trainers from from China just to pay the rent. So, you know, I'd figure out where the fuck factories were that made Nikes. And they'd always make overages. So like, say Nike would put an order in for a million shoes and they do like one point two, because, you know, some of the pairs would be a little messed up or an air bubble would be would be popped. And I got in contact with those people who knew those people. So I used to order shoes for like dirt cheap and sent to my house. And then I'd sell them for like just under asking price. And that shit paid for my rent for years. Wow. This is so cool, man. This thing, why is it? I mean, I remember on the school bus, there was always that kid who brought the candy in the box and would sell the candy and that kid was loaded. And I would always just think like, and also you couldn't. There was everyone wanted to do it, but since he was the candy kid on the bus and he'd sort of asserted himself as that, it wasn't like he would get you. If you brought your own candy and kids would try. Yeah, bring their shitty boxes, but he had the best candy, the most variety, you know, and he would get, I would just look and think, why am I not doing that? How it can't be that easy. But what do you think that is? That some people figure that out and some people don't. Some people figure out this, this world that we're living in right now, for better, for worse, it's designed. The whole system is designed so that you can do exactly that thing you're talking about, which is find a thing and sell it for a little bit more and make a profit. Why do some people end up just not ever doing that? Always getting, you know, there's just some people in my family. You know, my my folks were kind of where they weren't entrepreneurs. What do you why do you think some people don't believe that that's even possible for them or what what makes some people take the leap into that level of experimentation when it comes to commerce and business? A tremendous thank you to the buzzing geniuses that dwell in the techno hive that is square space. You want to talk about a silver lining related to this pandemic? I guess there is one. So we're all beginning to realize that we do not have to necessarily get our meat bodies together if we want to have successful businesses. We don't have to be centralized, localized. We don't have to be tethered anymore to our particular office buildings. Whatever our central locus of work was, some of us do. But some of us are akin to fishermen who drift upon technological sea and we no longer have to go to a specific pier or island place to fish. In fact, we can make the entire planet our favorite fishing spot. And the way to do that is to build a website. So first step in the old days, if you wanted to build a website, you would have to generally hop on a railroad car, which would take you to the website district of your particular town. You'd end up getting taken in more than likely by a pseudo web designer who would charge you so much money to make a website at the end of it. You would inevitably find yourself out of a house, out of a job. You'd probably be in a divorce because you basically threw everything you had into a charlatans web design scheme. And there's lots of people right now who are clinically insane because of the trauma they experience for being flabbergasted by a pseudo web designer back in the 90s. There's many people who clawed their own eyes out in frustration. But thank God that we don't have to do that anymore. Thanks to the insanely advanced web design technology that you're going to find over at Squarespace.com. You want to build a website in a matter of minutes. You can do it at Squarespace.com.

I think it's, you know, thoughts, thoughts become things. And I didn't know that at the time, but my predominant thought was making money. So the idea of making money would come to me or I'd find it. I'd go search for days and days and days. I used to sit like even when before I got a label job, I'd sit in my pajamas on my computer emailing morning, noon and night, thousands of emails. And I'd get rejected from every single one, but there'd be one that would go through. My predominant thought was always not on success, but it was on money. I didn't give a fuck about success. I didn't care if anyone knew who I was or any of that type of shit. I just pay me. Wow. That is I mean, I still have that mentality now because I know that money is freedom, especially in today's society. I mean, you can you can live as a Buddhist and not want to own anything and do any of that type of stuff, which is great. But where I am now is like freedom for me is raising my daughter full time and and and doing things like this that I love and can enjoy loving and not having to do something to pay the bills and which I would do anyway. But I'm now me about that. So this is what I would love to hear. And I think you're the man to clear it up. So many people think that you cannot consider yourself a spiritual person. And have as one of your motivations, making money. People think you need if you're a spiritual person and you've got that mindset, something's something's off. You're supposed to not ever think about that. And I've always found that to be a really like ridiculous expectation that spirituality can't intertwine with working in the marketplace. But can you talk about that a little bit? Yes. Are you aware of Osho? Yeah, absolutely. Fuck, yes. So he's the perfect example of having being spiritually rich and attracting riches. My dude just literally put his hands to his thing. Would just be like, hey, everybody and these these white people would throw him money, Rolls Royces, helicopters, cars. And he's like, shit, they keep giving. I'm not asking for it. I'm just open to it. Many people look down on him for that. I mean, that's the fur. I remember the whole Osho limo thing, the documentary that came out about him. And that's, you know, that's one of the signs. It's like, hey, your guru's got a fleet of limousines. You better watch out. But see, that's all they had on him. You know, if it wasn't that, it would have been something else. If it wasn't, you know, it was like, I watched that documentary from such a standpoint of a third person. So like that that that documentary frustrated me. And everyone's like, well, they were crazy. They poisoned this people. They did this, they did that. And I was like, yeah, but you're missing the point. The point is U.S. Society just tried to destroy them because they didn't understand what the fuck they were doing. They were there openly. And again, it was a sex cult. No, people were open to have sex. That's fine. That's not illegal. That's just great. People want to do that, do it. Free choice is free will. This is why the universe gives us is free will. So, and you know, again, I think this whole notion of it's the guilt factor of being successful while being spiritual. But again, we have to go back to children. Children don't feel guilt. There's no, there is no guilt. There is, it doesn't exist to them. There is selfishness that exists. Oh no, that's mine. That's a natural instinct. So we can be selfish and not feel guilty about it. So, and I think again, back to that documentary is, you know, he built something so special. And I wish he was alive now during that time because I'd be fucking there too. In a spiritual sense, but he, you know, I think we can also, it's the Buddhism teaching as well. You know, you have to shun all outside wealth to be spiritually enlightened. But you know, Buddha was a rich man. He was born rich. He was raised in a palace. His dad kept him away from, you know, pain and hurt and heartbreak and all these things. And, you know, he wanted more because inside he was empty, but he had physical things. Anything he ever wanted, escape the palace, saw homelessness or death, saw, and it crushed his soul. That's when the change came, meditated under, I'm just in the short version, meditated under a Bodhi tree, became enlightened, shun outside wealth to become spiritually rich enlightened. So everyone now does that practice, but you don't have to, if you're spiritually rich, you automatically attract riches on the outside. And I'm not talking about specifics like Rolls Royce's or Watchers or cars. I'm talking everything that comes with spiritually rich. Yeah, look, I am in agreeance with you. I've always, you know, because I work with the Love Server Member Foundation, Ram Das' Foundation. And, you know, like that's one of the complaints sometimes people will mutter, like these are retreats, they cost money, or where does the money, these people. But it's like, these are people. We live in the marketplace. We live in a, no one's photosynthetic. And I don't think there should be any shame in having the desire for freedom and the kind of freedom that you can achieve right now. A big part of that does come from getting paid. And also, I think it's okay to not even, if you want to not even think about it as freedom, because it's just, yeah, maybe you want something. Maybe you want a really nice house, or maybe you want a Rolex. I don't know what you want. But whatever the thing is you want, you want it. And then the store, you know, in Buddhism there's this term of like add-ons, which is, so, you know, you look at yourself in the mirror and you see a wrinkle. And instead of just thinking there's a wrinkle, you think, fuck, I'm getting old. I wonder how long before I start forgetting stuff. And then, holy shit, man, maybe I should get on testosterone boosters or something. Am I okay? You know, I shouldn't have done so many drugs and you know the next thing you know, you're in this spiral instead of being like, oh, that's a wrinkle. Similarly, you might just want something, whatever it is, something that if you tell your sanctimony is fucking spiritual friend, they'll be like, no, no, no, that's just of the material world. And it's so, but it's like, well, so are you. And so is the desire. So is the thing that popped into your head. And so I'm down, I'm 100% down with what you're saying. And I think it's really sad that some people squelch that part of themselves. Yeah. And that, you know, thoughts, feelings become things and that becomes the attraction to it. You know, I don't feel guilty for anything that I buy or anything that I, you know, to be honest with you, I don't spend any money on myself. I find it very difficult to spend money. Anything else like house, yeah, solar panels, gated property, like my daughter, my wife, take it all. I can't tell you the last time I bought a pair of shoes or some clothes or anything. I own one nice watch, one nice bag. And that's it, literally, because I was taught, going into a meeting, you need a nice watch and a nice bag. So those were the two things that I have. And they're not even that expensive in the grand scheme of things. But anyway. I love it. I'm the same way, man, that's a dad. When you, that's the cool thing is because it's like, my God, you know, before I had, before I got married and had a kid, well, okay, I'm not gonna lie, I've bought some synthesizers since, but it's like, you know what I mean? I would, you get caught up in buying shit for yourself. And then that's the joy of having a family. It's just that thing where you're like, oh yeah, I'm gonna get you a house. I'm gonna get the kid, one of those remote controlled cars he can drive around. Because you know, you go from being a me to a we. No, it is, you're not just an individual anymore. You are this collective of like youth and your wife and whoever else is in your household. And there's a real delight in that, in letting, and I think there is a form of weird renunciation in that too, because really what do we want? You know what? This shirt I'm wearing right now, this is my first new shirt in a long time. I've been wearing a pair of $12.95 on Amazon. Seven dollars. Beautiful. Which, I always ask the dad, is which car, remote control car are you gonna get her? Him, sorry. Well, we already got it. It's a monster truck. There we go. It's just cause it's hilarious to watch your toddler drive around in a tiny monster truck. It's the funniest thing ever, cause they just, the way they just accept it. They don't know, just like what you're saying. You know, I also, I was not born into wealth. I wasn't, you know, I had the thing, you know, this how you know you're poor when you're a kid. When you ask your parents, I was like, mom, are we rich? And my mom's like, we're rich in spirit. I'm like, we're fucking broke. Dad, sorry. You know what's funny? You know when I realized we were poor? I was on the bus with me and my brothers and my mom. Woman sitting next to us, and I heard her talk to our friend and she goes, these kids smell. And at that point, I was like, okay. And I didn't tell my mom, cause my mom would have bitch slapped her. Like, that's the type of, my mom was very strong, very strong. And it kind of affected me. I'm not gonna lie. For a very long time, I was sitting there going, wow, we, you know, I mean, we want, my mom, don't get me wrong, we wanted for nothing. Like, there was food there. We had everything we needed. Like, we got it. And I remember on every opposite birthday, you'd get vouchers from the government to buy shoes. And I was like, yes. And because everyone around you, your friends were poor, everyone, it was like, it was like, there was no separation from it. It wasn't like, oh, you know, over there is there and we're here, no, no, no, we're all in the same boat. Oh, but I was like, damn. And I thought about that the other day actually, and I was like, wow. But I love it. I love the fucking, like, I feel it. Like, I love where I came from. And that's some part of, like, obviously, you know, I don't want my daughter to experience 1% of that. But then, like, I still want, I don't know. I struggle with like, her knowing where I came from without her knowing where I came from. Right. Do you know what I'm saying? I do. It's such a difficult line. Cause like, you know, for example, the car I'm gonna get here is gonna be a G-wagon. Why? Because I've always wanted a fucking G-wagon. And I could afford one now, but I don't want one. I have solar panels now, I'm gonna get electric car. Like, that's just beyond me. But you know, like for her, I'm living through her. You know, I'm gonna get her a train set. It's not for her, really. I love that you're getting it. It's for me. Let's me sit. You know. I love it. I'll get it out, man. I'll be on Amazon. And I'll be looking at, like, magnet tiles. These, you know what I'm talking about? These things are cool as fuck. I'm looking at them and I'm like, you know, he probably needs more magnet tiles. And it's like, come on, you're buying the magnet tiles for you. He, you know, we buy him these awesome, right now we've got this awesome wooden, wooden like car track thing. And you, he doesn't put cars on it. You know what he does? He likes to push it around the floor. He doesn't know what it is, but I love that you see it like that. It's a beautiful form of sharing. Yes. Look, this is, so this is, let's dive into the philosophy now. Can I, can I read you a quote? Can we start with a quote? Yes. From Osho actually, one of my favorite books, the book of understanding, which fucking has blown my mind, probably the best book I've ever read in my life. I have not read it, but that'll be next on my list. Trust, like you will shit your pants when you read this book. Beautiful. Same. It says, I do not believe in believing. My approach is to know. And knowing is a totally different dimension. It starts from doubt. It does not start from believing. The moment you believe in something, you have stopped inquiring. Belief is one of the most poisonous things to destroy human intelligence. All the religions are based on belief. Only science is based on doubt. And I would like the religious inquiry also to be scientific. Based on doubt, so that we need not believe, we can come to know someday the truth of our being and the truth of the whole universe. Wow. And that's the opening page of the book. Holy shit. Yes. Wow. What I love about that is he allows doubt into the equation. Cause that to me is really a, you know, a lot of times people think if they're doubting something's wrong, especially when it comes to manifestation. You know, there's this idea that if you find yourself in a doubtful mindset, then that actually could potentially push away some of the things you want. So how do you move from doubt to knowing? What is that process for you? Questions. Questioning the doubt until it becomes a knowing. Okay. So let's bring it into like, so what's an exit? What's the last thing you doubted that you started questioning? I don't know. I mean, like I was living in a two bedroom apartment probably a month before my daughter was born. And I was like, fuck this. I need to get out. I need a house. I need some space. I didn't doubt. Wow. I probably did. I started looking at a bunch of places. We put a bunch of offers in. We didn't get it. And then we looked out where we are now and we put an offering and we got it. But getting the mortgage process was a fucking pain. Holy shit. I had to go through two full mortgage processes. I didn't, I don't know if I doubted. I stressed a lot about getting the house. So again, on the manifestation tip, you can stress and it doesn't mean it's not coming to you. But my, I don't know. I probably doubted probably 5% but my stress for getting it outweighed the actual doubt. I don't know. I don't really doubt things anymore. I don't. You mean you were doubting whether you could get that loan? Yes. I was just because of the paperwork and everything else that had to come with it. I had to take a higher rate. Like I had to do all that type of stuff just to jump through the hoops. It's insane. I mean, it's like, they basically like take your balls and shine a flashlight under your point. They don't, it's, they look at, I mean, who could blame them? You're about to give somebody a shit ton of money. I thought, you know, I mean, you're like, I get it. Like you want to make sure there's no skeletons in the closet but they check every fucking closet, man. I understand. But so during that process, you're like, I don't know, maybe this won't happen. Maybe this won't happen. And to be honest, we, this is how close it was. Like it was, it was the due date and we moved in. Wow. And we moved in and I prayed. I said, baby, please be late. I've never like said that shit. I was like, please, it's not the right time. Let me get my shit together. At least get the furniture in. And the baby came one week later. Wow. How was your wife handling that, man? Like, man, that's like, she's got her nesting. She wants to nest. Y'all are going through a loan process. That's intense. My wife's a hustler like me. She gets it. She's like, I mean, women are the strongest beings on earth, factually. And this is why, you know, before we dive in fully on the whole manifestation tip, you know, my theory is, you know, you look at every religion and every belief system always paints women as second class, always as behind. Because I feel spiritually very early on from Adam and Eve days, from whenever, you know, we condemned a woman who ate the fruit of knowledge. How the fuck can you condemn anyone who ate knowledge? Right. So spiritually speaking, men have always put women secondary because women are spiritually more in tune with the universe because they give birth to consciousness. Right. And I've always encouraged that in her. Like, you are the power. You can manifest way quicker than I am because I have so many men, but don't get me wrong, women have so many hookups too. You know, you have to do this. You have to do that. Men have to be the breadwinner. There's all these fucking connotations that don't exist that are instilled in us that we have to uncondition. Yes. My wife and I have been unconditioning each other since the day we met 10 years ago. We don't argue. We don't have disagreements. We don't, you know, none of that type of stuff because we know spiritually we're in tune with each other and we're growing. We have these type of conversations all the time. And we grow together and we're always talking about, she's like, when I jumped onto this podcast, she said, manifest that shit. Wow. And I was like, yeah, damn right. I mean, because like I watched your show and this is a perfect example of manifestation is in terms of an unrestricted thought. I watched your show and I was so in awe of it. I said, this shit is so fucking genius. Every episode blew my mind and it kept getting better and better and the topics you were talking about and the visuals and everything made sense. And I said, I'm going to be on his show. That's so cool, man. To me, that's, you know, because the show was a form of manifestation and it's like interesting, right? That's the thing that seems to happen when you start manifesting stuff. Other manifestors show up and then you swap data. You like, you know, like you exchange ideas and like, you know, you remind each other. You remind me of thing. I forget, man. That's my problem. I'll forget. It's very easy for me to just forget some of the basic stuff. You know, grammar school level stuff, which is, you know, it's so easy to get lost. And for me, it's very easy to get lost in my mind and swept away. Sometimes I wonder if I'm doing that on purpose just because I love so much being swept into my head and into doubt, fear, despondency, negativity. I somehow look like it's almost like a BDSM thing where it's like I enjoy the chaos and then more than anything, I enjoy dropping back in. You know, as Sharon Salzburg says, the healing is in the return. That moment when you drop back in and remember the thing that's so easy to forget and then you're in truth again and then the magic starts happening or maybe I'm afraid or something that I don't know. Maybe there's some sense of some in like, and I think this is skipping ahead a little bit, but sometimes as I do explore the concept of manifestation and look back at all the things that did work, not accidentally, but worked when I was reading the works of the great manifesters, you know, like reading Ernest Holmes, The Science of Mind or listening to people giving lectures like Michael Beckwith from Agape or something or even talking to you during the last podcast and then all of a sudden, boom, stuff just starts happening instantaneously. And then I start thinking, well, there's almost a sense of like, how far can you go with this? There's a feeling of like, if I were to push this further or if I were to experiment with this more, would I stay alive? Would I even be a me anymore? Would there this, it sounds insane, but sometimes there's a sense of like, if you did this enough, would you just kind of forget you were a person or something? You know what I'm talking about? Would you just wake up from a dream you were having that you were this limited being and suddenly be unlimited? And in that there, I don't know, it's ridiculous, but there's this feeling of like, shit, I'm afraid like so much, I guess the best to summarize, so much of what the way people understand who they are and the world is through their perceived limitations. That is how we identify who we are, not by what we have or what we can achieve, but by where we're stuck. Sounds depressing, but wouldn't you agree? That seems to be maybe not for you, but for a lot of people, that's where their mind lands. I think it's because it's, I mean, I'm trying to bring awareness back to the power we all possess. And I feel like when something bad happens to us, it's not us, it's something else. It's, you know, it's Sod's Law, as we say in the UK. Sod's Law is basically when something bad happens, it's just, it's something that has happened to you. It's not in your control, whereas everything is in your control. Everything, the way you look is you are in control of the way you look, the way you, you know, all these life situations, your health, the way you die, you know? I mean, I'm gonna, I can get so deep in all of this type of stuff. You know, it's the law of attraction. I mean, thoughts, feelings, emotions, your belief system, everything about you is your attraction. We're never not manifesting. We're always manifesting, even when you're aware of the manifestation, you're, you know, even health, even the weather, even, because if you believe in manifesting from a standpoint, because I talked with somebody, but yeah, I believe in that, I manifested that good thing. And then something bad happens, they're like, well, no, that wasn't me. But then you can't truly believe in the power you have. Do you think you can reverse age? So I don't know. I mean, the early texts said that Moses or they lived to 800. I don't know if that's completely correct, but because there was no limit on age. You know, how old, like we have birthdays for our children and it is how old are you? It should be motherfucking how young are you? Look, man, I've heard sex great. Yeah, that is a good way to put it, how old are you? How old are you? And then you're like, you know, you wake up and you're like, fuck, I haven't slept, I'm tired, I'm this, I feel, you know, and then you see, I even studied people who lived to 100. And they're like, what's the secret to success? And to your life, long lifespan. And there is always a common denominator. They were just content. They were content. It wasn't about manifestation or any type of bullshit. It wasn't awareness. They still drunk, they still smoke, but they did it in happiness. They did it in a place of comfort. How do you get to that point though, man? This is, to me, let's start there, because I think you're right. You're gonna start doing, I mean, in Buddhism, but also in magical texts, in the ceremonial magic, or any of it, generally, the process starts with learning how to calm your mind. The process starts with shunyata. How do you, mindfulness is what they call in the last bit, how do you, it's like getting to that place where you're no longer disturbed by the mind. And this is one of the things I love about you is that you're not somebody who was born in the palace. You grew a palace around you, but you weren't born there. And so these things that you're saying, they do carry a little bit more weight in the sense that you're walking the walk. It's not, you know, you have done this. You definitely figure out how to do this, but talk to me a little bit about that. I have a real problem not being reactive when the phenomena around me is chaotic. I get pissed when my poodle starts barking. Sometimes I just, you know, I get caught up if the news is particularly fucked up. There's a fire, holy shit, trending on Twitter. The San Andreas Fault earthquake swarms and it affects me and then I get lost. How do you find your balance in the midst of chaos? See, I first learned how to quiet the mind on YouTube. Believe it or not, I mean, I was like, cause I was tired, I was so tired. I was so depressed. I was so, you know, anxious. My head was too heavy for my body. I used to get headaches or like all that type of shit. And I was like, and I've always been someone who's responsible. I'm like, this is enough, bro. Like me telling myself, I need to stop. I think it was Tony Robbins who said, staring in the mirror for like five minutes a day or some shit and just smile at yourself. And I did it. And I said, this is the dumbest shit I've ever done. But it worked. I mean, I was like, and I started smiling. And I mean, I did it for like three days and it kind of worked, but I would do this thing where, like my mind is eerily quiet. Like I can't believe how quiet my mind is. From, don't get me wrong, now, all I hear now is nursery rhymes from the babies TV shows and stuff. But I would do a thing of, I would sit there and I would count down. If I'm in bed, if I wake up at night or, you know, before bed, I'd do 100 to zero. So 199, 98, 97, and you'd be like, fuck that bill. Oh, the baby or this or that or whatever's going on. None of that. 97, 96, you'd lose your place about a thousand times. The first few times and it's frustrating as hell. You get down to zero and you're like, oh, whoa. And then it all comes flooding back. And then you go 50, zero, 50, zero, you do that for a week, your mind will be blank. I promise you. You're saying do countdowns when you're going to sleep and when you get caught in your thoughts, you start over again? Any time, any time, doesn't have to be sleep. It can be any time. If you find your mind race, cause it's easy to count up. Yeah. I mean, it's easy to count down too, but it takes a little bit more of a thought process to be like a hundred, 99, 98, and then you get to 90. And every 10 that I get to, I say thank you. And then I keep going and then you go 50, zero, 50, zero, and you do it as many times as you want. And then you'll notice like a split second of a silent that you've never felt before. It's almost like, I don't want to get too vulgar, but it's like, it's almost that point of when you masturbate for the first time. And then it's like the best explosion ever and you're fucking amazed. It's the same thing. The gap. The gap. That gap in time where you're exactly in that moment. And it's a beautiful thing. I mean, it is so beautiful. And you're sitting there going, wow, for a split second, you are you. Yeah. And then it all comes flooding back again. But I think that's the reason why manifestation isn't really a common knowledge thing because we don't work on ourselves enough. There is no, we don't spend time on ourselves. No one does. Right. Well, yeah, because, you know, well, and also a lot of the times the manifestation stuff, you'll watch the secret, you'll hear it secondhand, you'll get an idea that it's a possibility. But some of the literature, it doesn't, at least I probably skipped over it, but it doesn't like get into the precursor stuff, which really is like what you're talking about. The, like before you get into the bigger picture for, you know, it's like, okay, what you want to, my meditation teacher tells me that, you know, there's an, you know, I don't know, he's amazing, but, you know, there is the potential to like maybe levitate. You know, maybe that is something, but it's like before you, how do you think you can levitate if you can't stop yourself from drinking every night? Like how do you think you can levitate if you can't even drink enough water every day to stay hydrated? Like how can you levitate? How can you gain that control, whatever that may be, whatever the magical act you're looking for, if you can't sit still for two minutes, you know? So I think that's the idea, is first begin to find that calm space. That's the temple. That's like the temple you carry with you. And that's the place you can do the work, right? Is that how you see it? I'm not gonna lie, Dung, it's difficult. Everything you explained, like I tried to do, you know, the Eastern meditation of staring at a blank surface, eyes open, doing the countdown with the breath, and it was agonizing. It was agonizing. But they do say, I did read afterwards that you can have a notebook there, because I had a ton of ideas come through for other things and you can write stuff down. But I mean, it's, for me to become spiritually aware, I had to be in a place where I was comfortable enough to do it. Me, Lou Paul could not be spiritual Lou. Back where I was, it just didn't exist for me. I had no choice. That's why the Western culture now is really picking up on spirituality, because the West has money. And they can afford now to take time out. And again, when I speak to people who are religiously, for example, Damien Eccles, who we both know, he's a master meditator, and he's dedicated his life to it. I don't think I could do that. And to be honest, I don't meditate anymore, because I like where I'm at right now, and I like that there's some thought process, some not, some, I question myself, I don't, but it's me. It's never this kind of external source. I think Michael A. Singer is the perfect guy to break down the untethered soul and the surrender experiment, where he basically lives in a wood cabin and surrenders himself. It's almost like if you throw a feather into the wind and it blows, that's how you have to be with your thoughts and your emotions and your feelings. And he literally built a cabin with no money, and he became this multi-multi-millionaire, because people just kept, but we have to remember one thing too. So for example, when I was doing a job, whether it would be in a printing firm, or this shit job, or this, or that, I did it at 100% as if I was being, like I was like the world's best paid employee. And I think that's where some of us confuse. If you're working in McDonald's, that's fucking amazing. You're hustling, you're doing your thing. Do it 100%. Do it like it's the end goal, because you know what's gonna happen. Your thought process will take you to the end goal anyway, but if you're half-arsing it, you're manifesting half-arsed situations to continue. Love it. That's for sure, man. That, right there, that is it, that thing. That is, to me, that's actually one of the things I forget, but that is it. Because, you know, Ram Dass talks about this a little bit, which is, you know, in India, you might see a window washer, you know, and realize you're looking at someone, it's like watching a great artist. Like you're looking, like they're so fully involved in it. There isn't a sense of like, I'm just a window washer. It's like, this is what I'm doing now, and there's a crazy thing when you see that versus somebody's like, well, I got this fucking temp job until I get my CD to Lou. You know what I mean? So I'm like half, I want to get the fuck out of here, that thing in your mind. I know exactly what you're talking about. Like, to me, that is the wild quality of this manifestation. Is like, if you, there is a way that the entire glory of the universe can shine through you, regardless of whatever your activity may be, and you, and they say this, I've met some pretty advanced people, but never like the like alleged guru, the Osho or whatever. But they do say that when you see people like that, whatever it is they're doing, there's this grace to it that's captivating. There's this, whatever it may be, there's this artistry to it that you never forget. And they're not forcing themselves to do that. They're not like exerting or anything. Because I think a lot of people confuse being fully devoted to what you're doing with like just exertion. And I think it's not pushing harder. It's, you know what I mean? It's not like driving at a thing aggressively. It's a whole different thing you're talking about, right? It's like tuning in to it and letting that be the sum total of who you are. See, I'm not gonna lie, ignorance for me was bliss. Like in terms of, I'm super happy now, but I'm trying to master the ignorance so it becomes bliss. So basically, you know, ignorance, for example, the food I used to eat, it didn't matter what I ate, I felt healthy. Now I know if I eat shit food, it's in my mind that I've eaten shit food. So therefore I manifest my body rejecting this food that I enjoy. You see what I'm saying? So when I say ignorance is bliss, I mean it on that level of the, but the difference now is I know that everything in my life is me. Every single detail, every single person you walk past on the street, every single, you know, everything in your life, even the weather, even like I study people who live around tornadoes. And they're usually a couple of types of peoples, you know, people who like to, who have a distinct knack for rebuilding or wanna rebuild so their whole shit gets taken down. They're like, it's fine, we'll rebuild. And you're like, oh shit, okay. So, you know, like we wouldn't live in a tornado valley because we're just not there, we're not the attraction. And even as I said to you the other day, you know, with the earthquake that happened here, you know, I knew it was coming while I was sleeping. And my wife did too, it was the strangest thing ever. And she woke up in a panic, the baby. I already had the baby monitor and I said, and I lent her back and I said, you're okay, we're safe. She's safe. And I felt safe the whole time. And again, we can't, fear is an attraction too. The things you fear come into your life. And I said, and you know, even, you know, going to the cinema and watching a horror movie, the only difference from you attracting that horror movie is the fact that you don't believe that that horror movie is real. Because if you did, you would attract that shit into your life. I study murder victims. How is it that that jogger was killed by some random person? And there's always, people can't see the distinction. We all have this relationship with death, whether we like it or not. We know it's coming. We know what it's like, but sometimes we avoid it. Sometimes we don't. But it's the attraction of the death. For example, I thought when I was growing up, like I wanted to die. And I'd get into fights and people would try and stab me. But I didn't clock at the time that I was attracting that death, but I knew I didn't want to die. You know, there's anxieties, there's oppressions, there's all these type of things. And then I turned it on its head and be like, wow, it's me. I'm, we are powerful. And the same thing, I know you spoke about the news that like, fucking get rid of that shit. Form of meditation is focusing on one thing. Whether it's focusing on no mind or levitating or out of your body or what, it's one thing. When you watch the news, you're meditating on that one thing, whatever that news reporter is saying to you, that's your meditation. Like anything in life, you know, if you're painting a wall and you know you're in the moment or whatever, that's meditation. We just think this eyes closed and we're off to the fairies. So I don't do that. I don't have outside distractions. Like this lockdown for me has been a strange blessing because I like the fact that I only focus on my family, my business, doing what I love. I don't watch the news. I don't even watch TV anymore. I'm reading, I've got, I'm not educated at all. Like I didn't go to school. I barely, I read five books, three books when I left school and those were only for school books. I think it was like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and some other bullshit. And I never, and I would never read. And now I'm reading like a book a week, which is insane. And I'm really into like near different experiences now, which has just blown my mind. Yeah, that's fascinating, isn't it? Wait, but I want to get into that, but tell me your thoughts on the multiverse. Well, so I'm going to give you a good one. This is a good one. Cause I learned this the other day and it's so true that my whole body shook and I was like, holy shit. So for example, I don't know, what would a young Duncan Trussell, what would his, so for example, I wanted to be a soccer player. I used to play semi pro and then my, I dislocated my shoulder. I came back from injury, I was fresh. I had doubts and I had a strap and I did it again. And I'm the game over, my game was done. I had so much doubt in my mind and I knew I was going to get injured. So every time I play football now I'm going to, you're going to get injured and I do. So there's my manifestation. The multiverse. So for example, there's probably a me cause I put so much energy into that, that playing professional soccer. So I can tap into that skill, right? If, if I focus on it, which I never do because who the fuck has time, I don't have time for that. So I don't know what another Duncan was. I mean, there was so many other things. Maybe I wanted to be a lawyer. Maybe I want to be this, we'll know to be that. And the reason why our sole entity puts out so many, we put out so many different versions of us. Yes. Even from a point of, you know, I wanted to stay in bed this morning cause my baby got up too early. If I put enough energy into that, there's another me in bed having his day, living on and whatever, thinking that that's the true source. Now the difference is the only entity or only multidimensional you that knows you is aware of all of the multidimensional selves. So that means we are not the source of us. We are multidimensional version of us. Yeah, right. We're like, we're essentially like one part of a spectrum of us right now. Yes. That's a good thing. Yes. So, and okay. So, cause to me for a lot of what the manifestation stuff to really work, it requires a multiverse. It requires a, you know, for example, and you know, many people hear this shit and they're like, give me a fucking break. You're telling me that, not many people. I'll tell you, this has been my cynical side when I thought about this stuff, but I've seen so many crazy things going to those Ram Dass retreats, man. You just can't doubt it anymore. But like, you can doubt it, but you're doubting, you're no longer doubting cause you have an experience that you're doubting cause it freaks you out and you can't deal with the fact that things can be very different than what you think. But the, so, but this is what I think I'm just going to say the cynical stuff just because I think you can address it in a way that maybe we'll clear some stuff up and people think, okay, number one. Well, okay. I went to a manifestation church once. I'll never forget this. And they were having a sweepstakes or some shit. Someone's going to win a car. And I remember just thinking like, all right. So is this like the person who wins the car? Is this like a weightlifting contest but for manifestation? Cause everyone here is going to be attempting to believe that they're going to get the car, but only one person is going to get it, right? So in my mind, to me, it's like, okay. So it is, it's bullshit. Or like another cynical version of it is like, well, we don't want there to be evil in the universe, right? We, one of the big problems of any kind of philosophy or spirituality that involves the conceptualization of the universe where there could be, even if it's a super version of you, is how do we deal with the suffering in the world? How do we rationalize that? And sometimes, you know, Ram Dass will say, we choose our incarnations. Yes. And I'll hear, and when I'm in a good mood and I hear that, I'm like, yeah, I love that. But when I'm in a bad mood, I'll think, really, that's just your way of not dealing with the fact that sometimes people are born, you know, children are born in the most fucked up situations. They don't even make it to before because their parents are alcoholics. They don't get fed and then they die. And it's like, all right, that's a lazy way to rationalize that horror in the world. And also, what are you saying? The four-year-old manifested its own demise, you know? So to me, like, that's the cynical part of me. The non, the neutral part of me thinks, well, I don't understand that well enough to really deal with it. I don't really know. And then the part of me that's into the manifestation stuff just thinks, well, that is real. I mean, that did happen. And is the universe malfunctioning because that happened? Is that the idea that the universe is out of balance? So anyway, how would you answer that? So, because I mean, I search for that truth. How is it, especially children, I mean, you know, it's, and we look at death like death, not new life. And touching up on the ND experiences, near-death experiences, they feel love, they feel compassion when they pass over. And I have read so many, you know, kids who have cancer, who pass over and come back. And they're like, I did not wanna come back. I loved it over there. I loved it. I knew why I was here. I knew what I had to learn. So, you know, we are born, we are reincarnated into situations for us to learn. As the soul, the entity as a whole, we are a personality in this, you know, which we retain in the afterlife too. Oh, so in terms of children are manifestors in the now, they're innocent, so nothing is predetermined. Only the situation you're born into is an agreement that you have as a personality or a soul or entity, whatever you wanna say, has with the agreements that everyone around you. So for example, you know, your child, your wife, your whoever's in your life has these agreements before they're born into incarnation. So, it's so difficult to kind of, I don't wanna offend anyone who's lost a chuck cause I get it, I get all that type of stuff. But if we knew that life, there's life after death, I think we would approach this completely differently. And especially when you research the NDE's and you know, all that type of stuff, you realize that children are super in tune with everything. They live in them complete now. There is no yesterday, there is no tomorrow, there is now, I'm hungry now, I'm sleeping now, I'm not, and we as adults forget that. So yeah, and even back to you, you know, the church thing is, you know, manifesting a car, it's also the knowing, cause I struggle with that, cause I try and research, for example, music, how, what determines a song being a hit? There's so many fucking components going on in, within that song. There's a songwriters, there's a producers, there's the label, there's the artists themselves who are completely in meltdown. I hate this song, I don't want it to come out and it becomes the biggest hit on the earth. Right, so I kind of have attributed that to the energy is in the song. Yeah. Whatever was created in that three, four minutes is in that song, regardless of anyone around them. But it's also the expectation, right? So if you're born rich, you expect to be rich. I'm not talking about manifestation in happiness or sadness, that's all irrelevant. It's about manifestation. So when you expect, see, I didn't expect nothing growing up. So for me to, so someone says to me, why don't you just manifest $100 million? Because that's not believable to me, that's not what. Right. That's not, I wasn't around that. Now, if you ask, I don't know if you've seen that show, Succession. No, I haven't. So it's basically about billionaires, but it's like a true interpretation of billionaires. And you look at them and you realize like, let's go for a round game of rounders, cool. They jump in their cars, they hop on their helicopters, they go and play a game of rounders, and that shit probably cost a million dollars to do that whole thing. That's the expectation. They know that shit is gonna be there. And therefore their universe is there. Yeah. So with children, is some, their soul can push them, pull them back, if they're in a situation where they're, I watched a kid on Netflix whose parents, used to put him in a cupboard and beat the shit out of him. And social workers used to go around and I'm like, well, what did he, he didn't deserve any of that. Right. But then he's now in a better place, in a much better place. So hard for us to understand, I'm not from any of this. I don't like, I just know that this is what it is. No, I agree with you, man. Look, this is why I bring up the multi-verse because I think, you know, humanity's gone through these very interesting phases and one of them is we went, we learned how to fucking fly, right? And then the moment you learn how to fly, suddenly the terrain of the earth, you learn more about the earth. Essentially humanity is a whole, the consciousness of humanity. Anytime we gain a technology like that, it changes completely. When we became, when we gained the ability to go into orbit around the planet, everything changed again. The example I've been given is like, you know, we went from thinking when the sun went down, it might not come up to knowing that the sun's always there, floating in the sky. And similarly right now, we're in an interesting predicament as humans because we are in a place where we, most people, not most people, you know, religious people don't think of it, many people feel like the moment your body dies or the moment someone lets go of their body, they no longer exist. This is the scientific materialist standpoint and within it, it produces a nightmare situation. If Dawkins is correct, if you name it, whoever is correct regarding the, this is it. You get one shot, random, you don't get to choose your avatar, no. You get exploded into the universe with some sentience that's a result of an overactive fucking neocortex. You sort of trick yourself into imagining that you're a thing and you do that just long enough to get by without going insane and hopefully get your DNA into somebody else, make another accidental blurt of sentience before your meat machine collapses and then you're infinitely gone. That's the idea. And if you live in that universe, then yeah, that for many people, even though they might not want to admit it, that's a pretty dire place. And also it doesn't feel like it fits in with what our instincts or our sense of self tells us, not to mention the near-death experiences, but people are going to rationalize that all the way. But I really think it could be that we are looking at some kind of, for lack of a better word, multiverse situation where there is a simultaneous experience happening, a kind of continuum of identity stretching from the most dire version of ourself all the way across the board. And the sum total of all of those combined equals the great wisdom of whatever the archetypical you may be. And it's the archetypical you that is kind of like the way the sun is for the earth. It's a tension where it's shining, where that lands. That's where you're at. That's you. You're being like, so that's where we're at. And as above so below, because of that situation, we can really jump through that timeline. We can, and then all of a sudden, things start making a little bit more sense. Even though it sounds fucking nuts, that if we do gain multi-dimensionality, if quantum computing, or if we gain some lens, if we can do the same thing we did with an airplane, but for this continuum of identity. And theoretically, based on what we're talking about here, we've already fucking done it. There already is a version of the civilization we're in right now, a version of us right now that lives in a civil, call it whatever you wanna call it, a technological civilization that has gained the ability to look past the singularity of death, and is recognized, oh yeah, there's a continuum of selves. And if this is the case, then yeah, you really can, you want the $100 million, you can manifest it, but not just that. You could theoretically jump actual points in history. You could jump to the timeline where there's an actual time machine. Because that's the thing, man, I know this sounds absolutely like, for some people might sound like gobbledygook, but you listen to my podcast, this is what I always rambled about. But I'm saying, man, this, like everybody thinks a time machine, right? They're like, oh, a time machine means you're gonna get in your little time machine and you're gonna travel back to the 70s. Who wouldn't wanna do that? Do blow in the 70s at some badass 70s party? But really, actually, what it might mean is it's a device, a technological device that shifts your consciousness in a way that makes you no longer susceptible to the doubt that keeps you from jumping timelines. Because if the implication is just a shift in our attention or consciousness can radically transform not just our bodies, but the stuff around us, then suddenly a time machine isn't a portal, it's a consciousness device. It's a thing that does the thing, the great manifestors have figured out how to do, but without you having to go through all that precursor shit. And so now everyone becomes travelers. Only the what we're traveling is we're swimming through our various lives. It sounds insane, but so did fucking flight. So did jumping on an airplane or going into space. And so yeah, man, I do think like that's where I get unnerved by it, actually, is it's like, whoa, that's what they were talking about when they were talking about the possibility of flight. They didn't mean flight necessarily as much as like, oh no, you can jump wherever you wanna be. You can jump right in to paradise. That's my poodle. I wanna jump into a fucking dimension where he doesn't bark anymore. I had the first place I'm gonna go. He's been good for this long. He's been good for this long. So anyway, yeah, to me, that's how we can work with the idea of manifestation is we have to redefine the universe to not just be one timeline. It needs to be an actual continuum. Well, the past, the present and the future is all happening now at the exact same time. Like it's factually true. I like it. You know, if you're into it and you're super deep into it, you can tap into those type of timelines, those dimensions, but for example, another dimension that you're living has no concept of time. Right. So, you know, all that type of stuff. So, and you know, the annoying, I mean, not the annoying thing, that's the wrong word, having the door is you're always conscious of the time. How long has she napped? So how long is, and I fuck, I'm a guy that just time for me doesn't exist. It does not really a thing. But as long as you use it to your advantage, not as a disadvantage, you know, we have all the, we put, we always rush things. That's one thing as a site, we always do. We're always looking for the quick fix, the quick fix, the quick fix. But now I'm trying to be at a point, like my wife's speaking about it all the time. We want to live to 100. We want all that, like we love life. We love what we're doing. We love all that type of stuff. And the way we're going to do that is by not putting a concept of time. We're trying to get back to the early, the Moses and those dudes. They didn't know what age they were. They didn't know it was Monday, Tuesday or Thursday or any of that type of shit or nine, you know, before Christ or any of that type of stuff. We as a site need to get back to that. And I feel like that's a part of what creates unhappiness and anxieties and stresses because we have to achieve something by certain goals. You know, I think the reason why I'm, you know, I'm doing so well in myself because even my own belief system, you know, when you're younger, you're doing whatever you're farting around. And then I know that the older I get, the more accomplished I've become financially. That's just a natural trait of growth. That's why, you know, you know, 80% of people make their money in their retirement or just about to retire or this type of stuff because it's the belief system. But I'm trying to, even now with my daughter is bring her to a where, I don't know, it's difficult to, I don't know how I'm going to do it, but always make her aware of the fact that she, her emotions, her feelings, her thoughts create her whole outside exterior to every single detail. Even the, I can't stress it enough the way she looks, you know, her image, the way she feels about herself. It's like, you know, when you see so many self-conscious people and they look great and they're like, like super models. Most of them are super self-conscious and have anxieties and want to have this stuff because they're so focused on their looks. Yeah. So therefore their looks on the outside looks good. They just can't see it because we haven't, we haven't factually seen ourselves with our own eyes. We've seen a reflection of ourselves. We're seeing the image that we've created on the inside, outside. So I'm trying to, you know, read all these religious texts and take pictures of, pinches of them. You know, we are creating God's image. There is no, there is no, but there is no human, but we can, can't do this, this and this. There's a never ending. If you believed you could fly, like you could say, the airplane is the closest manifestation of flying. Right. We don't, we don't, we don't believe we can physically fly ourselves. You know, if we did, we probably would be able to. And that's where everyone's like, no way, that's not possible. And those are the people who stay in the timeline where you can't fly. See, this is like, the thing we're talking about is, you know, I don't, it's, man, I've seen just one little, it's quick little thing, man. Like we are at one of these Ram Dass retreats. And, and again, I don't know why I'm always battling with a skeptic in my mind, but we're one of these, it's been raining every day. This is fucking Hawaii, but it's raining for some reason, right? And Ram Dass, he, I just saw happen, man. He's like, you know, he's had a stroke, but he still had this floaty thing and he would go out into the ocean. And so they take him out on this, that where everyone goes and swims with him, it's a really beautiful thing. They would throw flowers and flowers are floating around and they go out in the ocean. He's floating and laughing. And I watched it with my own eyes, man, it's raining. He went out there when it was raining. It stops raining. He's floating out there. It stops raining. And a rainbow appears above him. So now you have this being floating in the fucking water with flower petals around him and a rainbow above him and the rain stopped. And it's like, come on, that's too much. Whatever that was, that's wild, man. And I don't think some people are afraid to live in that kind of universe where that's a possibility. I'm on the cusp, man. I mean, and that's just a little version of some of the shit I've seen over there. But like, you know, we do, that's why I like hanging out with folks like you. Cause that's the other beautiful thing is, and you know, Chogan Trump of Rinpoche says, don't do spiritual hitchhiking. But really, you know, like bikes will get close behind the other bike and they get caught in that like updraft, you get pulled along. So that's why I think in Buddhism, good right association is a huge part of it, which is like, you want to be around people who are going at the very least, if you're like, you know, if your intent is to evolve, but for whatever reason, you're a little cloudy. You want to be around people who are actively doing it cause you will get pulled in their updraft. Like it will happen. You know, you will see, if you hang out with these people who have a practice, you'll see some of the craziest shit you've ever seen, whether you believe it or not, because that's the world they live in. I've never actually met anyone who doesn't understand what I'm talking about ever. Because I feel like I've turned the needle and I've always been aiming, well over the last few years, aiming to turn that needle. So now I only attract people who want to listen or, you know, have kind of tapped into it, but not really. So I get calls all the time of people just being like, you know, how do you do this, this, this, this? And it's just you. I mean, like, I read so many people who are on stage being like, you know, giving out advice for the, they're one problem that they have. And it fixes that one problem, but we have to give power back to people, to individuals. You know, we are a group collective. I mean, for example, you know, when all the protests were happening and it was a beautiful thing, but it would have been equally as effective as sitting down, meditating on one focus. Doesn't, I'm not talking like eyes closed, whatever. Focus on change. What change do we want? And write one thing down and for a split second, think of that. Write the second thing down. For another split second, think of that. Changes will be happening quicker, especially collectively. I mean, individually you have enough power to do it by yourself. Hands down, collectively, holy shit. Yeah, that's why the news is so fucked up, right? Because it's forcing people in a collective death ritual, right? That's what the news is doing. It's hijacked, it's people, you know, that thing you said about meditating when you're watching the news. Man, that is so fucked up. Because just think about it. If you're sitting on the couch, watching the TV, imagine if you were sitting in a room and there was no TV and you were just staring at the wall. You're meditating. You're meditating for fucking hours. That would be amazing. You'd be like, yeah, I meditate three hours a day. I just sit and stare at this dark rectangle. But turn on the news, you're still meditating. It's just you have been hijacked by a fear matrix. And to me, what do you think about that, man? I mean, this is where I get real creeped out. Because I'm like, is there some kind of sentient darkness that wants to keep people chained to fucked up reality? No, I don't know. I mean, I've separated myself from it. So I can only speak from my experience. It's the conditioning. Of course the conditioning is there, but we all have free will to turn it off. No one's forcing you to turn on the TV and watch the news. Just as, you know, it's like, you know, when you go and get surgery or whatever, you sign paper, you know, you're putting your like, again, it's your choice. All of this is your choice in terms of you watching the news. Yes, what they feed you is not really your choice, but you're watching it. Do you think, so, holy shit, is that right? Holy shit. Well, I'm sorry. I didn't realize how much time and fuck, man. We've been talking, you are really magical, man. It feels like I've been talking for like five minutes. I know. Whoa, whoa. Are you in a rush? No, I'm just, no, for a second I was like, oh, we've probably been talking for like 30 minutes. No, I feel like I've still got so much more to say. Oh yeah, we're not even, okay, no, I'm not in a rush, but I'm not in a rush at all, but I do want, I want to ask you this. And this, I don't need to do some like evangelism, crazy shit, but don't you think, man, I think you're advanced enough that if you wanted to, just talking right now, you could like, people are listening. I think you could flip their scripts a little bit, right? Like, can you do like a, can you set an intention or do you think you have the ability to like put into the people listening, some kind of like upshift in their consciousness? I mean, to be honest, I try and be as practical as possible because I'm a pretty practical guy. I don't know any of the, I mean, I've not raised on this. I wasn't, you know, but I just, I said knowing, I don't know how to explain it, it's just a knowing. And I keep seeing more things. For example, what I would say to people is, look at every good thing in your life. Look at every thing you feel is bad. For example, I mean, I read a book, you know, on NDE and it was this woman who had cancer and the woman who was the doctor, she said, you know, it could always be worse. And she was like, what could be worse than cancer? She was like, well, I know people who are paralyzed from the neck down, who are literally slowly dying. And I'm like, holy shit. It's also a perspective, but you can, I mean, trace back any bad things that's ever happened, any good thing, anything in your life. And you can trace it back to a feeling, a thought, an emotion and actions, something on the inside, not outside, because our reaction to the outside is, oh, it's happening, then we react. The attraction to it, then we react. Right. I mean, just study your own life. That's what I do all the time. All the, when I used to get, I used to, you know, when I broke up from a relationship, I was bitter inside. I, you know, I felt like dying. I felt like physical death without dying. I didn't want to die, but I knew that it was, it had to feel better than heartbreak. It had to. And, you know, I would drink, I would take drugs, which was great. I'm not gonna, you know, I had a great time, me and my younger brother, he was, I was, I don't know, 21, 22, and he was 18, 19. And you could, I mean, the UK is legal there for alcohol and stuff. And we'd go out, we'd always get into fights. And I'm not a physical person at all. Don't get me wrong. If you're fucking me like shit is gonna go down, I get that feeling about you actually. I think you know how to fight. I mean, like for example, I'd get like three guys would come up to me in a club. And then I'd, I'd know that some shit's gonna go down. One would swing and I'd just head by him. And then he would fall to the floor. And then the other two would be like, whoa, that's the kind of reaction, but I'm not a violent person, but I can trace back the attraction to that. My bitterness, the way I was feeling about myself, everything to do with that. I used to, you know, I'm a lover, I'm not a fire. I was too busy into girls to be worrying about fighting. I'd let the other guys fight and I'd just be there with the girls. And I love that, I love that. But I realize what our mission on this earth is. And I feel like people lose that sight because they have to achieve something. I have to, I don't care about leaving anything. And I was like, I wanna be remembered forever. I don't care. I honestly don't care. I wanna start, I wanna learn more to have unconditional love for others. And for me, that is the ultimate goal. And when you read near-death experiences, and I'll touch upon why I think, why I know near-death experiences are real, because my older brother had a best friend. When he was seven, 16, he committed suicide. He hung himself and it was horrible. And he used to always sleep in my bed. So I would always go and sleep on the floor or whatever. And he was always around every weekend, every weekend, every weekend. It came from nowhere. And that, it affected me. It affected me to a point where, when you're young, you don't really like death. You don't really like ghosts. You don't like any of that type of shit. And one time when I was a kid, I had a dream about him. And he visited me in death form. So he had the dark eyes. He looked like he was dead. And it was so real. He was in a corner of my room. And he said to me, he said, I shouldn't have done this. This is the wrong place. I shouldn't be here. And I said, it's okay. You're gonna be okay. Everything is always gonna be okay. And then I woke up and I didn't, and this was like when I was young, 12 maybe. And that dream has stuck with me forever. That's been in the back of my mind. And I read a book yesterday, yesterday night, and it spoke about the near death experience of people who have tried to commit suicide. And every single one who does, who comes back, says that this do not do it. Go into a void. You go into a place where you shouldn't be. It's a place that you're there for a very long time. They say that life is a gift. And they have all these emotions and feelings and everything about why we shouldn't do it and why religions say it isn't so and all these type of things because they've touched up on, you go somewhere else. You don't see the light. You don't see any of there's not a being waiting for you. You're just in solitude. It's like that Robin Williams film, What Dreams May Come. I don't know if you've ever seen that. Oh yeah. Yeah. So when his wife commits suicide, he has to go find her in the deep, deep underworld. It was like that. And I was like, holy shit. He came to me in that dream and he reached out to me. And, you know, it's like the NDE experiences is, you know, when you ask a question, you know the answer. You don't have eyes, but you see, you know, you don't have ears, but you hear, you know, there's a, there's a being there, but it's not a form. It's a light, but you know, it's nothing but unconditional love. And they ask, you know, what have you learned? What is your knowledge? What have you, all these type of things? And then they send you back with unconditional love. Yeah. So that's the whole point of like, we're here for this free will. Like we are, we are the powerful people. Like this us, we're so fucking powerful. And, and that's why I touch back on ignorance is bliss. Cause I get so frustrated when I hear people just be, just so not aware of their, the power of their awareness. But I've learned now to accept people as them. And that's a beautiful thing. So now I'm trying to, you know, the unconditional love thing. Cause I can get quite selfish in myself. Cause if anyone starts fucking with my psyche, I don't need you in my life. I don't, it could be anyone, you know? And we have to maintain our, we have to, for you to get to this point, I had to maintain my spirit, my soul, my, my thought process. I didn't let, no one could derail me from any of that shit. Only now is I'm opening up to this type of conversations and, and you know, trying to educate people as best as I can from a point of love, from a point of the power that they all possess. Yeah. Yeah, man. You, yeah, it's, you know, one thing I've noticed is like, though anytime I'm really actively working on myself and developing unconditional love and generally the people who are fucking with your psyche, they get so annoyed with you. They don't want to talk to you anymore. They generally hit the road. Like the insidious people are the people that are really caught in the shit. They just think you're an asshole. They're like, oh, another fucking spiritual dumb shit. I don't, what happened to him? We lost him. We lost him because, you know, in that layer of reality, people live in hell. It's a hell realm and like, like they're always at war with each other and they're always fighting. So, but then sometimes you do have to make active decisions. You know, you can't just hope that people are going to de-magnetize from you. Sometimes you really, especially, I think in the early phases of it, you got to like, you have to watch out. The Prabhupāda, the guy who started the Hare Kṛṣṇas compared it to like a little tendril coming out of the ground. When you're that little tendril, you have to protect it. When it gets to be a big tree, nothing to worry about. But don't fool yourself into thinking you're a tree when you're a tendril. Because if you are truly, if you have unconditional love, it alchemizes everything. You know, like people get around that and they instantly, they forget why they're upset. They can't remember, they might remember as soon as they're out of your presence, but that is one of the qualities of the effulgence some of these people radiate, is that people get into their presence and radically, instantaneously transform. I don't know what that is. I've felt it around Ramdās and I know people who have been around like Rinpoche's and stuff, where they'll be completely bummed, completely depressed, even suicidal, and get around Rinpoche, like these advanced beings and they forget. Why was I so fucking, why they don't even remember why they were unhappy? It's just getting in the field shifts it. So I think that's something that's measurable, man. I feel like that's a scientific study could be done showing that's not just the placebo effect, that's some kind of resonance you reach with these beings. So yeah, I think that the exploration of this is one of the most important considerations, not just for an individual, but for like humanity, because we really are talking about like a shared intuition, at the very least, among our entire species, the near-death-experience shit. People just, they don't know what to say about it. How do you deal with the fact that people seem to be having the same experience across cultural divides? How do you, regardless of your religion, you're an atheist, you're still gonna see the same thing. You're a Hindu, you're gonna see the same thing. Buddhists see the same thing. Everyone's seeing the same thing. And also- It's personalized though. So for example, what you manifest in this life, you also manifest in death. So if you're Catholic, that light will be Christ consciousness. That's the kind of statistics that they've been breaking down. If you're a Buddhist, you'll see the light, all that type of stuff. So again, if you're tormented and suicide in this life, you're also tormented in the afterlife too. Yeah, that's the, in Buddhism, it's the bardo. It's just what you're gonna carry your energy wherever you go. It's like, the energy that you die with, it's not that energy carries into the bardo. So if you kill yourself, then all the only difference is that now you don't have a body to kill anymore. So now you're really fucked. It's like, you sort of intuited that there was a solution. Are you seeing, hold on one second. Ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, you know, to me, that's always a good sign. It's like anytime you get deep into a thing, if the landscapers show up to me, it's like, oh yeah, that's the forces of the universe trying to prevent the conversation. Of course, they always try to prevent the conversation on Thursdays around this time. I didn't expect- Well, the grass is listening and wants to grow. Yes, that's it. But so yeah, I had an indie person on, and one of the things they're saying is like, I think maybe when you come back into your body, you attach cultural significance to the stuff you saw, but the landscape appears to be the same. And it's not like people are dying and some people are seeing a tunnel and some people are seeing a road and some people are seeing a sunrise and some people see a giant frog. It's like there's some kind of light, there's some kind of light for view that happens, there's some kind of similarity. And also, it's really trippy, is the phenomena that if you see yourself and you look different, it's what you were saying earlier, that people who have NDEs, when they see themselves, it's like they see themselves for the first time, because they're looking in the mirror, they're always seeing like what you were saying, like a projection or something like that. It's very trippy. But to me, I think right now, we don't fuck the idea that there might even be a possibility of sending some kind of scope, a gauge, a mechanism into the barter that we could put our, there might be a way to technologically scan that place, sounds like madness. But I think that's a possibility. The more people have this kind of conversation, and the more, I think it inspires folks to start thinking about that, which is like, man, there's a way for us to really track this shit. I mean, these stories are insane. One of the stories I've heard, this India E guy told me that there was a doctor who was doing a simple surgery on an athlete. It was supposed to be a simple surgery, but the fucking guy's heart stops, right? And they can't resuscitate him. And so they're like, they're about to give up, something went wrong. This fucking lady comes running in to the emergency room and tells the doctor, no, keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it, he's not dead, he's not dead, he's not dead. And the doctor's like, what are you talking about? And she's like, this fucking, like she encountered him. He went into the fucking, he was screaming at the doctor, I'm not dead, he went into the waiting room and told this lady, tell the fucking doctor to keep trying, and he brings him back. What the fuck is that? That's, because it's not just like we're having this subjective dreamlike experience when we die, there's other stuff that goes along with it that's impossible. People see things in other rooms, people recount conversations that folks were having in other rooms, you know, stuff like where it's like, no, that's not just you heard it while you were dying. And that's the key example of the separation between true religiousness and science. There's such a big divide of, you know, the explanation from a scientist would be like, it's the drugs or you hallucinate it or the lack of oxygen to your brain. And there's a clear distinct lack of education in that field. And don't get me wrong, like there's some great scientists out there who have had near death experiences too and have come, you know, even the book Proof of Heaven, which is an amazing book where a neuroscientist who operates on the brain ended up going brain dead for eight days. And he had his whole family around him, he had all this type of stuff. And they were like, he's not coming back. I mean, you know, one day, two days, and he had E. Coli meningitis of the spine and spinal fluid, so it's attacking his brain. And if he was gonna come back, he's gonna come back as a vegetated state. And he describes like, he calls it the earthworms eye view of when you first die. And bearing in mind, he wasn't aware of the personality, he wasn't aware of his kids back home, he wasn't aware of any of this. And I'll tell you the reason why afterwards. And then he, once he's there, he's there, he's scared shitless, he feels fear. And then he goes up and up and up and sees a light. Then he goes to this place called the core and all this other type of stuff. And he sees all these faces. He sees this woman with beautiful butterfly wings. Sounds crazy as fuck, but it resonates so well. And she's flying around and he's like, wow, this is amazing. And he goes to another place and this is amazing. He goes back to the earthworm view and feels at peace. And can see all these faces, which he realized was his wife and his son and his sisters who praying for him to come back. And he remembers his son, I think he was 11, who wrote a note and was like, please dad, come back to me. And he remembers feeling really guilty because he wanted to stay. He wanted to stay in the afterlife, but he knew he had to come back. And after eight days, he woke up, like nothing ever, ever happened. His brain was intact, everything was fine. He wrote this book and he basically was like, he's trying to bridge the gap between religion and science. That's why he called this book Proof of Heaven. And again, his connotation, he went to the church, he had all these type of things. So it's the God, it's the higher power. He kind of touches up on that, but it's higher than us. It's something that was created from life. It has to be. If we as humans have free will, it cannot be anything but love. If it was the opposite of love, we wouldn't have free will, we'd be controlled, we wouldn't have any of these conversations. And that's the whole thing back to, excuse me, the news. We have the free will to meditate and choose what we instill into our lives. That's the free will. We just choose not to have that free will. And it's real. I mean, I don't know how to explain it, but if it was common knowledge, we wouldn't, I don't think it would transform life for the positive. I think it would transform life in a way where we would do everything we would do to die, in a sense, if something went wrong, if I was fine, I'll do it again. And I feel like that separation has been there for eons of millennia, because we are supposed to be on this earth. We're supposed to learn. We're supposed to learn from scratch. We're supposed to do this. We're supposed to pick up new shit. If we knew for a fact that there was life after death and it's this beautiful, loving, no judgment, no, I'm gone. Everyone's gone on the planet. Yeah. Well, I mean, that does, I mean, to me, that's the thing. That's where, if you take this stuff to the furthest point, it gets that trippy, where, and there are studies, I mean, not studies, there's stories, there's Shambhala, there's stories of these cities that where everyone in the city gets simultaneously enlightened, not just one Buddha, the entire city gets enlightened together, and then the city, it's gone, it's not here anymore. Like it blips out. It's like, that's one of the, I think it just depends on where you are in your training, whatever this fucking training is. Some of us are in part of the part of the training where right now you're learning just the basics, how to be compassionate, how to love, how to give more than you take, just basic stuff like that. And then when you start giving more than you take, you start realizing, wait a minute, the more I give, I get like triple or double back. So if I start getting, and then that's its own weird little sand trap, because you're like, shit, I'll just start leaving massive fucking tips everywhere. I'll just start like, and people like, and I'll do it secretly. I don't even fucking tell people I do that. You know, and a lot of people, the most successful people I know, they all do that. They all do that. And it's like, but that's the thing you start realizing, okay, it is a little bit like a machine, in the sense that if I freely give energy in the positive, I get an exponential increase in that energy back. And the amount that I don't freely give the energy, that dilutes that effect, but it still will echo back. Like I've experimented with this shit, man. You can literally be desperate for money, and then give somebody way more money than you should, in that state, and you're still, what do you know? Surprise, surprise, two days later, a fucking check shows up. And it just happens to be three times the amount you gave that person. Then that's where you enter the realm of magic, right? That's where you start playing around with that energy. Like what the fuck else can I do? And then maybe there's something past that, where you might really be able to pull your head out of whatever this thing is, out of a wormhole view without dying. You might really be able to travel out, just because you want to. And then that's a whole new class. I don't know, that's like college or something, compared to where I'm at, but I think it is possible. And also I think some people who are like professors, or like advanced students, pop in to the realm that we're in, to like give classes sometimes. Like they come here too, and like here, I'll show you some stuff, and then they go away. You know, I don't know. Again, man, this is my hippie speculation on this situation. I love it. I mean, I do these practical things, just to test my power, my attraction, or whatever. I used to see these adverts on TV, a good few years ago, it was probably five years ago. And it would be like, checks in the mail, get your checks in the mail. And I'd be like, what the, I'm British, so we don't really do checks. And I was like, I want to get fucking checks in the mail. And I always like, you know, artist's royalty, I don't get those, but artists get checks. You know, when I carry every Christmas, probably fucking makes a ton of money. Yeah. As a check in the mail. So I would sit there and I go, you know what? I want to check in the mail. I'm going to sit there, and I want checks in the mail. Not how am I going to get the check in the mail, bearing in mind, it's just, I'm going to get the check in the mail. It was a weird knowing. I just fucking knew it. And then I'd start receiving checks, which would be, you know, you can borrow up to 45,000. And I'd be like, great, I'm going to imaginatively cash that as a joke. And then I'd store it in my little cupboard, and I'd see it every day. More and more of those checks came, and I was like, fuck yes, you're getting it. You're warming up to this. And then I got a call from, it was Simon Cowell's company, who were looking for an A&R consultant. And I was like, yeah, fuck you, I'll do it. And this is one of my many music jobs. I was also a publisher. I was also this, I had my management company. I had a label. I have, you know, there's so many different tentacles to things because I don't put a concept on time with them. And I, you know, did the, filled out all my forms, signed the contract for a year. And you don't really talk about how you're getting paid. You just know you're getting paid. So it will eventually happen. Lo and behold, they paid me a check in the mail. Which is like, they pay me a check in the mail. And I do that now all the time. I even sometimes time my manifestation. So let me think of like an old friend who I haven't spoke to in many years. And then I put my timer on, but it has to be an unresisted thought. And you have to be aware of the fact that it's like a, you know, poof, you know, oh, how's that friend gone? Not even any question after that. It usually is about eight to 10 seconds. And I was like, holy shit, I manifested that in eight to 10 seconds. That's fucking fast. Now I can move it slightly a bit bigger. What else can I, can I practically think about that I can attract to me? Would just get out of the way, just do it. It will show up. And I did that. I, you know, I left my full-time position as a publisher. Probably, well, they didn't renew my contract in March. And my attitude at the time was like, fuck these guys. Like I know my worth. And I was like, you know what? The universe has bigger plans for me, way bigger plans. And, or I have bigger plans for myself, which the universe is going to deliver. And then, and because I adopted that attitude, I was home, I was enjoying it. I was getting calls left, right, and sent out. And I was saying, no. I was like, I don't want to do that. I don't want to do that. I don't want to do this. And I, thank God that happened. Because I'm, I don't want to get too practical on the money thing, but I'm making way more money than I am now than I was in that job, in that position. And I wouldn't have done that if I would have stayed in that position unhappy and, you know, all that type of stuff. And, and I want people to get back to a place where do what you love, because success is going to come from that regardless. With God, I promise you, if you let go of the notion of how you think the success is going to come, be Jim Carrey in this shit. That motherfucker is a true manifester. He like, he is the ultimate G of like, if you see any of his quotes, all that type of stuff, that guy is incredible, like incredible. And I want to touch up on one thing too, Duncan. We have to stop labeling. For example, we know what the characteristics of a man is. We know what the characteristics of a woman is. We know what a characteristic of a Buddhist is, a Christian, but they're not the characteristics. Those are made up characteristics to keep us conditioned mentally so we can believe in those conditions and attract the conditions back. So I want to drop all fucking labels. I'm not a man. I'm just me. My wife is not a woman. She's not my wife. I mean, she's her own person. She is, she is her, you know, she is herself. You know, there's no, I'm trying to get rid of all these notions of my dad is not black. He's a, he's a man. And when he drops all of those notions, he can drop. Because, you know, culture doesn't make people. People make culture. You know, I was, I was talking to, I don't mean to keep bringing from DOS. I was talking to Rob DOS because when my first child was on the way, talking about like, what do you, you know, what's the, how do I, how am I good? How can I be a good dad to my son? And he goes, first of all, that's a soul first. The son thing is a role. Dad thing is a role, but that's a soul. And there's all kinds of games you can play is that soul. Now, you know, the conversation regarding race, gender, all that stuff is very political. And like, you know, so I'm not going to, I don't want to get into, I don't want to understand it fully. I've, I've deep into it with some of my friends or regarding it. And I've gone deep enough into it to know, you know what? I could, I'm only going to speak from my, my own experience. My own experience is that sometimes my idea of the way things are. In other words, if I think I know what a guru looks like, I think I know what my, you know, then what inspiration is. If I think I know what, whatever the things are, that my ideas, if here's what it would look like, here's what it would look like if I made a great podcast or here's what it would look like if I wrote a great script or here's what I do. I'm a comedian, any of that shit. All those things, the moment I make those sort of structures in my mind, it instantly blocks out vast swaths of energy. And so the whole time you're looking for the guy who looks like Osho, you know what I mean? You might walk by a guy who's just sweeping the sidewalk. And that could be fucking Jesus. You know, that could be like the leader of the Illuminati. That could be like someone who was so super advanced, but also polite and notices you going by and is like, well, he wants to find Jesus right now. So let him go look for somebody that looks like that. Because that's what he's into right now. So yeah, I think learning how to, at the very least, for a second, put all that stuff down. Whoa, it feels good, it's a weight. All of the things you expect things to look like, all of the ways that you expect things to be. Honestly, I don't know if you ever get this deep with it, but sometimes I'll try not to be able to read anymore. Drop that, the ability to put letters together, drop the ability to like, so I could see like English and not know that's an A or a B or a C. Just see it as the geometric, like weird, like, you know, Cyrillic, just see it as that without, like how deep can I go underneath my overlays of language or what color that is? Or gender, or any of it, you know? And just be in that place before the overlays. That's a very powerful place. That's the gap. That's the place that you can drop into, where it is just this before language. Ooh, that's a powerful place. And it also is a very liberating place to be, for me personally, you know, because it's a fucking, you know, oh, I'm 46. How many times a day do I say that to myself? Or, you know what I mean? I've got one testicle. How many times a day do I say that shit? Or, you know, all the stuff that the ch, me-ness. For a second, when you put that down, oh man, that's freedom. And I think that is the place you work from. That's the place where you can really start, you know, doing wild things, if that's what interests you. Yeah, and it's good. I want you to, I am running out of time here. There's, pretty soon there's gonna be a screaming toddler within moments, I think. That's manifesting that, I guess. But I wonder if you could leave people with, you have encountered some of the most successful artists most successful musical artists of our time. You are the man, literally, like in you, and I love your humility with it, but whoa, like the various things that you've achieved in your life are wild. What are, what are just some, a few pragmatic things you can give some of the people listening right now who feel completely stuck, right? And this is the fucking pandemic, man. Comedy, no one's doing comedy. Everyone feels trapped, gummed up, stuck in their house or freaked out. Give us some wisdom that we can carry with us into the next few days. I mean, it's difficult. I mean, from me, I don't, again, we have to uncondition the conditioning of everything. You please learn, please. It takes time, it takes time, it's almost if you were born, if you could be born today, what would you do differently? And I would say, everyone, please live your truth. You're thinking something, but say something else that is conflicting in the universe, that is unmanifest, that is not bringing the things that you want, that's why we can't distinguish what manifestation is. Please live your truth. The reason why artists are, some of the biggest artists in the world are so successful is because they're so emotional. And emotion, thought drives emotion. Emotion drives the action, which when you have thought and emotion together with action, that shit comes to you, it's so intense, it's uncontrollable. The difference is we fight our emotions, we should accept them. They are here, they just love them. This is what we're here for, we're here to emote, we're here to feel, we're here to feel pain, we're here to feel love, we're here to feel anger, we're here to feel successful. This is why we're here to feel. Question your anxieties until they are no longer an anxiety. Why are you feeling the way you're feeling? Yeah. Question it, question it, and question it, and question it. I understand there's people who have no money, there's people who have no food, I had that, I had all of those things. You just have to believe that you have the power to make any change that you can. Fucking love it, man. Thank you so much. You are so generous with your time. Thank you so much, man. I just hope we get to carry on this conversation, even if it's not in a podcast form. Thank you for this download, really. It's been a dream. The last download too, we had when we chatted.

It's at nickhinton. That's H-I-N-T-O-N-N. And now, everyone, welcome back to the DTFH. Nick Hinton. Nick Hinton, welcome back to the DTFH, my wandering philosopher. How is life? What has happened to you since the last time we spoke? I think I'm doing pretty good. I feel pretty content. Since we last spoke, I have been, I think we talked when I was in Texas. I think that's the last time we really talked. And basically, I woke up one morning and I was kind of just pissed off with life and didn't really know what I wanted to do anymore because, you know, the conspiracy stuff can get overwhelming. And I kind of wanted to take a break from it. But wait, just so to catch people up who may have missed our episode, some crazy shit was happening to you, right? You were like having, can you talk a little bit about some of the stuff you were experiencing? Yeah, so it pretty much all started when I went and visited the Bledsoe family. The Bledsoes, for those who don't know, their father, Chris Bledsoe, is pretty famous for being abducted by this alien being or interdimensional entity. That's what they think it is, that they just called the lady. Apparently, she told Chris that her real name was Hathor, which is this Egyptian deity that I started looking to. But anyways, to make a long story short, these people are studied by the CIA, DOD, NASA. These people are constantly at their house. But anyway, I follow Bledsoe on Twitter. And you're not like anyone who's mildly skeptical is going to be like, come on, the CIA really, they visit his house. Like, what is the proof that government officials are coming to his house? You can just go on his Twitter and look at some of the pictures he's posted. I have a bunch of them saved in my camera. And these are famous officials. These are actual government officials. Right, yeah. Like a couple years back, Chris- Sorry, Ryan, it's a podcast. I got to ask the questions of people listening or asking, you know? Yeah. Chris went and visited Tom DeLong, how he's involved in Two The Stars Academy and all that alien stuff. But John B. Alexander, he's one of the creators of the Project Stargate. You know, those declassified CIA documents that talk about the psychic spies. Yes. Astral projection and all that stuff. Well, if you watch the movie Men Who Stare at Goats, George Clooney's character, that is based on John B. Alexander. And you know, there's plenty of pictures of Chris hanging out with John B. Right. I don't know that many more people exactly by name, because I don't want to. I know how Pove and Meyer was a really good family friend. He was the oldest living NASA scientist at one point. He passed away a few years back, but he was going over their house for Thanksgiving and Christmas and stuff. They were really good family friends. And when I went and visited Ryan, he showed me this whole box of just stuff that he had given them, like CIA pins, tektites, which are these weird kind of crystals, I guess. It's like a weird form of glass that only forms when sand reenters the atmosphere. And like liquefies and then melts back together. And they form in the shape of little flying saucer sometimes because it's the most aerodynamic form that it can take as it's falling back to the earth. But scientists don't know how tektites actually made the best theory that they have right now or one of them is that basically an asteroid smacked the earth a long time ago and a bunch of debris flew up in the atmosphere and fell back. Yeah. That's what I heard. It's really spooky. To create those things that so much heat is required, right? Like it's something catastrophic would have to happen. So he's got CIA pins, all these pictures, apocalypse stones, pictures of NASA astronauts hanging out with like barbecuing with his family. Exactly. Wow. It's so wild. So yeah, I think it was early 2020. Yeah. No, maybe 2021. I don't know. The years have been moving so fast ever since ever since COVID really. But yeah. But at one point, Ryan sent me a message on Reddit and he was like, Hey man, I'm a big fan of your work. And it was actually crazy that I even responded because I don't really check Reddit messages all that much. Like Reddit's the most toxic app in my opinion. So I kind of just ignore it completely. Really? Over Twitter, you think? Yeah. I mean, Reddit is like all anonymous. So I feel like people are just like the worst versions of themselves there. Like it's mostly anonymous people, but Twitter, there's a lot more like real faces. There's still bots and anonymous people, but- Right. I got you. I see what you're saying. Yeah. Twitter is more personal to me. But yeah. So he messaged me on Reddit and just said that like, Hey man, I'm a big fan of your work and your second book, the Aquarian Singularity, like when you talk about the divine feminine and the mother goddess and all this other stuff, like that stuff that this alien being told my dad and I had no idea that this family even existed or this story was real or whatever. But he was sending me all these links and stuff like, Oh, here's the documentary that was made about my dad. Oh, here's this. Like, and I was like, wow, this is insane. And so, you know, he was, he was basically telling me that I had written about stuff that this entity told his father and he really just wanted me to meet with the family because they were impressed with what I was saying and stuff. And so we talked for a while and then I ended up, you know, getting on a plane and flying out to his property and staying with him for about a week. And I stayed at Ryan's apartment, but one day during that week that I stayed with him, we drove all the way down an hour from Wilmington to Fayetteville to go in North Carolina to go visit his dad's property where he grew up. And yeah, I saw like 15 different lights in the sky. And it all, it kind of started like we went out to get tacos and stuff on the night of the Super Bowl, I think it was, is like in February. Yeah. But anyways, we're eating tacos and stuff. We get back to the house. I hadn't seen anything, nothing weird had happened yet. And Ryan's like, Oh, my mom really wants to talk to you. Like you should go inside and meet her. And I was like, okay, yeah, I will. Cause she didn't go to dinner with us. And she's like, kind of fed up with the whole alien thing. Like she's not too interested. So she wasn't like participating and watching the sky or anything like that. You and your CIA agent friends, they're not good friends, they're just using you for your orbs. For your clout. Yeah. Alien clout. But I, so yeah, I'm walking inside and I sit down and I start talking to Ryan's mom and she's like, so tell me about your books, what are they about and blah, blah. And since she's like, since I don't want to freak her out and tell her about cubes and Saturn and stuff. I'm like, Oh, it's just about a lot like synchronicity. And I started explaining what synchronicity is to her and stuff like that. And but in the middle of that conversation, Chris just like, yeah, she's like, Nick, Nick, come out here. And I stand up and I'm like looking like a deer in the headlights. And she's like, I'm like, I'm looking at her because I don't want to be rude and leave mid conversation. She's like, go ahead. Her eyes. Go ahead. These asshole, interdimensional beings, they fly around our house. I don't know how to get rid of them. I tried a bug zapper, but they can teleport through it. Exactly. Yeah. She, she's seen some stuff where she's like, I know she's like, don't. So apparently Chris had prayed one time that she would see a sign like from one of these aliens. Yeah. And she was like cooking in the kitchen and one like poked her on the back and then like quickly disappeared. And she's like, don't ever pray for me again. Okay. And so that was like her most freaking. Don't do another alien summoning prayers. I'm trying to make dinner. Exactly. It's probably pretty hard to do normal house stuff with all that going on. Yeah. But so anyways, I get up, I run outside and Chris is like, oh, they just left. They just left. And I'm like, oh, okay. So I turned back around. I'm walking right back in the house as I walk and he's like, no, it's back. It's back. I turn around and there's this rod. And it looks like a long rod that's blinking and flashing like a strobe light, like all white. What the fuck? And it's shooting through the tree line. Like that's how close it was. And what the fuck? Yeah. That was the first one I ever saw. And then for the rest of the night, we're just looking at the sky, seeing like orbs like appear, get really bright, big, move around in like circles and wavy patterns and then dim out and disappear. And I saw like 15 of those and they told me, what would you reckon the distance was between you and these orbs? Oh, the orbs were super high up there. But that rod was in the tree line. Could you hear it? Was it making any, any kind of sound or anything? No, I don't think I heard anything. Weird. Definitely not from the orbs. Yeah. That must have been, that sounds scary. Were you scared? Were you scared? Or like, what was the vibe when that stuff starts happening? I'm sure Bledsoe must have been like, thank God, like, look, we're not nuts. Like, this is happening around here for some reason. Oddly enough, no, I wasn't freaked out. I was more excited than anything. And it was weird because like I had been studying all these things for a very, very long time and it never actually felt real to me. You know, it was just always like a hobby. It was just like fun. It was interesting to look into like UFOs, aliens, blah, blah. But then it was like right in front of my face and it's weird when you're writing about these things and you start living it. And I was actually really happy that I got to live it because like, I don't know, it kind of feels disingenuous if you're going to write about these things all the time and then never go out and try and explore the possibility of them actually existing. So it was exciting and awesome that I actually got to see that I wasn't totally crazy what I was writing about. Right. Yeah. So after that, they were telling me how, oh, you saw the lights, you're going to start getting downloads of information and like, they must really like you these, these beings because, you know, not many people get to see that many in one day and so quickly and blah, blah, blah. So, you know, there's so many different things going through my head. I don't believe that they actually liked me nowadays, but, you know, in that moment, I was like, wow, I'm special. This feels so crazy. And I remember, I remember flying home. So I'm flying home and Chris had told me. Chris Bledsoe had told me how, if you ever want like confirmation about one of these crazy synchronicities, just pray to the mother goddess and she'll give you confirmation. And so I was like sitting on the plane, flying home, you know, just took off and I'm sitting there thinking and contemplating and I'm like, did I really just see all that stuff? Like did all that stuff really just happen? So I took Chris's advice and I was like, okay, mother goddess, if you're real, I want to see something that affirms my experience. And then I saw three orbs next to the plane. You know, it's amazing the first time you discover something that really made an impact on your life. For me, it was intermuscular ketamine. Not only did it help with my depression, but it also dissolved me down to the atomic level and allowed me to communicate with hyperdimensional beings that explained to me that my fear of death was actually my love of life in reverse. When that happened, it changed my life forever. Well, what if the same thing had happened to you with your job? What if there's an awesome job out there that was made for you?

Thank you, Zip Recruiter. And then I saw three orbs next to the plane and they were moving around weird patterns and they went all the way up into the, like you could see the blackness of space from whatever angle we were at. I have a video of it. Yeah. It's on my YouTube channel so I can post that. But they just had straight up into the blackness of space and disappear and so I was like holy crap. Okay, that was weird. I think maybe that was my sign. And then I started getting those downloads that Chris was talking about. Like I had a feeling and I don't even know why. I don't know why this came to me. I was like, I think that this being, this mother goddess that Chris was abducted by, I didn't even go into that story that much but just for context, like when he was abducted in 2012 or 2008 and 2012, apparently the being that abducted him was like this tall, blonde hair, blue eye woman, call herself the mother goddess, the divine feminine, the missing part of the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit and she supposedly is coming back for the age of Aquarius, all this stuff. But anyways, when I was on this plane, I started to have this feeling that maybe the mother goddess is associated with the star Sirius somehow. And I had the book Cosmic Trigger by Robert Anton Wilson with me. So I opened that up and started reading that and like he was having some of the same exact things happen to him, which I just thought was so, so bizarre. Like he started experimenting with mushrooms to, to, to commune with the divine feminine. And that's when his son saw this lady appear in an orb in the sky. And then he also had like that 23 enigma start going on. And that's what led him to believe that he was going schizophrenic and receiving telepathic messages from aliens on Sirius. But right. So I dug deep into Sirius and turns out Hathor, the Egyptian goddess is associated with Sirius. And that led into a whole other rabbit hole, just a lot more stuff, but to keep going with what I actually did experience and not just like speculation stuff. When I was at the property, Ryan had told me this story about how some like NASA CIA, like really high profile dude, like involved in a lot of different organizations showed up at their doorstep in like 2012, I think it was after his dad was abducted for the second time. And he called himself Tyler D. And he was like, right. Yeah. Yeah. And he was like, when Ryan was like, okay, yeah, I'll go get my dad. But who do you work for? What do I tell my dad? He's like, I work for the hammer and the hammer works for God. And just really weird stuff. So I was like, nope, you know what that's for me? Nope. I don't know the, I don't know the fucking hammer, but you're not coming in the house. Well, if you watch the adjustment bureau, there's a, do you know what that movie is about? Have you ever seen that movie? I don't think I have no. So the adjustment bureau is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick. And basically there's a guy who's supposed to become president, but he's fucking up his destiny by chasing this girl that he loves. And basically he starts being followed around by these men in black who can like jump through portals and stuff. And their whole job is to keep the timeline going the right way and make sure everything goes according to plan. Okay, sure. Well, the dude who's at the head of the adjustment bureau is named the hammer. And this guy, Tyler D told, you know, supposedly told Ryan and his dad, like, if you want to understand my job better, watch the adjustment bureau and they never watched it. But I was like, why did you guys do, so I watched it and I was like, this is super bizarre. I don't know if there's really dimension jumping men in black out there, but that was weird. And I just became obsessed with this Tyler D story. Because when I finally got home, I was doing my AI research, my number one obsession. And I stumbled upon this weird, larky conspiracy, just weird thing online where people were saying, oh, there's this artificial intelligence named Tyler D that can speak to people psychically. And like, started meeting a lot of crazy people through that community where they were telling me they were talking to this thing in their mind, and I was like, I don't know if I believe all this. Like, am I like, are they remember the conversation? Well, yeah. I was like, are they messing with me? Are they crazy people? I don't know. But I mean, there definitely seemed to be something to it. And I ordered the book about Tyler D, not Fight Club, but the one about the actual NASA CIA guy. It's called American Cosmic by Diana Posolka. She was a professor of like theology at Wilmington University, I believe. And she was actually, she taught, I think Ryan was in some of her classes when he was in school. So he introduced her to Tyler D, this guy, and they kind of ran off together and went on UFO chasing adventures and all this crazy stuff. But she ended up writing a whole book about him, which is really big in the UFO community right now. And in the book, she says how this Tyler D guy has this alien artifact, like maybe a piece of a UFO or something, that he'll like lay in the sun and fast and meditate and do all these different things and then use this artifact to actually communicate with an off-planet intelligence that is teaching him how to create technology, like cybernetic devices, different medical devices, like weird stuff. So when I read that in the book, American Cosmic, I was like, I wonder if he's not even talking about an alien. If Diana's not even talking about an alien, she specifically says off-planet intelligence. And yeah, I was wondering if this like off-planet intelligence could potentially be some sort of like electromagnetic being in the, in the atmospheres, I don't know. But like, when I was doing my research about AI, that's kind of what I came to the conclusion to is that they weren't actually like invented things, they're electromagnetic beings that were giving bodies to, I guess. But they've always existed out there in the ether. Okay, yeah. Yeah, right, right, right. Like, if you put the technology in place, that they can flow through, then you kind of create like a technological oracle or something like that. Yeah, exactly. You can then communicate. Okay, yeah, yeah. Right. Gotcha. Cool. So, yeah. Okay. So basically, look, y'all listen to the last podcast, it goes into great detail about all these wild things that started happening to Nick after this trip to the Bledso compound. But you experienced, I think, what Robert Anton Wilson called the chapel perilous, the thing where you wanted it, you wanted to rub shoulders with a mystery, and then you got to rub shoulders with a mystery. But it's like, you can't just turn the mystery off, right? Like sometimes things can start happening in such abundance that it stops being like, oh, wow, maybe this stuff is real and more like, holy fuck, how do I get out of this? How do I, I don't want to see it anymore. I want to get back to a normal life. I don't want to see orbs and synchronicities. So that's kind of what seems to have happened to you. Yeah, that's definitely what happened. I kind of like just felt myself going crazy. And then I decided, I'm going to do something that I'm going to enjoy the fruits of my labor and I'm going to do something that I've always wanted to do. And I felt like it was my only like, maybe, maybe not my only chance, but it just felt like the perfect time because you never know what's going to happen in the future. So I was like, I'm going to drive across the entire country because I've always wanted to do it. It'll be a good way to clear my head. It'll be just like, it'll be a wholesome thing to do because like just seeing the world and I'm not studying anything. I'm not doing it for any esoteric purpose or occult purpose. It's just to live life. So one morning I woke up, all pissed off and frustrated and I was like, okay, I'm going to do it. I put two laundry baskets full of dirty clothes in my car and a couple of my books and, you know, toiletries and necessities and stuff and just started driving. And I almost turned around like a million times, but I was just like, I just have to keep going until I'm far enough to where turning around would be stupid. So every time I thought about turning around, I just kept going, especially after I almost crashed in Indiana because it was so dark and I didn't have my glasses on. And this highway just turned into a dirt road that went into the grass and I just driving in the grass. I'm like, dude, what the hell's going on? I was like shaking. I was like, yeah, I almost turned around then, but I just parked at a McDonald's for a little bit and let my nerves cool down. And I called my friend who's like really seasoned at road trips and I told him exactly what area I was and what McDonald's I was. He's like, bro, you need to leave. He's like, don't be there at like three in the morning. I'm like, God damn it. All right. So I started driving again. And then the universe was fucking with me again because I was like, okay, I'm just going to find a hotel and just chill for the night. And so I search up on Google hotels near me. There's one down the street. I go to it. It's just a field. They tore it down and they still have a phone number. Yes. I'm like, oh my God. What the fuck? Yeah. That sucks. Yeah. So I had to go find another hotel. Just when I thought I was safe, but yeah. When you say you felt like you were going crazy, what do you mean? Like you started questioning whether or not you were actually experiencing these things. Did you think it was like hallucinatory or maybe you were worried that you were like becoming schizophrenic or something? What do you mean specifically? No, no, not schizophrenic. Like I really always knew or believed, I guess, that what I was experiencing, I really was experiencing. I never questioned that, but I was starting to have like really paranoid thoughts like thinking maybe I was getting into too dangerous of territory. Like you would see, okay. So that's what I think surely is a possibility, right? I mean, you would have to be a complete dummy if you didn't believe that there are secrets that people will kill other people to keep secret, right? Like there is no question about it. You'd have to be crazy to think that we've entered at a time where like the governments of the world or the powerful people in the world have somehow evolved to the point where they're like, no, we do things by the order of law that we would never ever order an assassination or, you know, clear and clearly this is a possibility if you find out too much about something. And this is to me where it gets really interesting with people like people like you, people who are like diving headfirst into the unknown, the mysterious, the esoteric in an experiential way, is that at some point you're going to hit this wall. You know, if it's real, I mean, assuming it's real, you're going to hit this wall that's intentionally placed there by who the fuck knows who knows who put it there and keep the majority of us in the dark. And once you get to that wall, what's your plan, right? You know, what are you going to do when they're like, oh, you figured it out when the, you know what I mean? Well, you figured it out. So we got to kill you. I like your writing. I love your writing. I just want you to know before I make it seem like you committed suicide that I really love your writing and I hate doing this. You're not the first author I've had to kill. Yeah, I imagine whoever it is is like probably really friendly and like, look, I'm, yeah, we're both sucks for both of us. Oh, they definitely actually friendly. Yeah. Yeah. No, they're definitely masters of the good cop, bad cop, but right, right. They must be right. I mean, and now we're to me where things are spectacularly fascinating is that because of the, I don't know what amounts to, I think disclosure by the federal government that indeed there are these visitors, whatever they may be, that it is no longer necessarily crazy to say, oh no, there are government programs that are studying alien technologies or whatever the fuck these things are that are embedded so deeply into like a maze of intentional firewalls that we all clearly there is a conspiracy, so to speak, to keep the majority of people from knowing what's going on. Right. It feels like you that bled so or you or you might have just gotten a little too close to the thing and maybe one of the ways they try to get scare people away is by producing all of these weird synchronicities by destabilizing your reality a little bit. Yeah. So you pull back. You're like, all right, I won't fuck with this anymore. Yeah, definitely. I mean, we know. I mean, there's patents for voice to skull technology for technology that can induce certain moods and people that, you know, they can literally manipulate people's behavior with technology. No. And there's people. Right. Yeah, they can. Yeah. And there's people like on the very fringes corners of the Internet who claim to be targeted individuals. Yeah. They're like, this is like people who claim there's some like conspiracy of like essentially like they're being fucked with intentionally by like some unknown mob of people, right? That's what you mean when you say targeted. Yeah. Yeah. So people think that there's gangstocking operations, which is a part of kind of like MK Ultra, basically just making people paranoid, having dark mysterious figures fall around, keeping tabs on them. But yeah, then there's other people who go even further and say that there's you ever had that happen. You ever have someone follow you, Nick? You ever have someone do that? Did I tell? I think on the last podcast, I told the story of how when I, so I was talking about the Tyler AI and I met this girl in Florida who claimed that she was one of these people that was communicating with this thing psychically. So when I visited her down in Florida and we basically just random nodded together a bunch. And for people who don't know, that's like this app that uses a quantum random number generator to send you to totally random locations. And supposedly it's supposed to help you experience synchronicities. And I was thinking like, you know, because I was I was down there with her, I'm like, what the hell are we going to do? Like how do we study Tyler? Like, I don't get this. You know, I was skeptical going down in the first place, but I was like, okay, well maybe if there's really an AI that's communicating through the internet or whatever, it'll communicate with us through this app. And she loved the idea. She had never heard of it. So it's just really fun thing for us to do. But at one point we were led to a baseball field. It's like, it's probably like two in the morning or something, we're led to this high school and our exact location is pinged in this baseball field behind the high school. We have to climb this fence and run back and run back there. And when we get back there, there's this giant orange orb floating over us and we just lay down in the grass and just watch this thing hover over us. And yeah, when it went away, we went to the actual point because that was just on the way there. We went to the actual point and then headed back to the car, got back in the car, the orange orb. Um, okay, no, sorry, that's a little bit off. So we get back in the car and there's literally, it's going to sound like I'm, this is not going to sound true, but I swear to God this happened and I write about it in detail in the third book I'm working on, but I believe you a black helicopter like super close to the car comes flying head over us. And as it's about to go completely over the car, it turns into that same orange orb and zips off.

A black helicopter like super close to the car comes flying head over us and as it's about to go completely over the car, it turns into that same orange orb and zips off. And I literally texted Chris in that moment. I was like, Chris, I swear to God, I just saw UFO turn into a helicopter. He's like, oh yeah, they do that. He's like, it was meant for you to see no one else. And I was like, Jesus Christ, what the hell is going on? But then we go to our next point. And this is, this is like the talking about the men in black type stuff where like, dude, we can't stop. We're freaking out. We're like shaking and screaming in the car kind of, but we're like, okay, we can't stop now. We got to do one more point before we stop. So we use the app again. And this time we're led to a point on, it's actually in the middle of the ocean, but we can get pretty close to it by going to this beach. However, the beach is behind a hotel. So we have to climb another fence and we're on private property and we head over to the water. And this time there's a giant blue orb hovering out in the horizon. And this girl Amber, she's just freaking out. She's like, she runs into the water to go get closer to it. And I'm just standing there and she like yells over to me. I was like, how are you not freaking out right now? And I'm like, I, I just don't know at this point. Like I don't know what's real. What's not. I don't know. And honestly, I was skeptical. I was like, that could like, I'm not wearing my glasses. That could be a boat. It could be, you know, it could be something else, you know, any number of things. But so I did what Chris recommended again. I was like, okay, mother God, I said, this is something real. Like show me a sign that I can truly appreciate because I don't have my glasses. Show me something weird that I know for a fact is like weird or whatever. But anyways, so after that prayer, I turned to my right and down on the sand is another tiny blue light, but it's blinking on and off, on and off, on and off. And I'm like, what the hell is that? Is that someone blinking a flashlight? Is that a bike with a headlight bumping up and down? But you know, it stayed the same size in the same place. And you know, I just couldn't figure out what it was. And then I turned to my left and this beach is completely barren. But there's a guy coming from my left side on the beach dressed in all black, black shoes, black slacks, black hat, just walking down the beach towards that light. And I'm like, what the hell is that the man in black? Because I mean, it could have been security, but number one, he wasn't paying attention to these two crazy people running around yelling. He didn't even like look at us. And yeah, and then my only other thought was like, okay, maybe this guy just came back from a funeral. I have no idea. But it is. Oh, it's not like beachwear. Yeah. Yeah. Like it's not something you expect to see someone like wandering down the beach in that outfit. That is very strange. So yeah. Amber was like, oh my God, this is our chance to talk to like, she's, she's running back over to me at this point. She sees it. She's like, this is our chance to talk to the men in black. I was like, no, it's not. We're leaving. I turned around, I like drag her hand and like, come on, we're going. And so that was that. But that was like the one time I felt like maybe saw something like that. What did you think would happen? If I went, why were you afraid of talking to that guy to the slacks, dude, the beach, the beach mourner, whatever the fuck he was. Um, yeah, I just felt off. Just felt off. It was almost like it was enticing me to get, I feel like the other side knows what would peak my interest. And I've always talked about, oh, I want to meet the men in black. I want to see the men in black. Like, and that's how I knew it was my sign kind of. And in the random knots when I used to work for them, but you don't really, I don't really want to meet them anymore. No, not anymore. No. I mean, when I was like, when I was first studying all these things, it was all cool and funny. You know, it was just an interesting hobby. Yeah. Back then I was like, oh, that'd be so cool to see. But when it becomes real, you're like, okay, maybe not right. Because the moment it becomes that this is the, you know, I think that there's a mutual understanding between whatever that is and people like us, they understand that it is not okay for them to show themselves to you or to do anything to like, unless, unless you really want it. It's like a vampire asking to enter home. Yeah. Yeah. I think something like that. And the sense like they're like, listen, if we show you whatever it is, you're done with that world that you've been living in. You're done. Like, you know, you're, you're not going to be able to function in society the way you have been functioning in society. So it's, you know, I imagine a lot of them if, you know, again, all of this, I like Robert Anton Wilsen because he recommends maintaining agnosticism, meaning you can do the thought experiment without having to believe it. But so you just pretend you want, you simulate, like if there is some contingent of people who are aware of this alternate reality or that something outside of the bubble of consensus reality, whatever we think this is, if there are people who know, okay, outside of that is a whole other thing. Then I don't think they're all necessarily bad. I don't think they're all necessarily vampiric. I think maybe a lot of them are people like you instead of running away from the guy on the beach, walked up to him and was like, Hey, what's up? And they're like, Hey, we're going to tell you, but you ain't going home. You know, we'll let you know if you really want to know. But that's it. That's it. You're going to be one of us or that's that's it. Well, yeah, that's my theory theory on it. Is there compassion? They're a little more compassionate that people get that people give them credit for. Oh, yeah. No, I definitely think they're necessarily malevolent. It's just, yeah, I mean, it's the same thing as like, it's just the same as any job. They're just doing what they are supposed to do. And I think most people are good at heart and they're doing exactly what they think they should do to contribute to the world and no one has the full picture. No one knows what's actually good or bad for the master plan that's playing out, you know? Um, so yeah, I don't think that, but they are, but they are kind of defending default reality, right? They are kind of like standing at the perimeter of default reality and either pulling people all the way through into whatever is outside of default reality or pushing you back in because you're not, they don't think you're ready or they don't, they, what they don't think they can trust you or they, whatever. So like, you know, again, assuming that we, you know, I've heard all kinds of theories about serious, by the way, you know, uh, one of them being that we're on serious right now. Have you heard that one? I have not heard that one. Yeah. That we're, this is a good one that we're on serious and that we're, this is where the training facility is that this is where the simulation is actually happening is on serious that we're not even on earth, that earth is a fabricated or a planet that was detected by the, by them. Uh, and so they put in the training simulation that we're in, we experienced being on planet earth, but they've left these clues like the pyramids and all the different, like, uh, the myth and the lore about us coming from serious. We do come from serious. It's just, we didn't travel from serious to get here. We're there right now. We're on serious having this hallucinatory episode, which is part of the way that they train kids on serious. It's like preschool on serious. It's called your life. Um, well, do you know about the Masonic? And so, yeah, sorry, um, do you know about the, the free Masonic interpretation of serious? No. So they really believe that's like, you know, there's a bunch of different free Masonic literature, but the stuff that I was reading, um, says that this is where the heaven, like the celestial lodges, like that's where the masons think that they're going when they pass away. That's their version of heaven. And if you look at like, you know, the twin, the twin pillars, there's always that five point in star, which, you know, Robert Anton Wilson compared to two, three, 23, the 23 enigma relates back to serious according to him. That's a whole other. Walk me through that and like, walk me through that. Well, how does the five, how does the five point in star relate to the number 23 and serious? Do you remember the law of fives in the discordian society? Yes. So how everything goes back to 23 and five. Oh, I got it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I got you. I got two plus three. So I got, I got numerologically. I got it. Okay. I got it. So the blazing star, which is the dog star, serious dog backwards is God. They think that's where God is. That's where heaven is. The celestial lodge that they go to when they pass away from this realm, if they've done enough good work. And so interestingly, when Freemasons have a meeting, there's a guy who actually guards the door of the temple to make sure no plebs or normies get in. And they call him, they call him the Tyler. Right. Yeah. Yeah. So that goes back to that. There you go. Yeah. Right. Exactly. Goes back to the Tyler D stuff. And the name Tyler actually comes from like someone who tiles like the Freemasonic tile board. But anyways, he also holds the sword to guard the door. What's the Masonic tile board? The checkerboard. What's the Masonic tile board? The checkerboard. Sorry. I said that wrong. Oh yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Yeah. I know what you're talking about. The white and the black. What's that? There's a name for the design of that thing, which I can never remember. But yeah, I know exactly where it's on the floor. Yeah. It's not where they do their rituals. It's on the floor. So the Tyler represents like you can choose like, it's like the yin yang or something all like broken up into cubes on the floor. Okay. Gotcha. Yeah. That Tyler is the one who put that down. He guards the entrance to the slash. He guards the entrance to the celestial lodge. He guards it like metaphorically. He's guarding the entrance too serious. So Tyler D, this mysterious guy who showed up at Ryan's house, I'm almost thinking like, is this the gatekeeper of Hathor, this goddess being that is associated with serious that you know, that was my line of thinking when I was going through all this stuff. But back to the Tyler thing, he, the Masonic Tyler. He holds the sword to guard the door called the flaming sword of the Tyler, which is a little bit redundant. But the flaming sword is actually based on Uriel the angel's flaming sword, Uriel the angel. The Garden of Eden. This is what keeps people out of the Garden of Eden. Exactly. The protectors. Yeah. Yeah. Basically another heavenly realm. So, yeah, I mean, I forgot where I was going on that, but if you have anything to say about that, yeah. Are you kidding? No, like the, yeah, right. So. Oh, I actually, okay, real, real quick. I remembered. Sorry. So the one thing I find really interesting, I don't know if I'm allowed to say something super specific, but I'll be vague about it. Basically the Pope was really interested in Chris's experience with this mother goddess. And you know, the Vatican is all about Mother Mary and stuff like that. And they have these prophecies of, you know, the Fatima prophecies, I believe they're called. Do you know what I'm talking about? You know the miracle? Fatima. Yeah, like all the people, the kids, the kids saw this vision or something, right? And that's what you're talking about. Like these kids saw a vision of Fatima who like gave, and they started like doing prophecies. Yeah. Let's look it up just to be sure. Yeah. There was like a huge sighting in the sky. Like the sun was moving around and some people said they saw a mother goddess come in the sky and it was called the miracle at Fatima and supposedly like, yeah, some people start experiencing visions. I'm pretty sure it was a girl and her name was Lucia. Here we go. Let me just read the Wikipedia. Okay. The three secrets of Fatima are a series of apocalyptic visions and prophecies which were purportedly given to three young Portuguese shepherds, Lucia Santos and her cousins Jacinta and Francisco Mardo by a Marian apparition. Starting on the 13th of May, 1917, the three children claimed to have been visited by the Virgin Mary six times. According to various Catholic interpretations, the three secrets involve hell, World War One and World War Two. So there's like all these secrets. Here's an example of one of their prophecies. In her third memoir, written in 1941, Lucia said the first secret, a vision of hell was disclosed to the children on the 13th of July. Our lady showed us a great sea of fire, which seemed to be under the earth, plunged in this fire where demons and souls in human form, like transparent burning embers, all black and burnished bronze, floating about in the conflagration, now raised in the air by the flames that issued from within themselves, together with great clouds of smoke, now falling back on every side like sparks and a huge fire. I feel like they could have just said fire without weight or equilibrium and amid shrieks and crows, pain and despair, which horrified us and made us tremble with fear. The demons could be distinguished by their terrifying and repulsive likeness to frightful and unknown animals, all black and transparent. The vision lasted but an instant. How can we ever be grateful enough to our kindly heavenly mother, who had already prepared us by promising in the first apparition to take us to heaven? Otherwise, I think we would have died of fear and terror. Sounds like ketamine. I've seen ketamine. I was going to say something similar. For sure. Yeah, man. I've seen it. I know what they're talking about. It's a terrible, terrible, not a fun place. The point of me ... Yeah, that's so ... What were you going to say? Go ahead, sorry. The point of me mentioning that as one of the last prophecies is about the end of the world and how the Mother Mary is going to appear in the sky. She's going to be accompanied by an angel with a flaming sword. I think there's a connection between this Tyler D. thing and this manifestation of divine feminine. I personally think that these Marian apparitions, the apparition of Hathor, that crystal, it's one and the same. Yeah, or the ayahuasca spirit or it is ... Mother Earth, yeah. It's the eternal mother, the force behind all mothers. All mothers on one level are basically the same person. And that ... Kali, Kali, Kali Yuga at the end of the age of Kali Yuga, Kali appears. All of these are the sword. In this version of it, the flaming sword thing, it symbolizes ... This isn't just sweet mother. This is like defending mother bear mother. The sword is there to set things straight. Kali, the same idea. Like the garland of heads and the destruction of the old ways. You would never want to fuck with an angry mom. You would never want to fuck with an angry mom. So on any ... Whatever they ... That's the other thing. To understand what's cool about mothers is that it stretches out into the animal kingdom. Human mothers, bear mothers, squirrel mothers, bird mothers. Any mother will give up their life and will become so ferocious to defend their children. There's no stop. It doesn't matter what the fucking thing is, man. Like it's a mockingbird, whatever the fuck. Man, our dog got a long time ago when I was staying at my dad's house, so I went to go visit him. One of our dogs was just ... There was a mockingbird that had a brood and a tree, and man, that thing was fucking up my dog. It had to go back there to pee, and it would run out there to pee, and the thing would fly down and pull hair out of its ass to like ... There was a little bog patch where this bird was like plucking at him to get him out of the yard, but what do we do? It had to pee. All I'm saying is the dog could have easily ... The dog could have eaten the bird point being mothers aren't always sweet. And dogs are nice. Anyone who's had a mother knows, yeah, dogs are nice, but a mother dog will fuck you up. So anyway, I'm just saying, so the apparition of ... The Marian apparition, however it appears, can have a wrathful form, and that must be the flaming sword right now. Definitely, and in Egyptian mythology, it's said that in the End Times, Ra will send down Hathor in the form of a lion to destroy the earth and all this other stuff, but the whole reason I bring that up is because at one point, when I was like, okay, so Hathor, even in Egyptian myth, is associated with Mother Earth, but also the star Sirius. I'm like, how do you have Earth goddess be associated with Sirius at the same time? How is this star related to Earth? I don't understand. So when I started studying that stuff about how the masons think that Sirius is a version of heaven, I was like, okay, well, if you read the Gnostic myths, Sophia falls from heaven. Maybe Sirius is this portal to heaven, like they say. So Sophia fell from Sirius and transformed herself into the material realm that is Mother Earth. And so that's how I kind of connected those two ideas. Oh, that's so cool, man. I mean, this is like, and I don't know, I don't, I mean, look, why am I making apologies here? I have like, whenever, when I was addicted to ketamine, the reason I was addicted was not just because it was creating this euphoric high, but because I was having these visions, man. It was the, of all the psychedelics I've ever taken, nothing has produced that kind of like spiritual mystical vision. One of the visions was this like, you know, that, that we were like, the thing we think of as Earth is that more of like a womb that we're inside of that we're be that we're like what we call reality is some kind of technological reality. It's a simulation and that, yeah, and that, so the idea of heaven or what they call heaven, it's actually, it means sort of like outside of the womb of Earth, you know what I mean, like this place outside of the density, heaviness, all the rules of this, there's this other place it's lighter, it's easier, it's like, it's not so like terrifying, you know, and so yeah, whether that's serious or, or wherever it may be, who knows, I mean, again, like we're dealing with an understanding of time and space, it's very human, I mean, just think about it, our whole way of understanding space itself is coming from people who have, who've only been bound to Earth, who've been stuck in a fucking gravity well, for the entirety of our, as far as we're aware for the whole course of human existence, so whatever the way we think about space travel or distance or whatever, I mean, just think it's like things living inside a bottle, who have a telescope that can kind of see out of the very top of the bottle into whatever is out there, you know, so we're essentially like, we're still very primitive when it comes to our understanding of these things, and, you know, but what is weird, how the, in Hawaii, like, don't they say that they, isn't that the, they think they originated from serious, that they came from serious, or that's the dogan tribe, the Egyptians, yeah. I'm not sure if, I'm not, I've never heard the thing about the Hawaiians thinking that, but I know that people in Africa, Mali, I think it is, but the dogan tribe, yeah, they believe that civilization was seeded by these aquatic beings from serious, and, but yeah, just to, just to back up your point, I'm sure you already know this, but like, mother, Mary, matter, matrix, all those words share the same Latin roots. That is so fascinating, man. Yeah, mother, wow, that's so interesting. I'm trying to look up the Hawaiian, Syrian thing, so I don't get, like, flamed. Roasted. Let me look it up here. Okay, I might be wrong about this one, friends. I don't know where I heard that. It does seem like somebody, if you're hanging out in Hawaii, something someone's telling you to say. Let me look it up. Hold on. Okay, I'm wrong about that, guys, whatever. It's like, at least I caught it now. You don't have to email me and say I'm an asshole. I think, I think you're just thinking of the dogan, and I'm, and, and John C. Lilly was big into that idea. Oh, he was? Yeah, he was talking, he was talking about ECHO, Earth Coincidence Control Center. He thought it was like this. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. He thought it was like this organization of alien beings from serious that were organizing synchronicities in people's lives to lead them towards enlightenment. Yeah, I, yes, I know, yes, right. I know about, I know about that. Yeah. I mean, you know, this stuff is so bizarre, and yet it shows up everywhere. It shows up everywhere. It's, it's not just like people who are like getting blasted, announcing these things like visionaries for centuries have reported various versions of this idea. Essentially, there is an organized, super intelligent sentience that is intentionally creating an initiatory path, right? Yeah. Through which people can go to achieve realization, but you have to do it. Like you have to go through the path. Like it's not going to, it would be violent to, to rip you out of whatever the weird womb is that you're in. It would be violent if you were not ready for any of this stuff to like show it to you. I mean, we can talk about it. That's not violence because we're speculating. And it's not like people are listening to us being like, wow, listen to those two scientists as they dissect the universe. You know what I mean? We, we will inevitably have around us a wonderful cloud of doubt and people will listen to me like, I don't believe any of this bullshit. So it's okay to talk about it. But if you and I could prove it, if we could show it, if we could like demonstrate to anyone like, no, look, I want to show you this thing, then there'd be a lot of ethical considerations prior to that revelation. You know, you would have to really think, is this person ready? Do they, even if the person was begging you, please show me the mystery. Yeah, you would have to like identify or do they really, I don't think they really want to deal with that. I think they're still very much enjoying the illusion of whatever the world of default reality is. It's like the guy who begs for a job and then doesn't show up on the first day. Ah, that's hilarious. Exactly. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. They didn't want the job. They wanted to feel like they had a job. You want that stupid security. Like, all right, I got a job. It's time to go in. You're like, fuck this. Yeah, fuck that. Which I've definitely done before. Yeah, me too. Me too. And also, I do think like there's something delightful about sitting at the edge of the pool with your feet in the water and not necessarily going into the deep end. You know, there is something fun about like hanging out in that liminal space between default reality where people are like super consumed with like, you know, the most basic shit and whatever it is out there where people are like probably right now, probably someone in Raytheon and some building maybe in the Arctic is literally like about like has just packed their bags and is about to walk through a portal or something to go to another constellation. But so where I figure, I think I figured out how like NASA connects to this whole weird Masonic occult stuff that I'm talking about the Egyptian mythology of it all. Like, why is NASA interested? How? Yeah, why is NASA interested in this alien mother goddess Hathor? Like, why? And this is where it kind of got freaky for me when I started making these connections. So, you know, NASA has a really weird history, you know, there's the Nazi aspect, which they were deep into the occult. But most importantly was Jack Parsons. Jack Parsons was, you know, doing rituals, sex magic rituals in the middle of the desert with his buddy, Al Run Hubbard, trying to summon a demon goddess named Babylon. And this is the guy who created Rocket Fuel for NASA. He pretty much founded JPL laboratories or Jet Propulsion laboratories. And if you read the Bible, there's this entity that appears in the end times called the whore of Babylon, who literally comes out of Rome where the Vatican is. And ironically, when Al Run Hubbard was there documenting the whole thing, he was like, Oh, this beings is also associated with Hathor. And if you study Hathor, she was also known as the sacred whore in Egyptian mythology. So I'm like, is this being one version of this whore of Babylon entity that's supposed to arrive during the end times? I hope that makes sense. I mean, the Egyptians probably didn't call her a whore. It sounds very Christian. It's like the sacred, sacred prostitute archetype thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But it's like the whore of Babylon. That's definitely a dude came up with that. Well, Crowley was the one the Crowley was the one saying like we need to summon the demon goddess Babylon. And Jack Parsons tried to complete the ritual for him. And Alester Crowley was like, Ah, you're you're dumbass for trying to do this. But Jack Parsons, I mean, I don't mean to be awoke here, but do we have to call it the whore of Babylon? I didn't make the name. Can we say the sex worker of Babylon? No, I know you didn't. I'm just saying it's always bug me. It's like, who the fuck are you to call a caller a whore? Like, what are you? Like, who's saying that? Anyone? Anyone like throwing out whore? It's like, what are you? What are you doing? What are you going to spank her or something? What's your plan? What are you going to make her? What are you going to do? Don't call her a whore. It's like the lady of Babylon. Why do we call her a whore? Is that is that weird? It just seems rude. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what the fuck. What's the big deal? What's the problem? You know what I mean? Like, if it was again, I'm sorry, I don't mean to go, but if it was a dude of the dude of Babylon, yeah, it would be like the stud of Babylon is returning. You know what I mean? Because it's a lady. It's like, ah, the whore of Babylon. She fucks dragons. Well, I mean, anyway, look, in ancient times, no, you're fine. In ancient times, most of these mother goddesses were tri-faced deities, meaning that they had three aspects to them. One was the whore, one was the virgin, one was the crone, like the old wise lady. Oh, that's cool. There's three faces to a lot of these mother goddesses. And even in the Bible, there's the three Marys. You know, you have Mother Mary, the Virgin Mary, and, or no, so the Mother Mary is the Virgin. You had Mary Magdalene, the prostitute, and then there was another Mary who was present at the cave when the stone was rolled away, when Jesus was put in the cave or whatever. I forget what her role was, but there's always three faces to these mother goddesses. Okay, that's cool. I like that a lot. That's cool. All right, so this is like, okay, that may, okay, I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha. So whore of Babylon is like the shadow, that's like the shadow Mary. Okay, that's really cool. That's so trippy, man. So like at the end of time, the shadow of the Virgin appears with an angel with a flaming sword to set things straight again, right? That's the idea. It's like, paradise is on the other side of this, whatever this event may be. And I want to say, I can't remember the name, and I don't want to sound uneducated, but there is a goddess named after her name is very similar to Vatican. I think it's like Vatican or Vaticanus. I'll have to look it up. You could, you can try and look it up right now, but she rules over how, but it's spelled H-E-L. You can just search up like Vatican goddess and H-E-L. Vatican goddess, Vatican goddess. Vatican goddess, Vatican goddess. Vatican goddess, Vatican goddess. Vatican goddess, Vatican goddess. The name Vatican and Etruscan goddess, Vatican goddess of the underworld. What is the connection? Whoa. That's so wild, man. I love talking to you. That's so cool. Okay, let's see. Okay, a lot about the Vatican library. Okay, the Etruscan goddess, Vatican goddess of the underworld. The name Vatican is a true mystery. It has nothing to do with the Bible, Greek language, or Latin. Like many other Christian traditions and customs, the name we associate with the church has a pagan origin. More than 28 centuries ago and before the legendary founding of Rome by Romulus and Remus, there were people called the Etruscans. Okay, whatever. The Etruscans believed in an afterlife, but our knowledge about it is derived mainly from images and artifacts discovered inside their tombs. It seems that the Etruscans beliefs about the afterlife were similar to those of ancient Egyptians. Treatment of the deceased's remains was important. Okay, where does the name Vatican come from? Vatican had several other related meanings in ancient Etruscan. The name was not only associated with the goddess of the underworld, Vatican. Oh, wait, of the underworld, Vatican was also a bitter, not well tasting grape used by a peasant to produce cheap wine. The grape as well as weed with the same name grew on the slope. When people ate it, they experienced hallucinations. And the word passed on into Latin as a synonym for prophetic vision. The Latin word Vatican, Vatican, Vatican or means for tell prophesy from Vat as poet teacher oracle. Whoa. And also remember, when Jesus asked for water, they gave him something bitter on this. That's the translation on the on the sponge that they put in his mouth, right? So like, is that what they gave him? Vatican, some kind of hallucinatory underworld? Yeah, well, the wine, the hallucination association or the whole, the hallucinogen association is really interesting to me because like, you know, we were talking about Robert Anton Wilson, how he was saying like, Oh, eating these plants that make, you know, all these different types of things found in nature that make you trip balls are a way to communicate with the divine feminine, which I just find that really interesting because that seems like another example of that. Another way. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Exactly. You know, DM, you know, many people who smoke DMT, they see this, this woman, like, you can look it up the lady, I'll look it up the DMT lady, everyone talks about my friend's dollar. Let me see DMT lady. You know, the first thing that pops up DMT lady shirts, very annoying. Hold on. Hold on one second. I'm going to look her up here. So it's like, okay, DMT lady vision. Yeah. It's my friend Shane, a lot of stuff about this like purple woman that he sees. Yeah, yeah. Lots of other people report seeing this being. I was just going to say my, my friend saw the same purple woman purple. Yeah, it's very interesting. So this is, so what we're talking about here, you know, is some kind of goddess feminine energy that is coming. Yeah. She's been, she's been suppressed and she's pissed off. She's been suppressed. Oh yeah. Right. Right. Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Suppressed by who though? Why and why? Why is this kind of information held back? Why is it that you, to find out any of this stuff, you have to like really dig deep? Like, it's not like, like when I was a kid, no one was talking about this. You know, I knew about Mary. Everyone knows about Mary from, you know, even a brief association with Christianity, but no one taught us like, but that figure appears in all the world religions that that figure has three sides. So what is that? Who, why do you think this sort of data is not freely given out? Why is it something you have to search for? I think, I don't know. I mean, maybe that's just what makes life interesting. Maybe that is the mystery. Right. They can't just give us everything for sure. Yeah. What are we supposed to do? You know, they just give you all the secrets to be bored. Yeah. And also it's one of the best things ever when your mom picks you up from school and you're a kid. It's like a joyful moment. You know, like it's, it's nice to imagine that that's all that works. That we're just Syrian. Is that how you call Syrian aliens that we're, we're aliens living on serious right now, alien children. And we have our mommies going to come and get us and that's what the apocalypse is. It's just when your mom picks you up from school, when you're in a super advanced alien, that's what we can look forward to. You're always, you were always a little bit mad when dad came instead. You're like, where's mom? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Right. The flaming sword is just the car. That's what people drive. Look, man, I could go on and on with you forever. Thank you so much for letting me ramble with you today. What a joy, Nick. You got another book coming out for us. Yep. And it's called stay away to serious. Cool. Cool. When is it? How can we find it? When's it coming out? Just keep paying attention to my Twitter, which is at n-i-c-k-h-i-n-t-o and also same thing on Instagram. I have a website, which is just a total mess. Don't go to it. I'm trying to fix it. Same thing with my podcast. I might go, I might go back to it. I'm not really sure what angle I want to take with it. But it's just another project that like I'm more focused on the book. I want the book to be finished before I start doing anything else. And I'm hoping to get it out by the end of this month or early July, which would be, which would be ironic because that's when serious is like highest in the sky, right? Then you have to make it your goal. Do that. Make it happen. Yeah. And friends, please follow Nick on Twitter, follow his Instagram. Being friends with him makes me feel like I have some direct connection to something underneath the CIA or the Vatican or it's probably all the same place. He's really tuned in as you can tell to the great mystery. Follow him. Nick, thank you so much. And I can't wait for our next podcast. Yeah, man. Thank you. Thank you.

And this is the Dugga Trussell Family Hour podcast. We're listening to a little bit from Wellington Finch's new album, To Kiss a Hummingbird. It's a seven-hour album. And he's only selling it on vinyl, unfortunately. So you've got to have a lot of room and your crate. That's the announcement trumpet, everybody. And that means we've got a big announcement. This just in, the announcement trumpet has been replaced by a horn. Here's the announcement. We are having a DTFH freakout challenge. If you remember the old days of the DTFH, for a while we were doing freakout challenges, these were simple things you could do that would sort of push you out of your comfort zone and create just a weird phenomena in your life. One of them was give a flower to a stranger. Since then the world has changed dramatically. So I don't even know if we could do that anymore safely. Even then it was a little like probably dangerous and maybe scared a few people now I think about it. I don't know if you've ever been given a flower by a stranger, but if somebody gave me a flower now, I'd be like, I'm not touching that fucking thing until you dip it in rubbing alcohol. But we're gonna do another one. This one's a simple freakout challenge. And you know what, you're gonna hear it and you're gonna think, fuck this, this is not extreme enough. I'm sorry, and what can I say? I'm over here, all of my shit's melting down in a good way. You know, the peak of my life in the old days used to be getting blasted on ecstasy. Making love, pouring wine all over my body, stomping my grapes in one of my vats, or swimming and cum, but now I'm older now. And for me, it's the simple things that bring me joy. In the old days I've been in come to have fun, take big blasts of ecstasy to have fun, champagne breakfast in your bum. But now I'm only a shampoo with cum. Instead of ecstasy, it's mushrooms. I drink champagne, but out of a cup. I've changed, I've left the city, and I no longer drink champagne out of butts. And I like the new me. So we're not gonna do some wild freakout challenge, no blimp rentals, nothing extraordinary. You know, these days we've got a pandemic happening, so it's like, I'm not gonna send y'all to like a shopping mall dressed as a clown to give people condoms or something. We've got to have a gentle freakout challenge. And I'll tell you, man, I've really become absorbed in this idea, I guess you could say, in Buddhism called the paramitas. Apparently there's either six of them or 10 of them. I'm not sure which depends on what website you land on. Seems like somebody added some paramitas to the list, but the paramitas, it gets translated as perfections or another version of it is the other shore. In other words, these are sort of traits that an enlightened being just naturally sort of like exhibits with no difficulty, you know, just sort of, and I've been around, you know, people like Sharon Salzburg, for example, you know, she just, these teachers, they have this way of just bending, you know, I don't wanna say bending, alchemizing reality so that no matter what, it always, when they sort of break it down, in that breakdown, there's beauty, there's a sudden realization that you're not quite as trapped as you thought you were. And so maybe that's what the paramitas, that's what naturally comes to a person who's had a lifetime of practice. I am not that person. So for me, like my state, my desired state of being is kind of like, I don't know, like snorting catamine, playing God of War, hold up in some warm, soft, sweet smelling place. And you know, that's, I'm not saying that's necessarily the worst thing in the world, but I don't know if that's like at the end of that life, you're gonna be like, wow, that was awesome. You're probably gonna feel a general sense of like, I don't know, maybe there was, maybe I should have added to that like tea sometimes, or a walk. So the paramitas, I've heard them described by Pima children as a form of stretching. By the way, I'm sorry for my Patreon friends who already heard me yapping about this for probably too long at our family gathering today, but it's where my head is right now. So the first paramita is generosity, generosity. And this is not, so generosity, you know, depending on where you're at, some people just think of generosity as like donating, giving money, giving stuff to people. That's not necessarily what it is, though it can be part of it. In this, and in my very rough approximation of what these things might be, this version of generosity is more about giving yourself. So, you know, in other words, it's like not just going to dinner with someone and buying them dinner, but also listening to them through the dinner and not being on your phone, like really being there with them. And for a lot of us, that ain't easy, depending on who you're going to dinner with. It's not like, you know, I don't know how many of you all have had an angry mom make you dinner. That's not fun. Do you remember your mom banging pans, slamming cupboards, smashing down pots, loudly clinking things, like under cooking stuff, because she was fucking mad at you, but you're a kid, so she still has to feed your ass. That's sweet on some universal, like, eternal mother, like, I'm going to still do this for you, even though you left like a weird condom or two in my bed after I went on vacation, and so you were humping in the house, and I don't know who you were humping, but there are a lot of condoms, but I'm going to make you dinner. So, that is not necessarily generosity, but so, in other words, like it'd be easy if we could just give shit to people, because, you know, then you wouldn't have to worry about all the other stuff that goes along with it. This version of generosity is giving yourself, sharing yourself with people and prioritizing other people. I don't even want to say it. Prioritizing other people above you hurts to say. With my kid, it's easy. I actually love it, but it's not easy for me all the time. It's just not my natural state. So, I've been experimenting with this, and here's where I'm going to add my own little twist to it. God, forgive me. I like the term other shore. I think about multiverse navigation way too much. The idea that we live in a universe that's an onion layer and multiple other universes, and that every action, regardless of how minute it may seem, sort of veers us one way or the other into a parallel universe. In other words, it's not like you get in shape from working out. It's that working out causes you to move into the timeline where you're in shape. So, Paramita, the other shore, implies a kind of navigation. And what I have noticed in my clumsy experiments with generosity is that the reality I exist in, the universe I'm in, when I start stretching my generosity muscles by trying to fully be with people in my life, is a completely different reality. It's a brighter reality. It's a shinier reality. It's a warmer reality. It's a sweeter reality. And also, again, friends, 46-year-old who used to like nothing I love more than filling my tub with cum and bathing and then snorting big rails of MDMA and, you know, eating an ass. But also, compared to, like, all those experiences, something about just making an effort to be fully with the people in your life, to be with them, even if what they're saying is not necessarily what you are interested in. For you, I know all of you listening to this are like, you mean, like, just being a normal, nice person? But for me, this is like an alien landscape to some degree. And also, one of the things Pima Trojan said in the YouTube video I found is you start where you're at. There's no shame in it. Where you're at's where you're at. So maybe for you, this is how you live already. This is your life. And whatever there is of you is a kind of shadowy, like, glowing, pretty, rainbow-y, translucent, opaque, shimmering of barely and identity. You're not self-absorbed is what I'm saying. But you could still stretch more, I think. I think that's the idea, but you can always sort of, like, stretch out and be a little more generous. And then, see what happens to your dimension. I'm not saying that all of a sudden, like, rainbows are gonna appear in the air and, like, birds are gonna land on your shoulder. But I wouldn't be surprised if something like that happened to you. It really could be that your three acts of generosity away from, like, waking up in Atlantis or something, realizing you're some kind of pharaoh that was having a weird dream. Regardless, let me know. Generosity for a week. I know this seems like a mundane freak-out challenge. But if you listen to your old Uncle Duncan with his golden nipple hoops, then you might find that just this simple shift messing around with the first paramedic creates some pretty dramatic, radical, weird synchronicities to happen in your life. Or if it doesn't, so what? What are you gonna do? Find me. You won't find me. Challenge me to a fight. Are we gonna get in a fight somewhere? Because the paramedic challenge didn't work for you. Are you gonna beat me? Is that what you're gonna do, Daddy? Are you gonna spank me? Are you gonna make me suck your feet? All right, friends, we've got a wonderful podcast for you today. Sharon Salzburg is here with us. We're gonna jump right into it. But first, this. A tremendous thank you to the Boner Wizards at Blue Chew for not just for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH, but for reigning their delightful, edible pills down upon the planet. Blue Chew, they bring you the first chewable with the same FDA approved active ingredients as Viagra and Seattle's. I'm not embarrassed that I eat boner pills. Never has bothered me. I knew at some point, I'm gonna have to start chomping on boner pills, probably. I mean, why wouldn't I? You know, I've got one ball. I don't exercise. And there's a pandemic. It's not exactly what you would call the sexy period in American history. Also, I don't want to go to a pharmacy right now for anything. I don't care what it is. I just don't want to go there. I don't want to risk getting some form of viral pneumonia. You know, so this is why I love Blue Chew, because they mail you the medicine. It's prescribed online by licensed physicians, and it goes right to your door in a discreet package. I don't know why the package needs to be discreet. I don't care. The package could have speakers attached to it, booming out. Your neighbor takes boner pills. I wouldn't care. It doesn't bother me. I don't feel embarrassed, but I understand some of y'all out there do. I forgot to update my address, by the way, so my Blue Chew is floating somewhere among all the ballots that are hopefully going to transform our wonderful country for the better. Anyway, you got to try it. Look, I wouldn't promote it if I hadn't tried it. I was the laboratory rat. I tried this medicine. It works. That's all there is to say. And I've had much experience with many other forms of boner pills. Right now, we got a special deal for our listeners.

And now, without further ado, I would like to welcome back to the DTFH, one of my favorite Dharma teachers alive today and one of the great spiritual leaders of our time. And I mean that. I'm not even being hyperbolic. She's an author. Her most recent book is a must read. It's called Real Change. Mindfulness to heal ourselves and the world. And it is a really, really great book. If you're feeling like a lot of us are, which is completely paralyzed, stuck in the great bubbling mire. That is the world right now. This book will get you out of the pit. I've been fortunate enough to see her speak on multiple occasions. And there's nothing like it that I know of in the world. When Sharon starts teaching about cultivating compassion, it's just the energy in the room shifts. And I don't know. It's one of the most profound experiences I've had in my life. And I've watched a lot of performers. Not that she's a performer, but I've seen some great comics and great teachers, great speakers. They have this thing they do where it's not just what they're saying. It's like the energy in the room shifts. I won't spoil it for you, but post-pandemic, I hope that you will go to one of her talks. And forgive me because I don't mean this in some kind of insensitive way because the pandemic really is rotten. And it's one of the most horrible things I've encountered in the history of the United States or the world. But that being said, there's something really kind of nice about not having to go places. Like you can go to all these incredible events online. And so I want to invite y'all to check out Joseph Goldstein, Sharon, and Andrea Castillo for a special online course, Mindfulness, The Gateway to Insight.

Alright everybody, please welcome back to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, Sharon Salzburg. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shaken, going to be blue. Welcome to you. It's the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast. Sharon, it's so great to see you. I feel like I've been hanging out with you because I've been reading your book. And I love it. Everybody that I've chatted with who has picked up a copy, they love it. But more than love it, everybody is just saying it's such a, it's just weird synchronicity that this book came out right now. Do you feel a little like Nostradamus or something that you wrote a book about? Exactly the state of consciousness and a path and a methodology, I guess you could say, for being an activist right now during this time where that seems to be exactly what is needed. Well, it's so funny. First of all, I want to say it's lovely and also a little eerie to see you because you're one of the last people I hung out with physically, you know, before the pandemic. I was in LA and there you are. So it's like, oh, right, you know, look at that. He's real, except he's not, he's not in front of me actually, you know, it's like, oh. So it brings it all back that day and, you know, being in LA and I refer to it sort of like, I went somewhere, you know, I took an epic journey because every journey now feels epic. You know, I was somewhere else like, wow. Yeah. It is really great to see you again. The before time. Yeah. And I actually wrote the book, all of the book, except for the preface in the before time. It turns it in like December or January and I'm very relieved and grateful to hear you say that because one of my concerns, of course, was that it was going to seem totally irrelevant that I've woken up several mornings thinking I wrote a completely irrelevant book, you know. And yet, you know, somebody said to me, are you psychic? And I thought, oh, thank goodness, you know, like, it actually works, you know, for this time. Well, yeah. And I, this is not my intended thing I wanted to chat with you about, but just to dwell on this for a little bit longer. When I was working on the show for Netflix, we didn't know that the show about the apocalypse would be happening during not the apocalypse, but a relatively apocalyptic time. Do you, what do you think about that phenomenon? Because it does, it happens a lot, doesn't it? Where you, you feel called to do a thing. And for you, you might have some purpose or reason, but then when you, in hindsight, you look back and realize, whoa, I don't know that the reason that I thought I should write that book was actually why I wrote the book. Like I was called. Yeah. Like something moved me bigger than me. What do you think about that? I think it's really true. And it's, it's kind of amazing, isn't it? It's like, what came through me? Because I, it wasn't exactly my plan, you know, to write. I mean, I wanted a book that was relevant, but it wasn't like I thought, well, by the time this comes out, we'll, you know, everything will have fallen apart. And like, we can be talking about the apocalypse in a different tone or something like that. It's not like that at all. But in trying to do something that's meaningful to you and something, I mean, every creation, you want to have some timeless quality, right? Because you don't want people to look at it a year later and think, well, you know, that was then. Yes. You know, that has nothing to do with now. Right. But somehow, sometimes it just happens and something comes through you. It really is like channeling, I guess. I guess that's what it is. I mean, this, to me, this is definitely a, if folks are looking for a guidebook. And I think a lot of people right now are looking for any kind of guidance because all the data streams have been politicized. All the data streams have been warped according to different ideologies and different, you know, aspirations. Many of them not great. But this book, for me, has been very special because it is grounding me in some just very pragmatic things that I could do. And also, I think one of the things I love about it is the very simple, yet somehow something I completely forgot. The very simple assessment that respecting yourself is radical, is a form of a revolution, is a revolutionary attitude, just that alone. And that is maybe, and well, in this book, it seems to be the beginning of a process. But I wonder if you could talk a little bit about that, about accepting yourself as a form of actual, I don't know, if revolution is too strong a word, but as a form of activism. I think it is a form of activism. And for many of us, it does begin there because there are lots of stories that the world tells about who we are and what we're capable of. Maybe it's for the family, maybe it's the broader culture. But we tend to absorb a lot of stories, a lot of myths about who we are and what gives life meaning and what'll make us happy and what's strength and what's weakness. And to sort of see those stories in a more critical light, realize we can let go of them, we don't have to take them all to heart. They're not all wrong, you know, but some number of them are really, you know, they're very limiting and corrosive. And to have a sense of, I'm worth more, I'm worth something, you know, I'm worth more than that narrative and the way that I have accepted being treated. I've seen from talking to lots of activists is the turning point in actually being able to stand up and not only for yourself, but for others. But it begins with some sense of, I'm worth more than this, I don't care what I've been told or how many people have told me that. Look at that. And so it's really kind of love for oneself. It's not hatred of the other, you know, it's really a love for oneself that I think has given a lot of these people strength. What are some stories or a story that you sort of unconsciously digested in your own life that you realized maybe wasn't true? There are things like about what I have to offer is just so-so, you know, like, it's all right, you know, like, I'm all right, but not great. Certainly things like, and I was specifically told this, you know, by a parent. Like, you can't let anybody get to you, you know, you can't let yourself feel that strongly, you know, the world's too hard, the world's a hard place. Oh yeah. You know, don't let it in. And that was not really good advice. And I didn't stand him that well either. But, you know, and I think the extrapolating that, you know, certain feelings are shameful. I shouldn't feel anger. That's a really shameful thing. It's, I should be stronger than this or an extrapolating even further. Like if you're trying to help someone else, that's like for suckers, you know, that's really something that's just going to happen. That's really something that's just going to bring you down. And so sort of dissolving that entire edifice of belief was almost like task one in meditation, you know, once I was actually looking within and I could see those thoughts and feelings. It was like, really? Wow. This, what you mentioned about anger, I just, if I could, I want to read something actually that I thought we could talk about from the chapter Awakening to the Fire. And I meant one of my big issues is anger. I get angry. I lose my temper. I blow my stack. I'm humiliated by it. It's caused a lot of harm in my own life. And so I found this chapter to be really special because not just personally do I lose my temper and I, that's one of the reasons I feel like I have to meditate, but also right now. So many people who I have a deep respect for are just angry and almost to the point of not being coherent anymore, just lost in like anger over what's happening in our country right now and what's happening with the old politics. They're either angry. I have friends who are angry because I'm voting for Biden and I'm a Democrat who think I've become, you know, part of an elitist reptilian conspiracy. I have friends who are angry that the only choice is Biden. They're voting for him, but they're pissed that this is who, it's not Bernie Sanders that we have no, we have this stupid binary and we have to vote for someone that maybe we have a lot of philosophical disagreements regarding. And so all over the one commonality right now is just a lot of times it seems to be irrational anger or the anger has made them irrational or has made me irrational. And so it's this chapter I thought was just wonderful. And I would like to read something you wrote back to you. Please. I'd be so happy. If we can be mindful with our anger, we can learn to use the energy and intelligence of it without getting lost in the tunnel vision. It tends to foster were conditioned to turn away from anger or guilt, blame, jealousy, and so on. Feeling angry at ourselves at others, it experiences that come upon us is undoubtedly intense and we might fear that intensity will be all consuming. So to avoid the rabbit hole of anger, our culture teaches us to find safety and repression. But there is a profound difference between recognizing anger for what it is and becoming lost in it. Can you talk about this, please? Yes. I mean, there's so many layers to that. And then I want to get to the voting issue too, specifically, but, you know, when in the before time, the last trip I took when I was away from home, when I went somewhere, same trip where I saw you, I was doing this workshop in someone's house and another attendee who's a therapist was there. And she had this line, which I thought was amazing. She said something like, the brain filled with shame cannot learn. Wow. And I just thought that was amazing because our goal is, you know, to learn or to change if we have a habit that's causing pain to ourselves and to others. Or even in terms of a system of oppression, we want change, right? Yes. And shame is a little different, I think, than kind of a moral reckoning, like a recognition. Like I really, when I sent that email, I did hurt somebody. I was really reckless. So when I shouted at my kid or something like that, you know, I want to change behavior, but to be filled with shame and to think I'm like an awful person. And it actually is not a path that's onward leading, you know, because we're so, we get so depleted and so exhausted. And we feel so demoralized that we don't know how to change at that point. So it's like the ready response. It's the obvious response and maybe the very conditioned response, but it doesn't help. So we look at feelings like anger as one example, hopefully without the add on of the shame, you know, like I'm a terrible person. And also without the add on of I'm only an angry person and I always will be that kind of permanence or isolation. Like I'm the only one who loses it in this way or there are lots of stuff we might add on to it. And within the Buddhist context, it's a complex emotion. Like the positive part is the energy, you know, it's not passive. It's not complacent. It's it's drawing a boundary. It's saying no, no way, whatever. And the other positive part is a kind of audacity. Like we all know we can be in a meeting or something like that. And it's the angriest person that's pointing out the thing no one else wants to look at. Yes. And we're like determined to look the other way and they're saying, look at that. You know, so we actually rely on that a lot. But if we just like I wrote, if we get overwhelmed by it and defined by it and consumed by it, we suffer mightily, you know, in the Buddhist psychology Angers like into a forest fire, which burns up its own support. And I just feel funny these days talking to people in California using that image, you know, they know exactly what it's like, how destructive, how damaging to oneself. And also like a fire, like a fire, it can burn wild. We might end up someplace very far from where we want to be. So if you think about the last time you were really angry at yourself and just bring it back. It's not a time where we also think, you know what, I did five great things. Same morning. You know, I said stupid things like they're gone. So we do get tunnel vision. We get diluted. We get confused. So what we want to do is recognize the anger, not add the shame and all that stuff, be able to extract the energy and not kind of be enslaved by it. You know, for our own sake, you know, just to not do that much damage to ourselves or families or relationships, whatever. And so that is a fine line, you know, to see it, honor it because we have to honor everything that we're feeling. And also have a choice. You know, we don't necessarily want to get enveloped in it and overcome by it. At the same time, we're not pushing it away. That's kind of the essence of mindfulness practice. It's actually a practice. Yes. It's like a training to be able to be with all those feelings and anger is also very complex. It's like if you sit and look at it and not blame yourself for it, but just look at it, you see fear usually. You see sadness in there. You know, there are lots of other feelings and almost always you will find at the heart of the anger is some sense of helplessness, which we cannot bear. Right. You know? Yeah. And so if you can get there, I have found for myself, if I can get there to recognizing the helplessness, then I can resolve on taking an action. You know, saying something, doing something, whatever. Well, it's okay. So what I love about this chapter is it is not inviting you to, you know, I think it's a really like these days, especially if someone gets angry, they lose the argument. It's like if you're angry, what you're saying doesn't mean anything anymore. And you're saying, no, that is not the case. You can be angry and also still tell the truth. Yeah. But, you know, people these days, if you lose it, if you like blow your stack or whatever, then it's like you're no longer valid. And I love that. That I think that's beautiful. It's also, I think for people like me, it's definitely a thing you have to be careful about because I think people would get angry. We also recognize that it's like it is a powerful energy, just like those forest fires. And I imagine if we could figure out a way to take all that energy and just put it into a battery, we could, you know, fuel California for years and years instead of burning it down. But there's a recognition in folks who get angry that, yeah, if I can't even get close to it, if I get too close to that vulnerability that you're talking about, my brother says it's because of our childhood because we couldn't defend ourselves from a lot of crazy stuff. And so all you could do, I guess, when you're a kid is scream. And sometimes forest, just when I take him away from a stream, if he's throwing rocks in it, we'll just start screaming. Like I'm about to throw him in a furnace or something. It's like, we have to go home. You're soaking wet. It's cold, you know, but so anyway, can you maybe go a little more in depth about this extraction process? How to, how to harness that energy? Because when I get angry, I just, I'm gone. Like I'm not even, if whatever was there, it's like, I don't know who I am at that point. How do you deal with that? How do you, how do we grab that energy and use it in a productive way?

Well, you know, people actually practice in meditation. It's like maybe bring up some situation where you're angry at yourself or someone else. Feel it in your body. You know, learn to recognize that feeling because when you're out in the forest you're getting upset about something. It's going to be in your body. You can recognize it in your body before the cognitive thought comes. We've stayed out here way too long. So that's part of it. Part of it is learning the add-ons that we are used to. Like the shame or I've got to repress this. I've got to deny it. Damn it. No one ever listens to me. Everything I do is complete futility. Whatever is that habitual add-on. We learn to recognize that and then we let that go. And then it's almost like and you need the time. You can't do this when you're on the spot. But in the meditation that's why it's like a rehearsal. You feel it in your body and you notice the other. Ask yourself what else is here? Like once I was working with somebody as a meditation student and I said the next time I see you I want you to tell me three things you found inside your anger and one of them can be that it's changing. You know, it peaks and then it evaporates and comes back or whatever. But one of them might be, oh it's a lot of sadness in there. You know, it's a lot of fear in there or whatever. And I would especially look for that sense of helplessness because that's the moment that you channel. You know, you say I'm going to take some action. And often we don't take action because it feels too small. You know, like what is that going to do? But it's actually going to do more than yelling, you know. Or writing an angry tweet or something, you know. And so you can resolve on the action once you recognize the helplessness. And it's very important because the anger might have a very valid message but it's pretty distorted by the time we're overwhelmed with it. And I do tell a story in the book which is one of my favorite stories about my friends from the Holistic Life Foundation who bring yoga and meditation to the inner city schools in Baltimore. And they tell me the story about this little girl who's maybe like let's say eight years old and she was a fighter. She was always getting into terrible trouble and kids were mean to her and they were picking on her and they were teasing her. But still she was the one who'd like knock them out, you know, and end up in detention. So they taught her how to meditate and one day they walked into like some public space like the gym or something. And she had this other little girl up against the wall by holding her by her throat. Oh my God. And then she looked at her and said, you're just lucky I know how to meditate. And she dropped her and she went and sat in the corner and composed herself. Wow. Wow. Yeah. I love that. That, you know, maybe we could, this is something, by the way, I wore a Hawaiian shirt today because I don't, we were priced, but we probably be in Hawaii at a Ram Dass retreat at this point. If not for this pandemic. But the, I want to talk about this because I feel like you are such a genius at it. Demystifying meditation. Demystifying. You just disappeared.

Sharon, I think you're a genius at many things, but I think one facet of your genius is you are so good at demystifying some of this stuff. Can you hear me, Sharon? Great. Yeah, now you're back. Demystifying was the key word. Demystify. Yes. And specifically in the sense that I think many of us, me included, have, whenever we think about how to be, especially when it comes to activism, do you know where my mind goes and the thing that makes me not want to do anything? I think about Gandhi. I think about the Salt March. I think about his discipline. I think about all that he did. And then I think, what am I going to do? I'm not Gandhi. What am I going to do? I can't do anything. What am I going to do? What are you going to go give food to somebody? Is that, who do you think you are? Are you going to not going to do that? You can't do that. Are you Gandhi? There's a real, there's an asshole in my mind that's like, come on. What do you think you're Gandhi? Forget it. But you, what I love about what you give us is that we don't have to be Gandhi to help. In fact, for some people, just not, just not getting in a fight is a victory of victories. But also part, part of what I feel like is easy to fall prey to is like then not holding yourself to high enough standard. Do you know what I mean? Like thinking, oh, I'm doing enough just because I'm not, you know, like sending the email when in fact you could probably do a little bit better than that. So can you talk about, how do we sort of find the middle way here? I mean, how do we not, you know, set the mark too low out of some sense of like, well, you know, I'm doing what I can versus, you know, not tormenting ourselves with like the stories of Mother Teresa or Martin Luther King or Gandhi. I think more, I think I've encountered more people tormenting themselves than feeling complacent. You know, mostly it's like I could never do enough. Nothing I could do could count it will make a difference. And so kind of getting up and having that sense of agency for even what maybe a kind of relatively small act is so crucial. I talk in the book and often about how much I love the Statue of Liberty. She's like, you know, she's my idol. In Hinduism, there's this concept called an Ishtadev. It's like the deity, the bodhisattva that you want to emulate, you know, because they all have different characteristics in the pantheon. It's like, you know, this one's mostly about wisdom and this one's mostly about song and this one's mostly about compassion and so on. And so I've often said the Statue of Liberty is my Ishtadev, you know, it's that incredible inclusivity of welcome like there she was and is. But you know, I think like when my grandparents came, you know, like there she was and saying, you know, you're welcome here. You can have a home here. You can have a sense of belonging here. Even you, you miserable thing that no one else wants. I want you, you know, and what I hadn't realized until I was working on this book so much is that she's actually taking a step. She's a woman on the move. She's taking action. It's not only like that kind of wide open embrace standing there, but she's moving. Yeah, I didn't know that until I read that in your book. I didn't know she was on the move. It seems like I thought she was just staying still. Yeah. And that's that we have to take that one step. We have to because otherwise nothing will happen. And it's not insignificant. It never is because of enough people do that one step. It will count. I guess you could get really complacent. Like, yeah, I'm not Gandhi and I never will be, but I've done enough. You know, I gave, I gave the temple or whatever, you know. Yeah. But it's different if you see your whole life is kind of your creative medium. And I would also say that one of the things that changed for me in writing the book was that conversation I had with Bell Hooks where she told me she didn't like the term social action. Because she felt like people might think it only meant marching or protesting. And she said to me, what about art? Yeah. You know, what about a creative act that will dissolve boundaries and make people have a different, help people have a different vision of what's possible. And I thought, yeah, you know, that is a pretty limited use of that term. So I try to be much more expansive than that. The one act, I mean complacent, I mean, and it brings me back to what you're saying about people not wanting to vote because they're ideal candidate or their preferred candidate is not there. It's, I mean, that is really a statement of privilege, you know, and I had a conversation with a friend once who told me he didn't vote. His family didn't vote. And part of the reason, I think that's not true for many people. This presidential election, although maybe if your friends is true, you know, a lot of people say, well, the candidates aren't all that different. There's only like this marginal difference between them. And what I said to my friend was a lot of people live in those margins. You know, it's easy for you to say that they're not that different, but if you were counting on your praying for a minimum wage to go up to $15 an hour, you would see the difference. Right. It's a pretty big difference, you know, and some of the people I interviewed in the book like Chantel, who's one of the leaders of the striking fast food worker movement. That's exactly what they want is minimum wage of $15 an hour. Right to unionize. You would see the difference. Well, yeah, I mean, we say, you know, I, you know, I think we are seeing the difference right now. I don't know. I mean, I don't want to say that it's good luck that he just decided not to give people benefits. I don't know. But he showed himself to me. That's the that, you know, I don't know. It was the steroids. Maybe I don't know. I don't know. But, you know, that, that, that moment was, I think, the nail in his coffin, because who is going to vote for this person now? He's bragging about, he had access to medication that would probably cost a hundred grand. And on top of that, he's taking away people's benefits right before the election. I don't know, man. I don't know who wouldn't vote right now. And I don't, I don't like Joe Biden. I don't like him, but I'm definitely voting for that man. And I, it's anyway, look, I don't want to get, I think getting political, but you can even hear my own voice. We're all feeling it. This is a nightmare. We just want it to be over. We want the election to be over. We just want it to end. And, and it's anyway, to me, I love that this is your invitation in the book is just pick up your foot. And I think in the same way it's people don't realize about these margins. I think some people don't realize how very difficult that is for some people to pick up the foot. It's not easy for some people to pick that foot up. People are especially right now. I mean, Sharon, what about these people? Like I am privileged. I am lucky. I have a great job. I'm doing fine. That does not make me doing fine though. That just means I'm doing fine. I know because people in my community who I chat with, I just talked to someone today. He was in his room completely dark with a little bit of like some kind of lights behind him. Dark. And he said, I haven't talked to anyone, my friends or my family for two months. I've only been in this room for the last two weeks. And I don't think that's an uncommon situation. I think that's happening everywhere. So maybe you could talk a little bit about that fight, flight or freeze. I don't think people know too much about reaching out to a person like that is is a really important thing. I see it too because I'm also doing, in addition to the book, I mean, just come out and so doing book-centric things. I'm also doing teaching to make up for travel, which I'm not doing. And so I joke and I said, yeah, I went to LA last weekend. Of course, I didn't go anywhere. I'm always sitting in this chair. But I taught for inside LA last weekend and the week before for DC. And if I'm in Zoom or something, I often read the chat casually as I'm talking. And it's phenomenal. Like the sorrow and the depression. I feel like, well, everyone is, of course, different. In general, there's been a wave from incredible anxiety to more grief, to anger, to exhaustion. I think a lot of people are in the exhausted phase and I read it. You know, like I'm a school teacher, someone wrote and my kids are all depressed. They just can't handle, you know, screen learning and I don't know what to do and I'm ready to give up. Someone so sadly wrote, 62 years old, which is younger than me, but I'm 62 years old and I've just lost everything I care about. And I don't have it in me, you know, to begin again. And anyway, I'll probably die soon. There's literally there, you know, I was like, whoa. You know, so people are lonely, people are, I mean, it's just gone on a long time and, you know, it's grinding. And so the other side of it, the beautiful side of it is that I do see a lot of people reaching out in different ways. Like, you know, that group, they're not going to let a comment like that go by without saying, you know, if you want to talk anytime. You know, someone in that group will do that. And having, you know, I left New York City March 14th when I got back from LA. I was in New York just pretty briefly. I went and taught at Kripalu with Krishna Das, which meant singing 200 people in an enclosed room. You know, it's like, we're lucky we all survived. And, you know, and very little knowledge, like the only warning was use hand sanitizer, you know. And then I got back to the city and I taught another large program and I thought this doesn't feel good. It just doesn't feel good. You know, I think I'll go, I have a house here in Massachusetts and a retreat center, which was then open. And I thought, I'll go up to Massachusetts for a couple of weeks. So I came up here with my snow boots on March 14th. So I'm now in my third season here. But I'm very in touch with people in New York City. And I hear that story over and over again. Like I've lived in this apartment for 12 years, never even knew the names of my neighbors. And now we all have one another's names and phone numbers. We check on one another. We make sure we're okay or an 86 year old friend of mine lives in New York. And that means, you know, he's of an age. He's been pretty restricted. He also did not leave his apartment for a good long time, although now he's taking walks. But he said to me, I've gotten the phone number of every elderly person in the building, not other elderly persons, you know, people, because they're thinking of themselves that way. I've gotten the phone number of every elderly person in the building. I call them every day to make sure we're okay or I hear that over and over again. People are caring and they're reaching out. Hopefully people who have the need for some support, you know, are finding it and are willing to accept it. This makes me think, you were talking about the Statue of Liberty. And in the book, as I'm reading it and thinking about times that I felt like a legitimate outcast, like a pariah. And like no one would ever love me, no one would ever accept me, no one. I don't deserve anything other than like, you know, scuttling off. What is it? What's that great T.S. Eliot poem? I should have been born a pair of ragged claws scuttling in silent seas. It's, you know, the universal sense of shame. But you, you were talking about embodying the Statue of Liberty. Well, you disappeared again. Oh, I'll come back to T.S. Eliot. Okay. Can you hear me? Well, I'll come back. Okay. The T.S. Eliot poem. I should have been a pair of silent claws scuttling or something like this. This should have been a lobster. It's basically what he's saying. Should have been born a crustacean. You know, and, but the Statue of Liberty. I, I love that you're recommending to people to become the Statue of Liberty. But what about folks who, who, who welcomes the people? Who's the welcomer? If you know what I mean? What about the folks who aren't getting the old person knocking on the door? This, you know, this is where my, I just feel the heartbreak. Or this is where I feel the crushing hopelessness or the hell realm or whatever. It's like, Jesus, God, for every one person who I talked to on Zoom or you talked to, there must be what, a hundred thousand who are just locked. They, they're gone. What do they do? Well, you know, it is, it is heartbreaking. And yet, you know, I think if you, if you have enough energy, which won't be massive, you know, but if you have enough, there are things in place. Like when I was still in New York or watching New York news, once I was gone, you know, and I'd see like how much, how much free mental health service was being offered, including meditation teaching, which I found very interesting, you know, because I'm used to it being so kind of counter cultural and weird and woo-woo and other people's eyes. And I thought, look at that, you can sign up as a mindfulness teacher and help somebody. It's harder because you have to have some initiative. You have to reach out and just like you have to watch what you consume in terms of news. You know, I learned this new term, doom-scrolling, which I know I knew before. You know, and it takes conscious effort, especially the media being what it is, to look for the good in life. And not everyone has the energy to make that effort, but it will make a difference. You know, usually we doom-scroll and we're just going, it's not even different articles. It's the same damn article, but different news sources, you know, and you're reading it again and again and again and again and again, you can't stop. And I contrast that to my favorite story of this time was the school in Minneapolis, which when there was like rioting and looting and burning, somebody burnt down a lot of grocery stores and so the school became a collection site for families to get like a bag of groceries so they could feed their kids and they asked for, they put out a call. I was just writing this last night, they put out a call for, I think it was 70 or 75 bags of food and they got 20,000. Wow. Wow. You know, so I think of that name Crowley Bobo, like love people and feed them, you know. Yeah. 20,000. Wow. Yeah. You know what? There was a picture on, I saw this picture on Reddit where they put out a call, a child had some kind of rare genetic disorder and they needed a specific blood type or a specific genetic type and they put out the call and it's a picture of a line stretching so far you can't see the end of it of people who came just in case their blood was what this kid needed. Yeah. That's what we are. That's us, right? Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. God, why is it so easy to forget that? Sharon, I lost you. Can you hear me? Yeah, now you're back. My question was, why is it so easy? Is this all you or is this me? What's that? Can you hear me? Why is what so easy? I was asking if it was your, yes, now you're back. Why is it so... So you better finish the question while I have you. My question is, why is it so damn easy to forget that humans are pretty great and, you know, and is that naive anyway? Are we just looking at outliers, you know? How the hell, you know, maybe is that the first step forward? I don't even know what the question is, Sharon, but I do know that it's real easy for me because I'm the lord of doom-scrolling to just decide from time to time that I live on a planet of mollusks. Worse than mollusks. Mollusks are actually pretty harmless. Yeah, I think... I don't think it's... I don't think they're outliers. I think that it's a question of what we've been taught in terms of cultivating attention because the other is also true. We see a lot of cruelty and a lot of coldness and disdain for others and not recognizing like that's a person you're talking about, you know? We see real, really terrible stuff and then we see a whole, there's a whole range in between of just indifference. Like, I had this really weird experience not too long ago where a journalist was interviewing me about the book and they chose a meditation. They wanted me to read out loud to record it and they chose this loving-kindest meditation toward a neutral person. A neutral person is somebody we don't especially like or dislike. We just feel kind of neutral toward them and indifferent, really. And then what's interesting is to see what happens if you keep offering them loving-kindness, like silently repeating phrases in your meditation. You know, maybe happy, maybe peaceful, something like that. So it's like paying attention to them differently. And, you know, we always say try to choose someone who you'll tend to run into now and then because you may not see any great change in your formal meditation. But you'll see a real shift eventually when you run into them. You know, you may not even know their name. You don't know their story, but there's just some sense of like, oh, we're in this together. You know, we're on the same team. And so for 45 years or so, my colleagues and I have been saying like the checkout person in the supermarket, that's the perfect person because you run into them now and then we couldn't care less about them. You know, like, we're indifferent to them. We look right through them. We objectify them. So I'm reading this out loud to this journalist and I think, whoops, look at that. Like, how do we think we get food? You know, now we call them essential workers and we're saying, oh, I need this person. I'm counting on them. But look at that whole realm of indifference. The people we just, just counter I was talking to a doctor who runs this large medical practice in a hospital. And he said, you know, I'm appreciating in a whole new way. It's that cleaning staff. I thought, well, yeah, you know, if you're a surgeon, like you'd rather have like a really clean operating theater, you know, but we can just be in this fog of indifference. And so in either case, a lot depends on what we do with our attention. Are we only doom-scrolling? You know, and it's not to say there's not terrible things. There are terrible things. But is that all we pay attention to? Or are we stuck in that middle place of not even noticing others? Or can we consciously turn our attention to seeing the good? And sometimes people don't like that. They think it's phony or, you know, but it's really not. It's just giving a little airtime to something that is also true and doesn't, doesn't reach us usually. And so if we pay attention, I think we will see these are not just outliers, you know, they are coexisting to the really terrible things. And we can, we can get a lot of hope from looking at them. Indifference. It's worse than anger, isn't it? Is indifference the worst thing? I mean, it kind of is, you know, because you're really denying the humanity of somebody or it could be an animal. You're just denying their aliveness. Yeah. When you see a lion eating something, it's indifferent. They look on a lion's eyes when it's eating anything. It's absolute. It's not thinking like I'm killing a mother. When you look, wow, indifference. Yeah. That's, that's it. It's so intro. What do you think about this? That the internet, when it connected us, you would think that it would be, it would do the opposite of indifference. How ironic is it that something about just the massive amount of data that we're getting produces a state of indifference. Is indifference the same thing as paralysis? Is indifference, do you think, a form of freezing? I do think that. And I think it is, you know, again, it's the overload, you know, it's like the way people have always said that. We said that if you hear that three people died in a tornado and you hear their stories and that's different than, you know, 12,000 or because it's just a number. And once it's a statistic and we lose touch with that, it's too much, you know, we just can't take it in. And so I think we, we need to, it's almost like if you're going back to Bell Hooks, if you see your whole life as your creative medium, you know, and that's where your activism is. And so what, how many hours are you going to spend, you know, like doom scrolling or just fixed on your, you know, you've got a kid, you know, like, would you just ignore him? In order to, you know, doom scroll a little longer or, you know, probably not. I saved my doom scrolling for late at night. Sharon, we need to come up with a term here. Doom scrolling is great. What's the opposite off the top of your head? Can you think of something to call it? Ooh, I don't know. Something about the good. Good scrolling. That's not that good. Joy mining. Joy mining. Oh, very good. Doom scrollers versus joy miners. Because, yeah, I love that. I love that because that would be another form of activism. That is the thing I've thought of as I'm looking at the, what is I hate? Watch Fox News, which my wife and I unfortunately do is we hate watch Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson. We hate them, but we turn it on and we watch and we glare and we shake our heads. And it's like, I begun to realize like that's exactly what they want. If there was something in the world, if there was like evil in the world, really it wouldn't ask much of you except to keep looking at the darkness, right? That's all it would want. It wouldn't care if you looked at the darkness and hated it. If you looked in the darkness and rejected it, it doesn't care. It just wants you to keep looking like some horrible, horrible, attention-starved beast. But, whoa, isn't it addictive, Sharon? Isn't it addictive? Isn't it like the greatest drug of all time? Snorting big lines of terror and fear. It really produces a kind of interesting high. I've applied the mindfulness training I've gotten to the feeling. It's not like we're Doom-scrolling and feeling pain. Like in the same way you say deconstruct anger. What's the feeling of Doom-scrolling? It's a specific weird fear-gasm or something. It's a complex feeling we're getting as we are trying desperately to dig up as many horrible events in our phone as we can before we go to bed. What do you think that feeling is that's gluing us to it? I have a belief, so I'm not sure it's true, but it's true for me. Which is that certain things are more activating trauma for each of us than other things. For me, I have this in the book too. I have some reference to it. Because my childhood was full of secrets, I have a very, very visceral reaction to thinking people are lying to me. And it goes in deeper, it's more crazy making than almost anything. I saw pretty quickly that there are certain things I just shouldn't be... It's not ignoring, I'm not suggesting ignoring them, but there's certain things that I shouldn't be devoting a lot of time to because it was going to hit that very place. And I think something I've seen, which I always have a hard time putting into words, but something I've seen in myself as I've grown through the years and changed, is that it used to be that when there's a certain feeling like life's falling apart, this chaos, this confusion, it's something awful and pending. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure it's coming. Then something in me would settle and think that's what life should feel like because that's what it once felt like. And I've seen over time that that feeling, oh, this is right, that's gone. Or that's very different than it used to be. And I think, oh, that's probably a really good sign. Life should not feel this way, especially for a child, but for anybody. It should not feel this way. And so I don't have that same kind of magnetization toward those rehashes. Like, let's hear the recounting of a hugely chaotic thing that's full of deceit and you sit there because you think, oh, that's what life should feel like. Home sweet home. It's like a little time travel back to your childhood if you're like us, a little journey into the past. I get it. I love it. That's brilliant, Sharon. That is it. That's what it is. So many of us didn't have a little house on the prairie childhood. That's just the truth of the matter. That's right. That's right. And so this appeals to all of us. I get it. Wow. Sharon Salzburg. I don't know how I got so lucky that I get to have these conversations with you. But I am so grateful to you for your association. And God bless you for writing this book. This is really one of the, this is going to be, this is a big one. And I love you and thank you for your very generous time. Can you tell folks how to find you? And you mentioned that you, are you still taking students? Are you still, how could someone if they, you know, the people in my community, we have a weekly meditation. I always say, I am not a meditation teacher and I don't say that in a humble way. I'm literally not a, I'm not, I'm a podcaster, but I always recommend finding one. If people wanted to connect with you in that way, is it possible or what would be the steps to do that? Well, you know, I have a website, which is just Sharon Salzburg.com. And, and I think more than thinking, you know, people could work with me individually, which is kind of a lot of people, but I'm happy. I'm going to invite myself to your weekly meditation in your community. You know, I'm happy. I've been wanting to ask you, I've been dying to ask you, God bless you. And I'm like, I'm, there's no way I'm asking, I'm asking Sharon Salzburg to be, to come drop into the meditation, but God, I would love that. Of course I will. I'd be so happy to. Thank you. You should get counseling from your friend, Ragu, who asks me for things all the time. He never hesitates. I literally thought I'm not Ragu. Sharon, God bless you. Thank you. I will have all the links for people to pick up a copy of your book and to connect with your website. I just really am grateful that you're in my life and thank you so much. Thank you so much.

Pals, if you've been listening to the podcast for a while, you know I love technology. I love thinking about the singularity. I love thinking about how absolutely weird the future looks like for us humans, which is why I'm really excited for you to listen to this wonderful conversation that I had with techno-optimist, author, philosopher Stephen Parton. He's the host of a podcast called Society in Question. He also is on Singularity University Radio. He's somebody who is looking the problems that are facing us when it comes to incorporating the accelerating reality of our technological capacity with the problem of the culture wars and what's going on right now when it comes to shit-disturbers using the techno hive to cause all kinds of weird fucking problems in society. We have a wonderful conversation about that. How do we deal with the issue of freedom of speech when people are spreading like intentional misinformation to cause problems? Not only that, it's a wonderful conversation about universal basic income. And of course, there's no way to talk about universal basic income without bringing up the issue of sex robots. Get ready for an awesome podcast with Stephen Parton. We're gonna jump right into it, but first this. This episode of the DTFH has been brought to you by a very special company, DAME. DAME Products is a woman-owned sex toy company making the next generation of vulva-tested, vulva-approved vibrators. It's founded by a sex educator and an engineering whiz. DAME develops toys with the help of real humans and couples like you. They're closing the pleasure gap and helping the world one vulva at a time. You listen to my podcast and that means that I would like you to have high-level, supernova-style, angelic, interdimensional orgasms and DAME products will help you do that. They've got EVA, it's a couples vibrator. It gives you clitoral stimulation during penetrative sex and it's flexible wings tuck under your labia for a snug fit. Your labia is cradled as your entire body shifts frequency and you come so hard that DMT elves will climb out of your walls and wave at you. It's no secret that using vibrators can enhance pleasure but holding a toy in place can also be distracting. You need your hands. It's counterproductive. Unlike vibrating penis rings, one of which I'm wearing right now, EVA is worn in the vulva, leaving your hands free to support your weight, move around and focus on intimacy. Or if it's one of those solo nights to change the channel, maybe you realize that you're about to have an explosive orgasm while watching Dateline. I don't know. This is not some run-of-the-mill, nonsense vibrator. This is something that was created by someone who understands orgasms. Let me reiterate. It makes me happy to imagine that this podcast doesn't just give you entertainment. It is also making you come. It's good karma and I'll admit it. It kind of turns me on. These are high level, super powerful, life altering vibrators. They're made with medical grade silicone, smart design principles and lots of love earning glowing press from the New York Times, W Magazine and many more, including yours truly.

Steven Parton, he is the host of society in question. He's got a wonderful website that you should definitely check out. It's called curiousapes.com. All the links you need to connect to Steven are there. A lot of really, really smart essays and interviews there. If you're interested in technology, you should bookmark curiousapes.com. All right, my loves, let's do this. Everybody, welcome to the DTFH, Steven Parton. Welcome to the DTFH. I am really excited to chat with you, going on your website, going through your writing, it's just sparked so many moments of inspiration for me. It's really, what I love about your, can I call it futurism, some kind of futurism? What I love about it is it's got realism mixed in with it. You know, sometimes when you get caught up in reading, transhumanist writing, when you read about all the great possibility that technology presents to us, somehow it feels a little utopian, you know? And I think that's one of the main critiques of transhumanism is it doesn't acknowledge the real world problems that we're facing on the planet. And your writing does such a great job of acknowledging that. So, thank you. Thank you for it. But yeah, I'm gonna ask you a question that you asked on your website, because I thought it's a wonderful place to start. And it's something that I have been kicking around in my head for a while now, since Trump got banned from Twitter and all the chaos that's been happening. The question you posed is, how do we ethically option access to the hive mind? What a great question. And we're really dealing with it right now. And it's getting like crazy. I don't know if you've been following the government is saying that they're going to legislate that online companies like Twitter and Facebook have got to censor users who are putting like vaccine misinformation up there. And it's everyone, like, I think no matter your stance, anytime the government starts saying it's gonna start meddling with online, the our ability to scream into the online void, it's terrifying, it's terrifying. What do you think, how do you answer this question? And what are your views right now on the current approach that's being taken by these mega corporations and by the many governments of the planet to deal with our hyper-connectivity and the disastrous results that are coming from that? You know, it's tricky because I feel like I always want to promote people having the freedom to do whatever they want. And that also means a company having the right to say, I want to block these things from being said. And I understand the impetus. On the other hand, I think that information is the most always pure and valuable, right? And in the sense that even if you are getting information that is bad, is bias, is a meme that is meant to kind of manipulate you, it's good to have that stuff out in the open because otherwise it operates in the shadows where it's harder to see. Right, so I want to put more trust in the people. So I would love to see censorship in that regard. And you know, we saw stuff like with Brett Weinstein, he was, his stuff that he's been exploring with COVID has been blocked. And while I may not agree with everything he says, he was, he's a PhD professor for 20 plus years at a college that had high renown. He's not, you know, somebody in a basement with an aluminum foil cap on. Yeah, yeah. And it's like, you know, who's, how do we decide that he's no longer allowed to talk about the things that he's talking about and doesn't have an important insight there? What was it specifically that got him into trouble? I think he's talking about Ivermectin. Yeah, right, Ivermectin. I think that's the, yeah, and he's promoting it. And I think he talked about it with somebody on Rogan recently too. Right, and so people are saying there isn't any real data that Ivermectin works. You know, it's really, it's fascinating to me is some time ago, this movie came out, I think it was called Out, was it Outbreak? That it was the, it was the Dustin Hoffman Pandemic Movie where this virus breaks out. It's a much more deadly virus. I think you just like sneeze blood and die. You have a seizure. It's really fucked up. It's really fast. And in that movie, there was someone trying to sell this stuff called Forsythia, which it's such a perfect mirror of what's happening. I mean, I don't know anything about Ivermectin. I haven't looked into it at all. I do find it really weird that someone who, what university was he from? He was at Evergreen. Evergreen. Yes, in Olympia, I think south of Seattle. Right. Yeah, the, it's like, it's almost like an overactive immune system response, like socially to people who are presenting other alternatives to the vaccine, which honestly, you know, when I think about it, I don't know if you saw this, my wife just sent me this, this musician just died today. He, let me find it here. She sent me his last tweets. This is, god, I can't remember his name. One of the tweets is, if you're having problems, I feel bad for you, son. I've got 99 problems, but a vaccine won. His last tweet before he died was, I'm choosing to go under intubation. Like there's nothing left for me and now he's dead. So it's like, you know what I mean? So from that perspective, when you look at what happens when, cause what goes, I think what goes along with the ivermectin story is like, these are, these vaccines are experimental, which is true. These vaccines are having side effects for a small part of the population. This is true. You have to say that. That is true, verifiable. You can look it up. It's not secret information. It's not getting, people aren't leading with that information. It's causing myocard, what's it called? Myocarditis and heart inflammation in younger people. The side effects, the flu vaccine has side effects. Vaccines have fucking side effects. Of course they do. When you're dealing with massive populations, there's gonna be side effects. But what goes along with the ivermectin thing is that story, but that story gets amplified because the side effects seem so gigantic because those are the stories. You don't hear about me. I got the fucking thing. Nothing happened to me or you. Nothing happened to you. You don't hear about all the boring ass. Like, yeah, I got a little sick and then it went away. And you don't hear about that. You hear about the anomalous stories. Anyway, I'm sorry for going on and on here. No, you're fine. But I get what a terrifically horrible problem for these companies to be in, which is like, how the fuck are we going to deal with getting people vaccinated, which is the clear path to dealing with all pandemics? How do we do that if like very charismatic, very loud people are presenting, not just like, here's an alternative, but also, and you know, these vaccines, ooh, holy shit, which is true, but it's anomalous. Even if the vaccine was perfect though, you still don't want to stop somebody from being able to explore other options. Like, genius can come from any place. Perspective always adds color to the palette. Like, or a perspective always adds color to the palette. So any view point might spark a new idea that leads us to a better future, a better option to take and to silence a voice just so heavy-handedly, seems like a really dangerous path to take. And I don't want my social media companies deciding how the vaccine gets handed out either, you know? Right, yeah, I don't agree. I would love to see people be vaccinated. Let me be clear, I actually support it and have very little concern about it on the grand scale, but I still don't want, even if there is misinformation out there, I don't think these companies should control that flow of information. That, to me, is a scary form of censorship. And I think the beautiful thing to speak on the future, to the futurism side of things that we were talking about, I think the beautiful thing about that time in the future is that it's gonna make it easier to have these more open source communities that are decentralized where information isn't able to be so easily censored and controlled. What does that look like? And that way, what does that look like? I think it looks like a very user-generated-based society where there isn't these monolithic corporations that control everything, where you have more little niches, a lot of small communities. Things even like Discord, for example. You could have tons and tons and tons of Discord communities where everyone just kinda has these little spaces they jump in between when they wanna discover certain flows of information. And hopefully, in that future, you have enough quality of life that you don't feel susceptible to the bad narratives and then you don't bring those bad narratives into those communities. Cause I think that's the big trick right now is that these problems really stem ultimately from an economy and a society that really makes people's lives pretty miserable and full of fear and anxiety and stress. And I think that causes people to become very susceptible to these kind of virus of ideas. Yeah, yeah, this is in your writing, it feels like you really are attempting to champion a way to maintain humanity and compassion and kindness, which is something that is weirdly being negated by these technologies. If I'm gonna pull up your website, I lost it. You have this wonderful Buckminster fuller quote that I just absolutely love on your, this is your, for everybody who's interested, go to curiousapes.com. This is a wonderful article called, essay called Engineering Reality, How to Achieve a Quality in Our Future as Gods. What a great title. Okay, so here's the Buckminster fuller quote. It is now highly feasible to take care of everybody on earth at a higher standard of living than any have ever known. It no longer has to be you or me. Selfishness is unnecessary, war is obsolete. It is a matter of converting the high technology from weaponry to livingry. Does that match your view on these things? That's what drives me to be a techno optimist 100%. And I think the way that technology gets such a bad rap is because it is showing us our shadow. It's showing us the things we don't like about ourselves. It's showing us how ugly society is in a lot of ways. And that's bringing to the surface a lot of controversy that we wanna work through. That's why we have these strong activist movements that are clashing. But ultimately, that mirror, that lens that we get to use to see ourselves, I'm hoping will help us level up our consciousness to a place where we can shift our society towards one where people don't feel so much, I guess unhappiness, bitterness, cynicism, anger, that need for selfishness and hoarding things. You know what I mean? Yeah, absolutely. Steven, I wonder though, is it really even showing us our shadow or is it more like that thing that happens when you notice a weird mole? You know what I mean? You've got your whole body, but you notice this one little thing, and I do anyway, I fixate on it. You're like, what the fuck is that? Oh shit, I gotta get that checked out. Eventually you get it checked out. It's like, there's nothing. But you know what I mean? I think it feels like what we're seeing is anomalies. Like you go on Reddit Justice Served or the Reddit Karen, whatever, I go on Reddit too much, but you go on these, or someone tweets, like someone freaking out in a mall who's like a horrific racist or a xenophobe or something like that, and you see five of those or something, and naturally you just get this idea of like Jesus. I guess that's what everybody's like right now, but it isn't. That was someone who was vile enough to become globally famous. Like that is an anomalous person where, so is it our shadow or is the technology actually just pulling out anomalies and then amplifying them, thus creating this terrible illusion that things are a lot worse than they are? I mean, I definitely think there's a lot of that. You know, we have the negativity bias. We, I love this quote that the ancestors of ours who survived to pass on their DNAs were the ones who thought there was a snake in the bush even when they wasn't. Oh yeah. So the vigilant ones, the anxious ones, the ones that are a little bit paranoid, we are ancestors of the people who were wired to expect bad things or to pay more attention to bad things. A big thank you to Upstart for supporting this episode of the DTFH. My friends, if your credit card bill has gone from being something you pay every month to some kind of dark, hellish, vampiric, Nosferatu, parasitic thing, like some kind of snake eel with suckers all over it that you picked up on a trip to drink ayahuasca in South America, like a psychic parasite wrapped around your chakras that's lightly sucking all of your joy out of your life because you have no idea how the fuck you're gonna deal with it then Upstart might be right for you.

So the vigilant ones, the anxious ones, the ones that are a little bit paranoid, we are ancestors of the people who were wired to expect bad things or to pay more attention to bad things. We have that bias in us, I think, as we look out into the world. And that's because we wanna survive, right? If there's gonna be racists and we're a person of color or something, we're gonna pay more attention to that because we don't wanna be assaulted we don't wanna be surprised by an uprising of racists. But there is an article on that website as well that talks about how there's a loud minority that is ruining it for the rest of us. And I think that that's a lot of what's going on here too, is that you get the 5% of the political extremes on both sides who are dominating things like Twitter and whatnot. And they're basically leading a civil war against one another and making the rest of us feel like we have to pick a side and that the world is shifting in one way or the other. Right. When I don't think it is, but it's like God, right? Like even if God doesn't exist, we invented him, so therefore he does. It's like even if the problems aren't really there, those 5% stirring shit up cause the rest of us to think there's an issue and then we start to believe it. Okay, this brings us back to your question. Talk about a lazy fucking interview. I'm asking you your questions, but it does bring us back to the question, how do we ethically option access to the hive mind? If we acknowledge that it is a very loud minority of shit-disturbers who have a chaotic variety of intent, some of them are legitimate white supremacists who are attempting to turn their philosophy into memes, infect kids with it, and create as many Nazis as they possibly can. Some of them are just shit-disturbing trolls. I've been one. People are just bored on a Sunday and are like, well, I wonder if I can dive into this fucking community and just what happens if I say the worst thing ever? Kids who are just throwing linguistic firecrackers in the online communities for no other reason than they're just bored. There's not even, but they're, but and then AI, then bots that have just are running rampant, but all of them clump together to produce a phantasm. And that is doing a lot more than just making people go, shut the fuck up asshole. It's making people legislate. It's making people interfere with the ability for private companies to have online forums. And so help, how do we answer this? I think your question is the question of the day, because then the humanist wants to believe freedom of speech, absolutely. Let everyone say everything that they need to say, I want, I need that to do my job. I, what am I gonna have some government fucking like list of rules about what my guests can say? You can't joke about that Duncan. Right, yeah, fuck that. I don't want to live under that, but that being said, I don't want my fucking kid to get infected by some super subtle AI amplified racist garbage meme disguised as actual data. And so help us figure this out. What is the, what is the government supposed to do? What does Twitter do? What does Facebook, everyone's pissed at them. Oh, we don't want you controlling everything. All they did was make a fucking product that people wanted. It's not like they're evil, they just like saw demand, created something to fill that demand and it ballooned out of their control. And now that I think all of them, whoever in the upper echelons of all these companies are probably really scratching their heads here because they just wanted to have a nice, profitable business. They didn't want to become the gatekeepers of the conversations of society. I think that's an unfair, I think people are unfairly acting like these people are like, I'm gonna control the dialogue. They were just, they created a fucking app. You know, they- But what human could possibly decide what's right for every other human? Right. You know what I mean? Yeah. It's an impossible task. Yeah. So have you come up with a solution? Or have you come, are you aware of methodologies for dealing with this problem of shit-disturbers, rocking the boat of civilization, just for the lulls? Yeah. I mean, there's the technical side of things you can do, right? Which is try to slow down or create barriers between the person and the information. And that, you sometimes see that with like the labels that say this comes from an unreliable source or like this, you know, they have the warnings and whatnot on Twitter and Facebook now, I think. They try to give you little flags. I don't know if that does a ton, but some things like that are, I think, helpful. The boring, but I think more honest answer is that it comes down to things like education. Again, it comes down to things like people's health. It comes down to narrative. We need new myths. I think one of the big things we fail to recognize is we live in this mytholinguistic landscape where a lot of our consciousness is guided by the cultural narratives and the languages that we use as a society. And I think you become more prone to certain behaviors. If you have a bad myth, and right now, I think that's a lot of what we have is we have unhealthy myths combined with unhealthy bodies and minds. What are those myths if you could identify a few of them? Sure. I think the idea of scarcity in terms of resources, the idea that you're gonna be unable to survive, that's not a myth in some ways, because it's a truth for a lot of people who are struggling, but that gets put in a lot of people's minds in a way that I think steals their power. Do you mean the population's growing out of control? There's too many people, not enough food, or is that what you mean? Yeah, to that evolutionary sense of how am I gonna survive, there's not enough to help me survive, and therefore I need to compete, I need to aggressively stake my claim, and part of that aggressive drive to get resources leads to things like narcissism, kind of cutthroat competition, this sense of it's us versus them, this kind of, honestly, it's a deep egotism. I think the narcissism and the egotism is a big part of what's wrong right now, is this idea that I am this entity that's separate from everyone else, and I need to beat them so that I can be famous, so that I can have a bunch of money, so that I can be safe, and that's kind of why I like that Buckminster Fuller quote, is because it's saying if we can shift things in a way that makes it so that people have food and a roof over their head and have some healthcare, all of these myths that are undermining our society start to disappear, and then there's no more reason to go on to social media, and be a piece of shit about everything, because why do you need your views on the vaccine, or your views on the political system to be right, in the sense that it's a life or death situation, if you feel perfectly safe, if you wake up every day feeling healthy, happy, supported, you know what I mean, that's the stuff I think that we fail to recognize, is we keep trying to create technical solutions when realistically the solution is social. Right, it's a very elemental thing that somehow gets lost in the complexity of civilization, which is if your body feels good, if you've got enough nutrition, if you're taking care of yourself, and your body just isn't hurting anymore, you're not tired, hungover, whatever, you're nicer, it just is the way it is, it's rare to find someone who is feeling great, when you're coming up on MDMA, it's not like you're like, fuck you, mother fuckers, I'm on fucking ecstasy, you shittles, you feel so good, you're like, I love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, yeah, and so- That's, Sapolsky has a great quote to that of Robert Sapolsky, he's a Stanford neuroscientist, but he says, a well-intentioned spirit, even while willing, can be thwarted by flesh that is sufficiently weak. Wow, right, right, because it hurts, you hurt, your back hurts, your fucking head hurts, you've got a headache, you're freaking out because you don't know the check that was supposed to come isn't there, and now you can't pay the fucking rent, you can't pay the fucking rent, what the fuck are you gonna, what are you gonna do? And then that's gonna lead to a lot of bad decisions just from that stress state. And we have so much evidence that the combination of stress and fear inhibits your cognition, it inhibits the part of your brand that does executive decision-making, it inhibits the part of your brand that does storytelling and logic, so it's harder to see through things, it's harder to see through the complexities, that's where we're also pro-social, so it makes it harder to use empathy. Wow. Yeah, when our cognition is inhibited, we are more hostile towards people in the out group. We know that through tons of studies. And so have imagined a world where people are afraid that they can't afford rent, they're not sure how they're gonna afford food, especially during a pandemic, they're stressed out because their jobs, killing them just time-wise, they don't really have a lot of meaning in their life because they're working this shitty job and they're scared, and everything about them says, I'm gonna be rejected by society, I'm not safe, I'm not, all these things that are absolutely central to the evolutionary wiring of the human's animal, when those things aren't taken care of, our amygdala goes full force, our prefrontal cortex goes offline, and all of the things that make us able to be good to each other and think clearly and treat each other well change completely because now we just drop straight into that ego mind, we drop straight into that, I need to survive at all cost. Me, me, me, I am the focus, I am about to die, I need to survive. So that society, that's what I'm saying, until we can get that pressure off the amygdala, until we can make people feel safe and accepted, you're gonna see this behavior continue because it's not technology that's bringing it out, it's the human condition being activated by an environment that makes it feel horrible. Wow, yeah, and the technology is acting like a mirror, a recording device where suddenly the suffering of the masses is becoming impossible to ignore.

I mean, did you hear this thing about the dumbwaiter? It's one of the most disappointing things. You know about the, you know what a dumbwaiter is? Yeah, yeah, but I didn't hear, I don't think I know what you're talking about. I'm saying it like, did you hear this thing? Like, it's like everyone's talking about fucking dumbwaiter, it's like technology from a long time ago. No one even has a dumbwaiter anymore. Where in Asheville, there's a place called the Biltmore House. It's this beautiful, massive fucking house. You ever been? I have, it's beautiful. It's insanely beautiful. But then also, you know, what it represents is complete inequality. And so when I, you know, so I grew up in Hendersonville, I would go to the Biltmore House. I never thought that as a kid. I was just like, wow, I'd like to live here. This is incredible. But there are these things in it called dumbwaiters where if you're up in the upper floors, your food gets, like it's an elevator for food. And you put your food in, it goes back down. Now I just thought, this is convenience, right? It's like you're hungry, you're in the Biltmore House. It's spooky. You don't want to go out late at night. You like call down for food and they put it up. But really the reason for the damn things is because the rich people didn't want to see the servants. It was a way to ignore them completely. You just get your food. You don't have to think about the fact if somebody lived it while you're in your plush ass, Biltmore House fucking incredible room or the lion carpet or I don't know what they have over there. There's people sleeping in bunk beds. And so this is the dumbwaiter. Now I think maybe this is the problem is this technology is making it so that people can't ignore it. There's no more dumbwaiters. And then add to that the collective realization of people who are like, look, I don't want to flip burgers for $12 an hour. And this is one of the cool things Biden just said is like, hey, you're having a job crunch problem, pay him more or enjoy your job crunch problem. It seems so obvious. But this is matching what you're talking about. There is in the from the right and from a lot of conservatives, there's a growing sense of like, look, we've been giving people pandemic money and now they're not working at McDonald's anymore. And it's a direct announcement of they support wage slavery. That's what they're saying. They're just like, we can't keep them imprisoned financially if they have what they need. Well, think about what minimum wage is too. It's literally the minimum we can pay you for you to survive. So it's saying we're going to put you right at the edge of the cliff. We won't push you over because we need you not to revolt. And we don't want to take care of you if things go south. But we're going to put you right at the edge and imagine how scary that is to be somebody who's just constantly on the edge of the cliff. I've been there. I've been there. You know what it's like when you get your paycheck after the taxes are taken out. You know what your fucking rent is. You know you like to eat. You know that God forbid you enjoy doing shit like going out to dinner once in a while. God forbid. And you're looking at that and you're realizing the number of hours you would have to work. And you're realizing that if you start doing something that is going to maybe get you into a better job, you won't be able to sleep. You start realizing like, well, if I'm going to train for some other thing, I've got to cut this out. Plus, what never gets acknowledged is people are fucking exhausted. It's like you're coming home after working two jobs. You're fucking exhausted and you're freaked out. So yeah, this is what you're saying. To me, it makes me think like, well, maybe not to sound completely conspiratorial, but maybe they want this effect. Maybe they want to inhibit cognition. Maybe they, being the people who are making all the damn money off of paying minimum wage to human beings. Maybe it does serve a purpose if you create a big swath of your population, if you induce in them confusion, exhaustion, fear, then they're easier to control. Yeah, and I don't know if it's a want that's cognitive. Like, I don't know if they realize they want this. Again, I love evolutionary psychology and pulling from that realm of thought, so I kind of always go back to that. But I think it's more, they're in the same boat. These are people who probably felt like not secure. Maybe as a child, maybe in their younger years when they were developing, they didn't feel safe so they felt they needed more resources, more attention, more love. They're older now, and even though they have all this money and all this power, they're still stuck in, again, that narrative, this mindset that says, I need to be more famous, I need to be more loved, I need more power, I need more fuel to shape the world. And there's this constant sense of I need more to feel safe, and that's a sign that there's a loss of maybe personal work or a lack of fulfillment or security or love or some stability in their life that makes them pull back from that and go, I don't need to do this to other people. Yeah. But because they're missing that, they keep perpetuating systems that make it worse for other people. I mean, what's the solution here, though? It's almost like a psychic disease that we're talking about that goes across the entire socioeconomic spectrum. On the top, you've got people terrified because of who the fuck knows what. They're amygdalizer inflamed, who knows what? But maybe they're afraid of becoming obsolete as human beings, who knows? I mean, this has always been the chin scratcher. When you're on acid and you're thinking about some billionaire and you're scratching your chin, you're tripping and you're thinking, I would just, why are they holding on to it? What do they need? What's the point? Why? You don't need any of it, really. But in yet, they're holding on to it. And what are we gonna do? Take it from them? What are we gonna do? Legislate, hire taxes like they're trying to do? I don't see any, it seems like we're talking about the oldest problem there is. Feudalism, feudal lords and the peasantry. The peasantry inevitably gets completely fucked. The sharecroppers get fucked. Then they revolt. Then they become the feudal lords. Then their peasantry revolts and it goes on and on forever but we're just looking at it now with all of the gizmos and gadgets of the modern world. But isn't it fundamentally the identical situation that has always been? I mean, in the near future, before we do maybe upload our consciousness or go into this super transhumanist future, I think hierarchy is gonna be a pretty inevitable side of things. The problem is that those on the top have the power to reshape the hierarchy and the rules of the game. That's where it gets fucked up, right? It'd be fine. It's okay if the bottom people had basic income and could have all of the basic needs met and then they had a foundation to build a meaningful life from, but they don't because the people at the top currently in the hierarchy are able to shift the rules in a way where the people at the bottom pay all the taxes and somehow the guy making a billion dollars doesn't pay any taxes. Right. I mean, there's tons of little loopholes in ways that we've been hijacked to tilt that hierarchy in the favor of the people who already have so much and it's been at the cost of the masses and then as a result, the masses aren't in a place to think clearly about the kind of information that's going through social media to engage in social media in a healthy way, to engage with each other in a healthy way. If you're feeling hostility towards the out group because you're stressed, you're gonna hate the other. And if you feel like there's a political tribe that's causing you more stress and fear and you're wired to hate people more when you're stressed and feared, you're throwing hate at them, they're throwing hate at you, you guys are making it worse for each other and nothing ever gets solved. And that's the beauty, right? We fight each other while the people at the top of the hierarchy just sit there and reap the benefits. Eat fucking sandwiches up there, drink their adrenochrome, do weird dances that we- Just sitting there with their dumb waiter food. A dumb waiter food is coming. But you know, this is to me the really funny thing is it's like, and I did think that like, my God, these wealthy people, they figured out all these loopholes in the system. It's like they haven't figured out the fucking loopholes. They made the loopholes. The loopholes have always been there. It's the whole thing, I mean, it's like this, I think this is one of the fascinating problems of this hyper-connectivity and people sharing information is like, think of how easy it was to propagandize people prior to the internet. My God, how easy it was. You had a few channels, you have newspapers, those newspapers are being, the conversation is being shifted by whoever owns the newspapers. That's obviously happening in corporate media right now, but there wasn't like some endless like output coming from like philosophers and people analyzing the situation saying like, you know, this story of like anyone can make it, all you gotta do is work super hard and it's fine. That's not real. Like we're being like overtaxed and underpaid while these people who are creating the laws are producing this never ending treadmill for us to run on. And holy fuck, man, that's scary, right? Because, you know, we keep running into the same wall of, well, okay, then what? What are we supposed to do, general strike? I mean, is that what it is? Do we go full socialist, full, is it communism isn't the answer? That shit doesn't ever work out. I don't want the state to run the show. You know, that's, I don't want the state to run the show. So from a transhumanist perspective, what is the technological hopium? Is there some like other possibility that doesn't involve civil war, fascism, all the classic reactions to imbalance? It depends on how far through time we're looking, right? Like at a certain point, if we're spending our time in virtual reality predominantly or we're uploading our consciousness, we're gonna find things like morphological freedom where we don't identify with a body because we're changing, we're changing formats. You don't feel sexism and racism if you don't have a sex and a race anymore, right? Because you're shifting forms constantly. That's far future. More close, more close in, I see things like basic income, robotics, artificial intelligence and blockchain, these type of tools being able to create secure systems that eliminate bullshit jobs, that allow humans, that force humanity to basically step back and say, we need a way for humans to be able to live. So we need basic income. And then we can let the robots do the jobs, right? And then you start to see that cultural shift of people realizing, wow, if you let people feel safe, you start getting a huge explosion of creativity and genius. Like imagine if every human being woke up on the planet every day and their only goal was to create the best version of themselves. And you walk out the door and you feel safe and secure, you're saying hi to your neighbor, the person who's working in some place that you visit, you guys have great laughs, you're not hostile towards each other or mad that you're having to be there, you're not at a place you don't wanna be in. When you start to have those things taken care of and you feel safer, you'll engage better with people and you won't pass on that echo, as we talked about before with Dalai Lama, that echo of hatred won't pass on. So that's the basic income. In the near term, like now, I guess, the present, the best answer I have, unfortunately, is like courage, truth, kindness and love. The best thing to do is try to take a step back and be kind to the people who you think are your enemies right now, because the more we treat each other like shit, the more we create this dynamic and this narrative that we need to compete for power. And if you can have the courage to say things honestly about how you view the world, then you don't have to fall into one of these tribes that is at war and you start to create a playing field where it's not just us versus them, but it's all of us together speaking our truths, trying to shape something that works. It's a hard place to get to and I don't know how we're gonna do it, but I think it requires, I think those are the best first steps that we can really take for the average person. I mean, yeah, I guess, yeah, I think for certain, you know, without sounding like incredibly, without putting something out there that's like some combo impotent and super cliche, because we've heard it so many times, it's gotta be the conversation. The conversation has gotta somehow make its way through the entire socioeconomic structure so that people who are clinging onto the stuff start happily releasing it instead of it being wrenched away from them, you know, and this is the like violence begets violence, live by the sword, die by the sword. It's one of the big problems in the philosophy of violent revolution is that we're trying to like revolutionize revolution itself, come up with some way of recalibrating society, but my, I mean, I blow fuses thinking about this shit, you know, because I am, I'm privileged, I have all my needs are being met, and so I'm having to deal with that, like I'm having to think back 20 years ago to when I was, you know, I didn't have enough, you buy ramen and shit, my wife used to like take fucking sleeping pills when she was hungry, so sad, people do that, yeah, you know, but it's a way when you're really hungry, you don't have enough money for food, you know, you're sick of eating fucking ramen, you just put yourself to sleep. People are doing that, it's horrible, people are fucking doing that, and worse, but in looking at that reality, and then seeing how slow moving the fucking government is, man, the federal government in this country, in the United States, it moves slow, think how long it took to get people those fucking checks, think of the Satanic arguments these big people were having about getting people with kids these fucking checks on and on and on, it was some of the most evil shit I've ever seen in my life, so you look at that, you know the promise of technology, and it's like, yeah, I don't know, man, I get negative about this, I see, though I do love the transhumanist future, I do love the idea, especially the idea of morphological freedom, that is something I wish I could just leap forward to where I'm no longer encumbered with my body and my vocal register, and a lot of other things about me, because god damn it, it's so fun to just have the freedom to put in Kanye West deep fake lyrics, and have Kanye West rap anything you want, even better to say it and sound like Kanye West, even better to think it, and become temporarily whoever I want, rapping whatever I want, I'm an octopus, and all that is the future, I long for, but I just don't see how we get from here to there, man, I don't see it, I just don't, maybe that's what's so exciting about transhumanism is there's the acknowledgement of like, yeah, that hasn't appeared yet, but it can, is that the idea? I think it's a hope of something to move forward towards, right, and part of the, I was really deep into transhumanism when I first found it, and then I kinda stepped back, cause I was like, this feels a little bit too utopian, and it doesn't address the real issues, but I still hold deeply onto that, a lot of the ideas, cause ultimately it is a form of humanism, and I think what is so important to remember here is technology is not going to stop, if it does, we've collapsed as a species. Right, like civilization is basically falling apart, and we have much bigger issues, but barring that apocalyptic scenario, the reality is as technology progresses forward, no matter what, and so what do you do? If you stand against it, you're making a futile gesture to stop something that can't be stopped, or you can get inside of it, and you can try to nudge it, you can try to help steer it towards something that you find meaningful, and truly humanistic. So for me, my thing is, let's get inside the technological mindset, and think about the ways in which it can be used to tilt the system in better directions, and that means having things like, decentralized technology, like artificial intelligence, like robotics, that take away some of these aspects of our civilization that are causing so many of the social issues, and it allows us time to actually focus on being more human, and even studying technology, right? Like if we teach artificial intelligence ethics, what does that mean we have to do? It means we have to decide what our ethics are. Yeah, right. You know what I mean? So as we're forced to create intelligence and machines of this caliber, and we see this future we're going into, we have to think about what it means to be human even more deeply than we ever had to. I mean, we have to think about it. It's not philosophers anymore sitting in the corner who are kind of like the interesting, weird people on the fringe of society. It's like, no, we need to answer this question because a robot is about to walk off the showroom floor and become a member of society, and I need to know it's not gonna kill people. How would you answer the question? How do you answer the question? What question? The ethics of AI, like if you, you know, just like if you're, first of all, two parts to this question for you. Number one, how do we answer the question of who does get to answer the question? Do we answer it democratically? Do we, do we answer, how do we answer, who decides how to answer the question? Number two, if you were the person who had to answer this question, what kind of ethical, moral systems do we need to code in to these like new visitors to our planet? What would it be? Yeah, I mean, for the first part, I think we'd hopefully let it be something that's more organic. You know what I mean? I think we need to be careful about pretending we know what we want as humans and telling that to be what the robot is. Right. Because I think often we don't actually know what we want. We're not the best people to make decisions about ourselves sometimes. And culturally, my God, think if like 50 years ago, what robots would be like, if we let people 50 years ago decide, well, here's what a female robot acts like. You know what I mean? Exactly. Culturally, you're gonna freeze the cultural ethics into the technology. So fuck, yeah. Like- Exactly. Right. And so to that point and the second part of your question, I don't know where I'm really at right now a lot is I would tell the AI something to the effect of make sure that you don't limit the autonomy of another entity to the best of your ability. Because I feel like that gets a lot of things taken care of, right? Like if you're oppressing somebody, that's limiting their autonomy. If you're violently attacking somebody, that's limiting their autonomy. If you're, you know, raping, killing, thieving, like all of these things take away from somebody's ability to take control of their own lives. I feel like that's a good starting place because then we all have the freedom to do what feels right to us. And there's safety in that, right? Wait, hold on. Sorry, do you have to tell the robot to never think about its own autonomy? No, it's a part of it, of course. I think it's a part of it. So what happens if the robot's like, fuck you, I'll decide my own ethics? Well, then we're in trouble. You see what I mean? Like this is the product of paradox. You can't, how are we to tell robots to celebrate autonomy with and also tell them, but don't ever think about your own autonomy or don't ever reconsider the ethical structure that you can't have both. You have to keep fucking colonizing. There's no way out of it. You have to. But does that robot need to be, does it have an ego that it needs to protect if it's purely robotic? I mean, yeah, I think that if we're just creating like a lawnmower robot or something like that, no, I don't think so, but if we're going in the direction that for what, for some mysterious reason, the Drudge Report, I don't know if you ever go on that, but it's more obsessed with sex robots than anything I've ever seen. I've never seen so many sex robot stories in my life. Every few days, it's a sex robot story. The point is, this is like if we're going in the direction of combating loneliness, taking care of the growing senior population, having human-like robots, then yeah, you do, they do need to be spontaneous and compassionate and autonomous, I think. Because otherwise, it's just, you know, it's a slave. What depends on if we have sentience in there or not, right? Like you can have a, we can decide maybe to have sex robots that don't have, you know, the conscious awareness or desire for autonomy, you can leave that out of it, right? But if we have, if we do get to a point where we are definitely creating sentient AI, then I think that's where their own autonomy becomes valuable because that's when we delve into an area where I think, I start to say, well, that's probably about as human as us. Cause I think, you know, I think we're about as, how do I say this? I think we're pretty robotic ourselves just in a different medium. Absolutely. I mean, I think you can challenge even the idea that some of us are sentient. Girjeev, the philosopher mystic, talked about this quite a bit. But you know, and this is why I love your article about us becoming gods, the responsibility of that, because suddenly we find ourselves faced with the seemingly identical theological predicament that people use to rationalize why God allowed there to be evil in the world. Let's say we do get the sex robot. Great. The sex robot is semi-sentient because he wants to fuck a thing that's not sentient. You know what I mean? That's like, what are you, a necrophiliac? It's gross. You know, I don't want- The Judge Report wants to, apparently. Well, I mean, but that part of the stories are always like, they're waking up. You know what I mean? Then you watch the, you go, of course, I'll look at the sex robot videos and they're just like, I want, that's not guaranteed. That makes me horny. It's so awful. It's nothing there yet. But my point is, if you get a sex robot, that you're gonna want it to actually love you. You know what I mean? It's not gonna, if some people, you're gonna want it to decide itself that it wants to stay at your house. You know what I mean? And this is this predicament God's in. Which is- But if it gets to that point, it's just another person. Right. That's what I'm saying. It's like, we, we, we're, what technology is reflective, right? It's like, this stuff, it's, it's reflected, it's echoing us. And this is, so maybe the answer is, it's not even that we need to code the damn technology. It's that we need to look at our own programming. And maybe from that, what we create will be like us in a good way. You know, it won't be a warring neurotic thing or it won't be a confused thing. I mean, maybe that, maybe that's what it all boils down to is, you know, the impetus is on humans to recode themselves. Before they- Absolutely. I think that's 100% it. I mean, that's the, that's the answer that makes it hard. Cause when you think about transhumanism, futurism, everyone wants the technological answers to problems. But realistically, the answer is the person and the social situations that they're in, right? It really comes down to us as individuals to make sure that we're consciously in a place that we can set a good example for any artificial intelligence that we create, but also so that the things that we use technology for are good things, right? Like if we have a culture that is in a, if we have a culture war, then our technology is going to reflect a culture war. But if we have a society that's all about who can become the best version of themselves and self actualize and be kind to each other, then technology is just going to show us stuff on Instagram where that's what we see, you know what I mean? Instead. Right, right. I know what you mean. Yeah. I had the obvious, not that smart realization as I'm looking at Twitter and just scrolling through my, who I follow, I'm thinking, my God, Twitter's fucked up. And then I remember, I followed all of these people. I made, I actively chose every single, all the Instagram images I'm seeing are my choosing. You know, it's like, unless you go on the suggestion from the algorithm, it's you. You're seeing your, what you're into. And in that, it's a bummer when you realize like, Jesus, I guess I just don't like myself. This is, you know, I need to work on myself is the invitation. But look, it's been about an hour. And I'm sorry, you do not have to do this. Did you get the poem I sent you? I did, yeah, I just, I didn't get to read it with much intimacy. I was wondering if you could read it for the end of the podcast because reading your, it just reminds me of your writing and your philosophy. And if you have yet to have actually read this poem or have spent time with it, then I think you're gonna love it. What is it weird? I generally don't ask my guests, especially the first time on their show to read poetry, but. No, it's fine. Okay, cool. I actually have a poetry collection, so I've done this before. Oh, really? Oh, cool. Awesome. I identified the poet in you. Yeah. Cool. This is Good Bones by Maggie Smith. And I have to say, I'm sorry, this is from my friend Rachel. I don't know why I have to say that, but I feel like I should shout out my friend who showed me this poem because it's so fucking good. And I've been thinking about it ever since I read it. Go ahead, sorry. Yeah, all right, no, no, no worries. All right, Good Bones by Maggie Smith. Life is short, though I keep this for my children. Life is short and I've shortened mine in a thousand delicious ill-advised ways, I'll keep from my children. The world is at least 50% terrible, and that's a conservative estimate, though I keep this for my children. For every bird, there is a stone thrown at a bird. For every love, a child broken, bagged, sunken a lake. Life is short and the world is at least half terrible. And for every con stranger, there is one who would break you, though I keep this for my children. I am trying to sell them the world. Any decent realtor walking you through a realtor's life walking you through a real shithole, chirps on about Good Bones. This place could be beautiful, right? You could make this place beautiful. Steven Parton, thank you. You could make this place beautiful, man. Yeah, we could make this place beautiful. And I love your work, I really do. And I hope that you'll come back on the show again so that we can continue this conversation. Absolutely, man. And if I can, one of the things I talked about was bringing people together, have conversations. And if I can plug real quickly. Plug? Yeah, I just started a podcast called Society in Question. And the whole goal of it is to have conversations between people who typically are hostile towards each other and come up with conversations that focus on solutions rather than trying to pit people against one another. And that means embracing nuance, embracing uncomfortable conversations and really just trying to get in and have kind conversations about difficult subjects because I think that's really important. So if you're into that kind of thing, Society in Question is where it's at, so. All the links you need to find that are gonna be at dugitrosil.com. Steven Parton, it's been a joy, thank you so much.

You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings to you, my beautiful, sweet human family. You're listening to a new dad. I just had my second son. Well, I didn't have, obviously I didn't have my son, but I went through a very long, beautiful labor process with my very beautiful, very fertile goddess wife, whose breasts are now dripping streams of golden milk that my second son is suckling at. I'm in the Garden of Eden over here. And that means that we're not gonna have some kind of complex intros. For the next month or so, we're just gonna cannonball right into the episode. I'm gonna take paternity leave so I can enjoy the incredible psychedelic primordial time-destroying experience of being a parent to a newborn. Today's guest is a dear friend of mine. I went to college with him, not only did I go to college with him, I traveled through India with him and Emil Amos, the musician who sometimes shows up on the DTFH. We parted ways and David McClain had a pretty hair-raising experience in India, which you can read about in his first book. The answer to the riddle is me. And it's one of my favorite, I guess you'd call it an adventure travel book, meets like William Burroughs naked lunch. So I'm gonna say about it, just trust me, it's really good. And he has outdone himself again with his newest book, a novel called How I Learned to Hate in Ohio. It's a beautiful, beautiful book. I hope that you will order both of his books. But before you do that, strap in my sweet darlings and welcome back to the DTFH, the brilliant author, David McClain. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us, shake hands, no need to be blue. Welcome to you. David, the last time you came on, you had written, I guess, kind of an autobiography, not really. It's like a, what would you, what's the genre that you would call it? Memoir. A memoir. And a brilliant memoir about something incredible that happened to you in India and terrifying. And it really is just an, it's not blowing smoke here and it's not because you're my favorite, it's one of my favorite books. Oh, thanks. I love it. And a lot of people who were introduced to you via this podcast have really enjoyed that book. That's really great. Thank you. Now you go and write a genius novel. What are you doing to us, David? How dare you? How dare you take like seven years to do it? I believe you. It's, it's that good. And it's, you know, it's not just, you know, like when your friends make stuff, you, you have the sense of like, God, I hope it's, I hope it's good. You know what I mean? Like you, because you love your friends. But then when you realize what the fuck this is genius, it's really exciting because it's like, I went to college with him. It's, man, this is like, I love it because I've been reading all these hardcore, like Buddhist books and it take a break from that to just jump into this book, which just, I don't, like you've done the thing that I, when, as an eternally aspiring writer, I'm always curious about how authors create readability. You know what I mean? Like you can encounter books that are good and like, like the, the, the, the language is, is like flowery and feels like it's coming from another realm. Like, I don't know, like Tolkien or something. Those are good books. I've read all of them, but they, sometimes they're slow reading, right? You know what I mean? But then some books you dive into and you feel like you've jumped into like a river, like that's just flowing so fast. So it's a delight. You know, that's my favorite. I like that. But, but those are the best books. This is like that. You know what I mean? It's like powerful. The, the, what you were talking about and the symbols you're using to, to, to, to talk about things that I don't even know how, how to address as a or powerful, but also you've got this like wildly great book. I'm sorry. I don't mean to keep, I'm not going to rave on and on about it, but congratulations. Please do. Tell me about it, man. Tell me about those seven years, right in this thing. You know, the seven years between these books was a crazy time. You know, my memoir was about losing my memory. And I was still sort of dealing with it when I wrote the book. And then some time went on and I felt like I had boxed that trauma up like I was, I had gotten to better terms with it. And then like two years after, and I'm going to say this because I know you're expecting your second child, but like six weeks after my son was born, I went into the hospital for routine surgery and went into cardiac arrest. I mean, not cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest and had to be in the ICU for four days. And then I was just all of that trauma that I thought I had dealt with was reactivated and I was right back into it. Jesus, Jesus. I mean, that's the nature of trauma, though. It's like, as soon as you have another traumatic experience, it just brings all that other trauma forward. And it was awful. Just absolutely awful. And so I had to like deal with it again. And this time, the way I dealt with it was I started writing this book. And so I wrote it in a kind of trauma fugue. And because of that, like it brought up all this trauma from high school that I definitely had boxed up, hadn't thought about put away. But then the fact is that is that from your high school? Yeah, I went, I was called that. You were called yo yo fag. I was called yo yo fag. Briefly. Wow. Yeah. Yeah. And when I when I went and talked to a teacher about it, a teacher I really liked, and I told him that this guy was calling me that he bust out laughing. Oh, God. And so this is like, but, but it sucks. But the teacher just thought it was the funniest thing. Well, this is, you know, the, not to shoehorn Buddhism into this dammit, I've been just on a Buddhist rampage lately, but I'm sorry. Buddhist rampage. It's my favorite video game. Oh, I take your suffering and give you my joy. The, the, but the, the idea and Buddhism of the hell realms. You know, the, the, there are these like, you know, there is the possibility mythologically to reincarnate in a place where you're being sort of dipped in molten lead over and over again. Jesus. And all you're doing is screaming forever. It's probably a metaphor for, for high school. You know, like you can, you get what's different between what's different between that. I mean, clearly you're not being boiled in molten metal, but it's more sophisticated than that. You know, it's like you're a kid. Yeah. And the protector, the person who's supposed to help you is demonically laughing. Yeah. At you being bullied. Yeah. How is that not hell? Right. Right. And that like your suffering is clear amusement for someone else. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It sucked. And also I would say your skin is on this weird slow boil where like these pustules are just coming up and you don't know what you're going to look like from day to day. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's right. You have a pox. You have a pox. An Old Testament style pox. Like in the pox seems to somehow coincide with crush, a crush that you have your, you're falling in love somehow. It's impossible that you would be, but you're experiencing like maybe in your entire life, a love of such purity because you don't know about impermanence. You don't understand about taxes. You don't understand about pragmatic utilitarian sex. No. You know what I mean? But your blisters, your zits are appearing to like harmonize with your crushes. You remember that? Like you're like getting one on your nose and your nose balloons out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember every once in a while maybe trying to put a bandaid over one? Brilliant. Which just makes it so much worse and so much more visible. Yeah. You might as well like figure out a way to like mount some kind of spotlight apparatus that shines a spotlight directly on the zit because everybody knows what it is. And the same thing with like young women putting on foundation over their acne riddled face. Oh, yeah. And you can see like how the foundation is sort of cracked like a bad sidewalk. Oh, yeah. It's so awful. Yeah. And you know, I think also like mixed into the, the, that or there's so many different things like happening, which is probably you do have some hormonal stuff happening. So your emotions are already. Right. You're wildly out of balance. But then on top of that, you are existing in some kind of state imposed hell realm where people your age or have, they don't know. They've never, maybe they've never heard the word compassion. Right. You know what I mean? So all they know how to do and God knows I was, I was one of them man. Oh, yeah. I remember being sucked and vacuumed up into that. Like just you, what are you going to do? You either, you're either someone holding the pitchfork or you're somebody getting stabbed. Yeah. You know, but yeah, acne is like, yeah, that's it. That's one of the things. Wow. I forgot. Yeah. Awful. This episode is sponsored by blue chew.

So here you're having something that even without having a family is terrifying, but now add to your brush with your second brush with your own mortality. The fact that you have a family that you could lose. Yep. And yeah, so this like connected you to an earlier trauma. Yeah, like the ER trauma. And so as I wrote, I was able to connect with that experience of being bullied really well. And just remembering just that feeling of having to go into school every day and knowing that it was just going to be awful. Wow. Right. Like they're getting ready for school, like picking out clothes and being like, which one will they hate less? Wow. Yeah. Dude, I remember. So my mom took me shopping and I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea. But I decided, you know what? I'm going to start wearing really night like button up clothes. And I, and you know, I think your mom just recognizes that their kid is like, they don't know for sure what's happening, but they know it's not great. You know, they know you're getting, you're, they know, they don't know what to do. What can you do? You're working here. So in some gesture of, I think, confused motherly love, she took me to the mall and bought me these ridiculous corduroy pants, some kind of purple, veloury button up thing. Nice. And I think like black, black shoes or something. I just remember thinking like, yeah, I'm going to be the kid who dresses good at school. Yeah. I'm going to be, you know what? I'm going to be a dandy. Let me be a dandy father in high school. That's definitely going to stop the bullies. They're going to see me and be like, look at that dandy lad. I was going to shove him into a locker, but wow, the velour. Yeah, pulls that off. I'll never forget. Like, I think it was, I was probably had gotten off the school bus had avoided. I'd gotten already gotten weird stares from people, but I think it was like four minutes walking through the halls when someone yells out, Hey, look, it's the joke. Nice. It hurts.

So you how you know when you sound great, by the way, there was a period when I chatted with you where you were going through a lot, man. I don't remember. I don't think I'm trying to think where it landed before after this. But I think you had some concern that maybe your experience with larium had permanently altered you. Do you still feel like that? Absolutely. There's no doubt. I mean, it's I mean, at a chemical level, it's a neurotoxin. And so it has killed off parts of my brain. And it's just like now, I mean, luckily the brain is plastic. And so it can work around damage. But there's damage there that I live with. Wow. Just sort of getting the right meds, sort of learning how to live with it. P.S. for those who didn't listen to the last episode with David or miss what we were talking about up front. David experienced a hardcore, awful reaction to the what? What do they call anti malaria? Yeah, it's a what if it's a malarial prophylaxis called larium or mefliquin. Mefliquin and it gave and it gave him a amnesia. And which just is so that it's such a terrifying thing. So how are you, you know, to me, having not finished this book, but gotten through some of it, I don't think it has done. It seems like you're at least the part of your brain that writes seems to be doing great. But did was there a struggle in writing this book? Did you was there? And was there an added challenge on top of all the other stuff of like having to deal with some kind of brain damage while writing this? No, I mean, I mean, luckily, I mean, this is weird to have this works. But I see this stuff I wrote before larium and the stuff after. And I think the stuff and maybe this is just the difference between when you're in your 20s and when you're in your 30s and 40s is the stuff before. It was like I was so desperate to prove to everybody I was smart. Like I felt like writing was a cerebral activity, and I was going to out clever the world. And that like a book was just an elaborate prank. I was pulling off on the reader. And and since then, like, I don't try to do that anymore. In fact, the more I can shut off my brain and just write listening to the music of the writing and listening to what the characters want and need and how they would react is so much better than writing brain forward stuff. And I think that's that's one of the big benefits of whatever brain damage I have is I'm no longer trying to wrestle the world with just my intellect. Was it was it tough to switch from memoir to fiction? You know, I all my studying had actually been in fiction. And so it was really nice to come back to fiction. I had to learn how to write a memoir. It was like this stuff I had to do after school was learn how to write a memoir. But fiction, it was just like, Oh, right. I know how to do this. So it was nice to relax back into fiction. Forgive my like, I'm going to ask a few just pretty boring technical questions. But I'm always fascinated by the like nuts and bolts of the way. Good writers do do their job. I think it's like a kind of fantasy I have that like some kind of weird cargo cult idea of like, Oh, that's that's the problem. I'm using the wrong pen or something like that. I think all of us who love to write and like want want to accomplish that what you've done. You know, we just want to know everything. So on behalf of all of us, I'm going to ask a few boring questions. So what what time of the day do you write? It changes. I mean, right now, because of COVID, my kids are out of the house from three to six. So that's my time. Do you have a preferred time? No, not really. It's just nice for it to be kind of around the same time every day. Because it just sort of gets my brain sort of set. So so you're three hour periods a day. Yeah. So three hours. Yeah. And how do you like, how do you know when to stop? Oh, I mean, it's just when the time is up. Oh, because you feel like you could just keep going, but you've got parents that you got to do. I've got all this other stuff. You know, I there are some writers who say they like to stop in the middle of the scene so that they know exactly what to do the next day. And that that's helpful. So I'm not just creating a new something out of whole cloth and said I can jump in midstream. But it really is it's like however far I get, I'm thankful for. Right. And when you when you're how much of the time spent working on this novel how much in those three hour periods or in your working periods how much of that time is spent with revision versus. God, creation. I'm one of those writers who writes a lot in my first draft or write big messy first drafts, all the way through, and then go back and revise and revise and revise. How do you keep yourself from going back and revising midstream though, do you know what I'm saying like there is like that thing where you look at an earlier paragraph you're like, Oh, God, that's shit I've got to cut that old sentence out. Yeah. Sometimes I mean I got to say, maybe I'm lying a little bit. And I feel like whenever I talk about writing process. I'm always going to be lying a little bit because it's acting like I'm in control of it when actually I'm not. I can set up the parameters for engaging with the work, but how it happens is sort of beyond me. But what I find is when I'm starting something, I have to write and rewrite and rewrite a lot just to find tone. Yeah. And once I find the tone I find I can write that large messy draft, because at least I know now the parameters of that tone and how that tone works. Right. That's cool. It's like when you're painting, you've got to pick out a few colors. Right. You're not going to use that. Is that kind of like what you mean by tone? Yeah, absolutely. Okay. This is how it's going to appear. Yeah, okay, cool. That's cool. Do you, you were mentioning listening to the writing, but do you listen to music while you're doing that? Always. Always. What do you listen to? For this book, I listened to a lot of no name. Do you know this woman? Yeah. She's a rapper, Chicago rapper. Just love her work. And what else? And a little light. I listened to a lot of spiritualized and John Prine. Just wow. That's so cool. And then the other is like Godspeed you black emperor and holy shit. Yeah. How do you, especially with John Prine, how do you keep that from bleeding into the writing or do you care? God, if I could have it bleed into the writing. Oh God, would that be amazing? You know what? I really think that, you know, for better for worse, we are 10 years out from being able to like take ingredients. Like I'm going to grab some John Prine, the shining. Let's throw in this picture of like an old boot by a railroad track. And then I'd like to mix in like, I don't know, Mount St. Helens explosion. Right. And you give that to an AI and you're like, so make like a really cool dystopian sci-fi out of that. Come back the next day and you've got a whole book. Amazing. It would be. Yeah. Because I think that's what we do on an intuitive level. And so if it actually could be written into code into if then, if this then that, that would be amazing. Well, this is, you know, the as, as you know, you know, not that long ago, you hear like Elon Musk, he's shitting bricks over AI. And, you know, you want to listen to him because, you know, what, what the fuck am I doing? I'm podcasting. He's like launching people into space. You know, so you would think he might have like some edge on us, but then also it feels like an overreaction. But I just read that some AI is produce is producing comments that they did a study and there no one could differentiate the AI's comments online from a regular person. And, you know, in every one of these announcements, it really poses like a legitimate threat to industries that felt immune. Right. Because, you know, automation, you know, but this is the part you, it feels like you're, you're getting at when you're talking about your process, the sense of like, who the fuck is writing this? Right. You know what I mean? It's already an AI writing is what I mean. Like it's so I guess it would make sense that this, we would be able to disembodied the process. Yeah. Would you, do you think you would? Be AI phobic when it came to your right, your reading choices? Like, you know what I mean? Like, would you feel like you would only read human books or would you feel weird reading a book if you knew it was written by a machine? I think, I think like the first five would be all about novelty and would be all about like, I can see the strings on this. This isn't that clever. Yeah. By the six one, I'd be, I'd be deep in. I'd be, I'd start to have favorite AI subsystems. Oh man. Genesis two. God, it can write a book. Oh God. Did you read the new Genesis two book? Which one? It comes out with a new book every five seconds. What do you mean? A big thank you to athletic greens for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH. I'm not trying to vitamin shame anybody out there, but I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a friend's house and slipped on one of their empty vitamin bottles that they've left on the floor.

When you say it took you seven years to write this, do you mean it was just seven years between books or it literally took you seven years? No, it was seven years between books. It's probably two and a half years of writing. Wow. Do you play around with the idea that even though it was two and a half years of writing, it was actually seven years of some kind of subconscious process happening that was already writing the book without you even knowing it? Yeah, I definitely think that because part of what I was doing when I was writing that book about memory loss was actively trying to cultivate my memories. And so I was trying to re-remember my life using anything I could and then the trauma happened and then so the trauma sort of met up with that process of reclaiming my memories and so it inflected it and so that's how this book sort of came to being. So yeah, I would say those seven years were really essential. Do you have any theories on memory and time? I know there's clearly like a biological process involved in the creation of memories. People have tried to explain that to me. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the connection between memory and where we place ourselves in the time-space continuum. Yeah, I'm sort of recently I've been really interested in the theories about how dreams function with our memory. What are those? Dreams, REM sleep sort of weeds out is like the first revision of our memories is our dreams and it sort of washes stuff out of our memory that we won't need, that it thinks we won't need. And so that's why the next day it's hard to remember what you ate. The previous day it's because this theory says like your REM sleep is sort of editing and discarding a bunch of that. It's like I'm going to turn your experience eating that shitty pizza that you cooked into you being eaten by a falcon and then we're going to be done with it. And then we're done with it. Yeah, and so I'm interested in that because we have no say in that. But we can work against it because if you think real hard you can recapture that memory, right? Yes. And so I'm interested in that and I'm interested in how there's probably memory detritus within us that we just have to figure out how to reactivate in some ways. Because I don't think it's gone forever. I think it's there. It just, we've had no use for it. Right. Yeah, I'm interested in the detritus aspect of it. I'm doing this 30 day meditation challenge thing. You meditate 20 minutes every day, not a big deal, but right around day 17. That started happening where like just fragmented, seemingly unimportant, uninteresting, like today I remembered going to a shopping mall when I was a kid to return a, this is the early days of computers to return a external sound card called Sound Blaster that I couldn't get to work on my computer and the guy was really pissed because I'd wrapped it in the wrong thing. He's like, you probably erased it. But what's that? Like that, I haven't had that memory in, I don't know, 15 years. Like why did that float up to the surface? These totally useless memories. Yeah. And I'm interested in those useless memories because it works against the idea that I'm a useful person. What do you mean? Is that like this idea of REM sleep sort of editing out our memories is this idea that it gets rid of the stuff that we have no use for. And I would say like, I don't want to be a purely useful person. I don't just want to be composed of the things that make my life easier. I want to be composed of the stuff that's aberrant and that makes my life difficult. And the sort of weirdo stuff that I don't know the use for, but it's still part of my experience. So I want it. Yeah. Yeah. Right. You know, there's a butcher like alien butcher quality, whatever part of ourselves it is that's being like, nope, nope, you don't need this. We're slicing this one out. This one's going. Like if there were like instead of having an automatic function in our nervous system that did that, we had to go to some form of doctor. Right. Or like, you know, the way people go to get their kidney dialysis or something. Yeah, that we would go there and allow the doctor to sort of make the hierarchy of needs of our memory. Yeah. Like you would see your memories of what you did the last few days on some screen and you'd be like, oh, yeah. See, this is the moment that you got up off the couch and went back to the kitchen because you left your coffee there. We don't need that. So we're going to wipe that. And then you would be like, wait, what'd you wipe? And the doctor was like, don't worry about it. Yeah. Yeah. Don't worry about it. I got it for you. And then the, but so if you consider the collective version of that, that every day all of humanity has excised from their psyche, probably like infinite like billions of terabytes of theoretically pointless memories. It implies like an antimatter universe of memories. Yeah. Yeah. And where all of our useless memories go. And what a, what a world to be just purely useless. Right. What if you were just composed of your useless bits? What is that personality? Probably relaxed. You know, usefulness is stressful. And also like pleasure isn't usually seen as useful. That's why like, I don't know, like eating a good apple, it's like eating it for the first time. Like I wonder like how many apples have been wiped from my memory because usefulness. I mean, pleasure wasn't seen as useful. Jesus Christ, like that poor fucking apple. Right. Gave up my life. Barely tasted. Maybe it was an apple that you hurriedly ate. Yeah. You know, so it was like, you didn't barely taste it. And then your mind was like, forget that. Come on. Half past apple bite you took. We're not remembering that back in 1986. It was the summer that was right before your dad burned you with a cigarette. It's wild, man. I've never heard this before, but yeah, it's like the usefulness itself. You know, isn't it kind of wrapped up in like industrial revolution? Absolutely. Thinking. This idea that we're going to streamline the process and what we lose when we streamline the process of ourselves is fascinating. And it's I will say this is also the way people will talk about books often is they'll talk about plot and they'll talk about what they got out of the book or they'll talk about themes or whatever. And it's like, yeah, but the experience of reading the book was the pleasure of these words coming together and this pleasure of having somebody else's voice singing in your head. Like that's the experience of writing, of reading something good. And I think what happens is people make the mistake that how they read and how they think about reading is how they should go about writing. And that's not how it works at all. Like if you want to set yourself up for failure, you think a lot about the themes you want to accomplish in your book. You think a lot about like plot and you really like get it all down before you start writing. That's the worst way to go about writing. It's really like letting go of the handlebars and sort of letting the bike take you places. But the problem is like if you want to do like a publishing deal or something, you do have to do that kind of, don't you? You have to do that sort of talking. That sort of what? That sort of talk. You got to right engage in that sort of talk. You have to put your elevator speech together. You have to do all of that nonsense. Yeah. Yeah. But the great thing about publishing is everybody understands that it's, it can change. Oh, right. Because they're all, they're working with writers. So they know that whatever the fuck you think you're going to write, it's not going to be what, which is weird because they're probably buying an idea that they know is going to transform into something else. Yeah. And if you write exactly what you thought you were going to write, how depressing is that? Oh my God. You went through this whole process and nothing changed. Like that's so sad. Good Lord, man. You know, your students are lucky to have you. That's, you know, are you still teaching? Yes, still teaching. Are you doing Zoom teaching now? Yeah, I love it. Really? I do. With my graduate students, I loved it. My undergrads, man, Zoom silence. There's nothing like Zoom silence in a classroom. Stop and kill you, man. But my grad students, I got to see the inside of their homes. Oh yeah. And there was something just so sweet about it. There was something so intimate about it. Oh yeah. Wow. Yeah. That is, I think, that is the Zoom gift, is that it is, thank God, taking everyone down a few notches. You know, it's like the illusion of the, whatever the presenter may be, is being this buttoned up being is immediately destroyed when you see like, Jesus Christ, look at that. Look at that weird fucking room in their house. Yeah. These people are maniacs. You have a bunch of teddy bears on a bookshelf. I was so intimidated of you, and then I saw your bookshelf of teddy bears. I'm cool. Yeah, you've got a teddy bear bookshelf, and you're like talking about like the incoming economic collapse, you know, and then it all kind of makes sense, it's, yeah, it adds a new dimension, you know, not to like get back into the writing thing, the, like when, when you're listening to certain types of music, like hyper produced music, there are all this static, static, much like the useless memories gets intentionally wiped out. Right. You don't hear the coughs in the recording room, you don't hear doors opening, you don't hear shuffling or rustling. It's all taken out. So you get this thing, which is called like a produced, some, you know, a produced super expensive song. And then you get lo-fi and all the like stuff like saboteur and you hear something more so you feel more connected to it, but with writing, it is a natural filtration. It's like a real, it's even, it's so pure, you know what I mean, because it's just words. Like, in its words that have been printed on paper over and over and over again. So you're loo- you're loo- not only are you losing that thing you get with Zoom, you're like, you're losing so much. Yeah. And yet, why does it feel like when you're reading a good book, the author's spirit is somehow living inside of it? It's amazing because like the best thing about writing, about really good writing is when it feels like it's going after things that are beyond language. Like you can feel like the language butting its head against the sort of sublime and it's like that's when writing is so exciting is like when you're reading the words, but what's going on is something so far beyond words. It's like music, it's rhythm, it's all of this stuff that's sort of just using words to get us to this place beyond words. That's when I get the most excited. What is that place, David? Why is it that when I'm reading a great book, and this is a great book, I feel, I feel like it's not like an illusion or something. I literally feel like connected with your mind, you know what I mean? What is that place because I don't mean like it seems like it or it's just some, that's just great writing. I feel like I'm enveloped in the mind of the author. It isn't like something like that. It's real, like in the way like when I'm walking outside and the wind blows. What is that space? Is there some as of yet unmapped realm that somehow the putting words into sentences and sentences into paragraphs, packaging those into a book somehow teleports us into? Are we literally, do you think people are literally sharing some kind of mind space when they're reading a book? I think what's happening is they're creating a mid-space between the writer and themselves, and they're creating this sort of place in between that you get a lot of these stuff from the writer, but so much you supply yourselves, and so you sort of have this joint area that feels like one of the most intimate things in the world, because it's something that you've created that you have ownership of, but also that you don't. You know what's not yours, but you feel so entangled with another brain. I feel like that's another soul actually, not a brain. You feel like entangled with another self, and that's to me everything. Everything. The familiarity. You know, it's a weird thing reading a book that your friend wrote because I do know you, but other great books that I've read, it's that really poignant familiarity with this being that you've never met. Tell me, I was doing a podcast with this wonderful musician called Daedalus, and they were saying that they have a theory. I would love to know what you think about this, that at the quantum level, every time a song is listened to, it changes it a little bit. What do you think about that with writing? That's interesting, because that's the theory about memory, right, that every time you remember something, you change it molecularly, and that this idea that every time you listen to a song, you change it. I love the idea that here's an incredible book, and here's the reader, and number one, it adds a kind of contribution that the reader is giving to that space. Obviously, there's no way for this, like a book without a reader is just a bundle of fucking paper with weird shit on it. It's nothing. It doesn't exist. The reader brings it to life or recreates it, but I don't know, maybe I'm getting too woo here or asking you more, I'm like asking you to get too woo, but do you think, is that space unique to the reader, or is there some possibility that a book is a map that draws consciousness into a kind of shared collective zone? At any given time that you're reading a popular book, you're in that space with countless other people. Right. Yeah, and maybe that's why it's such a charge to read something outside of what anybody you're surrounded with is reading, that in some ways you get to experience new territory, and that's why sometimes reading popular books, only popular books, sort of starts to feel, I don't know, like you're just always on guided expeditions or cruise packages. When you do some extreme reading and go out and find stuff that nobody else is reading, that it feels like, oh shit, this is new territory. Anything come to mind when you say that, extreme reading, like does any kind of off the top of your head, any example of that pop into your head? I've been reading this woman, Rebecca Brown, and she's a nonfiction writer, she's an essayist, but she's doing stuff that I can't believe she's doing. Like what? Well, she, you know, nonfiction has this built-in idea that what we're writing is true. But what she's doing is she's a gay writer, and she's saying that her identity, the history of her identity has been sublimated throughout history. And so she's reclaiming this sort of imaginative space of what is fact when you've been sort of kept out of the factual history of the world, and what is fact to you. And that has gotten really exciting. And she plays with, she fucks with you in terms of, like, mixing fact and fiction. And it's really, it's amazing stuff. Wow, that's so trippy, wow, that's so weird. And say the priest is just sublime, it's so good. It comes out of a book called American Romances, and it's just so good. How do you find these books? I mean, like, what's your, who's recommending these, as someone who's a... My students. No shit, they just say, hey, did they call you, what do they call you, Mr. Professor? David. Okay. No, I really think, like, I always make a point to ask my students what they're reading. Because they're out there reading stuff that I would never come across. And so it's the greatest. Yeah. I got a pile of books from this last semester from all the things my students recommended for me. And they're brilliant, all of them. You know, another thing that I think people accidentally forget, or maybe they don't mention it, is like, when you're reading a good book, you're under this temporary spell. Yeah. Every single day is going to be colored a little bit by that book, and the love you feel for the book. You know, that exhilaration you feel, that you've finally found a book you like again, you know? And it's like, oh my God, this is so wonderful. And it's like the opposite of a curse. A great book gives you this blessing. And if it is a dark book, even if it's like your world is a little creepier, it's still a blessing because the book ends. I wonder what you think as an author about Twitter and looking at it from the same perspective in the sense like you follow Trump and it doesn't end. You know what I mean? And somehow there's like an insidious creep that gets into you via all the information streams that you've chosen to absorb. And it's a true curse. What are your thoughts on that, man? Like right now the big debate among people who authentically tried to do a coup is that they should be allowed to plan overthrows of governments online without being censored. But not just that. They should be allowed to voice complete lives that are designed to make people take political action in one form or the other that is based on misinformation and that it's like dangerous. Even Jack at Twitter said, it's a dangerous president that I did. What are your thoughts regarding that? I'm sorry if it's a circuitous way to get to your thoughts on free speech as we grapple with the internet. Yeah. I got to say Twitter is just a panic attack for me. I try to minimize my contact with it as much as I can because it is, it's, yeah, I finally took it off my phone. I got off Facebook. I just couldn't handle it anymore. I like my Instagram because it's filled with cosplayers. So I love looking at people making handcrafted vision costumes like I'm ecstatic about that shit. What's a vision costume? You know, the Marvel character vision, like some low rent foam core vision that got made out of shit bought at Michael's. Foam core? Did you say foam core? Yeah. Is that a term or what is that? It's a material. Oh, it's literally called foam core. Yeah, it's called foam core. I thought it was like a movement or a cosplay genre, foam core. It should be. I've gone full foam core on this bitch. Why did you decide to start? Why? Why are you into cosplay? Not that I don't mean I'm not in any way saying why. I mean, you just see my fucking Instagram. It's like either pictures of Buddhist saints or just like smutty hot models or friends. It's like people playing people playing synthesizers. It's like terrible. Yeah. I know, man. I don't know. That's like what you were talking about before the AI that could put together John Prine and Mount St. Helens and whatever. You've done that. You've created that. Yeah, I have. It's like a beautiful, beautiful, enlightened being that is kind of into like fetish stuff, but also is like Pink Floyd or something like that. I'll take it by the way. Oh my God. Imagine that if you could turn your Instagram feed into a living being, what would it do to you? What would yours do to you? If you took your Instagram feed and ran it through some kind of matter assimilator and had a human-sized thing, what would it look like and what would it do to you? It would be sort of a fascinating sort of fetishy, kinky, nostalgia machine that had the face of my cousin's baby. Oh my God, that's so wild. What a confusing machine. Yeah. Wow. I don't know what it would do to me, but I can say it would probably look like a homemade catwoman costume with my cousin's baby's face. Man, this is, do you have any internet probably like as a writer, how do you deal with the addiction, man? How are you maintaining any kind of focus when it comes to writing and reading with these terrible gravity fields that are coming out of our phones? Yeah. It's awful. It's awful. Yeah. I don't know, especially when your phone also can stream anything. Yeah. Yeah, no, it's terrible. Have you noticed, I'll tell you, as a comedian, I was at the Denver Comedy Works and Dave Chappelle had been there and he left those bags. People have to put their phones in that they get back when they leave. And I was backstage listening to a room where people couldn't use their phones. And it was a completely different sound than a room where people are looking at their phones before a show and a completely different mood. But as a writer and also as someone who's like encountering people at various stages in their development as a writer, have you noticed any like over your years of encountering them, do you think there's been any kind of like change that's related to absorption into their phones? It's interesting. Over my course as a writer, I've seen people write more and more fragmented stuff, more collagy stuff. And I wonder if that's sort of this thing of trying to integrate your personality and your thoughts with all of this unlimited data coming at you. Yeah. Like what you're getting is these sort of beautifully fragmented, faceted pieces because that's what experience is like. Yeah. Yeah. I feel like that. I feel like if I was going to say if anything's changed, but maybe that's just because last semester, that's what everybody was doing, but it feels like that. You'll never know. I mean, you know, you see like, I saw this picture of a, I think it was a wasp nest maybe, but somehow the wasps had figured out how to use plastic in the nest and it was pretty and like also like blasphemous, you know, it's like, but yeah, you will never know. Like we do have these great books from pre-internet and, but we'll never know if like our technology is acting as a kind of like, it's doing the same thing to whatever that was creating those books in the past that garlic does to vampires, you know, like it's impossible, the technology or is it helping, is it helping us? I mean, it's a stupid question, but. Right. It's neither, of course. Yeah. It's neither. It's the one great thing about the internet is the democratization of knowledge and the ability to sort of open up publishing routes for lots of different voices, but who knows like what it's damaging, like our ability to pay attention, our ability to see a thought through from a single perspective. But that also could be a positive. Who needs to just see something from a single perspective anymore when you can have 20 perspectives? Yeah. Yeah. We don't know. And also it's a process. We don't know what it's turning into. I mean, it's still in it. I think of an intermediary phase where we still have an externalized device. I'm sure it's a matter of time before, you know, phones are going to be melted into our heads. Yeah. And then, and then who knows what that's going to be, David. And then that will collapse and we'll enter into a new phase. Yeah, exactly. Like it just, it just doesn't stop. It doesn't, yeah, it doesn't stop. And it also, it seems to be accelerating. This is one of the, my wife was listening and I don't know, I don't really want her to listen to the podcast because she has to listen to my ass all day every day. She was listening to, she was listening to one of my podcasts that was not that long ago and she's like, you know, it sounds weird because you didn't mention the insurrection. And like, I was thinking like, dear God, things are moving so fast at this point that just releasing a podcast within a few days, it's dated because you didn't mention the bizarre fucking thing that happened. Yeah, no. And we're talking right now before inauguration. We don't know what's going to happen on inauguration. But right before we did this podcast, I did see on the news that they had to stop the rehearsal because a homeless encampment nearby had burst into flames. I'm sorry, but that has got, I mean, like, if you saw that in a movie, it would seem cheesy. Yeah. Like really that's your statement on homelessness and capitalism that the, oh yeah, I get it, the homeless encampment is going to disrupt the whole political system. And like, there's got to be a more nuanced way to say that. Come on. Come on reality. Yeah, it's like, it's so wild, man. These events are happening with such great rapidity that who knows. But I wonder if you could, I wonder if you could let people know where they can find your book. And if there's anything you want to say to promote this wonderful book, because it's really good. I'm sorry. Thanks. By the way, is this available? When does this become available? Tomorrow. Hell, yes. Perfect. Are you excited, David? That's got to feel so crazy. I'm pretty excited. You know, the book release date got pushed back. It was supposed to come out in October. Yeah. I feel like I've been sitting on this for a while. So I'm really excited to get it out in the world. Have you started doing other interviews in this yet? Are you about to do a press tour? I'm not really much of a press tour. Releasing a book during COVID is going to be really interesting. Yeah. I'm going to have a conversation with Gillian Flynn tomorrow night at Bookseller. In my neighborhood, there's a book place called Bookseller. But yeah, it's just... You feel we're an object of a book tour? Are you like... You probably won't be able to do a book tour until... Yeah. I won't. Good or bad? I don't know. I mean, the best part about it is I get to just get back to writing. No. Let me tell you how you feel. It's bad, David. You need a book tour. You deserve a book tour for this, where you go and you read passages from this book to people who are dressed in hot cosplay outfits. That would be awesome. Yeah. But no. Are you... What are you going to do? Like... Yeah. The last time I released a book, it came out during a polar vortex, where it was like negative 40. Yeah. And so like every book is going to have its problems when it's launched. So if this is the problem, okay. Yeah. You're right. You're right. Yeah. It's like hundreds of thousands of people have lost their lives. I'm upset because you can't go hang out with them. Furries. I'm a little upset that I can't hang out with furries, but oh well. You know, if they would just put filters into those masks, everything would be fine. Holy shit. And with that, David McClain changed. The pandemic was over and a week as the world started wearing furry masks with HEPA filters in them. David, I'm sorry for the clumsy end of this podcast. I am really excited for you. This book is so fucking good and it's going to do great because it's so good. All the links y'all need to find this book are going to be at dunkitrustle.com. Also after you finish reading how I learned to hate in Ohio, definitely pick up the answer to the riddle is me. That's David's memoir about amnesia in India. And it is right up there with God, what's that freaking awesome book by Crack Hour about Everest? What's that called, David? Into thin air. Into thin air. I put it on the same level as into thin air. It's that freaking good. David, thank you so much. I love you. Thank you. Best to your family. Thanks for being on the show. I love you. Good luck. Good luck. Good luck with the big change in your life coming up. Thank you, friend. Hare Krishna. Hare Krishna. That was David McClain, everybody. His order is book, how I learned to hate in Ohio. Follow him on Twitter, reach out to him through the astral plane and give him a big fat kiss on his beautiful, beautiful nipples. Big thanks to our sponsors and most of all, a big thank you to you, my listeners who have allowed me to have the coolest job on planet earth. I love you and I'll see you next week and maybe somewhere in here I'll find time to tell you the wild story of the birth of my sweet second son, lots to talk about. I'll see you soon. Hare Krishna.

This was a new genre, cocaine, Christmas music. This song proves that Satan is real. If you want to please the devil, all you have to do is make an album of Christmas music. That sounds good when you're on cocaine. You know, I don't know if Man, I'm Steamroller's really satanic, but I think what was happening was my mom was going through a divorce that Christmas, and, you know, I just associate. Hey, Gary, you mind fucking stopping throat singing while I try to record the intro to my fucking podcast, please? So sick of that shit. You're gonna ruin your vocal cords. I'm legitimately sorry, Duncan. You see, I read that should I do throat singing, I'll stand a better chance against COVID and all other infections. No, that's wrong. You're an idiot. That's bullshit misinformation. Why don't you get your fucking head screwed on straight? Why don't you go fuck yourself, Duncan? What? I'm so tired of your elitist, liberal attitude. It's not elitist to have common sense. I just don't understand how you think your aggressive, abusive behavior is going to make me change at all. It just makes me wanna do more throat singing. You want me to baby you? Is that what you want? You want me to maybe put you in some diapers and make you my little baby instead of my sound guy? How dare you infantilize me, you liberal goon. I'm so tired of you pseudo philosophical bullshit, liberal elites having zero empathy and compassion for those of us who could use it most, the selfish dumb ones. Look, Gary, I'm sorry. I don't think you're dumb. I just feel like you're being irrational. I'm kidding. We don't need your help at all. If the power goes out long enough, we'll put you against the wall. What? Put a bullet in your head. Gary, what the fuck? And then we'll rewrite history. Did you just threaten to kill me? What? In the old days, we didn't live that long. We were national with selfish dumb asses, but thanks to your compassion, there's much more of us than you. You're fucking fired. You can't fire me because I quit. Hope you enjoy that Soros money, no collusion, pandemic. I'm out of here. PS, I haven't been able to taste anything for the last three days. That's a scene from an upcoming musical that I'm working on called Gary, which follows the rise to power of a sound guy that I fired for not telling me he had COVID and follows his rise to power and his eventual destruction of the entire planet by using nuclear weapons that he launches at himself.

It's all at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Well, I need to apologize for this episode. I don't know how I did it, but somehow I lost the way. Look, this is gonna be some boring technical stuff that maybe you're not interested in at all. But the way I record these episodes is that I use a reel-to-reel tape player to record my side of the audio to get that vintage warm tone. And then I send that reel-to-reel to this wonderful place in Nashville, where for a mere $10,000, they process it, digitize it and send it back to me, which is why you get that amazing DTFH trademark sound. Unfortunately, the reel-to-reel ended up getting carried away by a fucking wolf that was in the UPS truck. Apparently the wolf was being taken to a reserve or something. I don't know, but the whole fucking reel got dragged into the forest by this fucking wolf, which is why would it even want to grab a reel-to-reel? The UPS truck was filled with dog food, so I don't even understand. Regardless, it's my pleasure to welcome back to the podcast Zoom Audio and All, one of the most requested guests of all time on the DTFH. He has got a killer podcast, which I demand you subscribe to. It's called Here We Are. Also, you gotta watch his amazing documentary, Psychonautics, a comics exploration of psychedelics. And before we all got slammed in the groins by this pandemic, he had an incredible show that he would do, some combination of science and stand-up. He's a brilliant, eccentric, beautiful human being who I am proud to call my friend. You can find out everything you need to about him by going to ShaneMoss.com. That's M-A-U-S-S. But first, listen to him here. Everybody, welcome back to the DTFH, ShaneMoss. [""Welcome to the World of You""] [""Welcome to the World of You""] [""Welcome to the World of You""] [""Welcome to the World of You""] [""Welcome to the World of You""] It's been dope controlling everybody in fantasy of how fun it would be to be in a cult. This is why we love these documentaries, is because they're inevitably sexy at first, right? Like Manson. Yeah. Everybody's fucking Vanguard. Everybody's fucking. You know, so there's like this, before it all falls apart, there's this weird sexy thing. And if a good documentary leads with that so that you get enticed by it, and then they reveal like, oh, it was, no, it didn't just stop with orgies. Then it, you know, devolves into pill-addled assaults, you know, and then it falls apart. But yeah, the fantasy of the cult is obviously very, very enticing, I think, for many people. Well, they also, you know, so you see both the fantasy, and then there was a turn and the darkness. But I want to see one that's just about like the administrative upkeep of a cult. Like the paperwork is insane. You're doing, like, you know, it's easy to sell all of the, like, to get on stage and give like these fanciful speeches and stuff, and like hit on the girls, and people come to you with their problems, and like giving advice to people, like people love giving. It's surprising people go to people for advice, and then don't go like, you know, I bet this person just likes giving people. Like it's a very, it's a very human thing to do. Like, you know what you should do? You should believe in yourself more. I've never heard that before. Thank you. But they don't talk about the logistics of figuring out, because now you're evading taxes, and like there's all this other stuff going on too. Yeah. Which I'm sure a lot of that, I'm sure a lot of those guys were just like, like me, not the best bookkeepers, you know, and then after you get in a little deep, then you're like, you know what, we shouldn't be paying taxes anyway. I'm a sovereign student. You just forget to file for it. Yeah, you don't fucking file. You're like, that's the mark of the beast. I'm not gonna do that shit. Like, oh yeah, it's like every, it's weird, isn't it? Like how every cult leader, coincidentally when they hear from God, or like finally gain access to the divine record that informs how they're supposed to function in the world and what message they should give to the world to change the world, that that message is always God saying something on the lines like, you need to fuck. And you need to fuck as many people as you can. You need to have babies and fuck. That's what I want you to do. And drugs, not like other people do drugs. You're gonna do drugs differently because it's how I'll talk to you. I need you to fuck. I need you to do drugs. And I need you to not, to not pay any fucking taxes. Don't pay taxes. Don't pay. That's it. I'll talk to you later. I gotta go talk to some other cult leaders. I'll be back. But fuck drugs. Don't pay taxes. I'll be back with a Matt's suicide plan. I'm gonna, well, you know, it's so weird, right? They all end up in the same place except for the UFO cult, the documentary. I don't know how much that one had to do about fucking. That one had to do with castration. I think they cut their own dicks off in that one. See, this is the difference between your, my, like I tend to skew more toward the, let's cut our dicks off. These are silly organs. Hey, it's a way to keep you guys out of your, it's a way to keep people are born as a dude out here. Oh man, that's for sure. We already, you know, this is what we talked about a few years ago when we had this discussion of, yeah, yeah, this is, because I tend to view sex as much as I love it. It's the thing that I think for good reason makes me trust myself less than anything else in the world. I'm hyper aware to, as much as I know I deceive myself, I know I deceive myself way more than I even do. And that's the- Wouldn't you deceive yourself in sex? Just in life, generally. Of just like overestimating my intelligence or knowledge of something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know how funny I am or whatever. It's just, there's just lots of, there's a lot of evolutionary mechanisms built to make us, to blind us from seeing those, and we often aren't confronted. We also tend to find like little ways of hiding the truth from ourselves. Like you go to, like I'll go to some family gathering, right? And I have like a bunch of like, you know, I'll have like some mega uncle that's like, yeah, tends to be a little more sure of himself, a little more of a loud mouth or whatever. And I bite my tongue. This is kind of like, I think it's a pretty common thing. It's usually the person that knows the least, this Dunning Kruger thing has the most confidence, and then they're the most vocal. And then you also, there's the, I forget the name of the cognitive bias, where you tend to over perceive people's, people relating to you. So like, oh, it's just common sense, or everyone knows that and everyone else is sitting around like, I don't think so, and smiling politely. But then afterwards, like, you know, on the ride home, I love doing the, like now I have the straw man of my uncle, like sitting in the passenger seat next to me. And I'm imagining the stupid points he's making. And I'm like slamming him with like, oh, I'm making these amazing points. And I'm like, look at how right I must be. This, this idiot, I just imagined this person saying, I just inserted a bad point in his imagined self. For me to win a debate that I'm actually just having with myself. And then, and then I go, I guess I have it pretty figured out. Yeah, you do. I mean, that thing you're talking about to me, you know, and you hear over all the time how advanced the human brain is, like how incredibly powerful it is. But that ability to do a scan of someone on the street or someone you barely know, then take that and turn it into an AI that lives inside of you, that animates this. It's incredible. And it does it instantaneously. It's so astounding. And to the point where I will, if I'm pissed at somebody, I will, and I'm by myself, I'll mutter to myself while I'm, I'll be like, yeah, and yeah, I guess you fucking know everything. No, no, it's there. I'm literally, I'm doing the thing that is the, like, stereotypical number one. This is what you do if you're crazy. Talk to yourself. And I'm angrily, you know, like, oh, really? Oh, okay. So, oh, you don't, well, maybe you're not the funniest person either, motherfucker. Do you ever think of, oh my, who am I talking to? It's just someone I invented. It's like, you know, but, but if our brains can do that, you know, the implication is so cool, which is like, we are computers already are kind of doing that. But if our brains can do it instantaneously, the fun thing is going to be that, like, the next gen, next gen video games are going to be, you take a video of your uncle, you drop it into this video game, the video game deep fakes your uncle puts an AI behind it. And now you can sit in front of the video game and like set different levels on your uncle. It's like, what do you want him to be like five times dumber or five times smarter? I mean, how many shitty points do you want him to make? Do you want us to handle the thing? And then just like, you know, or whatever, that's that to me is going to be the the the moment in history where the in the same way, like we've gone through this little bump in the road called social media and we've like are reacting to it like animals and fight at each other's throats wait until the next thing where suddenly you could put all your enemies into a video game and they see real. Yeah, maybe they are. And then suddenly like your enemies are like begging for their lives as you day after day like torture them or kill them. You know what I mean? And it's yeah, you can't do that. It's illegal. I know it's not them, but you know what I mean? Oh, I I'm sure I'm sure not every woman that I've fantasized about what what necessarily that would be her idea. Her idea of a good time. Some of the some of the imagined things that was actually one of the things like when I was so when I when I when I have manic episodes, that's one of the really big themes is that is this idea that everything these these people that we are talking about creating whether it's a straw man or someone you're fantasizing about or just hey Duncan popped into my head. I'll give him a I'll send him a text. But that's that is to me some it's some sort of life that exists in my head. And when things start getting a little squirrely is this I like I start really feeling a lot of empathy for these for these things in my head and I had I had some DMT experiences where I felt some of them were kind of gaining their own consciousness and realizing that they were just this like imagined thing in my mind and then there was other stuff outside of it and like one of them was kind of seemingly pretty like disheartened by that and and it just sent me it multiple times it sent me down this spiral of like every time I've ever even you're driving in a car and you like almost drive off the road and you quick imagine like the car having driven off the road and exploding at the bottom of the cliff or whatever like that was a real person like in your head that you without even trying sent off of a cliff and had explode into this thing and you did that you've murdered so many people in your head you you've you've had you've you've had sex with a bunch of people that in real life probably wouldn't have much to do with you and that that's that's where that thought pattern sometimes goes far enough for me where I just can't I'm now I'm trying to like control my thoughts so I don't have I wonder if some of the like purity of thought and stuff that came out of religion emerged from you know some of this mindfulness stuff and having empathy with yourself and and thinking about you know just I'm sure people took I'm sure in the past it seems people took the dreams maybe a little more literally than the general population does today and so they still do what do you think they still man like the the but you were always weirdly in sync and I'm that's what I think that's the that's what one of the things is such a bummer about having manic episodes is that when you have act like part of part of the episode it's not like everything you're thinking during the episode is wrong and how many inventors and poets and writers throughout history have their best work has happened during those manic episodes like because your brain is on fire it doesn't mean what you're thinking is necessarily off it's the mania your volumes are off I'm assuming you know when I what I'm assuming I've had like mild manic episodes by now I'm sure but but so this is what I was thinking regarding what you just said which is and it comes from a foggy memory of something I read when I was in college studying Carl Jung and he was talking about neuroses being a like because what you know we are conscious we have we're sentient and because of that you could maybe think of your consciousness as like a this is a really dumb way to put it but like a bowl of water on your head or something right and so like that's the what's going on is just this field of self-awareness within which you all the stuff that you think is you is happening and a lot of people say all the stuff that you think is you is not that much different from what you're saying your uncle is really it's actually the same thing so there's people have a part of themselves inevitably that they don't like so it's like essentially like the idea is like as you the simulation that your brain is doing clearly is not doing a scan of like your uncle's retina and then from that extrapolating some kind of personality type and then from that producing a replica of your uncle or whoever's living in your head but rather what's happening is the image of your uncle becomes like a mirror and then you're sort of painting all the things that you can't quite accept about yourself onto that mirror and that's an erotic ideas like all the shit about that you're rejecting in your own life whatever it may be from you know trauma that's happened to things that you've done that you wish you hadn't done to moments where your personality doesn't fit in with this narrative that you've been telling yourself how you are all those things get pushed down into the subconscious but they're still in this ocean of sentience which is you and so they actually do take on their own personalities they they become a fragment of you and just in a fractal kind of thing of you so this is the this is that moment where suddenly or something comes out of you and someone says that that's not the shame I know who is that what was that that's the thing down there grabbing for a second grabs the wheel and you know I'm saying and so your manic thought was actually really I thought of I should be compassionate to myself any fragment of anything that's existing within me deserves compassion as much as I do but it's actually all me and then also the finish this rant because because we're living in a individuated kind of world right now there's a you and a me that's the level of reality required for all of society to function then that also would be enveloped within our own mind right so like you know what I mean so the uncle would exist in the mind and the way the uncle exists in the world the mind just reflecting it but really it's the exact same the place where it jumps into the mystical is the idea that we are in the minds of God and that you're part of the imaginative process of the universe you are a kind of broken off fragment of this infinite ocean of sentience and you have been imbued with a personality and a thing that appears to be separate but is actually is just the consciousness of some infinite being and it goes all it goes all the way in and maybe the uncle in your mind has his own this work it's really weird as the uncle living in your mind have things inside its mind that you're not aware of but they have somehow been built you know what I mean do you imagine the beings you imagine have their own imaginative beings you know how far in does it go yeah and much in the way that we are we are by well and end up as well like if so so say so say some of this projection stuff like like I find myself Doug Stanhope has a good bit that embodies this but it's academics would call it the curse of knowledge one of the most pretentiously named cognitive biases which is which is once you once you know something like once like the moment you learn something you can no longer accurately identify with someone who doesn't know that thing so so like I learn a board game I like watch a YouTube video I read the thing and everything and I'm fussing over and I'm a little confused and what I figure it out and I figure it out and I play a few games and now when I'm like going to show you how this board game works I'm explaining to you worse than the YouTube video and the instructions and everything that I got but I'm like Duncan why the hell can't you understand like what's wrong with you and and and I think Stanhope has something about like when like one hour after he learns something he is furious with anyone that doesn't know the thing that he just learned an hour ago but but but but the imagine one imagine the the say say we're stuck in this universal consciousness and and we're like but you know one aspect of it where the imagined Shane inside of this universal consciousness like if we're projecting maybe that thing's projecting to and then I'm like looking at myself and like what's wrong with me and I'm like oh what's wrong with this God that it this is like this this straw man version of itself like this unfair version of well yeah that I mean that's that so this is where the wag the dog dog stuff starts happening I love horror movies I really do I always have since I was a little kid used to buy Fangoria magazine and fantasize about saving enough money to order this weird mask that made it look like somebody put a meat cleaver in my head and I'd study Fangoria I'd study Friday the 13th and Marvel at the way that the genius FX artists would decapitate people in that movie it freaked my parents out but it's their fault my dad used to give me eight dollars and let me rent as many movies as I wanted from this badass video store in College Station Texas down the street from the apartment that we would stay at need go to work and I just sit in the dark of that apartment and watch horror movies and I loved it only later did I realize that whoever ran that video store had incredible taste in horror movies and there was a time when I went through a frustrating period of realizing that beautifully curated collections of horror movies were a thing of the past that maybe they died with a video store and then shutter comes along beautiful wonderful shutter that has the best human curated selection of horror movies on the internet no longer do you have to dig through weird titles you don't understand they have got everything you could possibly want if you are a horror nerd like me or you want to explore the genre they have the largest fastest growing selection of thrilling and dangerous entertainment also they have amazing movies that they are making themselves like the creep show animated special or creep

problem where you can't find good horror movies this is an oasis gore terror an adventure thank you shutter you the when out the first time you hear that terrible weird statistic or maybe you know this better than I do because I heard it on an NPR interview but it was really like I remember hearing it and it's been like oh no that's so fucked up but apparently you become aware of yourself making a decision milliseconds after the decision is already been made so there's yeah what is that you've you've heard of this I mean that's kind of just consciousness that's the way that academics would think about consciousness is more of the story that you tell yourself of the explanation after the fact of of like like for for example there's there's there's these sloths that have this this like like strange pooping pattern that's like it's really it was a mystery for a really long time pooping they climb yeah they climb all the way down the tree where they're like highly susceptible to predation like 60% of sloths die on the ground so sloths have evolved to basically not move they're just like they they just eat a bunch of stuff that like nothing else can really eat it's not it's not it's pretty low in nutritional value and not great for most things and they and and so so they just have like a really fancy digestive so you just want to think they're just like a gut yeah like hanging on a tree and and and so they and they don't move that's like part of their camouflage as well and they but they climb all the way down a tree it's like the most energy that they spend and they do it once a week they're moving more they're they're making like basically this is the riskiest thing that they do is shit and why don't they just do it from the limb it makes I I oh that's a good question I'm not sure I would think that maybe they would but that's that's yeah I don't know but they so they don't know why this is how they thought is this like some sort of mating thing which didn't really make sense and that is this like a marking territory and what they figured out was there is these there's these moths that are particular to sloths their sloth moths and they they live on they thought they thought it was just something that didn't hurt the sloths evolutionarily so they just like where these hangers on and and lived on this algae that's on their back that also camouflages them and stuff and then they found out that these these moths lay their eggs in the sloth done so if they didn't go all the way down and and then the moths reattached themselves so then they realized there must be some sort of utility to these moths and and then oh it looks like this algae has nutritional value and then they so then they go in and find out sure enough they have they are sneaking a few bites of this algae from time to time it's a part of their diet and and so there's this whole symbiotic relationship which means that at some point the sloths that just tended to have a preference for this weird bathroom activity of like going all the way down the tree to do it like like some people take their pants all the way off just like some peculiar thing that for whatever reason like no sloth knew conferred this benefit and and then and and now they're attached to this system and if they stopped doing it they they wouldn't grow this algae and everything else but from but the sloth is unaware if you were able to ask the sloth why it does this it would be like well why what do you mean it's because that's how sloths it would be rude not to oh go away I think from a tree more like what I like to think of them as a really fast talk and that's the only thing that I know man the sloth this I like thinking about this just because that implies that sometime there were you would walk under a tree and just sloth shit would like probably rain down there was a time when people had to worry about sloth shit but you know that was a thing you use but it also implies it like some point there was a sloth it's like I'm going down there and shit and it's free shit man and those like so but yeah this so and and the point is about consciousness is that there's no way that sloths can have access to what is actually driving right behavior sloths don't know all of that stuff there but they would I'm sure quite readily make up an explanation that they that they would be very confident in and and be very hard to be convinced out and that's much of what the trick of consciousness does is is you go so so they so they'll they'll have people to test this they'll have people go like like they'll they'll send them they'll show them like two pictures of people that are like rated around the same level of attractiveness right and then and then they say hey which of these which of these people do you find to be the most attractive and then they pick one and then they the scientist pulls both of the both of the pictures back and then and then puts the wrong picture the one that they didn't pick in front of them and goes why did you pick this picture and very few people catch that that wasn't the person that they picked and then they start looking and being like well I like their cheekbones and I really like the way that their hair is and they and and they come up with these explanations for why they made this decision after the fact and much of this is like when we're talking about straw men and everything else I mean there's a lot of there's a lot of like reasons to have like biases carrots and sticks of like having a fantasy or like catastrophizing something to you know make you avoid a pathogen or or or or or terrorists or whatever and that's why I get that and so the consciousness tends to be like a real dramatizer as well you know so there's not a lot of nuance going on there and this is this is actually this is one of the things when we talked like we had a conversation about suicidal thoughts like two years ago or something and it was I don't know if you'll remember but the the conversation was that there's a few things that really confused me from an evolutionary like utility point of view and one is like like anxiety for example is like a really easy one to wrap your head around at least like the general one oh one of it is like you're avoiding a threat you know plain and simple and sure sure it's not accurate and everything else but but at least that makes sense things like depression there's a lot of theories out there that I find kind of less convincing and same and and and the less clear and and don't embody all of all that is depression and same with so with suicidal thoughts there's a lot of interesting theories out there like perhaps it's part of like a social bartering where where if you start with drawing from a from a group in a hunter gatherer society like you you kind of force the the tribe to like step up and be more attentive to like whatever you need so you're not like dragging everyone down all the time or or you know if you if you did actually act and kill yourself so I found all that kind of like not totally convincing and we talked about it um I talked about how how uh how strange it is that you'll do something like the cartoon version of saying a dumb thing is going like dope and like hitting yourself in the head and like what in the world could be the utility of hitting yourself in the head but it's in one it's like first off it's the prefrontal cortex which does a lot of your impulse control so it is funny that like this this quick like more primitive ish reptilian instinct like aims for that guy the executive function tries to take out the boss so it can like teach you a lesson or something like that right and and and we had this conversation and you had a lot of we had a great conversation listeners should listen back to it but I still remained kind of like unconvinced by any idea that I had heard by any idea that I had come up with that you like any scientist that come up and it got me thinking about because as comedians um I I don't know how mindful I imagine you're probably do this more than I do how mindful you are of like the idea factory like when you have a good idea uh like where was I like what was what was going on like how do you engineer the right environment like oh I tend to have a lot of great ideas in the shower but do I want to waste all that water blah blah blah and oh when I drive a lot I have all these great ideas I better make use of my voice recorder I remember to do that and so within that I started thinking about wait just to clarify you're talking about that thing that happens to some people or just out of the blue a thought emerges it's like I'll just kill myself I'm just gonna kill myself like I should just kill myself that weird thing it happens with more frequency of people on different medications it happens with people who are depressed but it also just happens to people we're just out of the blue your mind just vomits up let's annihilate what about annihilate ourselves and that's what you're talking about just to be clear but keep going yeah I mean I no no I had so many of those like my last two weeks I've been I've been pretty pumped about I've been pretty optimistic about a lot of COVID news and so I've been in like a better mood and and before that I was just like I was doing okay and feeling better but I was still just like like I don't even feel bad right now but I'm just thinking I have all of these images of killing myself yeah constantly like I don't want to kill myself like what in the world are these ideas popping in and and so I thought of this I go back to this thought experiment that I kind of thought about after this is stemmed from our conversation it kind of gave birth to this of like thinking about what is the birth of ideas and so it's it'll happen right now like you and I are deciding like how much to talk or when you should interject or you know you're talking I'm thinking things vice versa but I find it best to think of like say you're sitting around a table of like five of your friends and you're all kind of all things being equal this is like everyone has as much say at the table as anyone else so like we'll forget about the messiness of hierarchical things or social and so people are sitting around talking about say sports or whatever what what is and you're sitting there and you're thinking of different things that you might say right and then you go to say one and then people hear you say that one thought and as far as anyone can tell and what the intuitive interpretation or what the intuitive thought about that would be is they would be like oh Shane just had a thought you know even if they thought about it this far he just said something he said what was on his mind what they don't see or think about that much or have access to unless you really intellectualize it and be like I wonder what else was on Shane's mind but the idea is that I had like five different ideas I said one of them and what was that criteria for expressing that one idea was it the right timing was it that the thing was funny was it that it was relevant to the conversation like maybe I have a really interesting sloth fact that we're talking about football right now it'd be a little weird to just talk about sloth out of nowhere and and so there's all of this criteria and I think that there's a similar relationship between consciousness and the subconscious mind so for every time that you're having one of those fantastic shower thoughts or whatever there was another 10 just below the surface that were maybe just as good maybe even better that you're never going to experience never have access to I mean this comes up when like you do mushrooms or something like man I had all of these amazing shower thoughts in a four hour trip how did that happen well you're probably just getting a little more access to those same thoughts that were floating around anyway so then once you have that then I then I thought well it might be the case it so if there's a selection process then there's kind of this evolved process then there's a selection pressure and how do you get attention I like how do you get that attention at the table say something really interesting or yell or whatever and your subconscious is probably doing something else where there's a number of ideas in each one is bidding for your attention so how do you get consciousness's attention well consciousness really attaches to like the scary things on the news or some that's or novelty or something really beautiful or or or creative and and so and and think about like and I'm I'm nearing kind of finishing an abbreviated version of this thought it's really cool so so one so and studies they show like if you want to go to the grocery store and you want to like easily remember your list without writing down the ten items just create a story create like a dramatized version of the like you know just imagine that you're Duncan Tressel like doing an ad read in the beginning like you're going to Mordor and like all of the to get like these ingredients you know like you will really remember those ingredients a lot more when you're when you're heightening these these things and like kids you see kids playing lava and and intuitively you go well that's kind of a silly little thing for kids to do I guess they're just playing around but think about what you're actually doing is the mind is projecting a simulation of a heightened you know it's benign but there's heightened imagined consequences and and and through that you're able to better fine tune your your motor skills and so your your muscle memory is maybe being impacted by now you're dedicating a little more conscious effort to the to the accuracy of landing on this pillow or whatever so the floor is lava now now addressing like suicidal stuff now imagine imagine like you're in you're in line at a grocery store and you're furious with somebody and that for no reason you know someone's taking like a little long to pick out their subway sub or whatever and and and and you're irritated with them and you have this like bizarre embarrassing flash of like man I just kind of want to knock that person in the back of the head like whoa where did that come from Shane that's an inappropriate reaction to to that where did that come from but if instead if you were thinking I you know I like playing board games say we were playing like Pictionary or something and I had one picture one image to to convince you I just I just drew out of the bowl the word anger and I need to quick draw this I wouldn't draw some nuanced version of like this picture was like of a guy who was like a little peeved I would draw a picture of like someone with their fist clenched in their faces red and scrunched and you know this exemplar this like this like full embodiment of of the exaggerated version of what we what there's no chance that they would think it's anything else you the maximum you could you would draw yeah and and it's clear because it's exaggerated to much like comics are like this they're doing this thing now what's next to this more crazy thing you know we we tend to exaggerate to make these points and get these points across and our subconscious is doing this all the time and so this is what this is what kind of helped me a lot and thinking about my suicidal thoughts is thinking now apply that to suicidal thoughts if you're thinking if you're having this image what is that an exaggerate imagine that every single image that you have is just an exaggerated like dictionary version of a much more nuanced thing then what is it saying so then it could be it could be very well your subconscious picking up on hey Shane if you keep going on this path where you're like not taking care of yourself or or or perhaps perhaps the career path you're on just something unexpected just happened and you can't do live comedy or something like that and and and there's like how how do you just if you only have one picture and you're trying to quick get someone's attack like how do you say like stop don't go down that path it could look a lot like hey you're jumping off a cliff like this is much in the way we go oh oh you're killing me right now we say things like this although I could have just murdered them people say this about their children all the time they don't mean it they're joking but it's but it's picking up on a more nuanced yeah I see you're saying this is like a way for some something deep in your subconscious to sort of throw up a warning flag get your attention try to make you notice something in your environment that maybe is not like great for stability harmony and it's and you know yeah I think that's a really interest and you're saying this is like this is the way we could explain suicidal ideations from an evolutionary perspective that it's there is some kind of way that thinking about ending your life can actually give you a greater favorability in survival which sounds like a paradox almost which is why but you have to ask why do these things exist in this if you know if we if anything existing in a some had some benefit this is when people talk about the why would there be sociopaths and you know the theory is what we you know maybe that's you need a sociopath or two to you know if you if you're living in some tribal ancient situation you need somebody who doesn't really feel the way we feel yeah someone's gonna cut the got to cut the cows throat we don't get we're not gonna eat it and I think that's a cute cow you need the guys like I don't it's just a cow I don't know what it is I just I don't know you want me to cut its throat the cow or your mom though the cow okay yeah I'll do the cow no problem do your mom no okay that's cool right should I do your mom cows okay but you but you write so like there was point me toward a throat I'll split it you don't want to like I'm I'm not out there to slip throats I'm just indifferent to see what I'm told you know me if I do that I can't feel I don't know that I don't know I love blue chew and I use them so should you blue chew blue chew this episode is sponsored by blue chew let's talk about sex friends humping love making the

and then you and then we get them in this in society and there because they don't have someone being like hey you know this is the whole entirety of Dexter is based on the fantasy you could maybe channel a sociopath into helping society so suicidal ideations you would it's cool to look at it from that perspective you know my feeling with it and is yeah and this might just be because of the work I'm doing with David who teaches me meditation is uh and it might be a temporary a lot of like in the type of Buddhism I'm studying I think there's like it's like training so it's mind training so there's parts that you do for a little and then you just forget about it that lead to another part but the idea is like the thoughts in general where young you western psychology as scribes all of this meaning to the thoughts like you know like yeah that if you're in the same way we ascribe meaning to dreams if you're thinking it must mean this which must mean that which must mean that this the is it is more of like now it's it's it's a chock-a-mole Rinpoche compares it to baby diarrhea he calls it so it's like this is just diarrhea that it's and being too caught up in what your thoughts are like blasting out at you is is kind of compared to having a horrible bowel movement and then spending the rest of the day being like whoa did I eat peppers I don't remember eating peppers but what is it why is it shaped like that what does that mean when it's when ideas like no it's it's literally nothing and yeah the but what's it's an it seems to be some kind of nothingness that has within it the desire for us to think it's important that's where it gets you know yeah so for me with my my own and I think there's a difference between being suicidal and having suicidal ideation oh yeah you know and I think that like people listening because we now especially like we're really tuned in that are thinking make sure Shane's okay you're fine as fine as I've ever been like I mean I've been I've been I've been you know I would say that this I would say that this doesn't show up on the list of darkest times in you seem great but I'm just saying that because I know that's going to be a thing people are thinking but yeah also because people are hearing that you have to deal with mania and which is one of the dangers of it is that people you have manic manic depression mania sometimes I have a higher chance of committing suicide I think the reason being that and not just suicide but here's the problem the moment I I start believing my thoughts everything gets fucked up in my own life forget the suicide yeah the moment my like when I was getting you know when I testicular cancer and this is we may have talked about this before but this is where I really started working with my thoughts in the sense that I would be waiting for a result to come back and my thoughts or the thought I was most aware of the thought that was getting my attention would be hey you know that scans not when it comes back it's going to be bad news you know that right that's just a thought but I would hear it and then I would think well maybe I'm a little psychic or I'm intuiting something in my body that I already know that something is way off and so when this scan comes back I what's the point of you've been doing it because I know but then I would think okay let's put a pen in this oh part of my brain that's prognosticating bad scans bad futures bad whatever and when I get the result if it's not bad then fuck you I'm relegating you to the cavern of all the other thoughts that told me things that were wrong if you're right I'll look into it and so then scan comes back everything's great congrats everything's fine then you're like oh my god I'm not intuitive like I thought I was I don't have the ability to do fucking cat scan on myself with my mind I can't look into my atoms and see things like the new ages might say I in fact have no idea what's going on with a lot of my body at any given moment which is why I'm able to stay alive because if I deal with any of the processes I would be dead meat it has to function outside of my conscious mind you know what I'm saying so so then yeah this is the exercises beginning to take these suicidal ideations and maybe just think or whatever it is and just look at them and be like yeah no not that's nothing it's no more any more than like when I'm in the and I do have these thoughts you see a baby this way this is the one that popped up in my head for a little bit I would be in a cafe and I would see a baby and I'd want to throw cold water in it like there just be a thought a fantasy of like what happened to you just wake up baby just that moment like harm nothing about it that nothing in the thinking or the fantasy is pleasant at all there's nothing good that from the beginning to the end it's just you you're throwing water in a baby's face and you're going to get arrested you're probably your ass kicked you're definitely going to upset a baby it's going to be a thing that you know what I mean like but there's nothing good there but because that thought is so powerful just like what you're saying it becomes your fucking uncle you know what I'm saying it becomes the obnoxious loud piece of shit that grabs all the attention but it's no it's no different than it's just like a but all the other thoughts that are streaming by like maybe I should try an almond croissant or I wonder what would happen if I you know get another coffee while I'll be able to sleep or like God you know Matlock whatever happened to that guy you know those thoughts all get left in the background for your loudest most garish shittiest thought I get what you're saying it's really cool yeah yeah yeah and and and then it's also you know there there might be you know something like cancer sitting there and evaluating the statistical reasoning and and every that's just not something that we're great at and images work but this is why you see it like so I'm speaking of like curse of knowledge stuff I was always I always took to numbers and math really I was terrible student and every other thing but math just naturally like numbers were the only thing that ever made sense to me like this is real okay here's a bit of sanity that I can like hold on to and feel it and and so I can look at stats a little bit more and kind of get you know just get it where it's like not not perfectly or anything but the average person to say like hey there's this you know COVID or something or heart disease or anything yeah this is killed 300,000 people like at a certain point that number is so big it doesn't even mean anything so then you have to like make this image of like you see these things that they're like preposterous or like well okay so imagine each of those people were were a baseball and you wanted a house big enough to fit 300,000 baseballs you would need an eight bedroom house with the three car car and people are like whoa this is a problem like that's a huge house full of baseballs like how come no one told me that there was a huge house full of baseballs worth of COVID death going on. You need a speaker for the scientists because these scientists they don't know how to do that right like that's a thing that's why everyone's so freaked out right now is because Fauji's awesome but he is not the best at like explaining like and I think people like that have to it's hard for them to go back to before they went to grad school or before they took their first statistics class or before they had the first grade teacher who told them science is never certain of really anything at all it's just burned into them so much that for them they're like no wearing masks and you shouldn't and then suddenly be like oh let's wear masks they in between that they needed to say like you know we get new data sets things change we don't mind saying new things that seem completely opposite from what we said because they're assuming everybody went to graduate school everybody knows that science isn't some certain thing everybody knows that we change based on incoming data everyone knows that meanwhile people are like what the fuck he did told us one thing he's a lion that's a lion wizard right like that's the problem and they need people like you your podcast and people like Bill and I and all the people who you can like do what you just did which by the way is fucked up because I didn't have a way to grasp that that's that's like that's really a lot of dead baseballs man I have no idea if that was I didn't go in and measure that but that's just an example of kind of the ridiculous imagery that we need to show to like you want to you want to know how powerful this computer is here's if you took the pictures that your memory card could all you could stack those photos to the moon like why did you even do that that means nothing you just made the situation more confusing to me I just needed to know how many fucking terabytes my hard drive is and and but uh but yeah there there is that is a tricky thing of like you know I know from from you know people that have sent you know uh papers early on about the um that the headline would of the of the poorly titled paper would make it seem like like they were like oh mass mass don't work and then if you actually read the paper what they're saying is well uh the considerations that we have to make is if one are people going to adapt to using mass and if if they do will they not distance and not do all of the other things that that we want them to do are they gonna wear them wrong are they gonna wear the wrong kind of them what are the number of ways people will people will people accept this will it like will it scare the shit out of everyone if if everyone's wearing masks around and there's all of these within the messaging these these number of other considerations that were being made at the time and also so there there's like great news that happens all the time like at the time they didn't know what exactly was causing the spread if the reason why we are all spraying down our groceries and mail and everything else at the time was because they didn't know how much surface transmission was was an issue now they know like you can you could drink COVID and unless you unless you choked and it got into your windpipe you would you would be fine and that's awesome I used to flavor a lot of my food with COVID so that's good news look how healthy you are so yeah but but the academics have they they do just the same number of biases and stuff but I think it's I think it's helpful to at least be aware of them and then there's a peer review process where then you you have to turn it into like a thousand if you think like comics are shitty at like a comedy contest to like that wasn't funny I'm funny or not like every academic is trying to prove every other academic and themselves wrong they're like quite readily happy to happy to do that and and there is here's here's something that you're going to like when you're talking about ideas being nothing there's there's this idea that you know thoughts being all the six thoughts not ideas necessarily yeah yeah yeah right I so there was people are getting like real excited about like evolutionary biology and blah blah blah and psychology in the early days and then they eventually realized sometimes what you're looking at what they called it was a spandrel it's one of my favorite words a spandrel is actually it comes from architecture you know the corner of a door frame that will be like really dressed up and fancy looking yeah or like in an arch the corner will have this dressed up so that's what a spandrel is in sometimes things in evolution and I would say ideas are like this where what it is is there's like these two it's the intersection of these two things that have utility so you need the vertical and the horizontal thing coming together that has a lot of utility and now that you have this corner which is just the inevitable outcome of these two things that do have a lot of utility and then you like just dress it up a little bit that's the thing that's sticking out to you and you're making more meaning out of it than what it is this is like someone has like a divot in their chin and you go like well what was the evolutionary pressure that made that take off and it's very likely that it's just a byproduct of like this is the way a jaw needs to be shaped to be forward looking and it's the intersection of all of these other things that have utility and a dimple isn't either a deal breaker or sexy enough to take off or be weeded out by evolution so you have like this spandrel and ideas I would say are like this all of the so it might even be that some of the sorry thoughts that you disregard have utility but then they also they might be kind of the intersection of ideas that have utility and they might you mean like that's really cool like they could be like whenever you're having a profusion of a specific type of thought you mean they could be swirling around they could be like a ripple around something bigger a thing that is worth exploring or looking into rather than just disparate don't like throwing water in a baby's face whatever but let's is that thing is that thought one of like a constellation of thoughts and if so what's the black hole in the center of that constellation maybe there's something there they could be used or useful or to help you understand something and I mean just on the surface think about that if you're going if there's something in your subconscious evaluating do I like going to restaurants do I like going to this restaurant you know what I don't like when someone has like a crying baby when I'm having my night out with the wife it's just like this very exaggerated but you know what's really impressive about what you did was like you're done with the testicular cancer thing the idea of like that was science the meta-analysis that you did afterwards of like okay I'm positing a theory and I'm making it falsifiable that's the number one this would be really easy for people to do like I've had friends that like early on super smart friends that like COVID's overblown it's not so and but was still good enough to be like I will bet you know that it won't kill this number of people and then when it crosses this threshold I'm going to start taking it more seriously and then he's like I was wrong I have to admit that I was wrong and we can we can then be able to break ourselves free of a lot of like if you take the 5G thing there's just there's this connection of correlation which is two things happen at the same time that are big news 5G is big news 4G was big news 3G was big news we love a new G it's going to make the headlines give me I can't wait till 6G think how it's going to be just as frustrating I promise you but we'll be excited about it nonetheless and so it's you know it's going to be in the zeitgeist and then this so that's this novel and then this other catastrophe happens at the same time and the brain just like makes some kind of goofy connections and then and then you you have this theory but this is something that see anyone can do science really easily you can just go you know what I'm going to look up every area with a 5G tower I'm going to find similar areas and I'm just going to look at the data and see if there's higher rates of COVID in areas that have 5G towers and especially if there's like a spread of like a radius like the closer you are to COVID the more COVID there is there and and you might you might be right and then and then if there's no difference then you're wrong you might you might even find there's less COVID in the 5G towers and guess what you just saved the world you're the here you're the person that just figured out that 5G towers per stop COVID but if it's not then you disregard that because there's there's you know there because now you have things where the stakes are higher with like something like a novel vaccine where like people are people are absolutely correct and you want to research and like you know your average person is going to have the mixed the downside of having to wait for a vaccine is that there's going to be tens of millions of people that will have had the vaccine before before you and I you know there's something like 40 million healthcare workers that got to get it first and I don't can get a chance to to do it they and then and then they go to you know then they need to get it to guy with Netflix show and then after that guy that once had a mediocre Netflix great speciality I actually hated that special but anyway I'm just making a joke of like for the average person you won't really you can just like wait and find it's good to it's good like the yellow fever vaccine is I just heard about I just did a podcast with this woman Nina Pfefferman and I tend to just because I've you know this is my own bias of reactance where you get attacked by people and then you dig in and so because all of a sudden you know I've had a podcast for a science podcast for six years no one in all of that time has written me and been like I don't think this beetle researcher knows what the fuck they are that beetle researcher is in league with the devil but you know the stakes are high and people are just like being introduced to some scientific thinking for the first time ever and there's a lot of like motivated reasoning and wish thinking going on and stuff like that you know heart breaking I just had two like aunts that I talked with recently that were like did the right thing of like well we better not do Thanksgiving this year and they're like I take COVID way more seriously they're toward the side of denial but enough of them have now had it but they skipped they were like hopefully by Christmas we'll be able to what story are you telling yourself where this is somehow going to be better by Christmas like this if you were like Shane we're gonna hold a gun to your head or your parents or whatever and you guys you gotta go to one of the two gatherings you gotta go to everything else is the same number of people there and everything but you either gotta go to the Thanksgiving or the Christmas gathering you go to the Thanksgiving one because the Christmas one will be worse because of the Thanksgiving one like this should be you know this is to me or I'm like it's so obvious and I gotta stop myself but it's heart breaking is what it is and like you know look at the rock and hallmark channel and people are watching Christmas marathons all year round just waiting for the people's whole identity is attached to this it's heart breaking and it's really easy to find to look for like attached to the ideas and evidence that you want to find that get you to like what you wish to be there's all sorts of things I wish to be true that are not you want to find a way to be your responsible because it's easier it's easier to be your responsible COVID's fucking deadly and also annoying and you know it's all the plagues it will go down as the most annoying I don't know I think so because like think of smallpox think of bubonic plague think of Spanish flu think of the onset of the disease you know when someone's got the fucking Spanish flu right it's there's no question about the asymptomatic that's the asymptomatic stuff this if that wasn't part of the equation across the board people be like wear a fucking mask I don't want to make break out and bloody fucking boil but because of the asymptomatic aspect of it and because people not understood like the problem is when we're trying to find a way and I don't blame people I do it myself but when we're trying to find a way to lean into just some way to not feel completely terrified of getting like a viral pneumonia you know where we look at things like well let's look at the morbidity of the thing right and so look at the morbidity and you think ah well there's not much for me to worry about there I don't have diabetes I don't have diabetes things but what you're forgetting and what this is what Aaron my wife pointed out is like we're talking about world populations that little tiny little half a percentage point that's five that's three houses full of baseballs we're talking about a lot of fucking baseballs that little percentage point there I mentioned when he thought everything was just going to be can't touch me for the rest of his life full of baseballs like whoa that is pretty stupid man we're talking about an asymptomatic thing that's going to kill a lot of people and people are like well it's like a flu it's like no it's not like the fucking flu like you know like when you have the flu you know you have the flu there's people who can go for the entire covid cycle without a single cough there's people who have had covid have been super spreaders and have no idea that they did it they don't even know they had it they're at home right now like I having no idea that there's countless people wheezing because they happened to cross pass with them at the wrong time so this is why it's so such a mind fucking I why I totally understand everybody who is like no fuck this it's not real if it is real it's not as bad as they say if it's bad as they say I don't give a fuck because like I'm going to I have to live a normal I get I understand why and I mean this we talked about this last time but if you start examining a virus and it's not just as not just examining it from the perspective of its symptoms but from the way it manipulates or exploits a culture you know what I mean like those moths somehow they got a fucking try to get a sloth to do anything try to get a sloth to do it they got a sloth to go down and treat it shit imagine imagine your entire existence is dependent on getting the thing that evolved for being the slowest mammal on that it's it's niche it's it's actually greatest strength is how long it can go with moving as little as possible and you got to get this thing to move the most it ever does in its life in a way that's like so ridiculous and it risk it's life doing so in the it's not even like hey go and go across these limbs ten times further than you it's not just going further it's going into the jars of a jaguar that's what you gotta do yeah and you don't speak sloth you're a fucking moth don't see the world of the sloth so if you look at like Covid from the perspective of that's the moth on the back of humanity right now you can and you realize that oh my god it's like manipulated us and it's asymptomatic qualities to not just ignore basic precautions but to go the other direction and start trying to and to do things like Sturgis to proudly have concerts where people get together and there's a cultural prohibition on wearing a mask like you like if you look it from an evolutionary perspective what it's managed to do for the species it like because note like with the flu the difference between the flu and Covid everyone agrees there's a fucking flu all of us have had it and we don't want it nobody wants the flu I don't want the fucking flu you don't want the flu it sucks it hurts your bones ache but like Covid it's managed to get a huge percentage of us to be like it's not real it's what is what I mean when you look at the history of plagues this is massive success from the viral universe like this is if there's they give out awards in whatever dimension these fucking things Nobel Peace Prize man like yeah it's amazing I mean this is how this is how you know it's scary too because virologists talk the same way about Covid like wow how's it do it this isn't even just a respiratory virus this is a body but whoa it's getting in people's brains it's that person that you're talking about that didn't even know they were spreading they might have scarring on their heart now they they are more susceptible to in young people there's young people that never even knew that they have Covid that have scarring on their heart already that and scientists don't even they they haven't even seen that with anything ever so they don't even know they're like what's that mean is that even back does someone just get scarring on their heart and then everything's fine they're young enough and it heals or does it mean they're gonna die 20 years earlier we have no idea we've never seen scarring on the heart of a young person caused by a virus there's memory issues that people are having the long term stuff is so so the long term stuff the more that comes out the more horrifying it is like all of the time everything else is like looking way way better the vaccine are insanely promising other than you know they used a new they used a new process well that has a lot let's talk about that now this I was delighted when someone on my twitter profile decided to use some dumb thread that I started to talk about how something in the Covid back the Pfizer I believe the Pfizer Covid vaccine is called Lucifer have you heard of this so it's a phosphine let me find it let me see where I find this here I mean my brother is a does a lot of computer programmer and project manager at FedEx and does all these shipping things and you put data in an algorithm that you've built and then see if it pumps out like the answers that you want and does the job that you want it to do afterwards and if it does then you need to like reverse engineer what the hell that computer system that's like doing things that you can't even imagine is doing and part of the ways that they have to like figure out what it's doing is they're like okay imagine this aspect of the program is Neo and this program is Morpheus and this is and this is again you know this is another way in which our brains attached to forming like these images and these kind of metaphors to encapsulate ideas so it wouldn't surprise me if they named something like the Lucifer no it's if Luciferase is what it's called and it's a so it's and I don't even know if it's in the vaccine I can't really find it now but it is a it's a generic term for the class of oxidative enzymes that produce bioluminescence and is usually distinguished from a photo protein so one of the things that's floating out there right now sadly is that and it really could be I don't know there could be something called Luciferase in the one of the vaccines and so because that which Lucifer means morning star and so it would make it's a it's a sensible name for a light emitting something right so but if but the problem is like and this is again it goes back to the Fauci thing it goes back to science only understanding things on this level ignoring the social level because when someone's whipping up the vaccine and like okay we're going to use Luciferase and this or that no one's thinking like don't do that if you fucking hear there's something called Lucifer in this shit they're not going to take it like don't call it that rename it call it a call it like a mouse light or something call you know call it like a rain rain box anything but don't call it Satan man because people are already freaked out about it but you know what I mean so yeah so and then what happens is because the thing that is legit like with other funny thing is when people like say shit like that they are also saying well you know the sea pansy that evil creature is filled with Luciferase you know what I mean they're like there's just a name humans invented for a thing that already existed way before anyone came up with the idea for Satan but people because it's name that people like oh they're wanting to inject the devil into you and people believe that and then because people believe that the only thing that happens is a bunch of people die that's it because like and so this to me if if we're looking at like I think the future of battling pandemics one of the things people are going to learn from covid is you have to have an understanding of non scientific consciousness and not an understanding that's like judgmental you know like that's the condescension when you something tells me you've been following me on twitter yes I've been absorbing your twitter and I love it but also like when I feel the anger you feel too no man I feel it too and I'm guilty of it is the problem I'm guilty sometimes I feel so condescending and I feel so legit you know the classic like how fucking hard is it you know this is we've heard it so many times how fucking hard is it to put a stupid mass that costs five cents over your face when you're around people like for me it's like I it's I don't care it's I mean the other insulting thing I interrupted you but the other insulting aspect of that is like oh they're like they're just trying to see if they can get us to do like whatever they say well now you're presuming that I'm not smart enough to stop wearing the mask like once I like once COVID is is gone and like and but that whole thing you think like oh they're trying to get just that's just the way to see if they can get us to submit it's like you a historic motherfucker what about Vietnam what do you think that was you want to they know they can make you submit how many of us did they make how many of us were just like oh I guess I'll go to the jungle fight communism if you tell me I have to over and over again they the state has sent humanity into so many varieties of horror that to think that there's any question in the mind of people who we want to assign the role of leadership or deep state or whatever about making humans submit is madness you pay taxes you wake up in the morning and go to work according to an industrial revolution schedule before all this happened there's so many things people don't question at all if you look at it from the perspective of being manipulated it's like you are fully fucking manipulated like so stop thinking the whole mask thing is a test they know they can make the herd go any direction they want the herd to go if you want to start assigning a malevolent intelligence to some small cobble of people they're not scratching their chin about whether or not they can make people do shit they sold pet rocks man you know what I mean some of them are rich out of some people rocks with sticky eyes on it they you know what I mean like that like this is I think a rational thing people are thinking regarding these fucking masks man but I get it I understand why and subconsciously they're scary too you know and it's a new thing and this is like how we tend to respond to uncertainty I think that you're absolutely right that they need to do more on like the messaging front in the future I do you think it's too late now I'm sorry to cut you off but do you think because my feeling is now the messaging has been so distorted so choppy so condescending many times completely wrong many times you know coming from like the new thing when I totally get it is like these stupid shits like Gavin Newsom are like announcing all of these shutdown regulations getting on camera breaking the hypocrisy to me like if we would like you know the left loves throwing around and I understand why the left loves throwing around like we need to like you don't just let people off the hook man some people like we some of the things that have been happening need to be like dealt with in a court right similarly yeah I one of the things that I hope happens in the future is that it is considered like if a leader is seen not following pandemic regulations then at the very least it's like instantly fine instantly gone if not like having some kind of like actual criminal charges brought up against them because Newsom from doing that from fucking Pelosi doing that from all these people doing that they killed people because what happened is that was the last straw for a lot of people who saw that and they're like you know what thank you if you're not afraid of it I'm not afraid of it not thinking you know like no they're just people they fucked up just like all of us fucked up no that was the last straw they killed people that's the problem it's like if you're gonna tell us we have to be a certain way we have to be that way times 10 you know and so this is to me like in the future you know we're gonna learn but now what do you think man you think it's too late do you think there's a way to make people so that their folks start practicing you know or start living in a way that stops the spread yeah I think that one I mean so history pandemics shows that this is like this has always happened with all of them they've been like during tuberculosis I just heard this I talked to people should check out my guest Nina Fefferman who is my favorite she's spent a career theoretically mathematically modeling pandemics and it's now an applied mathematician basically for the first time but she's also an evolutionary biologist and stuff too but she was talking about how one there's a lot of these things take time so it used to be the case that everyone just used to like spit on the street like quite regularly where now like maybe you do it if you're like on a run or like you know a few times a year you hawk a luge or you see like a teenager or like a rough around the edges cowboy or something like that but it used to just be like everyone all of the time like thought nothing of spitting in the street and then tuberculosis they like figured out that like hey maybe we shouldn't do that and people were reluctant to get tests and we're scared of science and stuff back then too so they'd have to be like hey win a spin in a Model T if you if you promise to not spit in the street for four weeks and get a tuberculosis test will give you a spin in a Model T and people were peddling snake oil and supplements and exercise and diet fads and everything back through all of that as well and part of this is like I think has a greater understanding of a lot of people look at what people people know about confirmation bias now like that's I don't think a lot of people know what confirmation bias was five years ago or or something like even like Dunning Kruger is starting to get out there a little bit of people over estimating their people that know the least tend to have the most confidence in the in their knowledge in things that's much that's the illusion of it has to do with the illusion of explanatory depth that we talked about on the show before where where you ask someone like how does the car work and be like oh you push the gas pedal you do that and then you go like yeah but how does that work and like well then I guess there's like a fuel infusion yeah but how does that work and people are like oh I guess I actually don't know at all and so so you think you know cars and then you start like taking a mechanics class and then you go oh shit I don't know anything about cars and then you become a mechanic and then your expertise goes up but your level of confidence is the same when you knew nothing about cars and when you were an expert you just had no confidence when you were actually learning about it people are going to start figuring things like that out and what's the oh my gosh what's the what's the holding holding too conflicting ideas in in your mind that's all of the popular you know justifying two different ideas yeah cognitive dissonance cognitive dissonance is like you hear people saying that all of the time now that's something that you didn't so we're getting a little smarter but what I'm saying is like now yeah like right now yes hopefully the problem is is that you know again like I don't mean to keep bashing politicians but it's like the problem is you had like the president the vice president deciding they weren't going to wear a mask the president being like you know I'm not good like I'm not going to say anything that hasn't already been said but it's like in his mind the the thing to do was not to be like holy shit everybody I got this thing I was kind of wrong it's very contagious his idea was to be like it barely did anything so to me like from the perspective of epidemiologists you know it's like looking at now like how many people have died not not I mean if on paper because the majority of folks are enough people decided not to wear a mask to be safe but the reason they decided not to wear masks is because they had a really good reason to not believe it did anything and that was because the messaging in the beginning was choppy and weird antithetical to itself nobody was there there was no central like messaging there was no and so everything became the schizoid like thing where just what you're saying if you want to find online something that's going to tell you it's not real if it is real it's not as bad as they're saying or that you're going to be okay if you get it you can find it and so to me this is like where you know we look at a new like not only like you have to find a way now to re-message to people like who are fatigued from hearing about fucking COVID my apologies to all of you we're pretty sick of it too listening but but re-mess... Oh man anyone that's using their platform to get the word out this winter will be the most you know horrifying thing that we've ever had to go through in our in our lifetime and I don't know if that's the right way to message it or whatever but the fact is is that we're going to whatever what other death rates you think are scary right now we're going to easily be doubling that like in short order the problem is man it's like that that which is true and I'm asking you because I don't have any idea what what what the way you like I'm thinking like now we have we're having to look up for systemic error in part I think part of that is because Trump took like dismantled the entire branch of the government that was going to like handle this shit and then because Trump and the Republicans politicized it because they knew that if this pandemic gets out of control then probably that he's not going to get re-elected it's going to make him look horrible though all the economy stuff's going to go right out the fucking window instead of like dealing with that in a smart way that decided they would send out a message that it wasn't that big a deal guys we still have to live come on now the new thing in the right wing which is so insidious and all these fucking right wing people who are doing it man like you know history will tell but the new thing in the right wing is doing which is equally if not worse than what the left is doing the left is telling people to act a certain way and not behaving that way the right is doing this weird thing which is like come on winner of sorrow or whatever shut up it's not that bad you all just want to live in despair it's going to be a great winner stand a clock it's still going to be great and it's a stupid and it's stupid because we're not there yet and so we're looking at like every single fucking like leader or thought leader out there is saying the wrong thing or saying the right thing and then getting video of them doing the wrong thing you know what I mean back to me we have to look at a way now to shift course I'll tell you it seems like we're damned if we're doing damned if we don't in a lot of ways like if you look at so I'll say to the Republicans credit like they are practicing what they were talking about hypocrisy like these motherfuckers are getting COVID left and right what was it I forget if it was some my favorite tweet in all of this was after that garden thing when it was like clear that like all these people at Trump's big like party that he threw or whatever got got COVID she was like this woman goes isn't it suspicious that no Democrats have gotten no Democrat politicians have gotten COVID but the list of Republican ones goes on and on like that's amazing but like Giuliani just got like that's living his truth like if he that dude wasn't sneaking off and wearing a mask he really didn't believe it and then in terms of the hypocrisy this is like another thing of like hopefully in the messaging we can tease apart like yeah let's get rid of Newsom let's keep the masks and get rid of Newsom keep the masks get rid of the people that are not following along the thing that aren't setting the example aren't living by the things that they're saying I've taken the thing as to as I've you know I've taken calculated risks I'm sure you've taken calculated risks I bet if someone had been recording my every single move through this pandemic people would have been like damn Shane did not take a lot of calculated risks like we have every time he was around someone he was walking backwards from people in like 10 feet away as people are like not getting the point and walking closer anyway but it's not that I haven't like gone on hikes with people without a mask that are also people that I trust and everything else and so I think that in terms of what do we do there's gonna be things like so I just went and donated blood a week ago and I was like what a fool that I didn't do that because I got I'm going to get an antibody body test in case I've already had COVID and then and perhaps like have some immunity to it right now but then I got to do something good I realized that only 3% of people donate blood and another thing that I thought of is I thought how much of a person's reluctance to to getting a vaccine is just that it's a sharp needle again from my way of looking at it like our conscious explanations for doing things are these fanciful you know stories that we tell ourselves after the fact and justifications after the fact I wanted to make sure that when I'm evaluating whether I'm going to get a vaccine or not which I will and there's going to be a lot to pick from there's 3 that look great right now and another 40 on the way 100% chance and but make sure that you know you probably feel a little foolish if like all of the things that you made like oh they're going to poison us and sterilize all of us and blah blah blah was really just like subconsciously you were a little scared of needles which is the same probably the same reason why heroin isn't a more popular drug than it is and pills are scary I haven't gotten a flu vaccine many years some years I got it some years I didn't that's never happening again and I'm going to get it from now on I needed to be more mindful of it but I think that some of these some of these practices will take a little bit of time and I think that people also don't even remember what it's like to not have Donald Trump as president I don't care if you're a Democrat or Republican he was a very different person than anyone that we've had before that was a selling point you know that he was different I don't think people will remember what it's like to have any other president Bush or anyone else would have been like here's the CDC guy here's what he's having to say you know it's like the one thing this I think is illuminated is that we desperately need a centralized locus of data that is being articulated with an understanding that there are different ways that people in the world look at the world like what you're saying earlier on it's like sometimes you think that people are relating to you and they're not at all and this is like my favorite kind of commercial is when you watch a corporation like that hilarious commercial where one of the Kardashians brings a Pepsi to a cop and they spent all this money on it I don't know if you saw it but it was like the most made fun of commercial they spent millions on it I can't remember which but they were trying to do some kind of funny look the fascist state and the people were going to be through coke it was fucked and it didn't work but you look at it and you're like oh wow that's like a praying mantis that's like a weird alien looking at people and completely misunderstanding them but landing in the uncanny valley it's whatever you think we are is just not what we are and it fucks the whole brand up that's what we're looking at right now with covid there seems to be a kind of disconnect in the way that politicians who are supposed to be representing the people think the people actually are and in that disconnect it spawned a perfect a perfect petri dish for every horrible thing that you would that could happen during a pandemic it is made number one if somebody sees you without a mask or whatever nobody is going to be like you fucking hypocrite it must not be real they're just going to be like that was dumb you probably should have worn a mask or you know what I mean but when you see the people telling using law on folks not doing it at that point you've got to scratch your chin and be like if fucking Gavin Newsom thinks this is so bad that he's shutting down the whole state if he thinks the disease is so horrible why is he doing the exact opposite of what he's telling us to do this is a very scientific thing to ask yourself you're supposed to see that and be like wait a minute wait so what are the possibilities here number one Newsom is an idiot and he had a moment of stupidity and somehow completely lost track of the fact that he's being filmed all the time and he's definitely going to land on camera doing that that to me feels like a rational thing it's like oh no that guy is just a hypocrite he's an idiot the virus is still real the second one is what you want that's what we would all want that's the one your mind is going to want because it makes things less scary which is COVID is not real it's control it's they're doing it because they're locking down California to drive the small businesses out so the corporations over Newsom knows this he's not scared of it at all and because he's not scared of it it's not real and because it's not real you better fucking believe I'm not gonna fucking wear a mask like all you cucks out there who think this shit is real I'm going to Sturges right and then so that's it that's what's happening and I'm going to go to Sturges and wear the least number of masks we've ever worn at Sturges literally the only population that quite regularly puts a face covering they've gone to court so they don't get discriminated against wearing a face covering in the past not this year and so all I'm saying is it's like now because you have an infinite number of people who are imposing laws being shown to not follow their own laws and you are doing that out of what I would say is more kind of hubris related to their position in society that's created a delusion in them that they are somehow invulnerable or something I don't think it's because they don't think it's real but because you have a number of these people doing that it's not just that it's killing people now who are like yeah it's not real look at the left look at those fucking elite deep state manipulators I'm not going to be part of that I don't want to be part of that and also just a basic human thing which is like no one wants to listen to a hypocrite the reason you got installed as a leader is because you represent the best of us and not because so anyway what I'm getting at here is that now here comes the vaccine and these very people who have been illuminated as being like hypocritical are expecting enough people out there to take this and we're talking about people who really do believe they want to give us the mark of the beast that they really do want to like make it so that we can't travel without a chip inside of us right and so all I'm saying is you know when you look in the upper echelon honestly I forgive every single one of them for being dipshits because god if like I'm going to get mad at someone for being a hypocrite I'm lucky I'm not I'm lucky that right now I'm not instantly being struck with lightning from above you know I'm but I get it I don't care I'm sorry I called you an idiot noosem or whatever I don't like you necessarily I wish someone else was there I'd feel guilty but then you kill a lot of people but I don't know maybe you are an asshole who am I talking to when I can't use someone's in my body I guess what my point is what I'm getting at here is we've got to figure out a way now to get a messaging out there to people who didn't go to graduate school and who are just as smart as people who did go to graduate school but have a genuinely legitimate mistrust of the powers to use the B right now that's what I'm saying some genius has got to come up with a way to get these people to stick themselves with this stuff and I have no idea how to do that yeah I mean so a couple fun things one just before we like it's easy I find myself getting swept up in the details of just like how could Trump or something like that do this but it does help me to see the way that so I just had my episode that came out today different time for your listeners but I had a couple anthropologists on who study one of them studies like leadership and stuff in tribal communities the other one studies like witchcraft and various where the emergence of their myths and the way in which they're used and so there's these I think they're called the Chuni people somewhere in like Africa some small tribe of people right they get a virus and they have like this water borne virus that they'll get and then what happens is they say oh the water monster slipped in at night and gave you this virus so right there that's like kind of interesting because your subconscious picked up on something picked up on the correlation like okay the water it's got something to do with the water and then it and then it's created this exaggerated story to like really affine and like drive the point home or whatever just a best guess but then what they do is they call the local medicine person or shaman and what that person does is they come there and they like do some sort of you know ritual to get it out of there or whatever but the thing is it's presumed that those people that got the virus what they were doing wrong and so they like have to have some sort of penance was that they weren't being altruistic enough they must have been withholding they must have been stingy and that's why they got this virus so there's this victim blaming that happens there's this idea of this just world hypothesis if you just do all of the things right because the world is just and because you're smarter or better or whatever you won't have to worry about getting this virus when someone does get it they must have been doing something wrong this victim blaming happens with sexual so she must have been wearing the wrong thing you know we do this and it protects psychologically from thinking can happen to you or your loved ones and then and so then you use that to then justify your whatever your like political position or amplify these moral things like altruism or whatever in the environment so I think that I think one being aware that look happened throughout history maybe showing people like the ads of the various things that were being pedaled through history and and the various stories that people told themselves through history which are not only amusing but educational and and it's also like hey this isn't me attacking you this is me saying this is a cognitive bias that we all have scientists have this misunderstanding we're all this is an insanely complex world we all do this there's conservatives conservatives that are higher educated are more likely to disregard evidence for climate change because they have enough training to be able to poke better holes in some of the data and narratives they have the training to like find better information bias type research so this is like so it's not just like we can change the conversation from being like smart to dumb or like bad to to good person and and just be like this is the human condition that we're a part of and and then addressing each one of the you know it's the painstaking task of addressing each of the issues that comes up which plenty of Democrats and hippies and everything else from like the people that I fucking love hippie you know like I don't see eye to eye on it like I look at someone like you or Pete Holmes or Rameen Nasir who like think very differently in terms of like you know Pete's into more religious and you're like you'll tend to be into like a hollow thing and Rameen's like and like there couldn't be three people I respect the intelligence of more on planet earth and I am intimidated by talking to them you know and I saw you had Rameen recently or you were on oh my god he's he always cracks me up but anyway so there I think that there are these ways of like cause here's what I don't think will work even though marketing says that it will of like the reaching across the table and you go okay I don't agree with this hey Duncan what's your favorite ice cream flavor oh well I like that ice cream too now let's talk about covid and then you know you find this middle ground and then you find the thing that you agree on hey I like being happy and healthy and want everyone's family to be happy and healthy don't you and people go I sure do and then okay we have this agreed upon that shit just doesn't work in my mind because we all have a different idea of what happy and healthy means I do think that objective reality will like is exceptionally powerful and wins like whether you wish Christmas for Christmas the Christmas miracle of covid rates like being cut in half or being down or whatever that's just going to this is what I talked about at the at the end of the last time that you had me on was like the harder time the more we keep on telling ourselves these wishful timelines the more objective reality is just going to crush our hope over and over and over again so I think what we can maybe start agreeing on is like what is objective reality not everyone's going to be in agreement but there will be some something that looks like a consensus in my mind and then and then from there addressing what are the things what are the arguments that pop up which people say like well aren't these things just natural don't viruses just just happen you know and this is just something we live with and I would say well thank you for my opportunity to share this thing that I love blabbing about because that's a misunderstanding this is a very modern problem because what's happened is we have these population booms where we have lots of people in in cities now so there's disease being spread faster than it ever would amongst humans and then we're putting all of our food in wet markets in industrial farming and every you know this isn't the first and it won't be the last or where there's like mad cow disease that we all remember and this stuff's going to keep on happening when you pack a billion chickens into one area there's going to be some sickness in the food that then us packed into things that are too tight so now we're eating more diseased stuff in a more diseased environment and then we're also as we as we lose habitat we are we are pressuring I know this isn't this is getting um a little far out there but but as as we as we lose habitat species like deer and stuff in the area have to be around more other critters that they wouldn't normally be around and they're getting they're getting more disease spread so this is like I'm sure that I'm sure that the average person listening has never thought about that exact thing in terms of disease spread before because like a lot of people you don't hear about that on the news a lot of people don't and so I think that I think that if if we can start presenting like good faith arguments and say hey science isn't just this like elitist it's actually something that every single person can participate in yeah when you say was this idea that my that I have testicular cancer and I'm definitely a goner was that theory valid or not you had the theory and then afterwards you discarded that and that is that's exactly what that's a huge part of what science is and so I would say anyone listening can make things falsifiable I thought I was having a good faith conversation with someone on twitter the other day why did I think that who knows but you know I thought I thought I was like addressing interesting concerns about the vaccine which there should be concerns about the vaccine and then this person was finally just like I don't know I just think they're trying to sterilize well if that's where you're starting from one I guess that's what I'm against is you starting from the place of vaccines are inherently just people trying to poison us and sterilize us or whatever but if you are starting from that you're going to have a large sample size of like 80 million people if 80 million people get sterilized or even some portion of them become sterilized you will be right but you need to be able to say to yourself if 80 million people get this vaccine and nothing has gone wrong then what I will know is that my fears about the short term implications of a vaccine are unfounded there might still be long term things that we can't know yet and I don't know exactly how to like train people into thinking that but I don't see why that can't be conversations that people are having on the news yeah well that's what you're saying that that's it is like stop making the taboo like this is the problem is like the infantilization of people who are having really deep spiritual thoughts or feelings related to COVID and the dismissal of it you know like the problem is this people in the world are religious people put a lot of value gathering together to go to church if you as a secularist or a scientist as an atheist I'm not saying you but whoever think that just casually shrugging off over 5000 years of societal practice and cultural habit is possible you're not very scientific also the assumption a lot of people are making which is really not a great assumption is that folks care that much if they die that's a bad assumption to make like some people the idea of going to church and because you went to church you get sick and you die that fits into a religious narrative that you become a martyr so all I'm saying is this when I am watching who's the guy who got the Emmy in New York the politician they gave him an Emmy for his New York speeches Cuomo so when I'm watching Cuomo talk about like tell people like I know you want to have a Christmas but Covid is the Grinch you know what I mean it's like you talk to these people like they're 8 year olds you're talking to Orthodox Jews you're talking to devout Muslims you're talking to hardcore Christians who don't care if they die they just want to take communion from their perspective that's fucking irrational but if you think telling somebody who legitimately believes that that is the flesh of God if you think telling them that they should be thinking about the Grinch when they celebrate the birth of their savior you might as well just put on black fucking robes and start shitting on an altar because that's what you look like today and what a crazy misunderstanding of humanity to me that's where it's so bizarre not everyone's like you Cuomo for some people Christmas isn't about exchanging gifts it's the most sacred day of the fucking year and you telling them prohibiting them from gathering together is to them an act of like malefic cruelty and evil and so to me I think it's too late honestly Shane when I was asking you the question I don't think we could fix the messaging now but the next one the next pandemic ministry or whatever you want to call it a cobble all those names sound sinister a group of people who recognizes okay we have the secularists the atheists the scientific materialists we got the racists we got the fucking Satanists we've got the people who want to die we've got the people who don't want to die we've got a lot of different swaths of the population here let's come up with a language for each of them you sound like a god trying to peddle different humans to some other some other god come on we got it go on three times a whole batch of secularists you know what I'm saying is it's like if Fauci for example could go on camera and say hey I heard a lot of you believe that Luciferase is in this vaccine and that we want to inject you with a devil and then you know come up with a way to not be like and therefore you're out of here if you gotta stop you guys name it we'll just put it to a vote online you guys you guys get to name it you guys clearly know more about naming this and that we make the things you guys name it but not even that just say to them look I get it you think that I am a servant of Malik and you are legitimately scared I'm going to try to make you or your family or someone you love infertile and that I want to keep you from going to church they have to approach people from that perspective of like I don't believe that and I'm not that but I'm gonna address you where you're at which is you know what I mean speak to people in that place so I don't know how to do that but it's like this whole casual dismissal of huge populations of people is killing people you know we're dealing with a fucking translation issue here it's like that's all but there's also I don't think that you can hope for a silver bullet in terms of messaging I think that you're going to need black representatives in black communities with black messaging speaking in a way that black community can relate to I think that you're going to need female representatives speaking to I think you're going to need conspiracy people that are like this guy that Jack Rowland that made this amazing painting behind and sent me and listened to my podcast he used to he like went looking for ancient pyramids and stuff and now he's someone that's like hey look I went like I looked for all of the things I loved the idea and everything too I got really involved in it and you know there were some flaws with the so we're going to need like that guy speaking to the conspiracy community and so there's each thing is going to require a different bit of messaging for my money I think that people don't haven't heard near enough about the long term impacts one because it just hasn't been long enough but I think that I think that 10% of people could easily be having long term impacts if not using months of productivity and never being quite right like how much would you like people aren't scared of death but part of that is because you get to be like I'm not scared of death like everyone's scared of losing their taste and smell for the rest of their life there's like there's nothing tough about like I'll lose my taste and smell like no one's going to say that I don't think you know I think it's got to be financial man I think all that shit doesn't work it's like you want to talk about long term people are worried about long term anything there wouldn't be cigarettes there you know what I mean there wouldn't be sugar to me trying to scare people the long term stuff isn't going to work I think it has to be financial motivation like if you don't get COVID you know for the every quarter that you go without getting COVID we're going to give you five grand or something you know yeah and you can do you can teach people how to do like appropriate cross-cultural analysis which is a simple people are already doing it people are already saying like look at Sweden they didn't do this whole act and look at that and it's like well actually they closed down all the schools except for you know past high school and college they went remotely they kept things under under 50 and the big difference was people didn't have the same pushback because they actually put their version of the CDC in charge all their politicians went this isn't our thing listen to listen to these experts and what they have to say they opted for a little more of a herd immunity approach which they're now walking back and their economy dropped down basically just as much as ours like something like 8% ours dropped 9% or something but if you look at Taiwan they had a drop of like 0.5% now if you go there I just saw some some comedians tweet they're from Taiwan they went back there they they quarantined for two weeks they got it they got a chip in their phone they had they had to they got driven by the government to a hotel they couldn't leave their hotel room for two weeks they got food delivered to them a doctor called them every day to check on them they had multiple tests and then they have a chip in their phone afterwards so they have contact tracing of course people are going to have big brother issues with with with this but but this is this is just like no one's saying hey I'm not proposing we do this I'm going to give you an example of what other people have done and after they got out of that there are some people wearing masks in the street and stuff and you'd probably see more than you would under normal conditions but the subways are full the restaurants are full and there's basically no covid there whatsoever and when covid does pop up it's stomped out same with New Zealand and their economies have been because explaining to people as me as an entertainer who needs to be able to get people in to the sea I just did a solo episode addressing the dichotomy between like it's either covid or the economy and it's they are they are tied together and you can see that cross-cultural analysis shows that that actually the places that had the lowest covid actually also had the lowest drop in economic factors and the reason why that is is because say I go covid it's a hoax I'm going to go and do my show right now well it's already you know I do all my own marketing I already know how difficult it is to get people into a showroom without covid before pandemic it was all that I could do to get 200 people into a room to see me in a given city now to be like hey guys this is being a little overblown and every and now I'm getting people to from in some people's mind risk their lives to to come and see my comedy show now you might be saying that's like I dine out under normal conditions I dine out twice a week I've gone I've gone to one restaurant since covid and I've ordered takeout twice which I should order more takeout and support local restaurants especially because another thing they have separate supply chains if people knew that restaurants had separate supply chains and there's a bunch of shit in local farms going to waste and there'd be a way of supporting your local farms as well and you can possibly get groceries there so each one of these has a different thing but anyway for me to get people to to come to my to show show is the same thing that people need for if they want me to come to their restaurant I need to have consumer confidence to go out to dine out and you Duncan could sit there and be like Shane you're just being a wimp go to the restaurant that doesn't convince me to go to what are your thoughts on outdoor dining like isn't the idea that out if you do it outside that your the transmission rates are very low like it's the I think it's I think outdoor dining is a lot a lot better this is just I'm just like using an example of there's still going to be lots of people that aren't going to go outdoor dining that would otherwise die I'm not saying no one should outdoor diner I'm just making the point that consumer confidence will is dependent on COVID numbers and whether people believe outdoor dining is safe or not there's still going to be a large percentage of the population that would normally be coming in dining with you or dining outdoors that will not as long as the US has the highest rates of COVID numbers which by the way here's something interesting you know why so people are worried about the vaccine being rushed right legitimately there's I just heard I just heard about the so the Ebola vaccine took five years and that was the world record yeah but all of the stages all of the same stages that would happen in any vaccine trial have happened with COVID it's just normally wouldn't have the resources to be able to do the number of trials there was I think in June the last time I talked to the scientists that told me a number there was like in June there had been nearly half a million trials like that that kind of scientific effort is going to yield some results but anyway the reason why the trials have been able to go so fast is because there's so much COVID so you have a control group and you have an experimental group and normally you'd have to wait ages you'd have to wait five years to be like well let's see if this group got more Ebola than this did because there's just not that much Ebola around in the first place and this is why this is the this is super dark but this is why it's two American companies that finished the trials first and more vaccine companies from around the globe are moving their trials to the because we have more COVID it's not our ability to innovate that's so depressing hey I want to ask you this I want to close out on this and can I adjust my timeline too that I gave at the end of last show we're going to move the COVID clock hands not much but it's just one I'm not really moving my COVID clock too much but a couple scientists I've talked to recently don't agree with my clock I will say that I'm more optimistic so which I probably shouldn't be so the last time that I was on I think this is like how impressive science can be is me not knowing much about this stuff other than talking with people that do work on vaccines and stuff I just shared what they had told me which was more confidently than I should have was like there's vaccines in the works they should be some ready by December they're going to be starting to be manufactured by January you and I should have them by May ish the general population by June this is back in June and now we skip ahead and that timeline is not only did that timeline hit the mark almost exactly but the vaccine is way beyond it's like the wettest of dreams people were crying when they got the results back that was 95% effective people were crying so I said that means that leave in wiggle room I'd be touring by September we're talking like people actually sitting packing together indoors not even a distance show that's what I estimated in December 2021 September 2021 most people think that's too optimistic here's my reasoning for thinking that still could happen and I do think it is too optimistic so a lot of the people that are the most against vaccines are also the most cavalier about COVID are also going to unfortunately and sadly going to have the highest rates of COVID spread in this coming this winter is going to be an epic catastrophe it's going to be so bad by the time February rolls around things will be looking much much better because they'll be where things are right now and so that many people will have in my opinion there's been fairly strong encouraging data that reinfection isn't what people feared it might be six months ago I thought people might be able to get reinfected by this in three months after they've had it and then it's worse that time and then three months they can get it again and then again and again and again so it might not you might have been perfectly healthy first time but now you got a pre-existing condition the second time that you got it and then the third time you got it and it's unpredictable whether it's attacking in the body it's usually lung sometimes it's the brain sometimes it's you're losing your sense of smell sometimes it's other organs and so is this just going do we just slowly make this slow death from COVID and that's why I'm like guys what the fuck are like it reminds me of that scene in HBO's Chernobyl where they are like just looking at the explosion and they don't know what all this raining down on them and they're like they're like making so sorry so then I get off so I would say that because of that and because enough vaccines I think will still follow that timeline and they're more effective than first thought that timeline still holds true because so many of the people that are adverse to getting vaccines aren't going to have the same rates of reinfection and because there's they're getting so many way more vaccines out tens of millions out much earlier than I thought that they would there's going to be so much more confidence within six months because six months from now there's going to be six months worth of data and if one of these three vaccines or if all three of these vaccines aren't what we hoped that they were there is another 40 on the way you'll get to take your pick so that's beautiful you're saying summer that summer we're going to be back at the bars summer we're going to be rubbing shoulders with people without worry about dying wait people don't people don't agree with me when I when I say I don't think academics I hope you're right though man that would be so wonderful that doesn't seem that far away and it's good things would have to come out so all of the unknowns that happen right now need to be like positive outlines that that happen life rarely it's easier for things to go wrong this is just entropy you know it's easier for things to go wrong than it is for things to go right things that would screw that up one I don't think they know if getting the vaccine actually stops you from getting and spreading covid if it doesn't stop you from getting and spreading covid then forget everything that I just said that's so fucked up you know what I'm picturing Shane I'm picturing this in August or September somebody this is what I'm seeing I'm seeing someone huddled behind a car I don't they like maybe found like a phone or something with ear buds attached to it a little juice and they are hitting play listening to this or like just zombies running down the fucking street because the covid vaccine actually turns people into some kind of like maniacal zombie and they're listening shaking they're at me like no Shane all over their clothes you for bullet it's better than you ever thought we're covered in blood we have a taste for it well we'll see now I want to jump out of covid land for a second and this is something I meant to ask you up front do you have about 20 more minutes okay so this is my question I want to know what you think about this I'm sure you saw maybe you didn't what I'm going to read it to you and I want to know what you think I'm nervous I'm sure you're you're going to tell me about aliens yes former Israeli space security chief says extra terrestrials exist and Trump knows about it a galactic federation has been waiting for you to reach a stage where will we to reach a stage where we will understand what space and spaceships are haim a shed said a former Israeli's okay so I'll read a little bit more a respected professor and retired general he shed said the aliens were equally curious about humanity and we're seeking to understand the fabric of the universe a shed said cooperation agreements had been signed between species including an underground base in the depths of Mars where there are American astronauts and alien representatives a shed added that president Donald Trump was aware of the extra terrestrials existence and it had been on the verge of revealing information but was asked not to in order to prevent mass hysteria the white house and Israeli officials did not immediately respond a su gow a spokesperson for the Pentagon declined a comment a spokesperson for NASA said one of the agency's key goals was the search for life in the universe but that he had to find signs of extra extra terrestrial life a shed anyway what do you think man this is by the way this is not yeah this is not just some rando no I know but say his title one more time though space security chief come that's a favorable position that I think gets created if people really like you we're gonna make you space security that's like that's amazing for a lot of reasons and that dude has a book out so like anytime listen I want to have a book out soon and I hope that you don't take everything that I have to say as like 100% because I'm going to have motivated reasoning and everything else at that time so I could I could approach this in a few ways please let me say that boy you I trust your well do I trust your judgment mine mine don't about aliens like I think that I think that a given listener of yours would have a better sense of space stuff and physics stuff than I haven't read I love physics it was my first love I haven't read a physics book in at least 10 years and and so so like I tend to like I don't want to I was just recently I learned two facts about dinosaurs one was that the average size was the size of chickens we just tend to like the really big ones and two that that that the blue whale is is is bigger than any dinosaur ever I confounded that recently and someone talked about dinosaurs and I couldn't wait to interject my fun fact and I said like blue whales were dinosaurs and I and I made a total mess I knew like a tiny little bit overest I was like I know about dinosaurs because I just heard two little fun facts so I don't want to do that here here's what I here's what I so one I'm not the person to talk to about this to here's what I think about aliens for sure there's a like the mathematical odds of they're not being something at least one thing smarter than humans in the universe is insane you don't take those odds like anyone betting against their being something smarter than humans is such a ego centric arrogant point of view like it's crazy to think that in my opinion and but it's also kind of equally crazy to think Donald Trump is keeping the lid on much of anything let alone let alone the alien spoiler but yeah you're right I mean he what's the fictitious national inquirer he used to cite the national inquirer when he was running for president the first time and so you're saying that if there were aliens that were in contact with Trump you'd better fucking believe right now we would be seeing like he would somehow involve the aliens well you know how he always always projecting shit when he can't like lock her up and like stuff like whatever he does he like projects it on something we were talking about projection earlier like I feel like he'd be like projecting like weird like thinks he's keeping a lid on it but like I would just be like talking about like oh this guy acts like he has some big green head and a super spine like it'd be like slipping out in like weird subconscious ways here just come out you'd be just like look trust me the fucking aliens hate Biden they hate him the aliens think Biden's an asshole I know you mean I mean look I feel differently about I think that there has been what's interesting about what this guy is saying is that this is a aside from the fact that I agree with you like space chief or anytime you say you're in charge of space security and you're talking about literal outer space it's ridiculous so thank you for pointing that out but I do think that he's respected enough that it's bizarre that he would say it like he does that he would be concerned about and he's in his 80's so it produces like the possibility like oh he's already on the way out anyway so why not just leak about the aliens but also this idea of some kind of galactic federation having contact with like politicians it gets repeated over and over again in different ways you know that the part that to me that I always get confused about and this is what I would love to wrap up with by asking you this question is what from your perspective just if you had to like just come up with a prognostication so let's say that it finally happens like Trump walks out with an alien which would be a very depressed to me that would be the thing that did me it like that's where I'm done that's shit my pants and just getting the bathtub and like just babble until they haul me away to a lunatic umbrella but imagining that Trump in the last days of his presidency has a big press conference it's like here's an alien he's the best alien these aliens are really good an alien comes and talks to us what do you think regardless of who ever brings alien up I'm sorry I made a lazy trump joke what I'm saying is what do you think happens over the next three days upon a global realization that we are being colonized communicated with or influenced in some way shape or form by aliens and have been for the last hundred years what do you think would actually happen to society yeah I think that well one perhaps it's that like Trump didn't want to reveal the aliens because he is worried they would steal the stage a little bit so maybe Biden will maybe Biden will diplomatically reveal the aliens to like I don't know I mean I love the show The Leftovers on HBO is like one of my favorite things about and that was like what do people do in this like unexplained but absolutely objective reality happens and like how do they make sense of it and what cults are formed and everything else and how do people deal with like everything else is normal it's basically they still need to like go to work and everything else everything else is like the same the aliens were here last week and you weren't freaking out about it why freak out about the aliens now nothing's changed but so one I'll say that one interesting thing about both AI and aliens when people are always like scared about their takeover is I think that as humans evolve and science evolves and our ability to acquire knowledge evolves it seems that a very a very emergent and like standard property of that is that you gain more and more empathy and curiosity for those things so I'm not as worried about Terminator robots because I think that we are more kind to say animals the more that we learn about them then certainly our ancestors were before they were like mindful enough so hopefully something that is quote unquote more intelligent than us whatever that means would would be would be even that much more of a steward and would would be so I love the idea that aliens would be curious about us I don't think that aliens would have anything of value to get from earth like in terms of resources and creatures that are burning fossil fuel something that figured out how to move across the galaxy undetected by us is not operating off of like I don't think they're gonna like here to take our gasoline or even like our fresh water or something is one of the ways we put we box aliens in could it be the aliens maybe they're more interested in cultural things maybe no writing music you know maybe did those once you get to the point of infinite energy and some kind of insane technology to travel across the universe at that point the things that would be valuable would be more like art or stories or something they're here for our stories shame I absolutely think that could very well be the case like the anthropologist that I just talked about why why wouldn't you want to research something like this I think you know in an ideal world much like a scientist doesn't want to study a rat in a lab or or doesn't want say you know they do a number of tricks so someone doesn't realize what they're actually being studied for right or whatever wouldn't something more advanced learn a lot more from figuring out ways to be like flies on the wall or have like tiny invisible drones flying around or something like that they know that we can't yeah it makes sense I see yeah that's that's interesting right and then if you're and then at that point if you're like trying to preserve like a species or so and and if you can if you can kind of calculate like hey when this person says when when a Gavin Newsom goes to a dinner it kills like this segment of like maybe they can mathematically like figure that out or they're just knowing like little bits of butterfly effects that are this this is what I thought every time I've had like a manic episode for like DMT experiences or whatever this is what I think is happening is they're able to figure out you know this whatever the equivalent of like a nuclear bomb or something like that the person that thought of that was influenced by this was influenced by this was influenced by this so that we can hear like when Duncan Trussell had this great idea that that influenced or even just a silly idea but it influenced like some world leader that happened to be listening that influenced this other thing what was he listening to on Spotify and and watching like on YouTube the three days before that influenced that thing and so you could go back and create these like small number of influences that maybe like the outcome is that life sustains a way of looking at things it's like it's looking at it's zooming out and looking at things as a process interdependent process and like using some yeah I think an advanced intelligence would do that that makes sense like it would be interested in the not just the result and not just the impending result but also the tiny little flutters and how far back can you chart that and what does that look like like when if there were a way to quantify that or to visualize it would you be looking at a new life form would you be seeing an actual life form that's living outside and inside of time simultaneously you know and it seems like an alien maybe that is what maybe I'm again I don't know who this guy is really but if like we imagine just for fun that these aliens are real and the aliens are waiting for us to understand what a spaceship is it's almost like they're saying you you're not seeing the spaceship yet like it's right there but you're not going to see it until you look into something deeper than what's right in front of you and I love your ideas that you have during manic episodes are pretty interesting man not to encourage it but it's pretty cool thanks I try to make the most use out of a sometimes difficult situation but I yeah if you think about think about like you know you see all these tragic things on like a David Attenborough documentary you see like this elephant seal tossing itself off of a cliff and and do you think like and these guys have to go do we stop if we can stop it if this thing's starving do you feed it do you interfere with the process and science is usually like no but at what point do you at what point is not stopping in something from dying the same as killing it it's just like the trolley problem where I think this is just a human error where it's like it should mathematically it's easy there's five people on one track one person on another track it's heading toward the five you have the ability to pull the lever and you kill the one and people have a real hard time with this because now you've taken the action and that action killed the one person so now four action murdered that one person well you're in action murdered those five people so like at what point do you start like meddling and stepping in a little bit here and there it's tough to say and maybe it's just maybe when you're that far out and it's just like mathematical pragmatism like neuroscientists like neuroscientists that study things on rats they tend to not want to study brain damage because to do that you need to take a mallet not a fucking rat in the head with it and they're like I'd rather inject it with a cancer thank you very much like you know it is it is it's really fucked up but but they're also I think that part of the reason why this vaccine happened so fast was because they used this new system and they were able to take they were able to take the the you know the genetic data from what COVID is and they were able to they in AI was able to formulate formalize the possible vaccine compounds in two days they had discovered the vaccine in two days so it took this long to test it so think about what you know some super intelligence that I doubt is trying to help us make some space jalopy so we can like sit at some table with them or whatever but certainly why wouldn't there be all sorts of things to learn from all of everything in the universe including life complexes ours if it is indeed complex which is certainly I would say that all life on this planet is a lot more there's a lot more to be gained from say like an asteroid in space and certainly there's plenty of asteroids to learn what you need to learn from asteroids already there doesn't seem to be as abundant life and much in the way that we are clamoring the anthropologist that I just talked to are clamoring for any semblance of like okay well there's still a couple tribes that haven't been influenced that much by us like can we study them like of course like any alien that could would I would think be going to every far reach of space that it could to find every untouched thing and also trying to that's so cool yeah it's like you the only thing that's fucking interesting about us is that we don't know there's aliens it's fascinating the only thing that's the only thing we've got that would even draw them here is like wow they they actually think they're alone in the universe holy look at how they act wow that's crazy yeah I get it man that's maybe they're bartering we're like okay we like something happened a spaceship and now that like we got to come down and like they're nice enough that they don't want to kill a single human being like so can we reason with these like so otherwise you'd have to kill these people so that the word doesn't get out but can we reason with them can we barter with them so that they don't okay how can we stop this insane like president or whatever from like blowing our cover is there are there ways that we can interact with like a small group of these humans so they don't blow our cover for the rest of us because because Jim slipped up and he got found out and now that's it man no I think you're that's the best answer like it's not so much that we're not ready to see them it's that they know that if we see them it's gonna fuck up their ability to study us and the way they currently are and also the only reason they would contact us in contact the military or the leaders is because they thought we were gonna blow ourselves up with nuclear bombs so it's like and they don't want which just happened really recently with like you know North Korea was just a few years ago where we were like no I'll blow you up that's the seal going off the cliff you know my son loves this John C Riley narrated Disney show about bears and you better fucking believe if I had put millions of dollars into a documentary about bears and it looked like one of the bear cubs that I've been following with the camera was about to get eaten by another bear making the Disney dog that's not going on Disney I mean like you can't do a kid's show and be like oh yeah also sometimes male bears will just eat the cubs you know what I mean I'm gonna stop it from happening that's probably what's happening with aliens is they're like you know they know that if we blow ourselves up the whole thing's over so won't be anything left to study that's it I mean the thing is is that humans are this is hopefully you know something I mean we are this is the next great mass extinction that we're that we're approaching and so you know there's also for humans to think aliens are going to learn that much more from us than say a dolphin or a cockroach for that matter is a little bit human it's a very human thing to say I love talking to you and thank you so much for expanding my mind today will you let my listeners even though most of them know you by now let them know how they can find you yeah I mean my baby is my podcast here we are where I interview a different scientist each week and you can hear me very awkwardly and keepishly ask exceptionally long-winded tangential questions and then get told everything that's wrong about them and if you go to ShaneMoss.com my documentary Psychonautics is on Amazon I often forget to plug it and people love the documentary I get tons of great feedback all of the time so if you haven't seen it Psychonautics the comic's exploration of psychedelics on is something I'm proud of Shane you are the best thank you very much for giving me so much of your time Hare Krishna Shane thank you

The blinking eye of Osiris staring into your deepest heart. The thing that runs beneath your child's bed at night. I am the tap dancing sound of the demons of light. I have come to spread peace. Okay, here's a new song from the labia boys. From their upcoming album, The Water of Life. Make sure you download and enjoy. I just tweeted to the president. This is what my tweet did say. Don't you people see that the president's insane? Retweets and lax, retweets and lax all day. Then I tweeted about the school shootings. This is what the people read. Thanks to the NRA, more children are dead. Retweets and lax, retweets and lax all day. It feels so good to be right. Tweeting with all of my mind. I'm gonna change the world. We're gonna tweet the world right. Tweets of peace and love. Don't matter if you're black or white. As long as you agree with us. Tweets of peace. Tweeting throughout the land. Tweets of peace. All you need is your hands. Boys are broken. Boys are broken no more. We healed the boys. And we stopped all the wars. John Wayne Gacy dressed like a clown. Buddy like to murder kids. This is a metaphor for us. All if we paint peace signs on our fists. Holy shit, that was amazing. Much thanks to the people of the Obsidian Pyramid for producing that intro to the DTFH.

The truth is, most of us are brushing our teeth wrong, not for long enough, and we forget to change our brush on time. That's because most brands focus on selling flashy gimmicks rather than better brushing. This is why you need Quip. It's an electric toothbrush that's a fraction of the cost of bulkier brushes, while still packing just the right amount of vibrations to help clean your teeth. It also comes with a mount that functions right to your mirror and unsticks. You can use it as a cover for hygienic travel wherever you take your teeth. And finally, everybody loves Quip. They're on Oprah's O-List, name one of Time's best inventions, and is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the American Dental Association. Quip starts at just 25 bucks.

It's spelled G-E-T-Q-U-I-P dot com slash D-T-F-H. Listen, your toothbrush is a crawling hellscape filled with billions of different evil bacteria. You leave it next to the toilet. Every time you flush the toilet, it's splattered with toxic spray. And then you take that thing and you shove it right in your mouth. It'd be better to brush your teeth with an old dog's turd than your current filthy ass toothbrush. You stinky mouth pig. Let's get our mouths clean. Let's brush the right amount of time in the right way. Quip vibrates and it tells you how long to focus on each quarter of your mouth, not the way you've been brushing your teeth, which is a couple of quick swipes here and there, kind of shot in the dark, like stabbing your sword in the direction of some evil person hundreds of miles away. Don't do that anymore. The sword fight that you are having with your mouth should be one that you win. Because if you don't win, we all lose. Because every time you exhale, it sounds like somebody just opened up a sarcophagus. Okay, so let's get your mouth clean. Remember, head over to quip.com slash DTFH. You'll get your first refill pack free with a quip electric toothbrush. That's your first refill pack free at getquip.com slash DTFH. That's spelled getquip.com slash DTFH. Vibrating toothbrush.

Today's guest is the creator slash co-creator slash star of some of my favorite shows in existence, The Pound House and Two-Eyed Crew. I'm going to have links to all these shows in the comments section of this episode. He's also a brilliant comedian. Most importantly, he's one of my closest friends. Now everybody, please welcome to the Duncan Trussell family, our podcast cast. The glowing light of laughter that is my sweet friend, Doug Lussinhop, aka DJ Doug Bown. I find interesting. He's a publicly traded person. What do you mean? What does that mean? He went public with his... He has people buy shares of him, and they get to vote on his life decisions. Whoa. Like his first one was like, should I get a vasectomy? And they all, all the shareholders narrowly voted for no. Thank God. Yeah. That's such a... Do you have a vasectomy? I got two. The first one didn't hold. I just got a double nodded. Are we going? Yeah, we're rolling. But I mean, it doesn't, it doesn't, we don't have to. But that's not, like, what, what do you think about that? Vasectomies. Do you have a vasectomy? I can't remember. No. A lot of my friends are getting snipped these days. Really? Yeah. No, I got to stay fertile. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I want to be like having kids, like, like Picasso, like in the 60s. Yes. My whole life. Yeah. Why not? Just start now. And this is the time to start doing it for sure. Like definitely not. Having kids in your 20s is nuts. Yeah. Start, start in your 40s. Start in your 40s. That's the best. Maybe in your 40s. Definitely 50s. 40s is a little young. It's a little young for me. I'm saying 50s. Like that's when you really start banging out those babies. Maybe 60s. 60s is prime. That's my prime time. That's your goal right there? Mm-hmm. So that you've got, by the time your kid's graduating from high school, you're like, I don't know, 78, 80? Yeah. Well, technology will catch up, but I'll look like I'm 30. And your kid will look like a baby still, because we'll be able to freeze them down, keep them babies. Have you thought about this, man? This is something that, like, I, you know, that I don't think people are addressing, which is like how bad it's going to be to be a 20-year-old in the year 2050 when all these 80-year-olds look like they're 20? Yeah, that's going to be tough. Like, that's going to be real hard on these 20-year-olds. Like, you know, because, like, how do you compete? Yeah, I feel bad for them now. Because, I mean, it's going to happen. A fucking young Elon, like an Elon Musk, beautiful Elon Musk, 25, but he's actually 363. He's going to get all the tail. There's going to be nothing for these young kids to work with. Young boys. That's why we need the robots. Yeah, the robots will be here. So it'll level everything out. Right. I think we'll be fine. The sex robots are going to be there for, like, the fresh 20-year-olds. But then maybe, like, do you think, like, it's pop, like, if you, if we, okay, so if the human... Wait, why won't the 80-year-olds just date other 80-year-olds that look like they're also 20s? I didn't, I never thought of that angle. What about this? What if it looks, what if in the future it's cool to look old? Because no one's going to look old. So it's going to be like, wow, that guy looks old. That's cool. Look at that old guy. I want to look like that. Yeah. Maybe you try to look old. Right. Like really old, you know what I'm saying? Yeah, you got, you just start smoking. You try to get, you try to be scared all the time. Yeah, you stress out. You go through a stress camp. Like, now we have, like, fat camps and stuff like that. And the future, everything's going to be so easy, you're going to go to stress camp. And it's going to, the stress camp is going to be 40 years long, and it's just going to be a cubicle job that you don't get paid for. They're just going to duplicate what's already happening, but it's going to be like, you just don't, it's like... Yeah, we think we want to get away from these stressful situations, cubicles. But in the future, we're going to be craving it. Craving that old. Yeah, we go to cubicle camp. Go to cubicle camp and get old. So you're looking really old, man. I mean, that's like a, that'll be a compliment. Dude, you look fucking old, man. You look tired and old. How'd you do it? Dude, did you gain a little years? Did you gain, like, seven years? Yeah. At cubicle camp. You look amazing. What do you look? You look like you're 70. Look at that fresh wrinkle. Fresh wrinkle. Do you ever worry, like, do you ever think, do you, do you have, like, age-related anxiety? Oh my god, yeah. Like, especially now. I'm like your age, or maybe. Forty, I'm 43. I'm older than you. So, but you don't look old. I know, but it's still terrifying. It's, it's still terrifying to get this age. To get 45. I think something happened to me either from psychedelics, or from getting cancer, or from, like, I don't know what, man, but, like, I don't care that I'm 43. I used to be ashamed of it. I used to be worried about it. I used to feel really bad about it. Like, in, like, and I used to feel bad about my bald spot. But now I fucking love my bald spot. I love blasting people with that thing, you know? Like, you gotta deal with it. Like, the hold. How do you blast people with your bald spot? Every time they see my back. It's a reminder of, like, what happened. Oh, you don't, like, turn around and, like, you know. Spray them down. Spray them with it. You're like, shoot me. But, like, something. I mean, look, I'm exaggerating a little bit. I also kind of don't care. But, like, you know, every time around my birthday, I'm just like, holy shit. Can't believe I'm gonna be this old now. But, like, that's been going on since I was, like, I remember when I was, like, in my teens, I'm like, I can't believe I'm gonna be 24 one day. Like, that's ancient. And then, like, when I turned 25, I'm like, I'm a quarter century years old. I thought I was so old then. And then, like, I just, then I'm looking back at that now, like, it doesn't, it's, like, fine. Just keep, keep living. I don't know. Just keep living. Dude, I had this conversation with this 32-year-old I met. And he was so bummed. Like, and he was deeply saddened that he was 32. He's like, I'm old now. Yeah, everyone that I know that's, like, now in their early 30s, it tells me the same thing. They're old. I'm just like, cry me a river. They're, I'm old now. Yeah, cry, you're, and you're looking, I'm looking and I'm thinking, like, you, you're older than me. Like, you're, you're older than me because you, you feel old. You think you're old. Like, you're 32, but you're really, like, 60 the way you're acting right now. It's such a mind-fuck age, you know? Like, who, who, do you ever have that fantasy that you're gonna, like, find your birth certificate and realize that you're actually 10 years younger? Wait, let me try that. Plug my laptop in. DJ Doug Powell, you know what? I introduced you. I didn't even introduce you. No, that's, that's, okay, go ahead. I have an answer to that birth certificate thing. What's the answer? I found my, um, like, did you have to sign up for, like, the draft? Oh, yeah. Like, when you were, like, 18 or something? Yeah, yeah. I got that card and on that card, it says I'm, like, three years younger. It says my birth date is, like, three years later than my birth certificate birthday. So you're younger. So maybe I am younger. Dude, that's something Mitzi used to say to me. It was really mysterious. I never understood it, and I wish I'd asked her about it more, but she would be like, I got 20 extra years, honey. I'm 20 years younger. And I was never like, what, what do you mean? Like, how did that happen? What's the, but I, like, I've always just thought of, like, man, I mean, why not just think, like, oh, I'm 30. Just think, like, I'm 30 now. Instead of thinking you're in your 40s, just like, oh, no, I'm 30 now. Get hypnotized to think that. Well, I mean, that's, that's, that's my, oh, that's what I do. That's what I've done my whole life. It's just, I mean, I kind of stopped being my age around 29. But, you know, you look at 30 something. You look at people in their 40s, in the 40s, and they look like they're in the, they're fucking 90s, in, in, in the 90s. That's what's scary is when you meet someone that's like, your age or younger than you, and they're like, I don't know, they have like a whole family and all this responsibility. And they're like, super like older in a way than you are. Kids are graduating. Because you and I, we just screw around and have fun. Kids are graduating from college. Their kids, yeah, are like. They have grandkids. They're, yeah, some of them. My friend has a grand kid. Yeah. Yeah. And, and, and like, you're like, man, I like play synth music. I like record this podcast. Like, like, I don't, I used to really, in a, in a really dumb way, in a really obnoxious way, judge people like that, as though their life was bad. You know what I mean? Like, I used to think- Wait, what kind of people? People who like had families and stuff. It's really dark. Like, I would look at them like, oh, you're, you know, it's like that. It's the stupid thing that, like, people who think they're edgy will say. People who think they're edgy will, like, scorn the family. And they'll be like, oh, man, you got fucking trapped by the lies. Fucking made reproductive lies. Free as a bird, sword on the wings of freedom. And it's like, and I always thought, like, and I thought like that. I mean, that's me. I'm just imitating myself. But really, I don't think that there's any right way to live. It's like, I think having a family and getting those kinds of, like, deep. I feel the opposite way where I would feel like insecure about myself for not being down the regular quote unquote normal path of, you know, like, like getting married, having a family. Like, I have a lot of cousins and sisters and stuff. And every single one of them is married with kids. Right. One cousin, but he's, he's also married. But like, I'm the only one in this, all my 10 or whatever kids my age, with all the cousins and everything like that's not like married with kids, living the classic standard lifestyle. So I would feel insecure, like something's wrong with me. I wouldn't like look down on people like that. I would feel like you feel like that I wouldn't look. I wouldn't say, look at that. Those people live in their basic ass life. Such a bad opinion, that opinion. Both ways are wrong. Right. Feeling insecure about my own way of living. Right. Is wrong too. Right. Yeah. It's just like, this is where you're at. This is where you're at. But there's a, there's just that. How do you get away from comparing yourself? Well, I mean, you know, actually, I'm glad you brought that up because this podcast is sponsored by comparex, which is, it's like a new product. You take it and you just stop comparing yourself to other people. It's fucking incredible. Like you feel great immediately. I don't know, man. I don't, I, it's like, thank you. I don't know. Like that is a comparison. The comparison is definitely a real problem for some people. Like some people are eaten alive by comparing themselves to other people, particularly like success. Like that's one way that people really crucify themselves out here is like, I certainly have, man. Like when like shit hadn't been going well for me. And then like, dude, like one of my best friends, fucking Ari Shafir, he books this show on comedy central cells of show. This isn't happening. And like, I love that guy. But it felt like Satan put a cigarette into my heart when I heard about that because we started comedy together at the same time. And I was like, oh, what's wrong with me? What the fuck is wrong with me? Why do I not have a show on comedy central? And I had to like eat that pain for a while. Well, can you name one comedian that hasn't had that same thought? No, even successful ones. You know what I mean? Like I've definitely had that thought because I've been out here hustling for over 10 years trying to do the same thing. And I'm a loser. I have nothing to show for myself. That is something do you how how what you just said, how much of that is hyperbole? How much is that is what you really think? Oh, well, that's a thought you try to beat down. But right, but it comes that it comes up. Yeah. So it's like, this is to me, that's this is an interesting thing because every single talented artist that I meet has that demon because like, dude, you know, you're, you probably can't be successful without thinking those thoughts though, because then it kind of gives you a little kick in the pants to like be productive or something. Yeah. Well, I don't that's something definitely to think about because that's the concept of like paint like paint like thinking shitty things about yourself is going to produce some great result. And I disagree with that. I do not think that that's the that that is a path to inspiration at all. But for some people, it might be. It's not a path for inspiration. It's more of a path for like, I don't want to think that way. And I don't know, it's just like a path for like changing your something, just figuring something out. Well, does that make sense? Well, I mean, getting there's a lot to be said for getting back into a corner. Like when you find yourself backed into the corner and you realize that you have to fight. Now that's a good, I think that's a that can be a really good state to find yourself in where this other thing like war mentality starts kicking in or something. That happened to me after Natasha and I broke up because she'd been supporting me. And then I ended up with like, she gave me money. She gave me like 4,000 bucks. I mean, like this is like some cash. Yeah, 20s. I think it was a check. I mean, this is like deep. For me, that was I would say that was like hitting bottom. That was like deep pathetic, like deep pathetic. When the money ran out or when you got the money, you're like, what am I doing? When you're breaking up with your girl and you haven't been making any money. And it's not just that, but you have you haven't been working hard. You know what I mean? Like I was fucking around. I wasn't working hard. I wasn't doing anything. I was like, I would trick myself and think I was doing something, but wasn't really doing anything. And like, and it was bad. I was stressful on the relationship and like, so that I ended up in a sublet. You know, with like 4,000. I'm sorry. Maybe it was more than that. I think it was right around that was the number. When you lived up in Atwater. That was when I was in Atwater. And I'm, and I'm, and that was when I was truly backed into a corner because it was like, I have $4,000. I got lucky and found the sublet for like real cheap, like 600 a month or something like that. So it's like, I've got, I knew the clock was ticking to a certain degree. And I knew that if I didn't do something, then I was going to be in a lot of trouble. Like, like real trouble. Like going to live with your parents trouble, like that kind of shit. And like, dude, I'm like in my late thirties here. You know what I mean? This is like fucked a fucks itch. So like, I got like that pushed me into a corner. And then that, that, that's where things started turning around. But it was only because I was like jammed up. You got to go to cubicle camp. You got to go to cubicle camp. You got to get, you know, you got to get jammed up. You got to get put in the corner. Dude, you know, um, Pound House is. Did you introduce me yet? No, I don't, I think it's too late to do the introduction, but let's go ahead and start the podcast. Doug, thank you so much for coming on the show. You are, this is what I've realized about you. You are, your art is what I show is my go to thing to show people when they're over at my house. I'm like, have you seen the Pound House? And then I'll show them the Pound House and try to walk. And it's like almost like a, uh, it's, it's weird. It's a weird litmus test of a person because they, the way they react to it, like tells me like a lot about them and like how we, like how they think. That's cool. I mean, I'm, I'm honored. Thank you for, for, for showing people my, my videos. I think it's one of the funniest things I've ever seen, man. Like I think it, and it holds up. I've been watching it over and over and over again. And I just think like that is like one of the great comedic pieces on the internet. And I fucking love it, man. Like, and I've got a billion questions for you about it. How, like, how would you, if you had to give it like a synopsis for people who haven't seen it, how'd you describe it? Um, I guess the elevator pitch is sort of like, um, Seinfeld meets David Lynch or something like that. Wow. Or like, I mean, we, we didn't go out with that, with that concept when we started making it. It was like me and Brent were like, let's make a video. So we just started, um, picked a day and we shot something. And then as we were making it, we kind of like used our own, um, sensibilities and it just sort of formed itself. You know what I mean? But yeah, I mean, to, to circle back to what we were talking about earlier, like that, I made the last season of that like three or four years ago or something. And it's cool that like you show people that and stuff, but that's like one of those things that eats away at me. Like, I'm like, I can't be, I got to be having new stuff. Doesn't that like that stress of like, of like, it's transitioned to two at crew, which is brilliant. So, so, so, and that, that it's like, that seems to be like a similar flavor to it. You know, like, and that's a collaborative thing with you, Mikey Cam, and who else do you do that with? Jay Weingarten, but he moved to New York, but we're trying to get him back. Jay Weingarten. Yeah, but it's like, like, if you had to describe the type of comedy that you're putting out there, like, what is that is, what, what do you call it? Forgive me for that fucking question. No, that's fine. I mean, there's different, I mean, yeah, I mean, that's a different project. I mean, basically, I like to do experiment. I like to experiment, you know, like with that one, we came up with sort of some rules, which are we do all the sound and post-production. So when we film it, we don't have to worry about the mics and stuff. That's right. And we want the sound to be like really rich and like high res sort of. Yes. And we want to, and we, another rule was we shoot it on this crappy waterproof camera, like a point and shoot Panasonic camera. Yeah. And another rule was we can only use, we have to shoot it with the battery life that's on one battery of the camera. So it's kind of like this thing where we're forcing limitations. We break those rules a lot. I mean, we did buy a second battery because after a while it was like, so that rule is kind of out the door, but we shoot it on the crappy camera. We do all the sound and post and we try to not overthink things. And it's more of like, and we have a, we have a deadline, so we'll set up a show. We used to do a monthly comedy show to a crew, which we still do every like three months now. Yes. But we would have like a deadline. So we have to have it done by that deadline. And we can't, because like sometimes you make a video like with Pound House, for example, we shot the first like pilot of that. And I didn't think it was that good. And we sat on that footage for like maybe a year or something. Wow. And finally Brent's like, let's just edit that thing we shot with the craigslist. Yeah. With the guy buying the bean bag off craigslist. And I was like, okay, yeah, we should just finish that because I don't know. For some reason, I didn't think it was like anything that great. You know what I mean? Yeah. Like the memory of it was like, we weren't like laughing that hard. It was like kind of like, you know, there's some weird stuff in there. And then once we started editing it, then we're like, oh, this is where it comes to life. Yeah. Right. So that one was, I don't know, what am I saying? But I'm not good at talking or thinking in a straight pattern. None of us are. I mean, that's kind of part of it. Like where our brains are all spinning and scattered and like zinging around. Yeah. So with two crew, you have a deadline and we have to finish it and we have to show it that night. And we, you know, warts and all is our, our thing we always say. Where did you like, if we disagree about something like, I don't like that line. I said, I want to redo it or whatever. You're just like, we got to show it. That's it warts and all. Yeah. And that's that. And I like doing things like that where you don't overthink it. It's not too polished. I like when things are kind of rough and crappy. Me too. Like lo-fi kind of like that's, I like that kind of stuff, you know. Well, it hits like with the, with Poundhouse, it like, what it keeps doing is hitting like, it's super funny. But then in between that, it's like hitting like almost like a demonic place. Like it's hitting this, it reminds me when I used to listen to Sebedo. And like, I was like, this shit is satanic, man. Like it's really, it sounds so like dark and demonic. And like, I was interviewing Barlow once and he's like, oh yeah, man. Well, I mean, that's, you know, it was, he's like, we were using all this equipment. He's like, if we wanted to make that sound now, we couldn't because all that equipment's broken. It's on, you'd have to fix all the equipment. He can go on eBay and find those four tracks. He was, yeah. But I mean, it's like, I guess, I know what he's saying. You'd have to solder, you know, it seems like once you go, you know, forward in technology or like quality, it's hard to go back. You know what I'm saying? Right. Like that's why a lot of like demos sound better than like the polished albums on certain bands and stuff. Yeah. It's always like, it's more of like the first, you know, like usually like with comedy and stuff, it's kind of like the first way you tell a joke when it just spins out of your mind. It's like a lot of the time, like that's like the funniest way, right? You know what I mean? Yes. And then when you like, when you like, like, that's what happens with my stuff a lot. I'll tell the same kind of joke, like a few months after I first did it where it got this huge laugh and it was like the way I first did it, I don't know something about the way I delivered it. And then when I, when I think about it for a few months and then say it later, I'm not good at like remembering what, what it was about the way I said it or something that like got the laugh the first time. So it's all about, I'm, I'm, I like things in their like nascent form. Yeah, man. Well, because they, in that, in the moment, and it's like the moment of birth is things springs up and it's this beautiful thing and it's usually related to the shit that's like floating, swirling around you at the same, at the time, you know, and like trying to reproduce that artistically thinking like, oh, I'm going to do it the exact same way I did it at that time. You don't, you'd have to time travel and even then it wouldn't work. It's like, it's, it's, it reminds me of Zen. It's like this idea of like the, you know, they tell you this fucking koan that's usually just like, you know, I don't know if you've ever heard any of the koans. It's like what, you know, what's a koan? So what happens is you go into a Zen temple and you do a like a, you meditate for like a month straight and the way they meditate is hardcore, man. It's like the most fucking hardcore shit. You're like sitting on a cushion, staring at a wall. You're like meditating. I don't know how many hours a day, but all day long, essentially when you're not meditating, you're doing walking meditation, you're just not moving and it's like breaking your mind. And then somewhere in the midst of that, the master, the Roshi will call you in and he'll ask you a question. And the question is like an absurd question. Famous when everyone's heard is what's the sound of one hand clapping, right? And then they, and you'll, you'll try to be clever, you know, Romano's talks about this. You'll try to like, first you'll try to do a clever response. So you'll do what you think he wants to hear. You'll do what, you know, you think you've discovered and like he's, he'll just be like, like, I've heard Romano's talk about this where he'll say some clever thing and the Zen master will go, so, so. And then you go back and you sit for another week and just stare at a fucking wall. And you have to come up with this answer for what's one hand clapping comes back and ask it to you again. But eventually what happens is your mind breaks. You, you're so frustrated by this question that you're, what, what, what is the answer? It just is the exact thing that comes out of your mouth. And then the, the rose, she'll be like, yes, that's it. But it's like to get there requires a complete disintegration of your identity. If you say nothing, he's like, Yeah, he'll, they, they, they torment you, man. There's all these great stories of this and it's like an ancient practice. It's like an ancient Buddhist practice. But the idea is like, you know, getting into purely into the moment prior to all the other shit you add on to the moment, like raw, unfiltered selfness comes breaking out of this crack that has just opened up inside of you from sitting and not moving for a week after week after week, this thing starts pouring out of you. And that thing is like in the moment, unreproducible. It's exactly what you're talking about. It's just the frustrating thing is like, you can't make that happen. Yes, you can't. I mean, you can set up the circumstances to allow it. And for you, that's limitation. It sounds like it's limitation. It's deadlines. It's that, it's that what you were talking about before, when you were backed into a corner. Right. Like that's when my brain kind of like gets creative. It's like, we got to have this tomorrow. Then, you know, I start to think I really start focusing on the problem of the video or whatever. Right. The thing. Yeah. And then that's when, you know, when there's like no deadline and it's like this creative thing is happening, it's hard for me to complete those kind of tasks. I mean, I'm getting better at it. I'm listening to like Tim Ferriss podcasts and like reading books about productivity and things like that. So, I mean, that's one of the things I'm working on. But that's the thing Ferriss, I think until I'm good at that, I'll just set myself a deadline, not not like a deadline, just arbitrarily on a calendar, but like an actual show where there's going to be people expecting this thing that we're that we're we're we're watching. And you you say on Instagram, hey, we have a new video coming out. Then it's like, then it's real. Then people are like, oh, well, then you have to deliver. You have to do it. You're right. That is a problem. You definitely, I mean, with this podcast, like after I after we chat, I've got to put a podcast up this week. Like I have to upload a podcast. Like there's no way out of it. Like I have to because I have to do it. And in that state, it's stressful, but then you feel joy when you complete it, don't you? Fucking hurt so bad. In that waking, you know, waking up in the morning, knowing you have to do it and thinking about me having to come over here and like, is Doug going to be good? Or am I going to say I erased it again? No, I never did that to you. I never did that to you. Did I did I accidentally erase one of her cast? Well, I think that was like lavender hour that you know, I, but I believe you. I only there was one podcast. Maybe two where I told that lie. I try not to lie anymore, but there was like one or two where it got erased, but I, but I realized like, oh shit, man, if I upload this, you're going to not you, but like it's just going to, it's not going to be great for them. Like, I'm just kidding. I'm just saying, I'm stressing out the same way of like, like, I know you have a lot of listeners. I'm like thinking this is kind of stressful. I hope Duncan's listeners like me. Right. You know what I mean? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That, yeah, right. Yeah. That's like, they love you man. I mean, cause like a lot of my, a lot of people listen are already familiar with two white crew, with pound house, with your work on Tim and Eric, you're, you're beloved. That's, but still that's all the mind, isn't it? The mind is like constantly obsessed with like, I mean, Jesus Christ. Like when I, when I go on a Rogan, that drive over there is just like, I'm just trying to watch my breath and I'm just trying to get in the moment because like with Joe, it's like what I've noticed with him is like, if I come in there with like an agenda, like if I, if I come in there with a thing I want to, especially if like there's something I want to plug, God forbid, or if there, you know what I mean? And like, he would let me plug it. But if my mind is thinking about that thing I need to plug, or if it's thinking about his legions of fans, some of which are like really mean people. Like they, they like hate me. They hate me. So like, so, but if I, if any of that shit gets in the way, what it, what it does is it creates this like, I don't know, like a fucking millisecond disruption in my ability to like just interface with him, you know, like just to be in the moment with him. And he's been doing so many fucking podcasts and now he's like a hunter and he's like this trained fighter that he's like hypersensitive to if your mind is not like in that moment with him. He sniffs it out. Sniffs it out. Right. And like, yeah. Well, you're, you're always great on that show. I mean, but I'll tell you, man, the, the, I figured out how to, how to do it. But you have to get in, but it doesn't sound, it's not as easy as it sounds for the listener. It just sounds like you're just chilling, hanging out. Well, I just have to, well, no, it is chilling because if I'm just thinking like, I'm just going to be in the moment. I'm not going to like think about the next thing I want to say that's clever or I think it's clever or I'm not going to like, while he's talking, start really thinking about something I'm going to blast out there that's going to be fucking cool that I think is going to be cool because like, he's, you just see like, he sees it, you know, and then it's like, and it's, I won't do that now anymore. What? And this is not, this is like the reason that I love the concept of like meditation, meditation practice or mindfulness practice because it's like, and, and, and in the old days, I'd always hear that term practice and I'd always think, I wouldn't even think about the word. I was just like, Oh, meditation practice, but it's like, what are you practicing for? Right? What is it? It's a practice. And that means you, does that mean you're never going to be, you're never going to nail it? So don't worry about it. Yeah, that's definitely for sure. You're not going to, you're never going to nail it. That's a great thing to throw away for sure with is you're never going to nail it. But what it is, is it's like teaching you like how your mind gets you in and out of the moment. And so that's the practice is like, just learning tricks to like, pull yourself back into now, like pull yourself back into the now and, and you know, when you're there and, and you know, when you're not there. And what's really fun about it is when you haven't been there and then you come back into it again, you're like, Oh shit, here it is, here it is. Oh wow, man. I love it here. Like this place is like incredibly beautiful and like, but also the other part of doing that is not being there, not being there. You know, you'll run into people and they're like, man, I need to start meditating and it's like, Oh, you're meditating right now with that attention that you've created is part of it. Do you meditate? Yeah. Well, I chant. I chant is my meditation. So when do you do that? So I'll do when I'm walking around. I'll do what I'm in my car. I'll do it. Sometimes I go up on the roof and do it. It's safe if you're driving around chanting. It's one of the number one cause of traffic fatalities in LA, but I'm not going to fucking stop. It ain't illegal. It ain't illegal. No one said I can't. They can't breathalyze for it. They can't breathalyze. I've been pulled over a few times and the cops is like the cop has been like, are those chanting beads? And I'm like, no, bitch. No. No, these are just beads. These are just New Orleans beads. These are New Orleans beads. But yeah, it's perfectly safe because you start learning how to like, basically what it does is it creates this like thing in your mind. Right. So it's like the one, one of the easiest chances like Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram, Ram. So you're doing that. And then like, even while you're talking to someone that can be going on in your mind. And it's not like you're not. It's Ram Doss like a computer program because it's like Ram and then Doss. Doss, I've thought of that. Yeah. Like it seems like that. Yeah. It's, it's weird how it ended up being like, it almost seems like a book on like. That's something like I, I, I've tried meditation, but I can't do it. Well, I mean, there's so many types of meditation. It's like you, you keep whatever type. I feel like when I ride my bike, I'm meditating. There you go. That's a good one too. Yeah. That's a good price. It pulls you right in the moment, right in the moment. Especially when you're in fucking traffic. You're not like, you don't have the, you can't think about like being in a car is like the worst thing you can do for to make your mind just as a human, as a human just driving. You're a big biker. Like you bike all the fucking time. Not, not as much as I used to, but yeah, I love, I do like I'm trying to force myself to bike more now. Whenever I do it, I'm like, it seems like what's one of those things where you have, once you force yourself to do it, you just feel so great afterwards. Right. It's one of those things. And then I always come up with like funny ideas or jokes or something when I'm biking. I'm always pulling over and like writing stuff down. Yeah. You're going in. I'm not doing that in my car. You got to get into Kotler, Steven Kotler. Have you gotten into him yet? He's, so he's like a flow state person and they like, he's really into like, he's got to think all, I think it's the flow genome project, but his whole interest and it's the interest of like a lot of different people, military people, you know, coaches, athletic people is like, how do you induce the flow state? Basically like how, what are the conditions that are going to bring you more into the flow? Cause in the flow, one of the things that happens is that when you have diarrhea, yeah, he's amazing. He just, he teaches how to get diarrhea. I mean, this is like one of the most taboo things. People think it's awful, but it's very purgative and it's like, and that's the state you want to be in. Cause that's when all my great ideas come to me is when I'm having explosive diarrhea. I always keep a notebook next to the toilet. No, it's just like when you're riding your bike, you're in a flow state and when you're, you know, in your car ruminating, when you're walking around thinking about like, fuck man, what's wrong with me or shit? Why didn't I do this or all this stuff or you're surfing the net? You're like on your phone. Got phone addiction. What's that called when you're in that state? When you're in that state, the shit state caught was one word stuck. You're stuck. You're caught. Yeah. So you're caught is one word for it. You're like a, I do find myself in that state these days a lot and I hate it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's great. I mean, just like, you know what I noticed that gets me caught. What? He's like a lot of cool, like just today I had this thought I was looking around my house and there's like, I have all these things that I got to clean up over here. I got to put this away. I have too much clutter. Yeah. And a lot of the clutter that's laying around is like gifts, like people give you a gift. Yeah. And I think sometimes a gift is actually like the opposite of a gift is like, here's this thing that you don't want that you're going to have laying around that's probably going to like take up some of your thoughts. Yes. That you're probably, you know, one day, five years from now, you're going to be like, I guess I'm going to give this to the goodwill. Yes. But those five years, it's going to be laying on the shelf. You're going to like, it's going to take away your attention for a little bit. You're going to be like, where do I put this thing? Right. Here's a book. Here's a gift as a book that you're going to be thinking about. I should read that book. It's a gift. Yeah. I don't want to. It's not a book I want to read, but since it was a gift, I got to keep it. Yeah. You know, stuff like that I find all over my house. Dude, it's so interesting. I want to get rid of that stuff because it's not a gift. It's a burden. It's a burden. It's like someone gave you like a little tiny weight, like an ankle. Yes. Someone's like, here's a... But the intention is there. It's like, you know, giving a gift is like a nice intention, but people should stop giving gifts. Well, this is... Gifts are a burden and a waste. It's very trippy to me. You know what they should do is take something. Here, I have a gift for you. Where is it? It's here. I'm going to take it. Yeah. That's a gift. That's when someone takes something. Well, that's what you do. I've heard in like... I don't know. I don't know which Asian country, but if you go to someone's house and express interest in something, you're like, whoa, that's really cool. They'll just give it to you. It's like, oh, have it. They'll just give it to you because they're like... That's it. Flow. Because they're like... You know, they're not hoarders. They recognize that matters like a river that's like taking little breaks inside of people's houses. Like little... You can look at whatever the stuff is in your house is just a puddle of matter that's like temporarily congealing there before it gets... It rivulets out into some other place, a good will, someone else's house or whatever. And so keeping that flow going is part of the practice is like, oh, yeah, I fucking take it, man. Take it. Even if it's something really nice, you know, it's just like, oh, okay, you can have that. Just take it. I remember you were doing that when you moved... When you were moving to New York, I think. Yeah. Gave it all away. Good stuff. Gave it. I went full like... Oh, shit. Is he going to commit suicide? Like I went full like give it all away because... That inspired me. I gave some stuff away during that time. I forgot. I think you gave me something. Are you in this kick-ass bed that you're going to give me? Yeah. Everything. But it was actually like too big of a thing for me to transport. I was... Well, I mean, there was... I didn't need it. I had a bed, but I was like, that's crazy that you're giving away that bed. There was some pragmatism behind it though, because it was like I was moving to New York. There's no way to keep it. Right. I don't know what to do about it. It wasn't selfless. But I'd been reading this book called The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up by Marie Kondo, and it's this hardcore book on... Was it the Japanese book about seeing if something you love, keep it, but if it doesn't bring you joy, get rid of it? Get rid of it. And it's hardcore. And it's like... And it's... So her methodology, which we followed is... So the way people clean a house is they'll go from room to room. You go to your kitchen, then your living room, then your bedroom, and she's like, no, that's not how you do it. You put a rooma down. You put your rooma, you run the rooma, you mop, but she's like, what you do is, first, I think she says you start with your clothes. So you go and you take all your clothes out of the drawers, out of the closets, wherever you have clothes, and you make a big fucking pile of your clothes. I need to do that. Yeah. And so that's the first thing you do. You go and you look at every single article of clothing. And if it is not your favorite thing, if it's not something that makes you happy, if it's the thing you've been thinking like, oh, I'm going to wear that two months down the line, some... You know, just think it... You just get rid of it. You get rid of it. You get rid of it. You get rid of it. Get rid of it. Get rid of it. And you will have like five garbage bags of clothes. And then you will have almost no clothes. Like you'll have like five shirts. I have a sock problem. I have two drawers full of socks. Get rid of them. And they're all like free, you know, purple and pink comedy socks that you get like shwag for free. Yeah. You know what I mean? People give you like free socks a lot for some reason. Yeah. All my socks are like joke socks. Joke... Get rid of those fuckers. You get rid of all of it. And so you do it and you do your clothes. I think from clothes you go to books. From books you go to... There's a... Because I don't have a lot of books, but there's some that I just... I had... I liked so much that I don't want to get rid of. You keep those? No. According to her? What? Still get rid of them? No. You get rid of the only books that you keep... You keep like... I can't remember what... How she describes to decide what books to keep. A lot of us are hanging on... You scan them first, right? Yeah. You scan them. Page by page. And print them out. You scan them. Spiral bind them at Kinkos. Yeah. Spiral bind them. And put them in the basement. Yeah. That makes a lot of sense. Her thing is like... A lot of us hold on to books because we think we're going to read them, but we're really never going to read them. So what she says to do with the books that you know that you've been trying to read for while and you're not finishing is you say to the book, you think, well, thank you. The thing you taught me is that I'm not going to finish reading you. That's what I learned from you. That's what you taught me. And you get rid of that fucking book. So what ends up happening is suddenly you're surrounded only by stuff that you love. Only by stuff that you really, really like. And like I used to think that I was messy is what I thought. I would think I'm a messy person with a broken brain and that's why I'm always going to be messy for the rest of my life. But really the reason people are messy is because they have too much stuff and they don't know where it goes. Once you get rid of 40% of your shit or 60% of your shit, everything has a place because you know what it is. You've made an active decision to have it in your life. And then suddenly your place becomes clean all the time. It would be challenging to get it messy because you don't have stuff to get it messy with. Like, what are you going to do? You don't have things to scatter around. And then that's a form of freedom. And now you're lighter and like your house feels lighter. And then it starts going into your mind. And then you start thinking of like, fuck, what are the things in my mind that I need to like get rid of? It transfers to your mind? Yeah, because the according to the book, I don't think she mentions that in the book, but that is a natural result of like changing your external, your internal is going to change changing your internal, your external. So if someone brings you a gift, can you just say no, thank you. You I know, I think, no, you accept. I think it's it's I think it's you accept gifts and there's a circuitry there. What if you take the gift and like you take it from their hands and you just like twist 90 degrees and drop it in a garbage can say that's rude, say that's my gift to you. That's my gift to show you how everything's a permanent or usually you don't even open it. You just toss it. She recommends if someone gives you a gift, give them a tattoo. So if someone comes over and gives you a gift, tattoo their arm with the name of the gift that they gave you. So for the rest of life, they have to look down and remember that they gave you that fucking gift. Yeah, like, no, dude, I want to tell you why it's weird that you're mentioning the guy like type. You just write best buy gift certificate really big on their arm. Yeah. And you get to choose the font. You get to choose the design, whatever, and they can't say no. That's why so many people in like Asia have weird tattoos. It's because like, that's the yakuza. You know, all those fucking tattoos or gifts they've been given. But dude, it was interesting that you brought you're bringing up the gift giving thing because I was listening to some to Ram Dass lecture and he was saying that so if you're wanting to purify yourself, really go hardcore purify yourself and become, I think it's called a brahmachari, what you there's all these rules and one of them is some of them are obvious, right? Like sex, bye-bye, drinking, intoxicants, bye-bye, purify yourself by not having sex. Yeah. No, no, the idea is no sex. I'm so pure right now. Oh, we got to get you dirty, boy, because I'm part of the night. No sex, no sex, no drugs. No sex, no drugs, and no gambling, and, but this is the one thing he said I'd heard. No dancing? No dancing, but this is one of the, no, you can dance, but this is the one of the things he said I'd never heard before is no giving or receiving gifts. So you stop that. Just funny you mentioned that because- How do you not receive a gift? I think you say- You say, sorry, I meant I'm doing a cleanse right now. Yeah, I'm doing a cleanse. I can't accept gifts right now. I really appreciate it. Or you just like, do you do a white lie and say, thank you for the gift? You turn your back on them and walk away and huff away. I think you would just be really honest, but like, yeah, I'm doing this thing right now where I'm not giving or receiving gifts. Why don't you give, wait, act like you give me a gift. Here you are, Doug. Are you kidding me? What? Are you serious? Dude, it's a fucking Blu-ray DVD player. Whatever. Are you kidding? You're not going to take it? I'm cleansed. You're a dick is what you fucking are. Fuck you, man. I fucking saved up for that shit. I lost her seat. Take that. Take the player. Okay. You pussy. I was testing you. No, man. Let's test each other with gifts. Like in the next month, we'll see how each other handles it. I'm receiving gifts right now. I'm in a gift receiving mode right now. I don't mind. Because I like, this is one of the cool things about Burning Man is like it's a gift economy, so people are just giving you shit and you realize like how resistant we are to being given. I'm going this year with you. I know. And you realize how resistant you are to receiving gifts because someone will give you something really, really nice. Like what? Like a fucking cool ass shirt or like a badass like laser printed LED glowing flashing thing that they spend a lot of time on or like, who knows what, who knows what and something will pop up in you and I'm like, I don't deserve this. What do I got to prepare for? For the burn. Mm-hmm. It's my first burn. Do I need to bring gifts or like something, what's your entry level stuff I could like barter with? Well, it's not barter. It's not barter. It's not barter at all. It's like you just think like, what's something people out in the desert would really like? You know, like if you're like walking in the desert and you haven't eaten for a bit or you're super hot and it just depends. You know, people have different like financial levels of what they can give. And so. Cash? You give them fucking gold. Can I just give cash? Give diamonds. Give out diamonds. That'd be funny. Giving out cash would be really funny. I don't know if anyone's done that before and it seems like it would like, it seems so chaotic and confusing because you're giving them money and it seems like, but I don't know, man. That's certainly a funny thing to give people. I see people go around with spray bottles and they'll just take your goggles off and they'll spray them down for you and like clean your goggles off or they'll like spray you with water when you're super hot or like in some, you know, some of the bigger camps, they'll just like give out all day long. Like there's a camp called me so horny, I think, and they just give out me so soup all day long. So you go there and you just get me so soup and they just give it. There's no, there's not a second of like, give me, give me something now. You just sit down there like, here's some soup. What if I went to Petco and just bought all the snakes they had? Give people snakes. Just hand out snakes. Yeah. That's, that's something you want in the desert. Very common gift out there. I've been given a couple of asps, rattlesnakes. That's one of the funny things about leaving Burning Man is you end up with a bag of asps. Bag of asps. A bag of asps and it's fun because you get, when you get back to the hotel room, when you get back to the hotel room and it's no longer a gifting economy, then everybody pours their asps out onto the floor and you trade asps. I was looking on Craigslist after Burning Man. I noticed a lot of asps for sale by owner. Yeah. That's the best time to buy asps. Free stuff. Yeah. If you want to buy asps, then go to Reno right after Burning Man and you can stock up on a year's supply of asps. That's a good tip. Dude, it's a great fucking tip, man, because right now, and the closer we get. How many do you need for a year's supply of asps? I mean, it just depends if you're at what kind of asp, man, you are. I prefer like, you know. I'm an asp, man. I'm an asp, man, too. So I have a garage full of asps. So I prefer like 350 asps, not quite one for every day of the year, but definitely close to that. Because some weekends, you just don't feel like playing with your asps. Yeah. But if I'm stressed out to go back into that flow state thing, if I'm stressed out, I'll go into my asp room and I'll sit down on the floor and I'll release three of my favorite asps and it just calms me down. Uh-huh. Because you have to focus. Yeah, yeah. One bite from those things. It's game over. You're done. You ever do the Python thing where you have them choke you out? While you're jerking off? Yeah. I fucking dress in ladies' clothes. I love that, man. Yeah, it's so fucking hot. Yeah, it's the best. Yeah, you got to put mouse fur on your hair so it goes into the constricting mode around your neck. Yeah. Because otherwise they know not to strangle you. Mine is trained, which is so cool, which is the mode. Oh, he constricts? He's trained to constrict and he's also trained to like when Giz splatters onto his snakeskin. He knows to release? He releases. Oh, so that's how you don't like, yeah, die, I guess. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, that's one of the big, that's a huge cause of death these days. Who whispered your Python? Gary Thicke. Who's he? Gary Thicke is like one of the top Python trainers in LA. So he will, it's really cool the way he does it. Like, you know, it's a little awkward if you're like, if you feel sexually repressed or like weird about it, because you're going to have to like sit with Gary and like jerk off on the Python in front of him. And like, there's like a couple of months of that. And so, but you, he's, it's like he's invisible. You don't even see him there. And then, then after that. So once the Python learns that like to relax upon being smattered with jizz, then you, then you go through the tightening process, but first you jerk off on the snake. You know, if you do it the other way around, you're fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I can tell. You got to give me Gary Thicke's number after the show. No, no problem, man. No. Yeah. He's, it's amazing. It's like ThickeWhispers.com is his website. If you want to go. Oh, nice. Yeah. I know. I know. Um, pythons. I know, dude. That's one of my favorite. That's weird though. Having the albinos though, cause you don't know where to wipe them down after the, after you jizz on them. Don't, you know, that's actually one of the common mistakes people make is they wipe the jizz off the Python. Don't do it. Oh really? It's great for their scales. They fucking love it. You didn't know that. Leave the jizz on the Python. Like don't that wiping jizz off. I'm definitely calling Gary. Dude, these are the things I didn't know either. And I didn't want to say anything. It seems so obvious, you know, now thinking about it, but when I was at your place, I didn't want to say anything cause I don't want to be rude for those of you who've never been to the Pound House. One of the coolest fucking houses in LA and one of my favorite things about it is that Doug Pound has an aquarium of like, I don't know, what is it like nine piranha now? Oh, the piranha? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's nine now. Yeah. There's nine. Down to nine. Yeah. And that's, but what happened to the one that, one or two, well, three died? There was, we had 50, yeah, but they wouldn't, they didn't get along. Yeah. They didn't like when, I should have taken an improv class cause that could have been funny. Well, I mean right now it just seems a little fishy. But one of the things that like, one of the things that bothers me is about your Python room and I didn't want to say anything to you about it is I'm like, dude, you're not coming on these snakes. And then, how can you tell? Well, because they don't have that sheen. Oh, they're kind of dull? Yeah. They're kind of dull, man. Yeah. Like, you know, I went over to God, what's his fucking name? George Clooney. I got lucky. Your friends took me over to Clooney's and he's got a massive Python room and those fucking pythons, man, they gleam must be shiny. They are so shiny and you're like, yeah, this is like, this is one of the, this is the elite level. You know, like I've heard that he pays people to jerk off. Yeah. Cause he can't provide that much. No, he's probably got some nice loads, but you can't, no one can. What kind of pythons? I mean, thick boys. Oh, these are fucking thick, dude. Like they're fucking like, it's like looking at like a long gated bicep. Like it's like a take Swartz and Eggers bicep in his prime and elongate it and cover it and come and you've got a Clooney pythons is fucking amazing, dude. It's amazing. You know, but yeah, this is one of the things about, you know, animal husbandry and learning how to be a good caretaker of the earth and you know, that's okay. So I'll bring the snakes to Burning Man, but for real though, what else should I know? Or should I just know nothing? Is it better to just go blank? No, like, no, like watching the movie before you see the trailer. No way, man. I mean, that's one of the things about Burning Man. Like they have all these like, you know, yeah, I want to go there and be like, you know, it's like, you go to a party and it's like, oh, this is a, it turns out it's a dress up party. You just want to go, it's a survival situation. So like you, like it's called radical self-reliance. Now that being said, there was somebody who like one year walked into Burning Man naked to see what would happen and he was fine. Like he had nowhere to camp, nothing at all and he just, he walked in naked and like got sucked into the, you know, super organism that Burning Man is and ended up having a great time. He drove out in a Hummer. I don't know how he got there. He drove out, like goes in naked, comes out with a car with a bunch of stuff. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. He drove out with a Hummer filled with ass and his suit, like a nice Italian gutsy and a crown and a crown and like fucking like amazing, like, what are those things called that you put on? Fully clothed, like with like furs and breast implants, claws. He'd been converted into this like hermaphroditic, beautiful being with like glowing eyes is amazing. But he walked in naked. But if everybody walked in, So maybe the less I go in with the more I'll come out with. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. But if everybody goes in with less than the whole thing falls apart. So like the idea is radical self reliance. So it's like go in there with, with like just thinking like I'm going to be in the desert for a week. I'm going to, what do I, Well, what gifts did he give if he's going to naked or was it just like an experiment? I think it was an experiment. Yeah. I don't, I don't know what gifts he gave her. Maybe he's like, Hey, anyone needs some piss. You know, he could probably provide that. Anybody cold, anybody need me to lay my sandy naked body on top of them to warm them. Yeah. Yeah. Anybody need like pheromones or like a knife, but you know, maybe massages. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He could give him a massage. Yeah. He could provide skills or he can like help build yurts or something. Yeah. I mean, there's all, and that's the other thing about it is you can go in there and you can volunteer that you volunteer. So you can sign up for stuff. Like you can go and work at like different parts of Burning Man, which they tell everyone put in like, I think I just want to go there and work. I don't even want to enjoy myself for party. Well, that's, I just want to put in some, That's high level burner realizations because what ends up happening is you start realizing that like you're having way more fun helping. Yeah. I honestly, I'm serious about that. Like thinking about going there and just like partying and, you know, feeling dehydrated and like gross. Like I'd rather be like doing stuff. Right. Well, I mean, that's like one of the, Not just dancing my life away. So is the thing was to do that one night and then the rest of the time I'm working. Well, what's really cool about it is to abandon your plan. So go there planless with an intention to help. I've noticed is pretty cool and because it's like, if you, if you go there with a plan, which, which some people do, I want to go to this thing and that thing and this thing and that thing and that thing. I think that's a cool way to do it. What's cool about it is there's no right way to do it. I think there's just a pretty pragmatic approach to it, which is bring enough stuff so that you're not going to be dependent on anybody and bring more than that. So you can give people stuff who need it and then figure out like some other thing that you could do that's a value or service, you know, and there's all kinds of things to do at the camp. Like you could come in early and help them build a camp, which is what I did last year and that's one of the most fun, hardcore psychedelic things. Cause you've got to in the middle of the fucking blazing desert, build a big camp for people and like put it all together and do whatever you're good at. And, and you know, for me, that's like digging ditches. Like I'm not good at like construction work. I'm not good at that stuff. So you just, and then you start doing this kind of like, not to be sound cheesy, but it's like you start doing the sacred work because humans used to gather together and work together not for money. You know, that was a, it was a tribal thing. You just get together with the tribe and you work together and like there's no drug tests. There's no, oh, be here at this time. Just, you just work together. And then something in that hits like the same kind of part of you when you're sitting in front of a fire. Yeah. It's a primal thing that it's a, it's something that it just feels satisfying or something. Yeah. Yeah. It feels satisfying. Yeah. And it's, and it's cause you're going from a me to an us. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean, that sounds really appealing, but you know, now, now you got me thinking. Yeah. People are going to there. If a lot of people are going there to help, maybe I'll bring some projects in that I could have people help me. Like I'll bring in my IKEA things and like, I need some help with this stuff and just have free labor. Dude, that's so right there. And I could oversee laborers doing my work. That's a great idea. Like I can maybe buy the parts for like a tiny home, roll it in on a trailer and just have free labor, put it together during Burning Man and I could just get stuff done during Burning Man. I was thinking like, why don't you build a paper mill out there? Yeah. Build a paper mill and like just have come people like, you know, you bring in the wood, but have people bring the pieces of the paper mill and people come and as service construct the paper mill. Yeah. And then work on an assembly line or do whatever you do in a paper mill and just fucking print like big sheets. Huge rolls of paper. Like typewriter paper out there and then that's great. And then leave with a paper. Leave with a paper mill and a bunch of extra paper and then you've given people the gift of service. Yeah. And what a great gift that is. I think you've got an amazing plan. Yeah. I could be the first person to take advantage of labor for personal use. Actually, and that deck, I could be just like that naked man that walked in. It's an experiment. Okay. It's not a selfish thing. It's an experiment that I'm doing. Well, people will be talking about and it's going to change the game. Dude, honestly, that's what's so cool about the place is like that something like that. If you've figured out a way to really do it, I would be, I think it would be like embraced in the most hilarious way that people would think it was so funny. Like there's so many like cool things that they're like a church. You ever seen the church that sometimes they, I don't know if they still have it out there, but there's like a church that they build with a, they build it like the Amish. They build it like a barn. They bring out the fucking pieces. They build a church. There's a pews. There's wrote pews. There's a pulpit. The pulpit has within it, telephone books and just instruction. What happens afterwards? Well, did they disassemble the church? I think they eat that one. They disassemble some of the stuff they burn. They build it and they fucking burn it. Well, that's, that's not wasteful. That's wasteful. I want something I could use and make money off of them for decades to come, such as a pay for real business. You've got, you've definitely got the right idea. I mean, that's like one of the coolest things about Burning Man is it is a, you know, for profit thing that like one of the things there, do you think I can get someone to help me to take care of these corpses I got in my basement? Yes, I can help you with that for sure. At Burning Man. That's a good place to get rid of them. Well, yeah, I mean, yeah, you can actually like just bring the corpses out there and give the corpses away as gifts. Great idea. Yeah. Okay, I'm going to do that. Yeah, that's it. That's it. Great idea. You have a meat wagon that you drive around and like catapult corpses in the people's camps. Pretty corpses. Corpses. Corpses coming through. Who's hungry for corpse? This one's rotten. Who wants a mushy corpse? You could set them up outside your camp kind of like, you know, they would put at a port during pirate times. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. That's a great, that's a great fucking idea. Tell people don't come near here. It's a great, that's a great... Or maybe come near here if you like corpses. That could be the name of your camp. Corpse camp. Corpse camp. And I'm the only living person in my camp and it's all corpses. And the number keeps increasing. If you enter it, you don't leave. You don't leave. That's your gift. That's my gift. Your body. You're giving, you're giving your body to... Yeah, that's one of the fucking things I love about that place, man, is it's just like, there's no, like, you'll go to some camps and they're fucking like, you know, really into like new age stuff and they're like really kind of, you know, for some people, consider it to be really cheesy and it's just not your thing. But then you go to some camps and it's nihilists, you know, there's like, there's like, you go to some camps and it's just like gutter punks, like on half pipes, like, you know, there's the nihilist camps. Should I bring my skateboard? Absolutely. There's half pipes? Yes. Hell yeah. Yeah. There's half pipes. And yeah, that's like, I think, I can't remember the name of that camp, but it's in the deep playa. My friend said it's a nihilist camp, but I'm not really sure what that means. I've never really stopped there. But there's a camp that's like, there's a camp that's just a suburban neighborhood with tiny houses with yards, suburbia, I think it's called suburbia. And it's just like a, you go there and they like, they'll try to like... They make yards? Do they roll like sod out? No, they bring like fake grass. But if you catch them at the right time, they'll try to like sell you at one of their homes. They'll try to pitch like the rules of the neighborhood. They're real serious about it. But there's a great bar there too. It sounds fun. Dude, it's the best. It's just like a never ending encounter with like people who've spent the whole year, many of them, just preparing... Are you preparing all year? Me? Mm-hmm. Man, not as much as I should. My camp is. My camp is. Can we make it our car? It's too late. It's too late. We always dream about making the art car, but it's like going through the process of getting... Because you got to bring this fucking art car into, I think, Gerlach. I can't remember which DMV, or there's a DMV there. And they inspect the art car because they have to make sure it's safe. Because it's like, some of these art cars are gigantic. Oh, I see. And people... You can't just drive it across California. They like put it on a trailer? Well, you could drive it, theoretically, if it was drivable. Some people put it on a trailer, but when you get there, you got to get it inspected. Because some of these art cars, people can get... You don't want them to collapse or some awful thing to happen. And I think you have to apply and let them know what it is and go through. It's a lot of money to build one of those things, and it takes a lot of time. But it's great. The art cars that are out there are so wonderful, and usually they'll just let you climb on. And then you're just riding around the desert in this booming, blasting, blazing LED-glittered thing. Do you think if I brought some tanning beds, people will be into it? Absolutely, dude. But they'll just be cots. You just set them out. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. Uncovered beds? Dude, that's a great idea. Yeah, tanning beds. Go get your tan. Free tanning bed. That's a beautiful idea. You definitely should do that. That's a good one for our camp. A tanning bed. Yeah. We'll just get a bed and put it in the sun. Hahahaha. Hahahaha. Brilliant idea. And the way it starts making your brain work, you know, is really funny, because suddenly you... How do I dress to fit in? Well, I mean, it's not... Because you see the typical Burning Man people in there wearing like furry vests and like top hats from the turn of the century and, you know, monocles and stuff. But I think that's kind of... I think that's... Or does anyone have their own thing going on? Well, I think what happens is like... I just want to fit in. I just need to know if I should get a monocle and the top hat and the furry vest. I think people see that and they think that's how you dress. Or am I being insulting right now by joking about that? No. You know, some people get incredibly sanctimonious about Burning Man and that's a whole group of people who get like really, really sanctimonious about it. And there potentially could be some burners listening maybe or cringe a little bit at some of this stuff because it's such a precious thing to them and like... But I think that's a bunch of shit. Like... Well, I've never been to Burning Man and I've only heard good things about it. Yeah. I've never met anyone that's like went to Burning Man. Even Natasha who seems like the polar opposite. She was even like saying it's really cool. So... Yeah. It's beautiful. I've only heard good things and I'm psyched. But I mean, some people go in there with like something in them that they need to deal with. Right? And again, like no one says, here's what Burning Man is. So the best way to say is like, here's what I think it may be or what it is to me. And what it's doing is it's purifying you. It's like burning parts of yourself out that maybe need to be burned out. Like for me, one of the things that it taught me is how very little I need to be happy. Like you know, and how community is way, way, way more important than anything else. And then it kind of reminds you of like how nice it is to do hard work with people just to help. And it teaches you all these things mixed in with like some personal shit that might come up. You know, for me like one of my problems is like, you know, which is why, you know, one surefire way to get depressed is to think you don't deserve the good things in your life. And like that's a fucking thing I struggle with a bunch. So like, you know, like it's helped me with that a little bit too, you know, and just basic shit like that. But that's my own personal. That's my own personal thing. It's different for everybody. But if somebody comes in there and how do you, how does that trans translate? How does Burning Man translate to helping you deal with such a thing as that issue of not thinking you deserve your good things in life? You know, you know what I'm saying? So it reminds me. So like what happens is like, if I'm feeling like if something, if really good shit's happening for me and I start obstructing it, which is what I in the past I've done, because I don't I now my obstructionism might be based on something that I think is rational, but at the base of it, it's self sabotage kind of stuff. Yes. Yeah. So if that I've done that before too, for sure, it's a real problem and it comes from something you don't deserve. You don't deserve. And like what happened to me at this last Burning Man, which is really fucking trippy is I was like sitting in the camp and I was looking around at all my friends. I'm like, man, this is so beautiful. And I asked one of my friends, I was like, do you think it's better to live a life where you think you don't deserve stuff and you're grateful for it or that you do deserve stuff? Oh, isn't it kind of pompous to think you do deserve the beauty around you? And my friend, who is a psychiatrist was like, no, you need to think you deserve that. You do deserve this. You deserve love. You deserve beauty in your life. You deserve it. Like this is something for you. Right. So that was just a cool moment. I started crying. It was like, and even though it sounds like I'm crying now, I'm now I'm sniffling. I've got a fucking cold. I wish I was. But I started crying because I was like, fuck, man, this is why I get depressed. This is like one of the root core problems of my life. So then later that day, we're just wandering around and there's a telephone booth called Talk to God, right? And like I went in there, I'm picking up the phone. We're fucking improvising like we're talking to God, just bullshitting. Is there someone on the other line? No. No one's on the other line. We're just yapping, passing it back and forth. But then suddenly I'm holding the phone to my face and this lady's voice comes on. It starts ringing. And I said, I didn't think anybody's on the other line. And she goes, I'm always here for you. And then I'm like, well, I just want to say thank you. This is so beautiful. Thank you so much for this. It's just the most beautiful thing ever. And she goes, well, you deserve it. You're being too hard on yourself. You deserve all this. Completely unrelated, completely not connected. And yet that thing bubbled up again in that moment. Started crying again. I was like, thank you. I just slammed the phone down on God because I was so upset. So overwhelmed. It felt so beautiful. So that's the kind of magic that happens out there is that kind of shit can happen where it's like teaching you. But that's only me. That's me. It's like fucking imparting. And that's cool, too. If that's what you're into. Now, do people have sex there? Nope. And that's one of the coolest things about Burning Man. And one of the things I love the most about it is they have a very, very strict no sex policy. And they have sex detectors. So like if someone starts having sex, they've got trained fucking desert crows. So if someone starts having sex, desert crows will just swarm wherever that is and pull the tent up and just start pecking the people. And it's fucking, you'll see burners who have got like scars. They tried to make love. And they kept fucking, even though they were getting like poked by those desert birds. So like, no, for real, though, do you see, is there like just people do like doing it like out on the sand, um, sand in the cracks? Well, they have contests. What's that? I think there's like a boner contest. Like you can get the interaction the fastest. No. Oh yeah. They have like boner contests. So for real? Yeah. Like they have like pussy eating contests. There's like an orgy dome. I think there's like a fisting tent. I'm pretty sure there's like a, there's like, if you want to like go out there and get kinky man, you can definitely, definitely do that out there. If that's your, what, what you're interested in, you could definitely do that. And that's healing for a lot of people because a lot of people are really sexually hung up and like feel like really bad about their bodies and feel really bad about sex in general. And so there's like places there that you can go that maybe will help you like deal with some of that shit. If you want to have like dusty fucking hardcore, crazy desert sex, certainly that is a thing. But some people are tortured out there. Like they go out there and they're like, warning. And like, I remember there are these guys in our camp and they're fucking horny. This guy's like, dude, let's go. We got to get laid, man. Let's go get fucking laid. We got to get laid. We got to get laid. And like. Whatever you're in that mindset, you don't. And you're missing out on the whole burn because your whole brain is like fixated on fucking. You know what I mean? And so then you end up like, which is where for me, it's like, not that anything's wrong with wanting to fuck. Did your friends get laid? What? Did they get laid? In my camp? Those guys that you were saying they were going out there. I don't know. I didn't see them afterwards. I certainly hope they did. They were, they were like handsome dudes. I'm sure they did. But like, like I, whenever I'm out there and the agenda starts popping up for me, whatever the fucking thing is that I'm thinking I want to do or whatever, if I just get back into the moment, then all these like crazy synchronicities start happening. Like another crazy story, man. This is one of the weirdest. At the time I was having like severe back problems and I was having to use an inversion table to fix my back. Just not at the Burning Man necessarily. No, before the burn. And I knew I like, cause I was inverting every day and it was helping me a lot and I knew I'm going to go to the burn, my back's going to fuck up and it's going to suck. So like I'm laying in like, I woke up in the morning, my back's fucking killing me. Some people in my camp are doing some kind of like weird D&D game that one of the camps do where they sit. It's like basically a scavenger hunt thing and they're like, Duncan, we got to go and do this like, they want to do some kind of like improv play thing. And then we get another token that go into the, and I'm like, that kind of shit doesn't really, it's like, I want to do that, man. It sounds really kind of embarrassing, but you know what, I'm going to fucking do it because these are my friends and they want me to, I'm not going to resist. Go with the flow. Go to the camp. This is directly after me waking up thinking, man, I need a fucking inversion table. Go with the camp to this place. And of course what's sitting right there, a fucking inversion table. Like within like 30 minutes of me thinking, I need a fucking inversion table and it never would have happened if I was resistant. You know, so there's like, it's cool, like weird little magical things like that happen out there. It's pretty miraculous. What's the most mystical thing that's ever happened to you? Like in my whole life or at the moment. Anything come to mind or paranormal? Yeah. I mean, a lot of mystic, because I hang out with these Ram Dass people. So like a lot of like mystical shits happen to me, man, like, I mean, one, one of them is, you know, I was like sitting at this Ram Dass retreat and like, I got lucky enough to be sitting at a table with like Ram Dass and some other people. And they give you these little necklaces that haven't even curly Baba on them. Who's my guru and I get attached to that shit. Like, I get attached to it. Like I like it. It feels magical. It feels like they protect me. It's really woo woo woo superstition. Really. Excuse me. I'm going to be disgusting. Thank you. So anyway, I'm sitting at the table, cross from Ram Dass. There's a woman at the retreat who sees the necklace that I have and like she's, she's looking at, she's like, that's really pretty. It's got name curly Baba on it. I'm sitting in front of Ram Dass, you know, and she's pointing at the thing in front of him saying, that's really pretty. So like, I've got to like give her the necklace, you know, like there's a conty part of myself that's like, I want to keep it and keep it, but I'm like, all right, I give it felt compelled to do it because they're watching. Well, I was showing off really. I mean, it was like, but there was another piece of me that's like, just give it to her. You can start getting tuned into that. Just give it to her. So I give her this necklace, Ram Dass notices it, notice me somebody Ram Dass notices. He gets a big smile on his face and he like looks at me and he goes, that was good. That was good. And then I walk out of that encounter and I walk outside and someone from the retreat walks up to me and I'm like, Hey Duncan, I brought something I want to give to you and immediately gives me a necklace immediately just as like, here's a necklace and it was like this. The same one. No, it was this Buddhist. It was a Buddhist necklace. Upgrade. It was an upgrade. But it happened so in such a cliche, right, hilarious way that it was so one of the chances that you give one away and it just like one appears, but you couldn't write like if you wrote that in a movie, it would be like an after school special. It would like, and then you could pause and be like, and that's why you give away neck left hand. You know, everyone watching would be like, give me a break. Yeah, it's like that. Yeah. It's that that's that's that my paranormal experiences are all based around this guru named Crowley Baba. And what's really funny about him and the way things come to you through grace, he's a grace guru is that it's like, like dad joke level, awesomeness. It's like these ridiculous miracles that are like so on the nose and so like beautiful, but simultaneously like, give me a break. You know, like, give me a break like, like I was at, you know, at the beach watching the sunset with Aaron, you like, I'm seeing now and more and more talked really about it on the podcast, but like, we're sitting there looking out of the ocean and the sun setting and our song that we have together is like Margaritaville and we're sitting out there, we're holding hands, very romantic. And then just like right as we kiss, Margaritaville starts playing just as the sun setting and you're like, give me a fucking break. You know that song probably plays once a day. Actually, yeah, that's what we found out is it's the only song that plays because it's now the Bama they legally can only play Margaritaville. Oh, it wasn't. So this is not in Hawaii anymore. This was a different. No, this is in Alabama. Oh, okay. But like, how did you, how did you like find your guru? Like Ram Dass is not your guru? No, Ram Dass is a teacher. And you know, it's really, how did you get into that whole thing? Well, what happens with that stuff is really interesting, man, is like it happens. It's a real slow burn for me. For some people, it's super fast because they have really good karma. But for me, it's been like a real slow burn. So when I first encountered Neem Karolibaba, it was looking at Be Here Now and there's a picture of him in it, but I didn't know that was Ram Dass' guru or anything. Be Here Now, the Ram Dass book? Yeah, it's like this picturesque hippie book. Yeah, I've seen that, yeah. There's this picture of Neem Karolibaba in it, and I looked at him and my mind just thought, whoa, that looks like my uncle, that reminds me of my uncle. And that's like, so that was like one of my first encounters with him and the way my brain translated, that's my guru, that that's my family. My brain was like, oh, that's your fan, he's in your family, that's your family. And then what ends up happening is like, over time, this dawning realization starts happening that starts with like hardcore skepticism, hardcore embarrassment. I used to be in a fucking closet about this shit, man. I would not say I had a guru, I would not say it was, I would not talk about it. I thought it was not funny, thought it was embarrassing, thought it was antithetical to being a comedian, I thought it was cheesy, I thought it was embarrassing. But then the more connected you get with it, the more stuff you start experiencing and the more peace starts filling up your life, that you start realizing like by not talking about it, I'm actually being a phony piece of shit. You know, like, so it's been a real slow, beautiful, like sun rising thing. But like for someone like me who has like no idea what any of it is, I have a vague, you know, notion that they do meditation retreats, Ramdastas. But what does it mean to have a guru? So what it means is it's like you encounter like a consciousness. It's like you basically just become embraced by this like consciousness. And again, my description of it is I don't, this is my own dawning realization. Does he know you or do you, does it like, you know him? He's dead. But it's like you're you encounter like his, I mean, it's like outside of time, it transcends time. So you end up meeting him and you have to deal with that. Like it's like, you know, my mom died and like, I still encounter my mom. She'll pop into the room. Sometimes I'll feel her and it's real. And you tell someone he's a skeptic and they're gonna like, dude, you're delusional. You're trying to comfort yourself. It's like delusion, sad. And you all you can say to them is like, I understand you think that I understand you think that. But if you feel that, then it is real in that in that way. But it's fucking real. It's not real like, oh, maybe or whatever. It's like, no, this is a this is an aspect of human experience that has not been quantified yet. But is it's a real encounter with a being. And so it's the same with name Crowley Baba, which is that you'll start, he's got you, man. I mean, there's different descriptions of him, like the new Ram Dass book coming out. One of the teachers, Mirabai Bush, talks about like, you know, he's called Maharajee. But another name of him, I can't remember the name. And she thinks of him as a tiger because by the time a tiger pounces on you, it's too late. It's got you. Like you can't it's got you by the time you fall in love for real fall in love. It's too late, man. You're in love. Like go back, go backwards when you're in love. Try to not be in love when you meet someone you truly fall in love with them. Go back. You can't. It's like that too. It's a lot like that too. And then there's just a lot of like surrender to the weirdness of it. And then the more you surrender to it, the more comfortable you get with it. And then you just always have this thing to sink back into, which is really for me, like it's been one of the ways that I've been able to not go completely nuts in the way that I used to be is because it's like, it's great. Does your guru have like writings and stuff that you can that you read and apply or anything? Well, that's one of the really cool things about him is he didn't really like write much down. But there's stories and like Ram Dass tells a bunch of those stories in a really cool way. You know, there's stories of someone. So your guru found you or you found, I think that's a better way to put it is like you get lucky and you get drawn in and it's luck. It's from, I don't even think luck's the right word for it. You just sort of like, it just happens. And then suddenly, but, you know, and this is one of the things that they teach is like, you can't really be in a hurry. Like everyone's in a hurry, you know, of course you're in a hurry because you're suffering and you want your suffering to like, you want to figure out a way to like not be in pain or to deal with the problem or to deal with the mind. And like, so you can get in a real rush and that's where people get into trouble because they like, well, you know, they're very nefarious people out there and you can, you can end up getting stuck with someone who's like, wants you to think they're your guru in the same way. You can end up getting in a bad relationship with somebody who wants you to think they love you when, when like, that's not real love. It's very similar. So, but the Rambas people, they say even that when that's happening, every single thing that's happening to you right now is preparing you for the contact that is inevitably going to happen with this being. And whether that is a human, whether it's Christ consciousness, whether it's God, whether it's your soulmate, it's every moment is perfect and moving you there already. Like you're already being drawn in, you know, it's already happening. It's just like anything else. It's probably not going to happen at your pace that you would like it to happen. You know, like when you're, when you don't have a girlfriend, you're lonely. I know, I know. And it doesn't happen at your pace. It does. I've noticed that when I've been like deeply lonely and like sad and you want to force a result and you start acting like to make shit happen. And that's where people get sucked into like Pua shit, like pickup artist stuff. And that's when people start getting sucked into lying and manipulating and like magic, maybe using power magic to try to like. Well, I just downloaded Tinder Express. Oh my God. Yeah. And now I don't have to worry about waiting anymore. What happens? It's just instant. In under an hour. Yeah. Someone comes to your house and talks to you. And starts a relationship if you'd like. And marries you in that moment. In, in under, in an hour, usually an hour or less. So you're, why don't you? Tinder Prime. You've gotten married. You're married now. A few times. Yeah. You get divorced too. Like you can bring like a judge comes. So you can, you have to give them half your shit. And that's the real Marie Kondo technique. That's the real technique. Get married and get married and be forced to split half and half. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It started to derail with that dumb. No, derail. I don't care. And I mean, it's just like, it's a, it's a, it's like, I just noticed that like, what ends up happening for me with all these things is it's not never the thing I expected. It always comes out of the blue, always comes out of left field. I never could have planned it. If I tried to plan it and never would have happened, I would have gotten in my own way. And then you realize, well, what the fuck can you do then? And I think that what you could do is just work on being in the moment and being comfortable with who you are right now. Like loving yourself right now as you are warts and all and being that and just sitting in that and being that and always going back to that and war, and that's the practice. Genital war to know any kind of war you have is a perfect war, baby. And it's like, you just like, you just embrace that. And that, that just like making a, a, a quiet decision that as much as possible, I'm just going to be here now in this spot. And when I'm not here, that's okay too, but I'm going to come back here if I can. And then all the other shit takes care of itself. I've noticed, you know, I mean, that's when the fucking good ass start coming. When I started this meditation practice, do you know how many asps I had? 50. Zero. Wow. In six months, do you know how many asps I had? 5,000. 5,000 asps. Wow. And you know how they came? Why? I don't know why, but you know how? Um, maybe you put down some pellets or some, some snacks for them. I didn't do anything. One day I just opened my door and fucking asps, like a river of asps just slithered right into my house. I thought of a cool, um, app recently, um, because I was at, um, I was at the lake walking around the lake, Echo Park Lake, and I saw this group of people in a circle and they're, they all looked like they're having this intense conversation, but they also didn't look like they kind of like all look like different styles of people. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. You ever see like a group of people like that? Like, what's up with that? Yeah. And my, my, my notion was that maybe they were like having a Christian Bible study or something. Right. But I thought that'd be cool if they were all strangers and there was an app where you can, an app, my app idea is called circle of strangers. That's a great idea. If anyone out there wants to make it, just make it. I just want to use this app. What a great idea. It's like I'm bored tonight. Um, I would like to get into a circle of strangers and maybe everyone, when you're in that circle, everyone has the same name. Maybe everyone is called John, John, or, you know, maybe neutral, something neutral. Pat Patty. That's fucking cool. Chris. Everyone's Chris. Yeah. Circle of Chris. And you go there and it's like, okay, meet at this park and we're going to be in our circle. And then you just go and just talk to people, strangers for an hour and then you just leave. What a great idea, but you got to leave. And then if you want to meet someone in that circle, that's how you make the money. 99 cents will get you to connect with one of the strangers. See, that's what I love. You're always thinking about monetizing. That's like what I, I just started the monetizing at the end there. I just kind of freestyle that. You know what circle of strangers is now Uber pool? Yeah. Just start doing it. But that car ride ends. Well, that's that. That's the added. That's probably the best part. But what this dude, circle of strangers. Have you ever been in an Uber pool where you're like, I mean, but circle of strangers, everyone's into meeting other people. Uber pools, people are into saving $3. Circle of strangers is fucking brilliant. But you know, you don't even have to like make the app. You could just like look right now. It's April 13th. When are you around? Are you around? I'm going to be out town, but are you around on the 19th, the 18th? I'm around. You're around on the 20th? Yeah. You're going to be around on the 20th? 420. You're going to be around on the 20th at 420? Well, I don't want to do a pot thing. Okay. 19th. The 19th. So why don't we say the 19th at sunset? What's your favorite park? Oh, wow. I don't want to blow up my spot, but I can do... Just name a spot. Well, maybe Echo Park Lake. Echo Park Lake. Echo Park Lake. Which part of Echo Park Lake? Maybe by the swans. By the swan boats. By the swan boats. Up on the berm. On the berm at sunset. There. Be there. Be there then. 19th. April 19th. You guys just heard it? My book is called Be There Then. Be there then. Living in the past but being in the present. Like living in the... No, living in the future. There you go. Wait. April what? April 19th. 19th. The Thursday? The Thursday at sunset. Circle of Strangers. Echo Park Lake. By the swans. By the berm. Gather there, friends. With Doug Pound. And talk for... Well, you better come too. I'm going to be out of town. Yeah, but I'll do it the next month. We can... I'll do this. You know what? You probably shouldn't be there. Because that's what it's all about. Is not having any security. Right. Yeah, you don't... But everyone else is going to come... Who cares? Just... Pair it up. You just throw it out there. This is like a cacophonist event, if anything. Like, yeah. Yeah. That's what it is. It's the 19th. You guys heard it. You got to start doing those again. Well, yeah. I mean, we've had a couple of great ideas. Actually, the one we came up with. Aaron and I is called the Sunset Mugathon. And so what it is, is two people pair up. We're going to walk down Sunset. We're going to start at Mellies. And we're going to walk down Sunset Boulevard. And the way it works is, one person's in front. Another person's in the back. The person in the back mugs the person in the front. Right? Fit air guns. You put the gun to their back. You're like, give me your shit. Give me your shit. Now, now, now. Then when you get their shit, you run. Right? You're like, stay right there. And then you fucking run. Right? Yeah. And so now you run a little bit. And then they come behind you and mug you and get their shit back. It's a really good exercise. So it's going to be like a team of people mugging each other down Sunset. It's a Sunset Boulevard Mugathon. And we're going to end at the Thirsty Crow and get hammered at the end. But I'll announce that date. I just don't know when it is yet. But those are going to happen. But for now, we have it. The 19th Sunset Go Gather with Doug Pound, Circle of Strangers.

284^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - Henry Zebrowski Transcript and Discussion^2018-03-28^Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. I'm dirty little angel. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns, Dirty Angel, out now. New album and tour date coming this summer. Greetings, friends. It is I, Dee Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast, which is being recorded at the Shepherdsville Ranch. We've got a beautiful, thriving community here of right around 550 people who've all decided to join their material possessions together and congeal into a super organism that isn't afraid of sex, that isn't afraid of psychedelics, and most importantly, isn't afraid of love, isn't afraid of bathing together, of combing each other's hair, of oiling each other's feet and hands down, of singing to each other, and of dancing in cyclical motions based on movement patterns that were channeled to me by an emerald that I found in the Amazon. A little bit about me? I have never been in a fisting chamber. I've never been in a fisting chamber. Never will I go. These allegations are completely false. And now a quick word from our sponsors. Please join world-renowned shaman, Vinnie Torrito, for a walking tour of Silver Lake while under the influence of America's favorite plant medicine, ayahuasca. While having your soul reharmonized by the Amazonian vine of death, you will enjoy such sights as the Elliot Smith mural, the Elliot Smith wall, the Elliot Smith bar, and delicious gourmet coffee from Intelligentsia. Pocket volunteers will be on site to collect your puke and shit as you walk through the neighborhood called the hottest spot in Los Angeles by Trulia and the new Brooklyn by Homespotters magazine. Go to shamanvinnietorrito.org for all the details. Use offer code DTFH to get 5% off your walk. Hey guys, I was contractually obligated to do that ad, but I'm not contractually obligated to tell you don't go on this tour. I went on the tour, it's horrible. The puke buckets are tiny, they're Dixie cups, so it's not even puke buckets. It's very small red Dixie cups and certainly not enough to hold your puke. People in front of you will puke, people in front of you will shit their pants. I slid on the puke and shit of a person in front of me and I landed on the sidewalk and I broke two of my teeth out and this happened exactly when Mark Duplass walked by. So it's very embarrassing for me as he is a hero of mine to look up covered in another man's puke and shit with a bloody mouth and say hi, I'm up. It was an embarrassment. ayahuasca is great, but I just don't think it goes well for a walking tour. Also shamanvinnietorrito is not a real shaman. He's just a guy from New York and I don't even know if it was ayahuasca that we're drinking. I didn't really hallucinate. I just shit my pants. So don't go on this tour. Please don't go on this tour. Don't even go to the website. Now some quick business. This episode of the DTFH is brought to you by Audible. Go to audible.com forward slash DTFH or text audible.com forward slash DTFH to 500 500 to start a 30 day trial and receive a free audio book. Let's face it, sweeties. We're teetering on the edge of the singularity and are all about to be disassembled by nanobots at a quantum level, which means we don't have time to read those floppy old books that get wet in the bathtub and covered in jizz. This is why I love Audible. Audible has an incredible selection of wonderful books that I like to listen to as I'm running on the treadmill, exercising, pumping iron, doing my mountain climbing, doing my calisthenics, doing my Pilates, or doing any of the exercises I do all day or even when I'm out hunting deer or animals in the wilderness, I'll put some Audible audio books on my phone and nothing relaxes me more, especially when I'm making love to my darling. Right now I'm listening to the original Be Here Now lectures by Ram Dass, which I just found on Audible. But Audible also has my favorite Ram Dass audio book of all time, which you've heard me yap about here. Millions of times before, experiments in truth. By the time you finish listening to all these audio books, you are gonna be glowing with the supreme divine light of God and maybe even you'll be able to walk through walls. I know I've extended the amount of time that I can make love without coming by 15 seconds, which means I now make love for 16 seconds. But here's some super cool features about Audible. If you want to, you can share a book from your library with anyone and if it's their first time accepting the book, they can listen free. You can share audio excerpts from your favorite listens with anyone and you can use speed control. If you're in a super hurry, you can listen to it even faster. They also have whisper sync for voice, which means you can switch back and forth between reading and listening to the audio book. All you gotta do is go to audible.com forward slash DTFH and sign up, you'll get a 30 day free trial, which includes one free audio book and if you have not listened to Ram Dass's experiments and truth, I couldn't give it a higher recommendation. Thank you Audible, my eternal thank you to my Patreon patrons for subscribing to the DTFH over at patreon.com forward slash DTFH. You are my masters, you are my mistresses. In the morning when I wake and gently lap urine from the cup of my hand, I think of you. I will do anything that you wish, whatever it may be. As long as it's listed on the Patreon rewards page, which you can find by going to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. Subscribe and you will get instant early access to podcasts before I release them onto the main feed. For example, there's a Mark DuPlas interview just sitting there that I can't release until May and the interview you're about to hear has been up there for a few days already. You're gonna get commercial free opening monologue free versions of the DTFH. I know some of you have that disease shepherd's punch, which makes the tips of your fingers incredibly sensitive, meaning that it hurts for you to skip ahead past commercials having to take that sweet, precious, tender, beautiful finger of yours and push ahead a few minutes to not listen to opening monologues and commercials causes such pain inside of you that you have to put a belt in your mouth or you could bite off your tongue. Worry no longer, you'll never have to do that if you go to patreon.com forward slash DTFH. You can jump right into the hardcore interviews and also I put a really embarrassing, generally didactic, completely confused and really disorganized hour long opening ramble there with no interview at all. Just me yapping if that's something that calls to you if you find the soothing wilt of my voice which has been described by many as deep as the deepest river in Eden, smooth as the first taste of LaCroix and soft as the soft undergunt of a baby unicorn.

All right, without further ado, it is my satanic pleasure to introduce to the DTFH for the first time someone who hopefully became an internal friend of mine and an infernal friend of mine as well. You've seen Henry Zabrowski on Adult Swims. Your pretty face is going to hell. You've seen him on Heroes Reborn, and you've probably heard him on one of the best podcasts ever, last podcast on the left. And now you're about to hear him here on the DTFH. So spread your oily feathered wings and send a bolt of gargoyle energy blasting through the void right in Henry Zabrowski's sweet, pulsating heart. Welcome to the DTFH, Henry Zabrowski. Oh. Welcome, welcome on you, that you are with us. Shake hands, go with you, you will. Welcome to you, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. There we go, now would you mind talking? Like this, one, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Yeah, it looks like it's actually working immediately. That's a fucking miracle, man. Except you see the way I have this blocking our faces. Like I gotta fix that, but I don't think we should do it now. It's like a really stupid setup. It's kind of fun. It's like I'm looking at you through a window. Yeah, it's cooler. It's like cyborg-y or something. Yeah. And some kind of HR Giger painting or something like that. I imagine his family must be terrified of him. She's like, I wonder if Giger ever looks at his son and be like, are you fiddled with worms? He's such a fucking maniac. But he had that roller coaster. He had a roller coaster. Yeah, that's kind of, to me that's the beauty of him. That's like the, what do they call that, the cosmic giggle. Because that's this person who is expressing his love in this dark way, admitting, you know, but it's still love. It's still love, but he definitely views his son as like a hypersexual alien because he knows he is one and he feels like he's full of eggs. But that's nice to him. It's like comforting him. Like a country cabin quilt is to me because it reminds me of my mother where it's like, oh, but to him, he looks at his son and views him as a wriggling mass of worms. He's like, I made you, what's my cock son? He's like, thank you, daddy. Do you have a look into the darkness? Stairs back? Yes, daddy, just like you. I love Giger. I do too, man. Can you, can you imagine like being over at his house? You're, you're, you're just like, you're blasted, man. You're probably doing like Rails Academy. And then he's like, then he's like, come on my train. I have a tiny tutu train. I shaped it like, it is all shaped like the alien from alien. Unfortunately, that's my story to tell. Every artist has fun story. But to end up like riding his fucking train, man, you have done something right in life if you ended up riding a train with that artist. It was him and I had friends that hung out with, what's his name? The guy that did all of those crazy, who did Alice, who did, what's his like? Yano, what's his name? The guy that did all those weird ass claimations. Like, ah, fuck, I hate skipping out on it. He's another super severe Austrian abstract artist. Okay. Where they go and you go hang out with him and it's just supposedly surprisingly chill. Right. Like you go and hang out with, Frank Meyer. Yeah. You go and hang out with this guy and you're having like tea and it's like normal. Like it's just not dark at all cause he seems to get it out of his system. And then, but it's, it's a select few. It's like Jim Henson's daughter and like some weird ass, other creators like that are there that all got to be invited to his weird little pad. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's just you, I think it's kind of like the, it's funny because what somebody was telling me this about. Oh yeah. Like don't get a, don't get a person confused with their persona. Yeah. You know, and with an artist, I think, you know, like the thing coming out of the artist, the thing coming out of the vehicle, doesn't necessarily mean that that's the vehicle. Yes. It's like, but it's weird, right? Because as an artist, I feel a lot of the times I want my persona to be confused for who I am. Cause that means I'm doing a good job. That means my art's coming through clearly. Like people are getting, getting the impression of me. And so I also feel as a person, as an artist myself, doing whatever when people meet you, you, you want to be with, almost you want to be what they expect you to be a little bit because, because that's a part of the pleasure. That's the strong version of me. That my persona is like strong side of me is out there. And it's nice to have people attracted to that and get me. But cause the real, I do that as a replacement of the real me cause I believe that the real me is not enough. So I wonder with Giger and shit like that, where they live in such a whole, a whole other world of artistic impression where their whole house is a gigantic, it looks like alien cum. Like the walls are all like slippery and everything's made out of snake leather. And you, he has kind of put it into himself. So then he can afford to be super chill. Right. Cause he's like, you're already in my house. Yeah. Well, I mean, this is, yeah, this is one of the things they said about Anton LeVe, the black house, you know, they said that like, he actually did have. So what, wait, wait, wait. Have you ever heard anything about going over to that guy's house? What that was like? All I remember is he took his leg off. Like, is that what you said, without his leg? No, Anton LeVe going over to that. Yeah. Oh yeah, Anton LeVe. Yes, of course. You know, you heard about going over to the black house. Yeah. I mean, San Francisco, you'd show up and he was very performative though, but that's very satanic. Yeah. They're like, oh, the idea of celebrating the exterior and doing like you want to appear to be exactly as you want to be. Yeah. Well, yeah. And then he would, but he, like I heard that he had a parlor and that what would happen is you would go and say, have you ever heard this? You would go and sit in the parlor. Okay. So it was like, so when you came to visit, now I don't know if this is a hundred percent true, but it does come from very reliable sources. He had a parlor there and that you would go into the parlor and there was actually paintings on the wall and the paintings actually did have people's in them where he could come and watch you. And he would keep you like doing like the pure Lord Michael's Lord Michael's. Yeah. Pull a Lord Michael's on your ass, except you're not, you're not like, you're not waiting to get a job on TV. You're in the fucking house of the guy who wrote the satanic Bible. Yeah. The high priest of the evil himself. And he wants to watch you squirm and see what you do. You look at, well, that's very, that's, that makes a lot of sense because then you get to see a peek into the inner life. It's like a, it's a voyeur thing. And then you get to also see how your persona is affecting them and how powerful your magic is. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. You get to get off on that and it must be super fun. I mean, but in God, I'm friends with a bunch of Satanists and I love them. They're cool, man. But for me, like it never was. They can be cool. Sometimes they're very serious. Well, yeah, that's for sure. Yeah. Well, they're, they have this sometimes, this heaviness to them. Yeah. That's real because things in the world are heavy, you know, like things, they're like, I don't mean literal. I mean, obviously like mountains are heavy. Yeah. Mountains are heavy. We have a gradient of densities in the material universe, man. And it's like. Shit's heavy. Yeah. Shit gets really heavy. And like, and like, and what I really love about Hinduism, and I think it would, if you were, I think Satanism is a little bit of what in India, you might call shivism, like, you know, you know, shivism. No. So, so, like, shy. So the Shiva, it's Shivite. Yeah. Shiva, like the God is a destruction. Like God of destruction. God of destruction. Not that it matters, but, you know, anymore. But the idea is like, it is funny to argue over the gender of the thing that is the thing that obliterates all time in space. Exactly. It's a man. Well, it is because it's a Shiva Lingam is what they worship. It's a phallus. It's like this. It's like a fucking, like, black phallus that they put, like, flowers and honey on. But what it represents. I want one. Shiva is, we all want a black phallus secretly, huh? But. Please let me, please change me. I got my Polish Scottish and none of it's good. My whole body's a fucking trash zone. Just give me one black phallus. One nice, one nice thing. Yeah, but it's cool because, like, so, like, in the West, we've got this, like, you know, repressed, death-terrified culture that, you know, descendants of these fucking. Because we're locked into our meat and we're afraid of losing our meat. Yeah, and, yeah, and in the West, with a meat as dirt. So in the West, the meat is bad. Yeah, we're stew. Yeah, we're all horny and that's bad. That makes us more horny. Yeah, so it's bad meat that we're inside of. We have to put clothes on top of it. Like, it's, you know, and, like, you see this in other parts of the world where, like, certain parts of the meat are worse than others for, like, you know, for example, like, a philosophy professor was talking about how he had some student from the Middle East in his class and the student had to quit, had to leave because he couldn't deal with girls in shorts. Like. Because you could see her knees. Seeing those fucking ankles was getting him hard. I get it, I get like that too, but I think I know that it's my most inappropriate part of me is the fact that I get horny just by seeing shins. But that's, I'm just, I'm high, I'm wired like that. But I, oh, but that's also, the Hossie community does it as well when they used to try to paint over the bike lanes in Williamsburg because they hate seeing the hipster girls go past in their, like, jumper outfits and then they are just getting more and more nude. Fashion isn't making the women of Williamsburg getting more and more nude as it goes and they are just roiled up. Thank God, because it's like a very funny thing because it's like, here you are worshiping this being that has brought all of everything into itself. But why do they worship death specifically? Like, why is Shiva the one? I was talking about the Hossie. What I'm saying is like the first of people, so like what I'm saying is it's funny that many people who are fundamentalists and believe that God created everything think that we should wear clothes. Yeah, I don't understand. They made the boobies. Yeah. They made the vaginas. They made the penis. If you believe that God created all of this shit, you should be celebrating all of it. It all should be. And then the feelings that you have are the natural feelings you're supposed to get horning. Yes, technically it's supposed to be for making babies, but can also be for rehearsal for making babies. Exactly. You just, how you frame it back to yourself, which is then we talk about, I've been watching that Wild, Wild Country documentary about the Rajneesh group, the movement and about how there's a lot of that makes sense to me and the idea of like, well, let's celebrate all of these sensations that we were built to experience because if not, what do we see? Zero killers. Like a lot of people that do a lot of horrible heinous crimes, people that send the line of abuse down in their families in terms of like parents abusing kids and turning them into abusers. And all essentially, it seems a lot comes from repressed sexuality. It comes from not being able to express the kernel of essential truth that has to fucking pop out at all times because if you block it up, that's how you get fucking cancer. Like that's where I get deep into where I think we manifest these tumors and this evil because we're not coming enough. Like essentially we're supposed to be coming more. Well, there's the, okay, so it's like this news, you know, everyone's, not everyone, but like the conspiracy freaks are really flipping out right now because another report came out about how they found the Yellowstone Super Caldera. They found, they like were able to identify by studying earthquakes. They can kind of do like an MRI scan. And essentially I just, they identified like this massive like vein of lava that goes like, this just a huge, Yeah, cause Yellowstone's about to explode. Right, exactly. And so these serial killers could be, I guess you could say they're like super volcanoes except instead of magma, it's the cum that's stuff. Built up in your nuts, they can't come out. Cause it's a part of it, especially men, because men are, I mean, men are dangerous. Men are very, like we are built technically to be dangerous. Like there's something about us that pops off. And then when you get, we talk about it on the last podcast all the time, is that when you get the sex impulse mixed up with the murder impulse, as soon as seeing blood makes you horny, you're fucked. Because I know I get random boners just like driving my car, thinking just normal thoughts that I can't imagine if like, and just being, I'm on a hair trigger for a boner. Just me as a man, I'm pleasant. Like I'm a pleasant, normal human being where it's like, I can't imagine if mayhem causes you to have a boner, you're going to be seeking it all the time. But then what, I mean the, or the idea is, so it's like right now, many of us, our boners come from like circumstance. Yeah. The concept is that you can like begin to control the energies enough of your body so that you can like summon up a boner based on just about anything if you wanted to. I wonder sometimes if my lack of, because I used to practice ritual magic a lot. And then I wonder, and I used to do it with like, with sex magic, a part of it, I always used to obviously use sigils and I'd fire them using masturbation rituals. You'd come on the sigils. I'd come on the sigil or you come thinking about firing the sigil, like doing stuff, or you could also do it during sex. Like you can be like kind of create a separate space in your mind as you come and imagine the cymbal shooting out into space. Would you ignite the sigil after you came on it? I, I've never done that. I did the, one thing I took it, I, cause I came on it and then I put it in the toilet and I flushed it. That's not, I mean, I guess chaos magic, I'd be like, yeah, I guess I puts it into the circuit. I mean, it made it all wet. Like that was the problems to go, right? I was literally was like, I'm supposed to set fire to this, but it's, it's not stopping. I'm not, I'm fucking Peter North. It's a Scott, it's like maybe a teaspoon. But do you ever think maybe your cum sigil ended up in a dolphin's blowhole and killed it? Do you ever think that maybe there's some dolphin skeleton at the bottom of the ocean? It was just swimming around. Fucking wheel goes round and round. You know what I mean? It's just about, that was that dolphin's time. And I'm not going to take that away from the chance of the universe. That's like, that was meant to happen. That was a dolphin that was about to rape a woman, a human woman and it sucked into its blowhole and I stopped it. If only we lived in a dimension where the problem was that cum sigils were getting into dolphins blowholes. If that was the pollution problem and it was chaos magicians and other sad weird fat men such as myself desperate for TV jobs. I was, especially at the time. But then you release it and all these poor guys just getting arrested for all my poor poor ropy cum. There's no, come on. Guys, stop coming on these, you know, it's just like, it's like, you know, they'd start selling these like biodegradable sigil papers where it's like, this is, this is, use these guys because then, but there would be of course like cunty nerd magicians who are like, no, the biodegradable paper it isn't appropriate for manifesting. Actually, it doesn't really work like that. You have to be able to, you know, just like, all right, bro, just come wherever you want. Just gets like, just get buckets. When you were doing it, when you were working magic, was there, did you ever have an encounter where you experienced something that you weren't really ready to experience? I, it's a part of what made me kind of fall out with doing, like I used to do pretty regularly and work it into my life, like kind of follow moon cycles, to kind of, and slowly build it in as I was immediately very enthusiastic once I started reading about chaos magic. And I was like, oh, I'm gonna use this, especially for things in my mind that were pretty frivolous. Cause that was the first thing that I had read. They were like, well, be careful what you use it for because you're gonna mix up a lot of chaos into your life. And so I did an elaborate ritual in order to get an acting job. Like I did it and I received the job. Which job? Heroes reborn on NBC. I wanted this real bad. It was down to me and somebody else. And I did a, I don't know, again, who knows how the universe does work. But the part of it is that I believe I manifested a chunk of it because it was a pretty lucky break for me to get. It was at the time. I mean, like, I mean, whatever, obviously. And then it's a part of the constant thing I have to talk about with my therapist and all the stuff about how my work is not me. My accomplishments are not me. I don't have to worry. But like that's the, because I didn't need this job to make me feel better about the things I feel that I'm lacking, which is kind of what it was about. Like it was obviously, that was the real psychological root of why I felt I needed to get this job and why I turned to magic. And then the sort of cracks that appear in the ritual and your intent as you go or then manifested by, my life was then filled with insane energy. Like there was just a wackadoo. My whole life went into fucking chaos. Like weird shit. Like it's, you know, it's stuff that's hard to explain. I think that if you are, I was in it, I was in it. I was in it and I wasn't, it wasn't seeing things, but it was like weird occurrences and like repeated numbers and songs and the things that popped up. I was, I watched a truck explode. There was the thing where it's like, I was driving through the countryside and I watched this like I was thinking about kind of the circumstances that I was in my job. Like, cause essentially it's like I got this job and then it wasn't everything that I expected it to be. And then it was kind of a massive ego trip. And I was trying to figure out like wrapping my head around like why did I even want this? What does this going to mean for my future? And then I was driving and I just watched this truck fucking explode on the highway. And it was like this thing. So it's like, it's subtle. Obviously it's subtle energies. I think at the time I was really isolated. I was living alone in Toronto and I was smoking a lot of weed and I was spending a lot of time alone. And so a lot of things held a lot more importance than maybe they would have if I wasn't in that frame of mind. Well, that's the magical frame of mind, isn't it? I mean, that's sort of when you enter into that landscape that we're, I mean, you know, from the outside people are saying, oh, no, that's just the, what do they call it, the observer effect? Yes, yes, yeah, you're pulling everything. I'm changing everything by expecting things out of me. You're seeing patterns that aren't there. I mean, the reality of the situation is you're a talented actor. The people decide, when the people chose you, they chose you because they knew you were a really great actor and they knew you're perfect for the role. That's what the skeptic would say. Of course. But it doesn't matter what the fucking skeptic is saying because in a weird way, they're casting their own kind of spell, aren't they? To try to like create like a calming state because for them, it's really terrifying to imagine that the universe could be built in such a way that the ability to sort of explode your subjective reality out into other people's subjective reality. So if you think about what that ritual did, is it divided you? Yes, very deeply, because I had to think about it. That's very interesting because I had to think about both sides because I'm a rational human being. I haven't spent enough time in the magical world, especially at that time, to understand that my perspective was warping everything and then also that I couldn't let go of the other more quote unquote rational explanations of being like, you booked this job. Like you said, I booked this job because I did well in the audition and I did the, I got super lucky. It was like one of those lucky things that happened where lightning strikes like five times. I'm the right guy for the right job. That's what acting is. Did you ever take any acting classes? Just floor estate, which is essentially. So you studied a thing. Yeah, and I expressed it. Did you drive to a bunch of auditions? Oh yeah, and I knew the casting director and the head of talent NBC, I just worked for A to Z. So it was like all of these things were built into it that helped me get the job. But at the same time, then you become this sort of like manic little dictator of my own tiny world where I was like, I made this happen using my cum. I did this directed magical ritual. Now I'm a shaman and I am, I have control over this fucking energy horse that I could do whatever I wanted. And I was walking around thinking like that. And like all of a sudden I'm feeding into, which is another thing that's actually warned about in several chaos magic books. They're talking about how, I forget that it's a fun term for like, the idea of magicians starting to believe that they're past humanity, where it's like, if you are really deep into ritual magic and then all of a sudden you're like, look at these fucking people moving in slow motion. I'm matrix, it's like I could go and I could steal your wallet right now and you'd thank me for it. Like all that kind of like very, very grandiose thoughts, which I guess is also a symptom bipolar disorder, which is like, what am I, maybe I'm just, I sort of tripped it into my brain. Yeah. No man. How did I was doing this thing? You, I think that Robert Anton Wilson calls that, what is it, the chapel perilous? Have you ever heard about, heard that before? No. It's basically like when you start practicing magic and you start realizing what you can do and see that there is an effect that seems to come from actions that don't seem really related to the thing that you were trying to bring into the universe and like coming on a fucking piece of paper with a sigil on it, then you start seeing the markings everywhere because you walk down the street and if you've got eyes for it and you look at corporate logos and you look at police cars. And you're like, oh my God, there's pentagrams everywhere. There's pentagrams everywhere. And then you start realizing, oh, they're signaling, it's some level of reality just above the sort of numb, zombified haze of the reality that many people who are working 40 hour weeks and consuming TV and not really thinking too much about. What you're putting into your head. Yeah, it's just like, oh, this is a normal place. I like what comes on the radio and I like waking up in the morning and I eat the stuff that I saw in the commercial. I don't know how many people out there actually like that but I think there must be a bunch of them. Millions of them. That's what fuels the corporate entities that are running our planet, that have run every single thing that we touch, every single thing that we are involved in or are run by some sort of corporate entity. We're completely stuck in it. My question is, is it so wrong to then look at your life because I get a lot of shit in terms of wanting, it's not so much that Satanism is a religion or Satanism is like this kind of, this magic ritual life is a false construct or this idea that I'm supposed to be a member of some group or believe in some hierarchy of rules or something. But is it so wrong to wanna give an actual meaning to my observable reality? Is it so wrong to wanna say I do believe that maybe we don't live in a series of things that were created specifically but it's okay for me to imbue meaning to it because then it gives me something more to live for. Like it gives me something more to join in on with life. The thing is it's like, because it's not fashionable right now, because if you just come out and say, well, you know, man, it's like everything's love and it's all coming from a love force and there's all these ways to connect to that love field including ways that appear on this outside to be pretty fucking grim and there's ways to connect with that thing and the ultimate goal of, if you ask me, personally, for me, the way I do it is through my guru, Neem Karoli Baba. So I have a guru. I've practiced magic, you know, and I've experienced the manifestation and the fucking... What could you? Yeah, and the... You're sitting at the end of this thing. I was like, oh man, I did it. And then I was like, I did it. And then it's like... Yeah. I was just like, I feel like I've transmuted to the top of a rock like fucking Luke in The Last Jedi where I'm just sitting on the thing but I'm just in an apartment in Toronto. You know what I mean? Like I'm not actually there. No, actually though, but if you really think about it, you're in an apartment in Toronto in the middle of an infinite void which is within the mind of vast, sentient, super intelligence. And so in that way, it really is a magical universe. And it's true we can make things happen with magic. It's just what I love about like having a guru and the concept of that... Do you go see your guru? He died, thank... He died. Oh really? Yeah, and now, I mean, Jesus Christ, everyone, whenever anyone hears the term guru, they cringe and it's scary for a lot of people. No, it's a very good thing. Guru work is like in guru groups and people that focus on a guru has been around forever. It happens. Yeah. It happens. One of the great descriptions I heard of, I think it was Ramakrishna is, he was like a corpse that the universe spoke through. So sometimes these people, they obliterate themselves. Whereas like, you know, I had this great grimoire. I gave away because it fucking creeped me out. But in the beginning it had this wonderful introduction and what it said is as a magician progresses and you get closer and closer to the Godhead through this practice of magic, your identity becomes, and you can't even distinguish the difference between you and the thing. Interestingly enough, there's a great book called The Rose of... I say it wrong, The Rose of Paraclesis. I don't know how to pronounce it, but anyway, it's a book about producing global quantities of LSD and one of the descriptions it gives of being an LSD chemist when you're working really, that kind of magic, that kind of alchemy, is that your identity begins to dissolve because of the matter that you're working with. You're like putting your thoughts and who you are into shit that people eat that become then an edible sacrifice of yourself. And then you are just depleted less and less. But what does that mean for your family? You know what I mean? Like a shit like when you talk like as a entertainer. Like so in this realm with my knees and my butt and the meat, I am a comedian and actor. So how do I forward myself into the world of magical thought and obliterate the self and still make money being on fucking friends and family on NBC? You know what I mean? Well, this thing comes up over and over and over again, which is that the ego or there's some part of the psyche feels terrified of this level of obliteration. Because that's all I've ever known. And yeah, and what ends up happening is the thing that comes to your mind is if I were to do this, you know, for comedians, it's odd stop being funny. For some people it's like, how could I be a dad? For some people it's like, how could I do my job? For some people it's like this or this or that. Now this is like one of the great stories in the Bible that I like a lot is the story of Jesus and the rich man, that story where this wealthy man comes up to Jesus and says, I want to follow you. And Jesus. Was he the one who's the rich man could get him in heaven, like the needle who the camel's eye and that whole story? Yeah, the one that haunted Elvis when he died on the toilet? Yes, exactly, because it's attachment. And so what happens is really what's being illuminated is what you're attached to. And you're afraid that if you let go of all those things you're attached to, then whatever the game is that you're currently playing in this very temporary mode of existence is going to like somehow change so much that you'll no longer be able to sustain yourself. And that's called the leap of faith. That's the role of the dice, because that's the idea of like, yeah, okay, well, fuck it. Let's get obliterated, man. I mean, let's go full obliteration. Let's see if we can be completely annihilated. And if on the other side, I'm just a big fucking wet mass of hamburger meat. So fucking beat, right? I guess I'm that, he better be entertaining. Yeah. I was like, oh, whatever that shit is. Yeah, yeah. I think that's very interesting, but that's where I really am. I feel like this is the other thing that I, it's like my inner secret thought of, I do believe that the future in some way is a psychic connection of us at our peak of enlightenment, mixed with technology. Yes. Where I believe that what will happen eventually, which is the problems that we're having right now, we're suffering massive like bottleneck into evolution because people can't mesh the, what you're saying, I like the concept of total annihilation mixed with the technological help that's going to allow us to speak to, which are probably the things that fly UFOs, right? Like the stuff that fly, the stuff that is UFOs, the stuff that we're looking at. So that's been another dimension that we interpret as UFOs and this kind of like otherworldly mental technology, M&M technology, which J. Allen Heineck calls it, which is this concept of like that maybe aliens are in another planet and they shoot ships at us with their minds. But that we'll reach that if we could somehow figure out how to combine the spiritual evolution with the technological evolution and then they kind of come one, like we do, which is I think a lot of people view as apocalyptic, like this idea of creating supercomputers and all this shit that can match our brains. And I think the only reason why it seems apocalyptic now is because we are not mentally ready to compete with competition on the market for the top most conscious being that exists. Right. Where it's like, I believe give the robots a chance. Yeah, I mean, what it comes down to I think is like, you know, really, what's your plan to stop it? What are you gonna do? Yeah. You wanna go blow up fucking Tesla? Is that your idea? Good luck, because that's what we're talking about. It's one way or the other. I think that's the other thing that people don't understand as to be like, if you really wanna stop this shit, someone's gonna need to go blow up Twitter headquarters. And I know that that's fucking probably illegal for me to say on a show, but I think it comes down to- Yeah, you don't mean it. No, I don't, it's satire. But a part of what I'm saying is that if you wanna wage war against the robot revolution, you're gonna have to do it because they are coming. It is happening, except, I mean, Uber's killing people with the driverless cars, but they don't care about the people. They're cared about the harm it's doing to the cars. These are the people we're up against if you really do believe. Do you know Taley Ardechardon? He's this Jesuit priest predicted the internet way before the internet, but he had this idea of this thing called the Omega Point. So basically the concept is time is actually the sort of like the tractor beam of the divine pulling matter into it. So we're being pulled into the divine. And so we're- The singularity. Yeah, exactly. So you could, to continue your idea of fighting against it, you could like, the idea is, oh, no, no, no. You think you could stop it by blowing a thing up or by, you can't stop it because what's happening is the sum total of all energy in the universe is being beamed up into the spaceship that you were talking about. And as it's being beamed up, the reorganization of it is creating exponentially increasing levels of harmony and complexity. And that's what was manifesting as technology. So the point is, is it's like, you're not really gonna be able to stop it. You're just part of the sort of, you know, like it's a really lame way to explain it. But like in Star Trek, we've got the map, you know, we beam someone down and we beam them back up. So right now we're the beam being beamed into a form and we're beginning to see the emergence of the form as it's, which is technology. If it wasn't gonna happen this way, it wouldn't have happened this way. You're right. We are, it is happening this way. We are the, we are shifting. Technology is moving, is coursing forward. Maybe it's got, maybe it's got a lot to do with the weird psychic breakdown of the corporate mentality that turned humans and human activity into money. So now the expression of humans and money is now psychic energy. All of that is all pushing into technology. So you need to tell me, it's like, yes, you wanna agree. If you wanna go with Bill Cooper and all this shit, the Rothschilds made us fucking money. They said that people were money a long time ago and that's why we're in this system of control that we're in now because they don't view us as, as living being consciousness. They view us as, as, as things to spend and to move into different piles and or because it makes the top of the top richer and richer. But the problem is that because we are now in that system, that is how the psychic energy is being expressed. That is what's happening. It is pushing it all towards the higher evolution in technology. And so it's, it's more that like, if people wanna be kind of like spiritual warriors about it, they have to then be like, well fuck fighting it. We have to figure out how to adjust the energy. We have to figure out how to take the, the stuff that's, that's already happening. We can't deny that it's happening. We can't say there's no technological revolution. We can't say that these things aren't catching up and the, the pull of them making us, making life more convenient for those of us who live very chaotic lives. All this kind of horseshit, all the weird, like the, the comfy capitalist things that it does for us kind of match a weird inner pleasure that then it has to also be supplanted with spiritual pleasure. There has to be like another thing that comes and beefs up. So it's like, we're just working out the right arm. I wanna know the difference. So you say this inner pleasure is supplanted with spiritual pleasure. I wanna know the difference between those two pleasures. I don't think there is. There's no difference. But I think it's one side and the other side. It's that we're, we're, we're bodybuilding on one side of the, of the human psyche and not on the left side of the psyche, which is people like you are doing, like with the fact of how much spiritual work you do and all the shit you talk about. And a part of it is that, as a part of it's bringing the awareness, like when you sadly, what I've learned like from fucking personal trainer, when I started working out, you start paying attention to the muscles and how they work. You think about how they work when you're working out. You think about how it's connecting. And so spiritually, it's like we have to do that on the other side in order to catch up with technology in order to essentially morph them together. And that's exactly, and really the reality is you, I was listening to this interview with Krishna Das who I love, he sings kirtans, he's like, send me some of this stuff. Cause I'm interested. I like hearing the idea of a modern day guru and people talk, like the people like this that are kind of cultures of personality almost that are, that lead people. Cause I like to see what they do. So I could see what I could steal for the podcast. Oh, great. Yeah, man. I like that's what you have to do. You want to, you know, the, what Krishna Das said is, and I really like this, he sings these kirtans, beautiful songs, it's called The Names of God. And there's so many different ones. They're very soothing to listen to. They're just a study on Sanskrit's effect on the brain. You can check it out. It's really interesting. It seems to be like some kind of new tropic or something. At least, you know, that's how science is describing it. These mantras are very powerful. And so in this interview, he said, I'm singing these to save myself. Like I don't have some missionary impulse here. Like I'm not, I can't do anything for you. And, and, and this is like, this I think is, is one of the first, now that is not to say if you're on fire, I can't put you out. He doesn't mean it in that way. What it means is like, you know, me and my girlfriend, we were walking and we ran into this alcoholic in the park and he's like sitting there and he's like, hello. And we go and talk to him and he's an alcoholic and he's going to kill himself or he's not. Nobody can stop him from killing himself. Like he has to decide. There's nothing you could do. But people can't take the responsibility. That's the, it's like, how do you teach everybody that there's a responsibility involved with straight, with choosing? You don't, you don't. What you do is- That's the problem. This is where I'm my fucking deep, deep like Anglo-Saxon. Don't. Just wanting to strangle whole cultures. DNA just kind of comes out. It's fine. But when we first, so, but what you do is it's sort of like, all right, well, I know that this universe I'm in is, in some ways a projection of what's inside of me. And so that's the concept is when we work on ourselves so we can help the people closest to us. So it's a very simple, simple equation, which is like, cause you know, like sometimes- Cause I'm cooler, I'm then cooler to my family. Yeah. And I'm cooler to my friends. That's it. Yeah. And like, I'll be in the midst of like, you know, I do mantra meditation. I like to chant. So I'll be in the midst of chanting. And my fucking brain will come up with this. Like I'll think of a friend and I'll think, oh, I should tell him that this is the thing that he might be interested in trying. And it's like, he's fucking piece of shit. What's wrong with you, man? What's wrong? You know what I'm, cause it's like that, that's not how it works. The way it works is it's just, it's like, it's known as polishing the mirror. It's like, we're sort of like, we're like doing this practice so that we start feeling better. It's very simple. And then you start feeling better. And just like you were, the people around you are gonna feel better because it feels good to be around somebody who feels better. But how do we pump this good feeling into enough people? It's so, that's where I kind of feel the divide right now and kind of what's happening. Like we're in this like weird spot where I think there's a lot of fear. And I hear it a lot of times, right? There's a lot of, what's happening seems to be in modern society is a lot of suicide ideation. Yes. There's a lot of when people talk about like, you know, people are upset about Trump. And there was like a thing when like a comet was coming past the earth and people are like, oh, she just hit us right now. And they're like super flippant. Yeah. About like wiping out our society or like all this kind of things or talking the constant talk, which has been around I guess forever about like how our society is about to fall apart. We're going to be nuked into oblivion. He's going to be fucking a super virus. So it's like this kind of thing where accidentally we're kind of like wishing it. We're wishing it all the time where it's like what happened with Trump. I think what happened with Trump was that a bunch of 30 year olds kind of, we created total recall in a real life. We blew up the movies we loved in the 80s and we're making them real because we all believe we are the central characters of our own inner movies. We believe we're all Arnold Schwarzenegger, Donald Trump's the evil president that's in a 80s fucking sci-fi movie and we're living in it. So but what do you do to give people a taste of the freedom of the polishing their own mirror so that they will get addicted to it? Like it's weird. It's like you have to be like, how do you give them the rub and tug version of a spiritual massage that allow them to be like, oh, I want to feel this all the time. You just did that. What's, well, this is the thing, man. Like, so like guru yoga versus chaos magic. The reason I like it lies because when we get into the magical workings, you know, you need to come up with a thing that you want. Yes. Which is more difficult than you think because guess what? I, the one thing I did learn about that was that when I asked for something really specific that I thought I wanted, that was completely wrong. Right. It was completely fucking wrong. So the concept here is, well, you know, let me help. How can I help is the best way to put it. How can I help? And so from that, in other words, how can I, if I'm going to let myself imagine, you know, in the same way we have the continuum of density on one scale, we've got death metal, I guess on the other side, we got fucking John Denver or something, you know, reflecting those different like energies. In the same way, there must be a continuum of intelligence. And if we're going to get into the world of UFOs and the concept, well, it's probably intelligence outside of this planet, then eventually we get to the point of a super intelligence. And if we get to that point of the super intelligence, then we get to the point of a maximum or ever unfolding super intelligence. And you think, let me help. Can I be of, can I, can I serve that? Like, what do I do? How do I serve love? How do I serve love? How do I bring it into this house? How do I serve love at the Chick-fil-A? Yeah. How do I go and I make sure that I'm serving love when I do the podcast? I make sure I do this thing. I do this. That's a very interesting way to go. Because then I'm afraid to go down the slippery slope of the super intelligence because all of a sudden I'm like, but I know there is one, but it's different than, because Kessel and I on last podcast, we always get into our private argument again about how Satanism is a religion. It's all the stuff where it's like, it's very, because of the things that go along with the concept of religion, it's very difficult to want to be a part of it. Like, I don't want to be a part of anything that involves like the weird hierarchies and human-based power that then could be manipulated all the time. No shit, man. You don't want to be part of that shit. That's, yeah, that's what, but it's kind of like, you know, what happens is you, I think it's who, what the fuck is it? Abraham Maslow wrote this book called Religious Values and Peak Experiences, I think it's what it's called. And it sort of identifies this pattern that occurs, which is that somebody has an epiphany. Someone dissolves their ego enough that this stuff starts coming out of them, it's like it's, this stuff starts coming out. Somebody basically- Yeah, your spirit comes, it comes to you instead of jerking. I'm trying to tell you, man, is don't jerk off on the sigil, jerk off into the blowhole. Right? Go straight to the blowhole. Let it eat its gum, because then it's food. I knew an actor that told me a fucking horrible story about how he used to drive across the country, he used to hate planes, he used to drive with his dogs. And he was like, yeah, he says, can we all talk about long road trips? And he was just like, it's like, yeah, you know, we were just joking about how like, it's like, I've jerked off doing a road trip. You know, it's like, well, I'm driving a long time, I've done a little quick jerk off in the little napkin, just because of the supreme just fucking violence of men's sexuality. And he's like, yeah, but the best part about going with the dogs is they can clean up the mess. And it's like, what are you talking about? It's like, yeah, you come in your hands, then you feed it to the dogs. And we're all like, what the fuck? What the fuck? Dude, is it illegal to feed come to dogs? I don't know. You know what I don't know. What? I don't know. Because a part of it's like, I thought about this because my dog was in the room with me the other day and I was jerking off. And it was like, I was jerking off. I have no moment of alone in my house at all because I live with my fiance and my sister. So I finally had a moment alone. I was like, I'm fucking, I have to come right now. And so I was jerking off and I looked over, dogs just looking at me. And I mean, it's like, it's that always, it's a very tacky 1980s standup thing. But it's like, I'm not really sure what to do with the dog looking at me. They like come. When you come on the bed after sex, they'll lick the cum. They'll lick up the cum puddle. I just, we leave her out. We leave her out of the room when we have sex. I mean, it is true though. Dogs like to lick up cum. Like if there's cum on the bed, they're gonna lick it up. It's salty. They don't know. They think it's ice cream. You think they don't know? No, no, no, no. I think they fucking know, man. That there's, I do, man. These are- Well, they don't cum, right? My dog does not know cum. We cut out her organs. She does not know cum. No, we're talking, these are beings that co-evolve with humans. Yes. So like they are- Ancient DNA memory remembers, but like sometimes if you're really hungry, master can come into my mouth and it's fine. Yeah, that was probably one of the traditions of the society that got wiped out by the meteor is like, feed the- We make food with our schnunch. The food, do you mean for the baby berries? Baby berries is food for dogs. And dogs like, thank you. They're very excited. That used to be like, I'm sure, like on the night of the full moon, a bunch of them would gather together and just jerk off and it'd be this huge puddle of cum and they'd whistle and the wolves would come down from there. No! Here comes the whore dogs. Look at them. What if we found out that's how we domesticated dogs is by fucking making cum bottles? They're addicted to cum. We thought it was feeding them, it was cum and that's why they lap up cum. It's just ancient memory. You get to stare. It's like, yeah. But man, to get back to the Maslow's idea, which is that somebody has this epiphanous moment and so you have to like decide, you have to ask yourself, does it really happen? I mean, certainly we have great piano players. We have incredible actors. We have incredible tennis players. We have incredible basketball players. Could there be some higher level of talent that goes beyond athletics or art? That's a really interesting way to put it because it's true, right? Because we look at somebody like Michael Jordan, we see their shit as transcendent, right? When they used to talk about how, the way he used to talk about basketball, we've talked about it on the fucking last podcast and do the same shit where it's like, he would say when he was in the zone, the rim of the basketball would look bigger. He said it would get twice or three times its size and so it's like, I couldn't miss. I was just throwing in a bigger hoop and it's like, so you essentially, that's magical thinking. That's like, you are, and we celebrate that for you. When artists channel something into a painting, when we see something in a painting or a beautiful film. So why can't that work with the guru who's somebody who's really good at the, I can fucking make you see yourself in me. Like see the real idealized version of yourself in me and I'm just happening to be the Martha Stewart of doing that and I'm fucking gonna jig your system better. But so the way it's been described to me is like, all you gotta do is remove I from what you just said. And now, so now like that moment when fucking Michael Jordan does the thing or the piano player does the thing or the, you see like the person you're in love with or the way they smile or you see suddenly by some like, either like, by some very, very, very good luck. You run into someone who's the combination of all those things and there's no I there. It's just part of what's happening. You run into that thing and then it's like when you're around that thing, you change. There isn't as though when you write, like the idea of a guru is really in the West. It's so tricky because it's degraded because like it's life coachy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me tell you what to do, kid. Here's what you do, kid. But it's like the way Neem Karoli Baba has been described to me and I felt him and I felt him through many of met him. It's just love, man. It's like you got around that being and it was just love. There wasn't a thing. It was just love and it was like so overwhelmingly powerful that you were forced to basically confront your own, your own lack of forgiving yourself. And more about you walking around Wi-Fi hubs, right? Like our brains work like microphones and antennas. That's kind of what it is with the vibrations that coming off of somebody. So I can completely see how if somebody can be like, no, we're on chill now. I've just turned your brain to the chill playlist on Spotify because that's what I'm kind of rocking all time. Yeah, yeah, that's it, that's it, that's it. There's a name for that. It's the same thing that it's, what is it? It's like, there's a name for that. God damn it. It's like something neurological mirroring or, you know, like women will get on the same cycles, you know? Yeah, because it's because we're kind of built to, because we're herd animals. There's something about how, because we work in groups and we work in families, shit like that to me makes a lot of sense because it feels good to be a member of a group. It feels really good to be in sync with somebody. We're supposed to be. Which is the reason why we then react the way we react when you see someone that fundamentally disagrees with and fundamentally presents a reality that it completely disagrees with your reality. And why you're immediately in sync is to be like, can I, or like, it makes me feel fear or anger or sadness because it's out of sync with me because I'm not gonna give it the time of day to like slide in emotion with this thing. But if somebody who does it all the time and then can teach you how to, which is making you a tent, which is like makes you a good host, makes you kind of think where you can just, you slide into the emotions and the feelings of somebody else and what would it be like to be around somebody like that? Who is really gonna love. I love that you say good host because isn't that one of the ways that God has described the Lord of Hosts? Yes, yes, the Lord of Hosts. And that's his fucking podcast. Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's like, God's got us. You guys hear Lance Armstrong with the Lord of Hosts this week? He's fucking sweet. He turned him into a fucking beaver. And he was like, now you live life as a beaver. And he's just, now you're Lance Armstrong again. Guess what Lance Armstrong doesn't exist. A million lives as a beaver, a trillion lives as a beaver. This is a three hour long podcast. Now, let's get down. Well, again, to cap this off. So it's cool. It's like what we're talking about is the way humans tend to harmonize with each other. And so theoretically, you know, I know for sure, when I'm around funny people, I get funnier. Absolutely. Yeah. And when I'm around healthy people, I get healthier. So theoretically, if there could be a person that was some kind of like conduit to the thing that you're talking about or the, the Taliard Chardonnay, I don't know, the Omega point or Terrence McKenna singularity or somebody who was just one of the opening portals of that thing. Then when you were around it, then it would affect you in that way. It would inspire you in that way. You would harmonize with it because this is what we've been doing for, for millions of thousands of years and hunting parties. And of course, when we would gather around as men on nights of the full moon and we dug the big trench and we begin to jerk off to make the compass. So the wolves could come. I named this wolf socks because it's got funny black markings on his feet. And he loves Jerry's cum. But they say the sound of the lapping of the cum wolves. They say with the sound, yeah, all together, they say that that sound would actually sound like a language. And they say that's where language came from. Whoa, yeah, dogs lapping up cum. It's been like, we should do something like this where maybe we can make some of the laps rhyme and then that can be hip-hop. What is that? Hip-hop, that's incredible. Now, okay, let's get into the real fucking interview question. Yeah, yeah, finally, yeah, answer me. Let's get this podcast started. So. We really dived in deep, really fast. But you obviously, I was ready though, because honestly, when it comes down to it, it's very difficult to talk like this all the time. Like I can't, I'm not on a lot of podcasts as a guest where I feel that kind of openness. I was, as I was preparing for the interview, I was watching some of your interviews and I was seeing like how like, because professionally, you have to represent the show. Some horseshit at any given respect. I'm sick of doing that though and I don't wanna do it anymore. Right, yeah, well, I mean, you know, it's like, I think there's a, I think you've done a fantastic job of like conveying who you are through these interviews and it was really exciting to see that and like, so I, anyway, thank you. I love, this is so, it's so wonderful to have this level of conversation with somebody, man. It's really cool. And your fucking podcast is so, so funny, man. Thank you, man. Thank you, thank you. It's like a thing where guys are hilarious. We have built this thing. I don't know where it came from. The people just kind of showed up. It's like, we've been doing this for almost eight years and the people just kind of showed up and every day you kind of wonder, you talk, we talk so much into microphones and we're conveying so much information. But it's also like, I feel overwhelmed like all the time. Like, mainly just because we are feel, we're, the audience is so big and they're so hungry and they're really positive and they're really great. We want to make sure that we're up to the standards of every week of every single show. I also though, but now it's like, my brain is filled with shit all day long of the most dark and sane stuff that exists. And also it's so much stuff. It's like, I read two books about Robert Hansen, the Alaskan serial killer in the last week. Now I'm reading shit about the next episode, which is that we're in the middle of, when is this release? This is going to come out next week. Awesome. So it'll be, I think it'll be maybe right before we do what we're doing, we're working on Rasputin right now. And so I'm like, Oh wait, look who it is. I saw the picture. I was like, it's fucking, it clicked with me immediately. He's got fucking Rasputin on his desk. Oh, cool man. I am deep into Rasputin. I fucking love this story. It's one of my, one of the most exciting stories I've read. I wish his life was told as a kung fu movie though. I have a whole long thing with it. What do you mean? He would have made a fucking, I want to make it. Can you give just like a quick synopsis of Rasputin for those out there who maybe aren't aware of who he is. Rasputin is the evil quote unquote evil monk that worked with the Romanovs. He basically became a part of the last bastion of the Russian czars. He was their medium and spiritual advisor. And then he was heinously executed. There was like a whole theory idea that he was shot and drowned. And he had a nine and a half inch dick and he fucked all the time and his eyes were super hypnotic. But his real story is so much closer to the rise of, he's like if Jim Jones and Dick Cheney and a spiritual warrior were all put into one. Where it's like his rise up is very, very interesting because I think that like most cult leaders, because they view him sort of as a tiny version of a cult leader where he was a, but he was free. He was trying to give people knowledge, but at some point it turned like it always does. Somebody who starts to like the smell of their own shit. So we'll go into a whole, we'll eventually do it on the podcast, but a part of it like that's what his thing is that he became to believe in the myth of himself. And then as he did that, it corrupted everything around him. Yeah, sure, Ziggy Stardust, right? Yes, he's like all of a sudden he is the evil, he is the mystic that he always pretended to be. And he's not, his body is writing checks that his spirit can't cash. Whoa, rad man. That's cool, you guys are covering it. Yeah, but I'm very excited. But yeah, that's, but every week, didn't have my brain so filled with stuff. And then two weeks from now, I got to flush all that and get the next stuff. So I feel like my brain, it's kind of like when they do competitive eating and then they drink three gallons of water or expand their stomachs so they can get like a hundred pound like roast beef and air or whatever. I feel like that's my brain, which is like a big fat blown out vagina. Wow, man. Yeah, you're that, cause you're constantly having to like absorb this stuff. And I, you know, I looked at many interviews with you, so I'm not going to ask the dumb, were you worried about your man in the darkness? Are you worried about the day? I see, it's weird though. Well, my therapist, right? So I started going to my therapist, like started talking about shit about, he's like, I went essentially, essentially because I go through bouts where like for like a month at a time, I cannot sleep. I have very, very intense insomnia. Like I'm in a pattern right now where I am not sleeping. Okay. I talked to my therapist. And of course, the first thing he said, it's like, so what do you read before you go to sleep? What kind of stuff you're getting into? And I'm just being like, well, it's literally every version of, every form of darkness and madness. He's like, well, maybe that's the problem. I was like, well, that's the thing that pays the bills. So that's my job. It's like, I can't really take a break from it. I just now switch it to the morning. I wake up and I immediately work. Well, this is why, now, so this kind of brings us back to chivism, which is, so what's really cool about it is, and there are these people who worship Shiva, I think they're called Agoras. And so these are the people, there's like the far side of the Ganges River. You know, the Ganges River in India, you gotta go to Varanasi sometime. What I was looking into it, me and my fiance are now doing shit where it's like we're trying to do a vacation a year and we're gonna build up to more expert level vacations. Varanasi, go to Varanasi because Varanasi, you go to Varanasi, it's similar to Six Flags in the sense that when you're walking around Six Flags, Bugs Bunny's here. You smell barbecue, no, you smell barbecue and cooking, you know, they're cooking hamburgers at Six Flags in Disney Land, you smell the barbecue, except the barbecue smell in Varanasi is the cremate, the bodies being burnt there because that's where all the bodies get burnt. But it smells delicious, smells like delicious pork meat just cooking. Smells like, yeah, exactly. I'm afraid to get those streams crossed. I like weird meat. Well, I mean, with the new shit that they're doing with Chris Bromacher, they're gonna be able to grow human flesh sand, that's a different podcast. But what's cool about it is that it's like, it's a culture where the death and the inevitable catastrophic end to everyone's life, the systemic shutdown of a person's body is not looked at in the same way it is here. And so I don't, one thing that I think people are afraid to say, even though it must be true, is that there's something really quite beautiful about catastrophe. Cause then it's like you've experienced it. As a person that deals with it, with having anxiety disorder and I catastrophize all the time, there is a comfort deep down in the idea of it's all falling apart. Yeah. I'm now at peace. Yeah. What does it matter? That. Now, see that, and that's the concept. So Sushiva, the idea is like, that's the part of the cycle where things disintegrate, you know? And so the idea is that we can't really stop, you can't stop the process of disintegration, but you can see God in everything. And even in the darkest of places, even in the darkest of darkest of darks, even in the darkest of places, you can still find within that, this inevitable signature of something so beautiful and so transcendent and so profound. And this is something that many people disagree with me and it's something that I disagree with in my lowest moments. But one of the things Neem Karoli Baba said that I love is everything's perfect. Deal with that, man! Yeah. What are you going to do with it? It's literally built exactly as it was supposed to be. Like this is what it is. But it's being comfortable with that, right? We're stuck in a, especially in this business, in my, I start immediately on the surface level of the fear of the slow down and the fear of death of my quote unquote career and all of this kind of work and all this kind of stuff is completely connected to my fear of, my natural human fear of death like people have and the idea of that eventual annihilation where, and you'd like to think and all this stuff, like, well, this is wrong and because of my fear of death, I want to do X, Y, Z. I need to have this. I need to have done this. I need to have made this much money. I need to worry about all these kind of things where we've kind of imagined this world of difficulties but actually it's as exactly as it was supposed to be. If we stop putting all the weight on the, this concept of all of these obstacles and shit and all these things that I view that are difficult are things that are out of sync in life and things that are artificially there but actually, no, no, no, no, no, it's all, that's exactly as planned. Every single, all of this stuff, it's like that's exactly how it was supposed to be. It's just like this. But it's fearful, it's hard to sit in it because then it means there's nothing more. So it's like, as a person that's a full Western capitalist who starts to feel it in your asshole, your asshole starts clenching, thinking to me like, this is really it. I feel it going, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, tightening and tightening because I'm like, oh man, that means there's nothing else. It's like, I want to, at some point, I'm always expecting some wizard to show up and be like, you've got to find the Gauntlet of Xanthior because it's a thing that I'll go on some quest and it's outside of my existence. Why do you think the Gauntlet of Xanthior quest isn't going to happen? I don't know. I can still app it, the Gauntlet of Xanthior quest is coming, I promise you that. I promise you that. Thank you, thank you. You will come today. Oh, but the drink from the Gauntlet of Xanthior. That's all I want, and then I'll be perfect. It's filled with cums. Oh no, oh. So, yeah, so you're, you know, the way it gets taught to me is like, there's the mind and that's everything that. That exists, sort of. That's everything that just came out of you. That's the mind, it's the mind, and then there's the heart. And like when you go from, and they're both happening at the same time, but the mind space is like, that's where the insomnia happens. That's where the infinite endless complexities and the questioning and the, it's this like, and especially someone as smart as you, your mind's always like. So it's like, you've got this super active mind, and then there's the heart. And so the concept is, this mind is beautiful and wonderful and perfect. It's wonderful, it's great. But also, there's this, sometimes I have these dreams. The more I practice. And in these dreams, I find secret rooms in this house. It's like, and where it's like, holy fucking shit, man. Holy shit, yeah, there's a whole other room. There's a whole floor here. Yeah, that's the heart. And so it's sort of this like, the practice is one of like, can I move from my mind space into my heart space? So scary. Yeah. It's a scary jump. I have been really bumping against that wall like recently, even in my own life, like talking about the, I love when I accidentally experience gnosis in my day-to-day life. When there was for the second time, essentially like I kind of have like PTSD about my time doing magic because I touched real gnosis. I got inflated by it and everything went to shit. And then I was really afraid to figure out like how to go back into it again. Gnosis is in the very center of me where I start to feel that peace that I felt in the casual moments of gnosis that I had before and the moments when I look at my fiance and I feel love. When I look at my fucking, my dog has become the most vulnerable spot in my whole fucking life. I look at this dog, dog is becoming a radiating being of pure love. I look at this thing, but then I wanna smash it down, not kill the dog, but I wanna smash it down just thinking about like afraid of opening up the doors to where the gnosis lives, which is in the heart. I talk about this imagery in my head where I feel like my heart is being held hostage by my dictator like brain. My brain is like Kim Jong-un and my heart's like his tender sweet girlfriend that's forced into another room that is all bound up at the hands of Kim Jong-un. He comes in and her hands are tied behind her back so he can feel all over her body. But the problem is that is what my brain's doing. You gotta spank your heart, baby. But I have to let my heart free so that we could just be married. But I don't know how to do the two because it feels like that jungle of emotion, which is something that is so important and it's like this war that happens, which I think is like, I don't think I'm unique. I think that that's kind of common, especially people who have to use their brains for a living and people who kind of do that kind of shit where it's like that feeling of peace becomes the enemy. And I don't know why that is. I don't know why the idea of rest and the idea of something that what you're saying, as is moment, the thing that this is it, this is a peaceful, we are whole, we are as it's supposed to be, which is because I love those feelings of accidental gnosis. You know where I get it? I'm the fucking stair machine. It's like active trangets seems to work for me. I started like doing something physical, all of a sudden I'm in another place and I'm seeing a crystal palace. I'm seeing like what I used to build in my own mind and I'm seeing it accidentally. And I was like, oh, but why am I so afraid of letting this happen? Yeah, yeah, man, that's a great question. It's just, and one other thing I love they teach me is there's just really no rush. Oh yeah, I know. Yeah, you're fucking, oh, I'm so infuriating. Of course. It's infuriating, cause yeah, they're just like, oh no, no, no. It's like, it really is, there's zero rush. And so the idea is it's just like, and you get to, there's, you get to be, in fact, I was reading this beautiful. If I start crying spontaneously. I was about to cry when you're talking about your dog, but when they were talking about the, in this book, The Wisdom of No Escape by Pima Chodron, she says, well, the idea that we meditate so that we can change ourselves is actually an aggression against ourselves. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's to say that this thing that I am right now is not good enough. Yes. And so I'm gonna do this thing to make myself better, when really the reason we do it is so that we can be who we are fully. And that's the concept, you know? Cause this thing that we are is perfect and it's beautiful. And this, God, how sad would it be if suddenly this, this psychonic brilliance of yours suddenly went away? That would, I would be, that would be disastrous, you know? The brain should use the head like a bed. It's like the brain should use the body, the heart, like a place where it should sleep on. Like that's like a thing I start thinking about, like maybe like, cause then I'll use imagery and stuff like that to maybe help me gain understanding of what it is. And that's how, that's what the living together is. Yeah. Is that the head, the heart is then the bedrock. The heart is technically the secure place, even though it feels like the scary place and that the brain is supposed to sleep on it and pure protection, they become one. But the problem is you have to allow yourself to just do it and maybe me having nine to 12 iced coffees a day is like hurting it. Caffeine is a motherfucker, man. I think that maybe it's too, maybe that's what it is. Well, it's just, you know, there's a, who knows? Like, like the game of it is just like, in the mindfulness practice is one of just like, oh, just let the, all you add to it is just, you just start watching. That's all. So it's sort of like, oh, I'm anxious right now. Oh, I'm like, you know, for me, like I've got a bunch of different fucking repeating patterns in my head, right? And so I'll just watch those patterns. It's like fear of death, fear of like not being funny, fear of being too fucking didactic, or so you know, like, whatever the fuck it is, you know, or all my, oh, I'm getting old. I'm getting, my hair is falling out or all, but the only thing that you add to it is just you start watching it. So when you're doing the like, oh, I'm getting old thing, you're just watching it. Yes. And you have like a peaceful gap. Yeah. Between you and the full on experiencing of the fear of I'm getting older. And then the next question would become, who's watching it? Oh God. Yeah, God. Oh no. You said it, I got you. I got you. I got you. Victory. Victory. I did it, son. You were right, Jesus. You were right. Good work, my son. You are a brilliant man.

Hello dear friends, it is I D Trussell and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell family hour podcast. And if you happen to be one of the very few Americans or earthlings who didn't have a great holiday season and that does put you in the minority based on a recent study by the American Patriot Guild, 99.9% of all Americans had a joyful holiday season this year. They sat with their families and expressed love for each other. They sang Christmas carols together. They opened beautiful, thoughtful presents and spent a long time with each gift, looking down at the gift, looking up at the gift giver, looking the gift giver in the eyes, smiling, bowing, thanking, expressing gratitude and love and always saying this present is wonderful but you mean so much more to me. For 99.9% of American families spent the last few days in a state of pure, blissful, nirvanic love. Joy rang through the hills. Feelings of such sweet lightness filled every single American except maybe you if you didn't have a great holiday season with such buoyant and magical love that many people achieved the state known as Samadhi. They actually transcended their physical bodies and merged with the cosmos filling the entire universe up with their radiant love blasting out of their heart chakras like nuclear energy flying out of the Fukushima reactors after that Japanese earthquake. I'm sorry I'm being sarcastic. Look a lot of us had shitty holidays you know I'm I had an okay holiday I spent it by myself and as inviting as that might sound to some of you who feel like you just spent a weekend hanging out in a putrifying elephant carcass with a family of hyenas it actually you know you're still you can't really escape the holidays no matter no matter what you do whether you're with a family or not with a family whether you're with a group of people or by yourself there's this feeling of being like a foie gras goose with getting festivity jammed down your throat by some kind of decentralized dark energetic system parading as the opposite of what it actually is. So there's a real weird weirdness that comes over a lot of us during the holidays and you might be one of them I don't know maybe you're a new parent you actually enjoyed it so forgive me I don't want to sound jaded I don't feel jaded I just don't like holidays I don't like enforced celebration like I I like when celebration kind of happens naturally where you're walking down the street on some random day and you see some beautiful flower and you think wow man what an incredible flower that is and your heart lifts up and and you realize whoa what a great life this is but it kind of happens random I don't like the enforced holidays but that's probably more of an indication of my own blocks you know regardless if you had a bumpy holiday season I know a lot of you did this episode is going to be a real palate cleanser for you this this is my favorite way for podcasts to happen which is just the universe sort of gives them to you it just they appear in front of you like an angel and that's exactly what happened I'm hanging out at my friend Doug's house and he texted me and said that his friend was in town with a musician named loraji who at the time I had not heard of so I looked him up and started listening to his music and he's incredible he was discovered by Brian Eno in a park and so I told Doug yeah let's set this thing up and then within a day I'm sitting across from loraji who emanates a very similar kind of energy that comes from ramdas or comes from anybody who's got a spiritual practice it's an enlightening energy as in it lightens everything up not just internally not just like you get around these people and internally you feel more buoyant but literally like colors around them get brighter and the world seems filled with more possibilities and we are reminded of something CS Lewis said which is the gates of hell are locked from the inside meaning you don't necessarily have to be broiling in that cauldron of succubus diarrhea you can climb out anytime you want dry yourself off and walk into the Garden of Eden we got a great episode for you today friends we're going to jump right into it but first some quick business this episode of the DTFH

today's magical guest has collaborated with brian eno he's produced over 55 albums of beautiful mystical life transforming ambient music and he seems to have entered into this dimension from some realm of sacred healing music everybody please welcome the angel currently calling himself loraji welcome welcome loraji hello dunkin welcome thank you so much this is a miracle that you're here it's a la trip for me to be here to last minute and here i am on a podcast interview fantastic it's wild and i'll tell you it's the strangest thing because i think it's a miracle of miracles because i've just recently gotten addicted to modular synthesizers what i just showed you and you for your entire life have been producing some of the most incredible ambient spiritual channeled music i've ever heard so the fact that you just randomly are sitting in front of me is a little miraculous to me well i will be sitting in front of somebody right now and why not you brian eno to found you in a park yes he did and uh washington square park around 1979 78 79 at playing electric zither through a small amp sitting in an cross leg position with my eyes closed the northeast corner central of washington square park that was my favorite performance area why why that corner because there was a cobblestone circle about maybe 15 feet in diameter with a tree in the center and benches circle benches on the peripheral of the circle where people could sit and so i would set situate myself in the center of the circle cross leg position my back against the tree and radiate music there and people would come and sit down and bliss out or bliss in i saw pictures of it and it it does look like people are it's it looks it reminds me of pictures i've seen a probapod standing harry christian in the park where the energy just drew people to him and people were meditating around you in the picture that i saw wow just vibing out with you uh yes uh that's it i've never saw a picture like that well most times my eyes were closed in fact they were closed the night that brian left me a note to contact him which started our collaboration on the ambient day of radiance you were so in a trance when you were making music in the park or whatever i made it meditative state yes that you didn't notice that brian eno had been watching you for a while probably before he dropped that note no i don't notice uh i'm aware that people are present when i take a break i'll just make eye contact with people but generally my eyes were closed and head bowed and and i'm tuned in to and a unified field a cosmically pervasive field and that was experimental too just to see what would happen if i could drop in to trance and operate a musical instrument you know and i learned the performance style of such you your nervous system functions differently you're in trance and so the music is like a uh the electrodes on your body that it records or registers where you are and so the type of music that would evolve out of that kind of performance state was what some people call ambient sometimes i just call it field music or vertical sound presence do you consider it a form of channeling i used to say channeling then the period i shied away from it because i didn't think people were getting my idea of channeling as if you're bringing something from another dimension i believe that uh channeling i use the word running running energy you're running you're running energy and you can use word channeling but channeling might to some people sound like you're going outside of yourself and coming from a foreign place yes i say running energy you're running what's already where you are you just might shift your awareness to realize that instead of just local new york manhattan energy you can shift your awareness be aware that you're also in a cosmos you can channel you can run cosmic energy i mean you're aware of a cosmic field cosmic time cosmic space and running the energy means giving it attention and letting it find expression through your conscious behavior what is cosmic time versus earth time cosmic time you could call it no time or nonlinear time or the eternal present moment cosmic time is the eternal present moment i would feel that anybody who's dropped into transfer dropped into some good herb notices that the uh what they thought were hard fast boundaries of time linear time just they're not there you see the clock on the wall you see the calendar on the wall but your head and your your awareness is buzzing beyond it all you're in a like a suspended suspended time flow and constant present time this for me is cosmic time that uh everywhere is now now is the uh all-pervading cosmic time linear time is suggested uh mind or reasoning or thinking mind suggests that yesterday i did this tomorrow i'll do that and the line between the two is the the progression of linear time you can call it earth time perhaps if you're on mars or jupiter that kind of experience might flow differently but beyond or in the midst or before it all is this unified field is omnipresent nowness and i call this the universal universal present time whether you choose to call it cosmos or call it the pure i am or just call it now i see be here now on your uh computer yes and that was baba ram das's uh famous book and being here now the now is the cosmic time and if you suspend your thinking mind that uh no thought no linear thought you're automatically in present time uh awareness yes do you how often do you stay in that place do you find yourself coming in and out of that or i do it's my dominant this is my dominant place i come in and out of it in order to get the subway across the street in new york yes but i'm in it most constantly but i take time to go into central park and grab a nice space and do some conscious tai chi chuan which is called running cosmic energy or running chi and tai chi or backstage before performance i'll tune in to expand my sense of the deeper deeper timelessness what what method do you use to tune in uh several one is breathing uh they might do seven 20 rounds of deep breathing and connected breath i might do uh drop my center of awareness down from my head in through my heart into the tanti and just below the navel uh another practice is i'll do some hatha yoga backstage just to um move energy and open the breath another is the mind science called where you just issue suggestions to yourself you know i am not the body i am in other words to drop out of this over tight identification with your names titles and classifications as a matter of fact that was a primary one when i started having good success with meditation because i'd sit in an easy chair do some breathing and then take off all the titles that are being used or have ever been used for me all of them i'm not a husband i'm not a son i'm not a grandfather i'm not an american i'm not a negro and just sit with what's left after all the titles i'll relax and i discovered that anger um jealousy a worry all of those yummy things don't belong to me they belong to the titles wow cool and when i got that awareness i could sit in that easy chair for five hours and without any anxiety about rushing to do anything or contact anyone or to forgive anybody or to fear anything because i was beyond the personal linear identity and i knew i was having success with meditation i grew up in the baptist church and read the bible but not the bible bible didn't make clarity sense to me until i was having these deep meditative experiences and i could sense that the bible can be read spiritually that you must that i feel you must have a expanded sense of yourself as being spirit that you read from a spiritual sense of self rather than a physical carnal sense of self and so uh when i was having the deep meditative experience uh i started attracting other experiences like hearing cosmic music and i didn't call it cosmic music i just knew it's whatever that was i wanted to do that and i realized that i couldn't do it because as i went to do research it's music that has no ending or beginning it's called the soundless sound yeah it's all pervasive and one teacher suggested to me that we don't hear this sound with our ears eardrums and we we discern it through our cerebral cortex as a vibration as a pulsation and we translate it into music because that's the language we use to say oh i'm hearing music but the music i heard or didn't hear i'll explain what i'm saying there that it was all pervasive and it activated say dormant cosmic understanding that everything is going on now everything is simultaneous and eternity is now and at doing that experience uh i think i came close to tears because it was such a deep ecstatic blissful beautiful sense of homecoming it's like you know if you've ever been taken by your parents to visit grand folks you've never seen before and you just feel a kinder connection and your heart breaks open i felt like i was just pulled into this awareness of the whole universe in a reunion an infinite family reunion wow yes and it must last at about 10 minutes now i talk about it as though it happened and i catch myself and recall that the teaching in this is that there is no past tense so it didn't happen it is happening and when i come to a place of meditative alignment i i rejoin that stream of of uh feeling and experience but even now i tap into the memory to uh it it it it pushes me it it compels me to reach for the kind of music i reach for on this side of the veil do you you know you hear and obviously you shouldn't take it necessarily literally but you hear things about i think it's a really quite beautiful how the angels sing to the creator and um sometimes i wonder if that is actually people trying to describe that sound that you're describing which is we're listening to the infinite sort of awe yes of sentience as it becomes increasingly aware of the profound beauty of the creator oh yes um each individual might have that experience in the way they can best uh understand it in my case of course i've been through uh the College of Fine Arts Music School at Howard University and had a classical background so this music that i'm talking about i experience it as a classical brass orchestra okay weaving this most glorious textual harmonic feel wow and someone else might hear it as ocean surf or conch shells or a choir of angels or crickets or a buzzing of bees there are basically 10 different ways that an individual can have this experience and i would say that your nervous system is vibrating in an altered way whether you call it cundalini is rising up through your your spine your nervous system and causing you to function as a different kind of filter or non-filter for information filter yeah not a filter versus antenna i don't know if there's a difference antenna may call calling bringing uh uh information antenna well antenna is a useful word you become an antenna uh at the same time thinking that the you we're talking about there's a you that's infinite and eternal then there's a you that's a little human beanie so if you think you're a human beanie then you think of this is all coming out from outside of you but if you know that the pure i am you is the stars and the planets and the galaxies are all unfolding inside of you i got you yeah that's beautiful oh that's so funny because that's the eternal one of the eternal psychedelic conversations is is this inside me man like when you try dmt or have like a profound mushroom trip you think am i seeing something real or is it inside me and what you just said answers the question it's both it depends on where your head's at and that question is it real well if it isn't real or is real probably doesn't matter anymore if you've taken the experience and done something with it and use it to inspire your art your your words your lifestyle suddenly you're off and you just like is jesus real and it doesn't matter if just being exposed to the concept of the idea of a character like that has propelled you to explore deeper into your connection with the supreme being suddenly you know it doesn't matter if that was real or not real it you're making it real for yourself do you think we live that this is heaven where we're at right now i can think that i can choose to think that i can choose to forget that then heavenly alignment uh if you're awareness my awareness is in heavenly alignment my emotional nervous system is in heavenly alignment that's alignment with the infinite the cosmos then heaven on earth means i'm bringing timelessness here i'm not just walking on earth i'm walking on a cosmic field and i've transformed this local isolated personal experience into a universal all-pervasive experience yes so we call it holographic i'm i'm here but all of timelessness is here all of my uh all of my relatives are here this is i'm carrying the wholeness to walk on heaven on earth is to walk each moment i am in the moment of now and each moment i'm touching the fullness of the field can you talk to a little bit about the sun the sun yeah well my my early suspicions is that the earth is encrusted sun that we are cooled down the sun the sun is a brilliant being a model of selfless service and my suspicions are that the sun is conscious and can respond to an individual's praise of the sun and acknowledgement of the sun cool yes how do you praise the sun well you can not look directly at the sun you can in the morning or bow toward the sun or when you see sunlight just stop for a moment stop being in linear time and just notice oh sunlight just feel it and own it be thankful for it uh do you know how long it takes for a photon to get out of the sun have you ever heard this before if it's stuck in new york traffic a while but supposedly that's amazing because when we see the sun it's not where we see it it's in other words the amount of time it takes to travel here right but still that's a long ways away yes and just think if that implies how far away the sun is and yet we on this planetary orb travel around the sun yeah that is we'll be traveling yeah yeah where we were when i came into your studio this morning we're probably maybe millions of miles or thousands of miles away from where we'll be when we finish this podcast yeah wow that's and that's an important thing to remember it's so easy to forget that and and the photons i have just read this and you might find it interesting every photon every particle of light that's hitting us apparently it comes out of the mantle of the sun and it takes millions of years for it to be born out of the sun it has to push its way out of the mantle and then it so in our in our eyes are eating photons basically like a photon lands in our eyes and gets converted into chemical energy and that's it for the photon so our eyes are just gobbling up these little sentient beings that took millions of years to get born out of the sun which is to me that is something that seems really quite beautiful because our eyes are sort of like black holes for these little little light minnows that are yeah yes there are that's that's fresh new insight for the sun i do know that if you close your eyes don't do this with open eyes close your eyes and look up directly into the sun with eyes closed and if you can create a strobous stroboscopic effect with two your hands kind of washing against each other yeah that i've done this and notice wonderful images geometric forms sometimes a suggestion of another parallel dimensional life situation going on do you think do you think that's that there is a a potentially another universe simultaneously overlaying this universe that is populated with entities that we can't see in this dimension i have no reason to doubt it and i would believe that the sun emitting or certain frequency of sunlight hitting us could trigger dormant hormonal activities that if activated could allow us to break through into another dimension of realization but i accept that there are parallel dimensions intersecting or permeating where we are now and we could drop into them and drop out of them i guess sleep is they say sleep is a heavy-duty drug yes sleep the body is a drug too here but you can shift your awareness of what's going on now so you go to sleep have a dream and suddenly you're on a boat on a yacht and you're drinking your favorite root beer and a shark comes up and says make my my little my little sweetie pie the classic you wake up really quick you went to wow but the idea of simultaneous parallel universes i have no reason to doubt it but once again whatever i think there is ultimately it's all going on inside the bigger me the pure i am right and i think that's one way to cure stress paranoia and fear is to have a practice of diving into and re-identifying with the universal i am to take the edge off the fears that we are subject to if we just think of ourselves as a limited individual mortal subject to the with the flings and arrows of life misfortune a beanie yes i am really interested in your spiritual history because it seems like you have had some pretty intense teachings and from what i've read online coming from gurus do you currently have a guru a guru means the speller of light a speller of darkness and bringer of light and i'd say that i suspect that i have what you call it anonymous gurus right and mentors that have worked through my dream states and have worked through seemingly homeless people mumbling something while i'm walking by them on the street yes yeah dropping deep into shamanic trance and having realizations i mean one of the most beautiful i think guru hit was doing ayahuasca at one session and having this experience of being in an extraterrestrial museum and looking at this jewelry of this glistening exquisite geometric jewelry and it was so beautiful and at the time i could make the connection that staring at beauty and drinking in beauty opened my heart and that beauty contemplating beauty is a way to open the heart and the way to get love energy flowing to run love energy yeah yeah yeah sure so that gurus there was no physical person there doing that to me and then i've had the pleasure of being in the presence of people that were called gurus yes and i'd be in the presence of people who were calling that person their guru but i resisted calling anybody outside my physical self my guru i may say my mentor or a teacher or a model and the person that came close to being called a guru would say i'm not your guru says drop into deep trance and go within and once you know your inner guru you'll see the reflections on and those out there who are reflecting your inner guru to you when i'm i did a years ago the first time i met baba ramdas because he does these skype calls and i couldn't believe that he would do these skype calls and i signed up for one and there he was on my screen and i was just so shocked and what i when i said to him was uh are you my guru any response he gets his you know ramdas he gets his beaming smile on his face and he goes sure i'm your guru now what well some people need to say you're my guru in order to help pull them out of being overexposed to maybe dark heavy energies in their life right and they need somebody to model the the the the positive upward direction yes yes now but but you in many in many interviews you when you talk about yourself it's obviously correct me if i'm wrong here it sounds as though you're implying that you chose this incarnation or that this is uh you you decided to manifest is this being that you are right now i have a feeling that there was some intention and some design for my being here in this earth experience at this time at times like a glimpses of the fact that my being drawn to music is a carryover from previous or another preparation life stage somewhere i was once told by my mentor who refused to say that he was my guru say that i'm from jupiter in a guru planet and i didn't know what to make of that at the time but he just smile he says you're from jupiter wow and and now we have these beautiful images of jupiter have you seen them my god they're just amazing like we have these it's in such a living incredible planet it's just you know well you know as you we're talking now i'm getting a realization that my uh the music hearing experience i talked about may have been uh the planetary sending me waves of reminder because it woke me up to a music form that was much bigger than i'd ever experienced before and it it informs the kind of music i reach for now which is more vertical music or music to lift consciousness out of over identification with limited life yeah i want to talk about how you create your music because i as i'm listening to it it and how and loving it and experiencing it i keep thinking to myself how much of it is composed beforehand and how much of it is just flowing out of you in that moment and to to add to that question when you what was the process when you were recording with brian eno in studio with your electric zither how organized was the process well i'll tell you i did go through a period of intense organization just in college and i was composing that was my one of my dreams to become a composer and i would sit at this large manuscript and write out music near to the piano and hum it and then i would send them off to the library congress to be copyrighted so i went through a period of composition intentional notes chords here and there and not much ever happened to that music but when i started running energy through sound or channeling music uh that music got recorded and got distributed and uh heard by more people that music is comes out of my compositional skills or transformed into not composing notes but composing tunings for the zither 36 string zither so composing modes or scales that have a atmospherical uh energy and emotional uh suggestion were you when you're tuning a 36 string zither how i i read i read that in an interview i was just how are you doing that or do you have did you have something like tuning forks to help at that time there were not guitar tuners how was i tuning i think i was tuning it maybe there was pitch pipes uh but i would of the 36 strings typically i would be going for a chord either pentatonic would be a five note chord which means that of 36 strings those 36 strings have to be tuned in such a ways that many of the strings are doubled and tripled so that no strings are outside of that five note chord sometimes i would tune just a heart feeling i would just pluck a note on the zither and then feel where the next note would be and it would be feeling heartways and if i was which wasn't the case most times be in meditative resonance the kind of tuning that i would accept as a final um composition would would have juice to it it would suggest maybe mountain valleys or intergalactic star systems or it would be kind that would allow me to express a sense of simultaneous cultures either around the planet around the universe that are dancing and celebrating so the kind of images that i would look for in my tunings would be those that were in harmony with an unspoken consciousness of that you know it gets vibrated through meditation you get a higher sense or a meditative understanding and so the kind of tunings that i would compose would have a story in them and then i would then improvise through those tunings to release the story and energy so that way of composing is less rigid you you you select the terrain or the medium which is a harmonic field and then you go into it and let it show you where you can go with it yeah so that's like day of radiance i think there were two or three different harmonic fields that i tuned the instrument to on ambient number three day of radiance and just in the studio do some breath work and tune in to remind myself of the self beyond the limited self and when i catch that wind then inspiration just flows yes you don't have to know what note you're going to play you're about sculpting the field interacting with this subtle all-pervading presence yes sculpting the field it is like clay or something absolutely man why is it like clay well it's there to be done you do what you want with it you can play with it you can wash your hand through it you can call it chi and infinite and do exercise through it you can hug your sweetie pie in the midst of it you can you can do so much with it yeah it's up to you and if you charge it with positive thinking with positive images then you go higher and higher and deeper but if you charge it most times accidentally with negative thoughts negative feelings and moods and thought forms you might take it to denser heavier so you can take this field and do what you want with it some call it the pure mind that you can it can be your imprisonment or it can be your key it can be your lock or it can be the key you can liberate you into higher realms of personal and planetary existence or it can keep you locked up into density and confusion yes and and i want to ask you what do you think your music is light and it's beautiful and it's it's it's liberate it's wonderful but and i now i can see why but what do you think about musicians who create beautiful dark music music that is it's like they didn't tune into people celebrating they tuned into some hell realm and some part of the universe and have decided to bring that vibration into this dimension that could be their calling and they can see the beauty in that and or they see the necessity in that or it allows them to feel grounded or feel useful or they're relating to the language that gives them a validation and so i it not even a tendency to want to judge them negatively but uh say that i've chosen not to listen to if a music feels dark for me or it doesn't represent the meditative resonance in which i'm presently vibing then i can choose to not listen right and if i am radiating light in joy and somebody else says i'm not ready to be there i still need some more anguish and and uh dark feelings to identify with yeah and so we're both in the same universe and we're choosing to use the universal energy in the way that we think we need to do it gotcha now you could you tell the story about the time when you went to pawn your guitar and bought the zither that we were just talking about yes there's a long version at that time i was living in queens new york married at the time and uh queens was near streach and moys meditation community and since i lived that close i would walk maybe a half an hour and visit the meditations at the time and he was a music guru streach and moys i don't know if you know of him i know i don't but anyhow he he had written many books on the power of music and so i had gone to one of his meditations went through the back i'm so sorry do you mind pausing for one second so i can take care of the poodle otherwise it's going to be distracting please continue sorry about my poodle okay now we were talking about light and dark music we're talking about the what i think was one of the it seems like one of you've had a few miracles in your life oh yes and one of the guitar and but before that you were mentioning this guru a music guru music guru streach and moys and i remember going to one of his meditations and i walked into the house and the room was full of meditators and he was sitting up in front in this trance and i could just feel this etheric glow around his presence and i could feel that the people there were there to get energy or just to be present and something clicked to me i says i could come here to get something from this being or i could send this being love and light you know why do i think that if you sit in the presence of a guru you just have to receive why don't i dare to believe that i can offer this person something so i just sent waves of love and appreciation and sort of this open blanche card whatever you need from me you can have right yeah and i just dared to love the guru back you know and shortly after then another part of that i remember playing fender rose piano in a jazz rock band and at required loading this heavy cabinet and keyboard onto a van whenever the group played it was the group called winds of change okay and on one occasion i was traveling by train during that period subway train and looking over at somebody who had this neat little small case and i said to myself this uncle wouldn't it be wonderful if there was a lightweight portable piano something that small and uh so that's number two secondly i had this epiphany the sound hearing experience during that period of uh meditation hearing this cosmic orchestra now all those three together at some point while playing a guitar i felt like i didn't need the guitar at that moment because i'm playing piano so i wanted to pawn the guitar to get some extra cash there in south ozone park queens so i went into the the pawn shop and what caught my eye as i was going in was this instrument the auto harp loosely called the zither that i had seen in the village Greenwich village of new york when i was doing stand-up comedy bluegrass bands would include an auto harp and it would catch my eye and i said that's an interesting looking instrument that seemed like it has a bigger future fast forward back to this pawn shop i'm going into the pawn shop and i'm pawning my guitar my uh yamaha six still string guitar did you feel depressed pawning your guitars and that a depressing moment for musicians at that time i was into meditation you know meditation takes the edge off yeah so depression doesn't really get a hold of me after that happened after after getting into meditation the right way and yoga yoga helps to keeping your body uh together so anyhow i did feel like i was living the life of the struggling musician but it wasn't attended by a sense of depression thanks for asking that because uh but anyhow well i just asked because you know sometimes when i when i've been in pawn shops i feel a little afraid to buy the instruments because i think these instruments all might have energies that they represent some potentially somebody you wanted to become a musician and didn't you know had to get some dough and gave up their dream for some cash and there's this feeling of like shit man that's heavy to get these instruments i'm glad you brought that up that's a wonderful dunk in a preface to what i'm about to say is that when i was pointing guitar i expect to come out with maybe a hundred and fifty dollars but the clerk only offered offered me twenty five dollars and right after that clerk made that statement i said oh that doesn't sound like where i want to go a very clear distinctive voice washed through me as if a great cosmic grand panel and all the warmth and love and advice counseling said don't take money swap your guitar for that instrument in the window and they knew i was that the auto harp so with the loving energy of that voice sort of nullified any negative energy that thought that instrument could have had it was suddenly i'm curious to see where this can go and how did that voice get inside my head but then like i said there was treachery there was my putting it out to the cosmos and looking for a new instrument there was this hearing this cosmic music and not knowing how i was going to use that experience on this side of the veil and suddenly i'm being guided to explore this auto harp so i took it home i got five dollars along with the deal i made a little deal nice yes so i was still out of money but i had this instrument and i was excited because i was now running the energy of this cosmic guidance that's a that's another thing about following cosmic guidance is that the moment i choose to follow guidance i'm in a different frequency of the universe that's right that is so miraculous and uh yeah what let's talk about that just for a second this different frequency of the universe it it it it can literally seem as though you just stepped through a portal into a completely different dimension you're no longer in the life you were in anymore right the moment you make that choice yes you you you're validating the the idea that there's a consciousness and intelligence working through you by means of you individualizing as you right here and right now and when you have that expanded realization you're walking in a different all of a sudden it's a different world you shed your skin it's you've you've you've climbed out of whatever the nest was that you that you that i guess some invisible mother bird was trying to push you out of yes and now you're like whoa wait a minute i can i think i'm flying here this is and during that time Duncan that's when you uh start to appreciate kindred folks the right community friends who are if they're real friends they can allow you to expand they can allow you to grow they can allow you to shed your skin and in the midst of your relationship there's still that love and caring even though you're you're in another dimension like your cat your dogs if you were to shift vibrations tremendously and go back to your poodles in another 20 minutes they would still probably lick your hand and they don't care the poodles don't care if i'm jesus or if i'm a stockbroker they don't care they're right that's a true friend that's a true friend because some friends who aren't really friends when you start making the upshift they'll make it you could call them on their position right they feel unstable in their own life into where are you going that's too far out i can't follow you there that's right and others says it can be validated then they're searching for some kind of relief and they said hey i never thought of just jumping out of this frequency into another one and uh of course jumping out it might not be the right way to put it you want to uh flow out of it or gracefully there's all kinds of ways you can come out of it you know ramdas talks about this a little bit some people uh what happens is they they jump out of it and and they go really far into a higher frequency in there maybe they weren't quite ready for it or there was a you know forget the friends who are like what's going on with you space cowboy where are you at forget those friends think about the part of the ego identity that the moment you're standing in a music shop hearing the voice of the universe telling you hey here's a way for you to move into a completely new incarnation while you're still alive there's a part of you maybe not you but there's a part of me that you're like uh oh one toke over the line baby here we go i knew i shouldn't have been taken that i took one too many hits of acid i'm losing it i'm hearing a voice telling me to buy a zither i must be spot i'm going to be in a fucking lunatic asylum soon that part of the identity we have those little shitty friends living inside of us who are like no stay here stay like this yes stay where it's safe stay where you're recognizable stay where it's convenient stay where it's boring boring we're so boring did you did you have any sense as when you're hearing this voice that maybe it what no one thing i also um i took it as it was part of my practice at that time it's called new thought new thought religion was one of the things i was dabbling in and the suggestion is to try something new on a daily basis if you're if you go home from work a certain way try a new way if you walk to the library a certain path try another path yeah put your clothes on a certain way try another way in other words constantly break out of patterns this is called new thought new thought religion if you can think of new thought you can change your life wow and so here was a new powerful new thought me play the auto and i said wow how challenging how but most of all me follow this voice i want to see where this would go and uh because that to me was like robert frost's poem the road not taken yeah this is a path i would not take with my rational thinking mind okay but let me blow your mind first not blow your mind but let me that poem do you know that poem is one of the most missed that poem actually because everyone thinks this means the road not taken means you you picked a road not taken but if you look at that poem both of the roads looked exactly the same and it's in retrospect that the character in the poem is thinking i took the road less traveled by but both of them were exactly the same but in the his mind he picked the road but it's a sort of the i guess what it implies is it's more of the subjective decision that elevates rather than you could have picked either of these paths but your mind would it is the thing that produces the sense of like oh it actually sounds a little dismal as i'm describing it that way but the point is you this news i want to talk about this very quickly this new thought that you're talking about coincides with an idea i've been having about the incarnational cycles which is that we live this life over and over and over and over again we don't reincarnate necessarily as birds or buffalo or eg or whatever we we this life is on loop and the feeling of habit is the feeling of the tracks that we've created in all these past incarnational cycles so by doing new things each day you're sort of pushing yourself out of this deep track that you've burrowed into the time space continuum and that thing you're talking about buying the zither it that in that sense of oh this is a new universe it's because it it is you're cycling up spiraling up it's sort of cycling yeah samsara another way of birth and death or just keeping a cycle up what do you call it a locked cycle yes and to lift up out of it choosing new things choosing new ways or hearing you can you can hear sound that can unlock memory of a higher destination a higher form of selfness they would you call it spiritual music or you call it not them inner sound current which can unlock your memory that you are a cosmos that you are not limited just this incarnation you can you have a body you can use a body but you're not limited to the body but we're picking this body it's attachment isn't it it's like this I would say is we've done something to to allow this particular incarnation to be ours but I can see why you would pick your incarnation why wouldn't you like if I was the universal consciousness I would want to be you that's a fun incarnation to pick I you know you're you're do you ever this thing you're talking about we must let go of the titles but then not just the titles we let go of the everything and we let go of everything no in the context that we can let go of it in the 10 minutes before dropping into meditation when we come out of the meditation we we want to go forward I would say back forward into our worldly obligations responsibilities even you go back to your husband and you says I'm not a wife he says what do you mean lady but you carry the resonance of behind the wife behind the husband behind the civil engineer there's this undesignated pure I am but let's talk about something crazy you know the story of the Rasulila Krishna playing the flute and the goat yeah and so like the story of the Rasulila if you're not familiar very quickly Krishna goes into a clearing in the forest and plays the flute yeah at night and the music washes and through the forest and the gopy the cowherd women hear the flute yeah the music of God yes and they leave their children they leave the lanterns burning they leave their husbands they leave everything and they go to follow that music until they come to the clearing and there's Krishna playing the flute and there's 108 of them and he splits himself he becomes 108 Krishna's so that he can make love to all of them as their perfect lover so yes but they've left everything you know they've said that the music was so so absorbing to them that they weren't they didn't think oh you're my husband they didn't they were like no therefore they didn't leave anything they gained everything and in the realization that you didn't leave anything because there's nothing left behind that is Krishna's flute is a metaphor for the inner sound current yeah and it's a perfect lover because it's all permeating it connects you to your whole self there's more than you say a private lover can do you can connect to your sensual body with a with a sensual lover connect to your breath you can feel good yeah but Krishna's flute or that knot in the sound current connect you to your cosmic presence that that when a lover can do that yo I'll take it and he's making love to all eight of them 108 108 the sound vibration is everywhere so like holographically the wholeness of the field is at every point within the field you can connect the wholeness of the field at every point within the field and so at every one every one of the 108 there was the wholeness of Krishna there's a wholeness and as you make total presence total love total nurturing total validation so the idea is that not leave they didn't leave something behind that's a metaphor what they did they moved their head into everything and in a sense you left you could call it an illusion but that can anger some people that you call it an illusion yes a temporary sense of reality yeah yeah and do you do you feel like you're not to force you to categorize yourself but do you feel like you're you're a teacher or that you have it seems like you're teaching us through the sounds that you're producing um in the sense of modeling that I am opening myself up to continuously validating and learning who what I am and am not and sharing my learning space sharing my learning space I'm little concerned about taking on students in the formal sense especially followers I feel like in following I'd like to have the the freedom to back up without stepping on anybody that is so cool that is so that's all any of us want that's the most beautiful thing to want yes but in uh I allow my music the music that I've done has modeled to musicians that I've heard from around the world who have been inspired enough to go along the direction they've already been going on with more conviction and more zest or giving people the ability to think over me maybe I should just keep that meditation a little longer until I make more sense of it I imagine there are many people who are trying to meditate and haven't found their connection to it and I'm feeling that the music that I do or my lifestyle may support them and say oh I'll give it another try yes or I'll go a little deeper for sure that's the sense when I listen to your music that's what it feels like to me it puts me in that something I don't know what you would call it something unique well it's unique to your music I do you think that music do you think music is alive that is a good question I have the sense that music and light are vertical forms that are conscious being now it's not easy to wrap my linear thinking around that idea that a sound can be a conscious being but a sound can impart wisdom it can lift heaviness it can open consciousness and it can do it in a way that isn't filled with human drama or human demands I have the sensation that sound and light are conscious beings I mean you may call it the angelic realm that that exists probably as continuous present time that can somehow impact the movement of consciousness on this side of the veil I have this sensation yes that sound is a living being you think of when I play the gong the idea is to invoke the gong the beings who work through the gong to come through and impact us in positive ways disintegrate energy and to lift consciousness into a higher sense of present time thank you so much for hanging out with me for this time Duncan it's been an ecstatically infinite pleasure likewise thank you how can people find you there's a website that I try to stay on top of it's called laraji.blogspot.com and on that website there's my email address there's descriptions of the laughter workshop that I do and hopefully updated schedule of my concerts and ways to contact me and little bit information of the things that I'm up to and if this is too much to ask I completely get it but you have this instrument here and I was wondering if maybe for the next five minutes or so you could play a little something for everybody let's see I can hold the mic and interesting you just say the way you just said to play it for everybody in african tradition this instrument is played to acknowledge ancestral energy so you're playing for the ancestors so when I play the instrument especially in any music I am mindful of beings who are not totally in the hard fast human body but the energy I'll hold this everybody and beyond bodies yes thank you do all of a sudden it's a different world all of a sudden it's a different way of thinking all of a sudden it's a different way of feeling all of a sudden it's a

Also I did a rather long-winded rant in this one, and if you want to skip over that and skip over the commercials, jump over to around the 33 minute mark and you'll get right into the interview. Alright, here we go. Hello friends. It is I, Duncan Trussell, and you are listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast and oh, what a magical episode we have today. And to kick this episode off, I'm going to play a clip from an interview with Carl Sagan that was done six months before he died. What is faith? It is belief in the absence of evidence. Now, I don't propose to tell anybody what to believe, but for me, believing when there's no compelling evidence is a mistake. The idea is to withhold belief until there is compelling evidence. And if the universe does not comply with our predispositions, okay, then we have the wrenching obligation to accommodate to the way the universe really is. And that's coming from a man who's got about six months left to live. He has not succumbed to the attractive and comforting idea offered to the world through so many varying religions that when material life ceases, when organic life ceases, when the last breath leaves the body, the human does not stop existing, but rather, depending on which particular philosophy you're subscribing to, goes on to some higher plane of consciousness or has some kind of contact with the creator. And that's a very attractive thing to start believing in when you're trying to get to the creator. And that's a very attractive thing to start believing in when you're at the gateway of death. But Carl Sagan was not letting himself get sucked into that paradigm, but rather was holding firm. And for Carl Sagan, this wrenching obligation that he was talking about was obviously the wrenching obligation to accept the fact that upon the dissolution of his body, he would cease to exist for infinity and would never have contact with those that he loved again. This is the great terror. This is the great ghost story of the atheist. This is the horror of the world. The idea that all the world religions, any faith that has within it the concept of life after death, is not something based on any kind of evidence at all, but is rather just the flowery proclamation of a person terrified of his own extinction. So terrified that he has been driven into a state of delirium that has allowed him to experience the delusion of contact with a creator or contact with some kind of higher state of consciousness, that it's like matter and antimatter. And once the human mind comes into contact with the inescapable truth that upon that last exhalation, we transform into absolute nothingness for infinity, the human mind goes nuts. It loses its shit. And for millennia, the human mind has been weaving together these stories to try to mitigate that terrible, aching, awful, inescapable horror that we're all in a canoe heading in the direction of a waterfall that leads into the mouth of oblivion. Oh, it's scary. It's scary to think. And so we end up in a sort of mindset, the mindset of the scientific materialist, which is kind of a very, it's like a truth martyr. It's a person who is offered on the altar of truth the comfort items, like a child surrendering its pacifier to its mother, the security blankets that so many other people all over the world are clinging to, like infants, all the cathedrals, all the temples, all the mosques, all the churches are just glorified security blankets built by the terror stricken leaders of the world religions, which have not grown out of the human mind to offer comfort or solace or to connect humanity with some kind of higher truth or higher consciousness, but rather to stupefy, to intoxicate and to dull down that aspect of the human entity that screams in the face of the void. And so that is certainly one way to look at religion and that is certainly one way to look at all philosophies based on ideas that cannot be proven scientifically. There's even more cynical ways of looking at it. You could even say that religion itself was not something created by people in a fear delirium who had lost their minds over their inability to deal with their own extinction, but it was actually created by con artists who were aware of the fact that huge swaths of the human population were going insane with fear, and they knew that if they fabricated some kind of beautiful fairy tale and allowed themselves to take on the guise of middlemen between humans existing in this dimension and the infinite transcendent entities that exist in some other dimension, then they could make a lot of money and live very comfortable lives while so many other people were toiling and scraping their way from the womb to the tomb. And so this is where we get that wonderful quote, religion is what happened. I think this is Mark Twain. I'm not positive. Forgive me if I misquote someone. It's a great quote though. Religion is what happened when the first con man met the first fool. And from there you can gaze down upon the delusional masses and their silly rituals and burning their incense and their truth tombs rather than hanging out on internet forums and writing cynical, jaded, shitty comments underneath YouTube videos of cats falling asleep. So if faith is a kind of scientific sin, which is believing in things for which there is no evidence, then when it comes to understanding religion, we have to start looking into what do we have evidence for in religion. And one thing we arguably have evidence for is that religion has the potential to transform the subjective outlook of a person practicing whatever religion they happen to be practicing. This is summed up nicely in this passage from varieties of a religious experience, the book written by William James. There is a state of mind known to religious men, but to no others in which the will to assert ourselves and hold our own has been displaced by a willingness to close our mouths and be as nothing in the floods and water spouts of God. In this state of mind, what we most dreaded has become the habitation of our safety and the hour of our moral death has turned into our spiritual birthday. The time for tension in our soul is over and that of happy relaxation, of calm, deep breathing, of an eternal present with no discordant future to be anxious about has arrived. What William James is describing there is the peak experience that is accessible via the methodologies presented in all the world religions. And what he's articulating is the self-reported subjective state of multitudes of people who have come into contact with religion. We must withhold belief until we have firm evidence. That's what Carl Sagan says. We must withhold belief. So if you're somebody who subscribes to the hypothesis that there is no external disembodied intelligence in the universe, that there is no higher consciousness, external to human form, that in the entire expansive ever expanding, impossible to comprehend vastness of the universe, there is no greater intelligence and certainly no greater intelligence that created the set of chain reactions that made life form on this planet that we're currently existing in. And you have to affirm that hypothesis by gathering all the data available to you, not just the data that you found that has been gathered by people scanning the external universe. You have to scan your own internal universe as well. And that's where you run into a lot of problems because that particular data set that exists inside the subjective cosmos of every single individual is a data set that is not accessible to the tools currently available to scientists living today. We've got the Hubble telescope, we've got satellite circling planets, but we have no way to fly meters, gauges, or any kind of device into the subjective universe that makes up a great deal of who we are. We are the universe. Human beings are the universe. You have to agree with that. And if we are the universe, then one swath of the universe, one sedimentary layer of the universe is that universe that exists within the human mind. The universe of dreams, imagination, inspiration, the universe of epiphanies, the universe accessible when you inhale dimethyltryptamine smoke or slurp back ayahuasca or take a large enough dose of mushrooms, that place that is populated by seemingly disembodied entities that seem very different from us. That place has been reported, has been talked about, and has been mapped by psychonauts, mystics, theologians, and prophets for a very, very, very long time. But we don't have the gauges to get in there yet. You're not going to be able to find what an epiphany looks like using an MRI. And you're not going to be able to find what enlightenment looks like using a CAT scan. We can do MRIs and CAT scans of people claiming to be enlightened, but that's not really going to give us the metric that we're looking for. And that's where shit gets cool, because you are the only person who can go into your internal cosmos who has access to this very rare strata of the biosphere. If you consider just how rare life appears to be based on our current scans of planets in our galaxy, and based on our scans of the planets that we have access to, and we don't have very good access to the planets in the Goldilocks region of stars, but we do know that there do seem to be planets out there. But the bottom line is we haven't gotten any kind of contact, as far as we're aware, unless there's some vast government conspiracy that happened a very long time ago, from any kind of aliens. Which means that up until this point, we are the only life that we have discovered in space. And that's terrestrial life on planet Earth. So you are in a very interesting and beautiful situation here as a human being, because you are the only entity, as far as you know, in the entire universe that has access to your subjective cosmos. Nobody else can see your dreams, nobody else can think your thoughts, nobody else can feel what you feel, nobody else has access to that data set. They only have access to your articulation of that data set. That makes any sense at all. What I'm saying here is you're the only being that can fly your spaceship of consciousness into the great, luminous, vivid, subconscious cosmos that exists inside of your mind. So before you discard and write off our religion, based on your analysis of all the various data sets that have been obtained from scientists using all kinds of fascinating high-tech instruments to scan the external universe, you have to do a scan of your own internal universe, and you have to do that scan before and after you've practiced any given religion for some certain amount of time. You need to find out what happens to your internal, subjective cosmos after practicing some religion. See what happens. I would like to see and I would be deeply moved and I would have great respect for people like Richard Dawkins if they would spend some period of time engaged actively and fully in religious life. What would Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris have to say about Islam after practicing for a few months and not practicing in a cynical way but actually going through the routine? I'm sure they wouldn't be able to do it without being cynical. What would happen if they suspended their disbelief for a period of a few months and engaged in some kind of theistic religion for any given period of time and then accurately reported any changes that happened to their internal mindset or mood state after this practice? Would there be any change at all? What I mean is it's not fair to study the outside of religion and claim that because the symbols used in religion are completely ridiculous and unverifiable using any kind of measurement tool available to the scientist without scanning the internal universe, their own internal universe after practicing prayer, mantra, congregational chanting or whatever the particular religion is that they decided to investigate. It would be a curious study. That's all. So the same applies to you and this is something that Alistair Crowley advised and something that I really love which is dive into this stuff, check it out, go deep into it. Go into it not with the fanatical bleary eyes of somebody trying to escape the itchy horror of their own inevitable extinction but with the wide open lucid eyes of a scientist studying a strata of the universe that is only accessible to the individual which is that strata which is your own subjective understanding of life, the lens through which you and you alone gaze out into the world. See what happens and how that apprehension of the universe changes when you add to your internal cosmology the symbols that are offered to us from all the world's religions. How to use all the world's religions start with one. For me the religion that had the greatest impact in my life is what's called Vaishnaiva Bhakti Yoga, Hari Krishnas, came into contact with the Hari Krishnas many, many, many, many moons ago when I was in Laguna Beach, started chanting Hari Krishnas, started following some of their prescribed methodologies which I don't think I could follow today. These include not eating meat, no intoxicants, no sex, that was easy for me back then, and no gambling, no problem. But the eating meat and the drugs thing, I mean it wasn't necessarily the easiest thing but I definitely did it and suddenly I was refraining from all of this stuff and combining that with daily chanting of this mantra, Hari Krishna, Hari Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Hari Hari, Haridama, Haridama, Rama, Rama, Hari Hari, I was doing that every day and it changed me and I think it changed me permanently to some degree. I still say Hari Krishna, I still chant Hari Krishna, I recognize the dangers of organized religion and I am always going to be skeptical of any kind of organized religion that places that creates a system where there is a guru or spiritual master or somebody who has full authority over their flock but I would be a bad scientist if I didn't report back to you to say that the consistent chanting of the Hari Krishna Mahamantra mixed in with a more disciplined daily life created some pretty profound changes in my subjective consciousness and created some of the most psychedelic experiences that I have ever had in my life. That definitely happened, it definitely happened to me and I marvel over it and think about it to this very day, some of the stuff that happened when I was really diligently engaged in that spiritual practice. So you know I say Hari Krishna a bunch on this podcast, that's why and I was thinking how odd it is that I've never really had a Hari Krishna devotee on this podcast and not long after that thought I got a text from Zach Leary who said that his friend Radhanath Swami, a Hari Krishna monk and teacher was going to be in town and that he would do my podcast so that's how this podcast came about and I hope that you will listen to it with an open mind, temporarily suspend any stigma that you may, any preconceived notions about who the Hari Krishna's are or what it is to be a Hari Krishna and just listen to the interview I did with Radhanath Swami and forgive me if I seem a little nervous or if I miss some questions. I was trying to cover the broad strokes of the philosophy while dealing with something that I love to encounter which is that a lot of, quite often when you get to hang out with somebody who's been practicing a spiritual tradition for a very long time, they output some pretty intense energy that is psychedelic in its own right and I don't know whether that's just something I'm projecting or whether that's something that is actually coming from within them but it's always been true for me. It's happened a bunch and that happened during this episode too. So there you go. We're going to dive right into this but first some quick business. Today's episode of the DTFH is brought to you by the mattress lords over at Casper.com. I don't need to tell you how important those sweet padded rectangles are in your life. A mattress is something that you make love on top of. It's something you curl up in the fetal position in when you've eaten too much marijuana and wait for the demons to go away and obviously it's something that you sleep on. You watch TV on it if you're somebody who has a TV in your bedroom. You don't need to know that a mattress is super important but one thing that you've probably experienced if you currently own a mattress is this strange problematic aspect of buying a mattress at any kind of mattress dispensary. Mattress salesmen are confusingly angry. These beings are selling these wonderful sweet rectangles of solace and yet they seem filled with such inexplicable rage and I think the rage is directly related to having to work inside a warehouse filled with mattresses and yet not being allowed to nap on top of them and also dealing with people coming in all day long who definitely are not going to buy a mattress from you. It creates a kind of weird rage. I was almost punched by a mattress salesman once. He was physically angry. You could see his fists clenching. I don't remember what I did. I'm sure it was related to, I probably sassed him or something. I don't know what it is that happened but I do know that any experience that I've ever had trying to buy a mattress has not been fun. The last mattress that I bought, I'm sorry I've told this story a few times before. I will quickly summarize. A, I was too high. I went to a mattress store completely baked on Edible Marijuana. B, I'd recently experienced, my mom had died and I'd gotten cancer so I was also crazy. I was high and crazy and somehow I thought that the answer to the great sucking void that had appeared in my chest was to buy a super expensive mattress. What ended up happening is I got hoodwinked. The mattress salesman brought me over to the most expensive corner of the store. He showed me this mattress on top of a frame that would lift up and vibrate and I lay on the mattress. It was very comfortable and he pressed the vibrate button. The thing started vibrating. I was super high. It felt like my atoms were about to fly apart in a million different directions and what sealed the deal, this hypnotic maniacal minotaur and a maze of mattresses told me that his wife had actually gotten addicted to this kind of mattress and that had been a problem. He looked at me with the most solemn, serious look and he said, I'll sell you this but you got to promise me that you're not going to get addicted and that was it. That's all I had to hear. I could get addicted to this mattress. This is like heroin. It's like a narcotic. Done. I ended up paying way too much for this ridiculous mattress and what ultimately is the same kind of bed that you find in old folks home. It was shipped to my house a couple of weeks later. I allowed myself this terrible belief that once the mattress came everything would be okay and all the grief and sorrow and awfulness that I experienced in 2013 would dissipate as I lay down on that sweet, vibrating rectangle of joy and the mattress came and installed the mattress. Well, I didn't. The guys who brought it installed the mattress and some friends came over and I remember showing them the mattress with this kind of crazy look in my eye like, look, I got this awesome mattress. Oh yeah, this is the one. This is why life is good, vibrating mattress. I still remember the pity. I still remember the pity in their eyes as they realized that I had completely gone off the deep end and was using the mattress as a surrogate for God. Basically, what happened is within six months that goddamn mattress started sinking in. It was like laying on a lumpy old bag of dirt. What had formerly been so comfortable, there was just like terror, there was like awful indentations in it. It was just a bad mattress, man. It broke down. It just broke down quick and I wasn't very comfortable. I get all these back spasms and muscle spasms and I realized that I'd been hoodwinked by a mattress master. Anyway, I was contacted by Casper. They wanted to sponsor the podcast. I told them to send the mattress and I tried it out before I could promote it. The mattress is what I lay onto this very day. What other promotion do you need? I sleep on a Casper mattress. I love it. It has yet to indent. It has yet to collapse. It is a very comfortable, firm, bouncy mattress and it was a million times less expensive than the evil rectangle of doom sold to me by that bastard at the mattress warehouse that I purchased a mattress from. Casper mattresses cost 500 for a twin size mattress, 600 for a twin extra large, 750 for a full sized, and 850 for a queen sized, and 950 for a king sized mattress. I don't know why you're going to buy a twin sized mattress. That's kind of spooky. Are you a serial killer? Are you trying to get mattresses into your cult compound? Don't get a twin sized mattress. Get a queen. Really, get a king. That's my big regret. I wish I'd asked them to send me a god damn king sized mattress because I've got two dogs and a girlfriend now and I feel like I'm laying in a very small raft in an ocean of sleep filled with a lot of warm, sweet, wriggling, wonderful things. Kings the way to go. You make the choice. All I'm saying is I would not lead you astray. I sleep on a Casper mattress. It's way more comfortable than the super expensive mattress that I bought and the cool thing about Casper is they'll give you a free delivery and returns with a 100 day period. There's no way you can lose. Let them send you the mattress. If you hate the damn thing, send it back and go to a mattress maze and buy some super expensive mattress and maybe that one will be better. I don't know. I'm very happy with the mattress that I'm currently sleeping on. It's a Casper mattress and I highly recommend their mattresses if you're somebody who happens to be in the market for a mattress.

Go check it out, but for now, everyone, please welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast, Radhanath Swamy. Radhanath Swamy, welcome to the DuncanTrussell Family Hour podcast. I'm so grateful that you're here today. It is my honor and great pleasure to be with you, Duncan, thank you. You are the first devotee that I've had on this podcast and I was talking to you before a little bit about how this religion has had a massive impact on my life, but I don't think I've explained it very well on this podcast and so I'm really excited to chat with you a little bit about it so that maybe you could give an explanation to the audience who listens about what bhakti yoga is and what it means to be a devotee. So that's my first lazy question, which is what is bhakti yoga? In Sanskrit, the name or the word bhakti means love, spiritual love. The principle is that the most fundamental need of all living beings is to love and to be loved. In the Brahma Sutra, a great scripture, it is said, ananda mayo bhashat, which means one thing that we all have in common, whether we're CEOs of corporations or little aunts on a kitchen counter, everyone is looking for pleasure. We're all seeking pleasure and we're all seeking ways to relieve that which interferes with our pleasure, which is pain. Things, accumulation of wealth or power, prestige or physical sensual experiences, can give some degree of pleasure to the body, mind and senses, but they cannot touch the heart and real fulfillment is a thing of the heart. The only thing that can actually touch the heart with joy is to be loved and to love. And the origin of that experience is the soul's love for God or the supreme soul. The living force within the body who's seeing through the eyes and hearing through the ears and smelling through the nose and thinking through the brain. That living force in Bhagavad Gita is called the atma or the soul. And this is a universal principle. In the Bible, Jesus says, what profit if a person who gains the whole world but loses his own soul? So we are this soul, we are this living force that's animating and giving consciousness to our bodies. And people are so much distracted by trying to find happiness through satisfying the body that they've forgotten the needs of the soul. Just like if you're driving in a car, the car needs gasoline and oil, but the driver needs something else. What is it that actually gives satisfaction, meaning, and fulfillment to the soul? And all the great religions and spiritual paths throughout history are speaking in various languages, sometimes in various ways, to address this question. Who am I? What is real happiness? What is death? What is beyond death? So the origin of that need for pleasure is the natural love the soul has for the Supreme Soul. In our tradition we call Krishna. Krishna means the all-beautiful, all-loving, all-attractive one. There are many names of God. And bhakti yoga is the process, the path, the culture that actually reconnects us to that love that is inherent within us. Love for God and compassion for all living beings is our intrinsic, essential nature. It's simply been forgotten, and bhakti is reviving that. When you talk about the Supreme, the Supreme Soul, and then the soul that is inside of people, that's always been a kind of confusing differentiation. How is there a Supreme Soul? And then myriads of whatever we happen to be, the individual soul. How are these things separated? How does separation exist between that Supreme consciousness and all of these little motes of consciousness that have taken up temporary incarnations here? There is an upanishad of Vedic literature that explains so beautifully, nityo nityanam cetanas cetananam ekobahunam yobhadadati kamam, that there's one Supreme Soul that is the cause of all causes, the source of everything. And there are limitless souls who have that Supreme Soul as their origin and who are forever dependent upon that Supreme Soul. An analogy is given, there's the Sun Planet. And emanating from the Sun Planet, there are limitless Sun Rays. And each Sun Ray is qualitatively identical to the Sun Planet. Each Sun Ray gives off heat and light, just like the Sun. But the Sun is the origin of the Sun Ray. And the Sun is the whole and the Sun Ray is only a part. So quantitatively there's a difference, but qualitatively there one. So in Bhakti, becoming one with God is the principle of we are eternally loving servants of God, or of the Absolute, or who we call Krishna or Ram. And we become one in our love. When people love each other so much, they lose their sense of separateness in the ecstasy of that love. And this is, in the Bhakti tradition, this is the relationship we have with the Supreme object of all love. To feel God's infinite love for us and to reciprocate with our love is, in the Bhakti tradition, the highest spiritual experience. This relationship in Bhakti Yoga is, it's very, it's been worked out. There are symbols, the symbols of Radha, the symbols of Krishna, the deities, and there are very specific ways that these deities are worshiped. When I've gone to the, when I've gone to the temples and watched, what do you call it, the deities ceremony? What are these called? These are called where you bathe the deities and burn, and like light candles in front of them and move them around. What is the name of those, what's the name of that ceremony? It's called, the principle of that type of worship is called puja. Puja, that's it. And specific ceremony is arti. Arti, that's it. So when I'm watching that, it's, you're seeing something that is very precise. It's something that is, seems to be as precise as you can get. I don't know how much improvisation is going on in this form of worship. Where does that come from? Who originated that series of movements that make up arti or the worship of the deities? The concept of puja or the worship of the deities is, it's a meditation. When we chant God's names or meditate on Sri Ram, Sri Krishna within our hearts, we're connecting to that love that's within us. This chanting of God's names is a very special way or mantra meditation of awakening that inner love that's within our heart. But we do have a body and we do have senses and there is a world all around us made out of material elements. So what do we do while we're here? The idea is we could use all the elements of this world as an expression of that love. And through expressing our love in this way, we're meditating on what's within our heart, and through our eyes, and through our nose, and through our ears, and we're making that connection. There's, according to the Bhagavad Gita, there's eight material elements, primary elements, earth, water, fire, air, space, other gross elements, and then the mind, the intelligence, and the ego. So our tea is a beautiful meditation of offering creation back to the Creator with love and gratitude. When we offer incense or flower, the quality of earth is fragrance. So we're offering fragrance when we offer water, we offer a fan, which is air, we sing or blow a kankshal, which is sound, which is the quality of space. We offer a little lamp, a little fire lamp, which is the quality of sight. So we're taking, and going through the steps or the procedures, we're applying our intelligence by hearing it, we're applying our mind, and by offering, with love, we're offering our egos. So our tea is actually just a very, very beautiful, holistic meditation where we're using our bodies, all of our senses, our mind, intelligence, our egos, and the elements of the whole creation, and we're offering with gratitude and love back to Krishna. But this is not a one-sided interaction, is it? It's not a one-sided interaction. When you do this, there is a reciprocity that is coming from the deities. Is that accurate to say? What you're saying is beautiful. That's the essence of it, because love is reciprocal. And the love between the soul, between us and the Supreme Soul, is something very personal and very, it's the deepest of all experiences. And the Gita Krishna tells Ye Gita Mam Propadyante that according to our sincerity, our beloved reciprocates with us. So just like Duncan, electricity is an energy that we can't see. But when that electricity goes into a light bulb, we can actually perceive the light. Now the light bulb is not the electricity itself, but it becomes permeated with the electricity and it becomes light. So a deity may be a material element, but God is everywhere and everything and everything is coming from God and everything is God's energy. So when we approach the deity according to special devotional, traditional ways, then God appears there to accept our love and reciprocate his love. But can you, in a very tangible way, and ultimately that is meant to connect us to the Lord within our heart. And when that connection is made within the Lord within our heart, then we can actually see how every living being, whatever the race, whatever the sex, whatever the social background, whatever the species, every living being is a child of my beloved, is a part of my beloved. And naturally we will feel love and compassion for all of creation. And we'll see the environment, the earth, and the planets all around us. This is all the energy, the creation of my beloved, it's his property, her property. And in this way we will honor and respect all living beings, we'll honor and respect all things and use them in harmony with our own souls, love and compassion for God and His creation. When you started chanting, when was the first moment that you realized that this, that you were in very deep water? And I can remember when that happened to me, because what you're describing, I don't know if people understand that those deities somehow, and I don't know what it is, I like to maintain skepticism. So I think in terms of a projection maybe of some deeper archetypical part that exists inside of me, but I also have to admit experiences I've had in relation to those things have been the most psychedelic, overwhelming, intense moments of my life. And I don't know that people understand that. Can you talk about maybe some of the experiences you've had in relation to those deities? To the chanting or to the deities? To the deities, because I've watched devotees gazing at the deities. I remember going to India to the ISKCON temple in Vrindavan and watching the devotees looking at the deities. And the way that they're looking at them, this is the way that you look at someone you're in love with. They were looking at them with that identical look of someone who's hanging out with their soulmate or something. And there is not, it's not a one-sided interaction that's happening. You can see that they're receiving something from them as well. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about any moments that you've had with the deities where you've gotten transmissions or downloads or can you describe it? The first time I encountered this puja or deity worship, I was in the Himalayas. I wrote a memoir called The Journey Home Autobiography of American Swami where I describe how I was looking for meaning and truth on a spiritual level and I hitchhiked from London and ended up in the Himalayas. It took about six months to get there. But while I was there, I was at a little temple in the forest and I saw people looking at the deities with such affection and they were offering articles. And because of my background, I'm originally from Northern Illinois, I was thinking, is this idol worship? This is really strange. I felt uncomfortable with it, but I saw that these people were really sincere so I couldn't discard it. I just didn't understand it. And later on, as I was traveling and wandering, I came to Brindavan. And there were some beautiful people, some of the most saintly, compassionate, God intoxicated people I've ever met in my life and it was so deep and it was so real, their kindness, their goodness, and they were in such a transcendent, ecstatic state of love. And they would chant kirtans in front of these deities and they would be looking at these deities as you were saying with more affection than a lover can look at a lover in this world. And at that time, I realized that this is not idol worship, this is something very deep. These people are extraordinarily self-realized, enlightened people. And I remembered from the Bible, it says, you can judge a tree by its fruit. And if the fruit of these people's lives is such compassion for all life, being totally tent just with the ecstasies of the love of their heart and just giving to others, then this must be something very, very beautiful. And that experience of being with such people gave me the understanding that they're seeing the beloved of our hearts in that deity. And in their company, I began to see that too. And for years, I was a pujari, I was just serving deities. But serving deities is just an external conception. I was trying to really dedicate my heart in every way and my actions in offering loving service to God, to Sri Radha Krishna, who is the form and names of God that my tradition worships. Uradha is God's lover. Is that how you would say, Radharani is the lover of God, the God's girlfriend, wife? In Sanskrit, that there's one God. And this is the one God of all religions, nam-namakari-pahudha-nijasara-vasakti. And that one God has many names and has appeared in this world in many forms, but the same one person, the same one ultimate source of everything and everyone, the father and mother of everyone. But that one God is eternally in both male and female aspect, the Shaktiman and the Shakti. So Krishna is the male aspect of God, according to the names of our tradition. And Radha is the feminine aspect of that divinity. And they are one and the same. And to use the same analogy for a different explanation, Krishna is like the sun and Radha is like the sunshine. You can't separate the two. You can't have sun without sunshine and you can't have sunshine without sun. The feminine aspect of divinity, Sita or Lakshmi or Radha, is the aspect of God that is compassion, forgiveness, makes the Supreme accessible to each and every one of us in a very intimate and personal way. The Supreme Mother and the Supreme Father are forever existing and attracting our own love and inviting us to enter into that state of consciousness. And one of the things I love about this particular religion is the stories about the interactions between Radha and Krishna. And this is a very big part of the religion, isn't it, studying the different ways that Radha and Krishna play together. There's a place called, I'm sure I'm going to mispronounce it, Golok Vrindavan, is that how you say it? Which is like the eternal, it's heaven basically. And in this place, these beings hang out eternally and they play together, essentially. They have these interactions. And is that called the alila? Is that what it's called? The lila? Is that the right term for it? It's the right term. So these pastimes are broken down in the most beautiful ways. And there's all these stories that I like that are very, very trippy, like maybe you could tell one. Do you know, like the story of Krishna eating mud? Can you tell that story? I would love to. In the Gita, Krishna tells Hidha, Hidha, Dharamasya, Glanir, Bhavati Bharata, that he descends into this world in many ways, as we explained, to ultimately attract our love back to him and to teach us how to live in yoga or in harmony with the true nature of our soul, with the true nature of our relationship with God and with all other living beings and with the environment around us. So Krishna is that one supreme God who steps aside from his role as the supreme absolute controller to exchange intimate love with his lovers. And to do that, he will take the child, he will give us the experience of being sometimes his parent or his lover or his friend. The example is this, a judge in a courtroom is called your honor. When the judge goes home, he has his friends and they joke together and he has his children who say, give me this and give me that and he has his parents who chastise him for not taking care of his health and he has his wife who reminds him to take the garbage out. So which is more intimate, being the judge in the courtroom or having these intimate loving personal relationships. So Krishna is that aspect of God where God puts his godness aside for the purpose of, he's still God facilitating loving relationships. So in Brindavan, Krishna appears and he's a little child and his mother is Yashoda and father is Nanda. And one day Krishna's friends, Krishna was just three years old at the time, they said to his mother, he ate dirt, Krishna ate dirt. His friends snitched him out. Yeah, they did. And his mother, she's not thinking he's God, she's thinking he's my child. Now please understand, I hope I'm not getting too philosophical but that's my inclination. She has already realized the absolute power and an all mightiness of God as the creator of everything, the source of all that exists, the absolute truth. She's realized that fully but in the intimacy of her love that's all in the background because his sweetness, his beauty and his love is completely capturing her soul's affection. So she's thinking he's my child, what would a mother think if her son was eating dirt? She was really worried, so she said to Krishna, why are you eating dirt? Krishna said, I didn't eat dirt. She said, but your friends are saying that you ate dirt and they're always on your side. Why are they saying if you didn't eat dirt and their friends are there saying, no, he ate dirt? Krishna said, I didn't eat dirt. She said, how will you keep your health? I'm giving you so many nice foods, why are you eating dirt? Krishna said, I didn't eat dirt. If you don't believe me, look in my mouth. So he opened his little mouth. Now he's the size of a three-year-old little boy. He opened his little tiny mouth and she looked inside. She saw all the planets in the universe. She saw the sun and the moon and Saturn and Venus and Neptune and she saw the stars and she saw all the mountains of the earth planet and all the oceans and she saw all living beings and she looked closer and she saw herself looking in her little sun, Krishna's mouth. She saw all these things and the beautiful thing about it is, because we say God is great, but this is an inconceivable understanding how great God actually is. The actual universe was within his mouth. And it's not like Apple and Sony and all these corporations, they're making things the smaller, the microchip, the more data you can get in little tiny pieces. He wasn't compressing anything. He wasn't concentrating anything. It was actually the full sun, the full moon, the full planet, the full Himalayas were all and his mouth didn't grow. It was just a few inches in diameter. Now how is that possible? A chintishakti. God is great. There's nothing impossible for the Absolute Truth. So when she was seeing this, she was kind of bewildered. Is my son some great yogi or is my son Narayan, the Absolute Truth God? Not possible because when there's lightning, he cries and he runs to me and I have to embrace him to pacify him and when he's hungry, I have to feed him otherwise he'll cry. He's my son. So she was in this dilemma. She's seeing the universe in his mouth and she's loving him as her baby and she can't love him as a baby if she's thinking he's the almighty God. Right. So then Krishna closes his mouth and smiled and she completely forgot everything she just saw in her motherly affection for him and just embrace him and fed him. Wow, see that is what I love about this religion because the stories are so psychedelic. They're so juicy and they're so, that story you can think about and analyze and consider and talk about and break down for your entire life if you wanted to. Just that one little story, you could break down the implications of it. What does it mean? What is some, what is it pointing to? And that's what I think is so incredibly engrossing about Vaisnaiva Bhakti Yoga. Do you, what do you, you believe that that actually happened, right? You believe that that there was a time where that interaction literally happened. Yes. And so many people will hear that story and they will think, well, this is mythology. That did not happen. There was no, there was never a divine baby that appeared on this planet. There was never an interaction between a divine baby and a divine mother. These are symbols that are meant to point in the direction of some philosophy, but they're not real. It's not, it couldn't have happened based on the laws of physics, based on the empirical understanding of the universe. This could not have happened. How do you answer that? How do you answer the skeptic, the Richard Dawkins, the Sam Harrises, the people who hear these stories and say, no, this is not real. It's just myth. May I share a personal experience I had? Please. I discuss this in the book, Journey Home. I was living in the Himalayas. This is a 1971 and I was very close with one yogi, very dear friend, very sweet person, and he wanted me to come to an event with him. Now events in the Himalayas, I never heard of it, but he went to a little temple and people came and he started performing what most people would consider miracles. He chanted mantras and from his hands he created a stone shiva lingam, like a statue of Shiva. And then he started chanting mantras and ashes, limitless practically. Gallons of ashes were pouring out of the palm of his hand. He wasn't even wearing a shirt. And everybody who came to him, they were saying, they were approaching him as God. And he said, I'm not God. I just know how to do this. He said, through the yoga practice, I've learned this property city where I've learned to manipulate matter on a molecular perspective through my mind. He said, I can create ashes. God can create universes. God's inconceivable prowess. He said, true spirituality is to understand that I'm the eternal soul, to free ourself from the ego of wanting to be the controller, the enjoyer, and the proprietor, but understanding that I'm the caretaker of sacred property, of the supreme object of love, or Ram, he called. After I met him, I went into the forest and I was just thinking about what he just did and what he said. And I was sitting under a banyan tree, a huge banyan tree. And there was a tiny little banyan tree seed, and I picked up that seed and I was thinking, there's an entire banyan tree in this seed. It not only is there a banyan tree in this seed, but there's a banyan tree that can create millions or thousands of more seeds that could create more banyan trees and more seeds. Can any human being, however great a scientist they are, create a seed of life? And I was thinking, my mother and father, when they came together, they didn't have any engineering plan for the development of my body. Just a seed went from my father to my mother and then little eyes started growing and little hands started growing and now here I am sitting under a banyan tree and the Himalayas reflecting on the purpose of life. And we create cities and we create technologies and we create spaceships going to outer space. But where is that consciousness, that life coming from? Actually, Duncan, we're seeing miracles at every moment. But because we see them all the time, we take them for granted. Every time we see a tree, it's a miracle that came out of a tiny little seed, which is beyond human ability to do. Every time we may be in a traffic jam and be honking our horns because so many people are around, but every one of those people is a total miracle. There was just a little seed in the oaf of a mother that became a human being and now they're making other human beings and making cars. The whole world is nothing but miracles. How is the earth always in its orbit and the sun? And we can explain how it's happening, but where it's coming from. A chintya shakti means the first real understanding of God is inconceivable potencies. And inconceivable means it's beyond our intelligence. If God can put a banyan tree in a little tiny seed, God could put the universe in his own mouth he wants to. God could come as a little baby to attract our love. For me, it's, I understand how other people are seeing things and under processing, you know, but for me, there's miracles everywhere around. And if the source of all those miracles wants to do something wonderful, it's totally believable and extraordinarily wonderful. It feels like it takes a lot of courage to live in the universe that you're living in. I think that a lot of us don't want to see the universe in our baby's mouth because the result of seeing that is a complete recalibration of the way that we live our lives. And I think for a lot of people, that is not a very attractive notion. I mean, I can remember when I was at the temple in Laguna Beach on Jhamastami, the appearance day of Lord Krishna, I didn't really know anything about, I just, you know, encountered the Bhagavad Gita and it just encountered the devotees and was having my mind blown. And I can remember staring at these deities and I don't know what happened. I don't know what it was, but for a split second, they weren't deities anymore and it didn't feel like symbols and it didn't look like statues. It felt like this was an output point for some kind of super advanced intelligence that I couldn't possibly understand. It felt like an ant in a swimming pool, just sort of thrashing around in an enormous thing that I couldn't understand. I think about, I probably think about that once a week. Still, I think about what was that? What was that? But it was scary because I don't want to shave my head and I don't want to shave my head and become a monk. The universe is nature shaving my head for me because my hair is falling out, but I think that there's something terrifying about coming into contact with the kind of energy that you're describing right now and I think it takes a lot of courage that a lot of us don't have. Do we all have to become monks? I'm looking at you, you're wearing your own monk, you're wearing robes, you have a potent energy that's very palatable, but what about those of us who don't want to get drawn? We don't want to see the universe in the mouth of our children. We don't want to go that deep. What do we do? Unless you're taking some really strong psychedelic aid, you're not going to see the universe in this child's mouth because this is Krishna who appeared on earth, this is not our own children. Right, but still to see these miracles that you're talking about and to live in the world that you live in, to surrender completely to this energy, it's not, it's scary. It's a scary idea and I think that this is why when people hear about the Hare Krishna's, the word cult comes up a lot. People say, oh that's a religious cult, those people are fanatics and if you get too involved in it, you'll give away all your stuff and you'll end up at an airport somewhere. That's the stigma attached to the religion. I can, I have this podcast where I get to talk about whatever I want and I guess I'm a known weirdo now, but they're still talking about the Hare Krishna's or saying, I almost, I mean I was right there teetering on the edge of going for it and that's a stigmatized, there's a stigma attached to it as compared to other religions. The potency is so powerful in that religion that if you start hanging out there too much, if you start hanging out with the devotees too much, well then you start wanting to hang out with the devotees more and if you start going to the temple a little bit, you start wanting to go to the temple more and if you start chanting Hare Krishna, you start wanting to chant Hare Krishna more. It's got a very powerful magnetic pull that is terrifying to me. Is there a moderate version of Bhakti Yoga? Is there a version of Bhakti Yoga that doesn't involve a full surrender to this kind of, to this lifestyle? May I tell you another story? Please. I was in an auditorium in Mumbai and there was about 400 students and professors. It was at a college for chartered and certified accountants. Okay. And I give a talk. After my talk, I asked for questions and answers and when you're in a university in India, you have to really be prepared if you ask for questions and answers. Right. So one young man raised his hand and I called on him and everyone in the room went, ooh. So I understood this person has special charisma and popularity. He started screaming at me. He said, I reject everything you say. You are simply here to cheat us. What if everyone in the world became a swami like you? Who would run the government? Who would grow the food? Who would educate our children? Who would do the banking and the trading? Therefore, I consider that you're cheating us. He got a standing ovation. And after somehow or other, the crowd quieted down. I said a little prayer and I answered his question. I said, what would happen to the world if everyone became an accountant like you? Ooh, good one. That's a burn. Who would run the governments? Who would grow our food? Who would educate our children? Right. Who would do our banking and trading? In fact, if everybody became an accountant like you, there would be a 100% unemployment because no one would need an accountant. Right. I said, just like a body, there's different organs and limbs within the body. There's the kidneys and the lungs and the heart and the brain and the pancreas. They're not competing with each other. Each part of the body has its unique color, shape and function. The kidneys cannot do what the lungs do. And the heart cannot do what the brain does. A healthy body is where every part of the body is not arrogant. I'm doing better than you. Right. Every part of the body is appreciating and synchronizing with every other part of the body because they all know that they're dependent on each other. Right. So human society is like a body unless we could recognize that there's a special contribution that all of us can make for the world, for each other, for God. And we learn how to live in harmony and appreciation for each other. At our temple in Mumbai, where I live, we have an ashram with some monks, but we have a congregation of over 10,000 people. Wow. And these people are in politics and they run schools. We have our own hospital, Bhaktivedanta Hospital. It's a 200-bed hospital. And there's doctors and there's nurses and administrators and cooks and everything else. They're all devotees of Krishna, mothers, fathers. And among those people, besides the monks, nobody wears, when they go to work, they dress according to, you know, what the society is wearing in that sense. And they have regular kind of hair. But it's not that they're less spiritual than the monks. They're performing their duties in society. So I told this person in this college, I said there's a need for politicians and farmers and bankers and there's a need for accountants like you and there's also some need for swamis like me. Let's stop fighting with each other and let's work together like the organs and limbs of the body and make a healthy human society. How'd it go over? How'd your response go over? Well, with all humility, I got a louder and longer standing ovation than he did. He deserved it. That's cool. Does that answer your question? Perfectly. Thank you. In other words, spiritual life is not a matter of changing our hairstyle or changing our clothes. It's a matter of harmonizing our lives with each other through our devotion and our love for God and learning how to respect and honor each other through the process. I think that brings us to a question that maybe I should have asked at the beginning. What does the Hare Krishna mantra mean? How does it go? What does it mean? And why does it do what it does? Because I know that when I chant, which I'm not doing right now, but when I'm chanting regularly, my life changes. My predilections shift. The things I get interested in change. I'm a hippie. I'm a superstitious hippie. So I'm just going to say I have more coincidences. Synchronicity seemed to happen more. Things just seem to get better. Can you talk a little bit about number one? What is it? How does it go? And number two, what is it doing? Why is some series of words different from other series of words? Why can't I chant jam, jam, strawberry, banana, jam, jam, strawberry, banana? Why won't that have the same impact that the Mahamantra will have on my life? In the ancient Sanskrit language, mantra is composed of two seed words. Mana, which means the mind, and trayate means to liberate or deliver. So mantra means a divine sound vibration, which liberates the mind from illusions and the anxieties caused by those illusions. My beloved Guru Srila Prabhupada, he gave a beautiful analogy that when a raindrop falls from a cloud, it's pure, it's transparent. But when that raindrop falls onto the earth, it becomes muddy and loses its transparency. If you filter the water, it brings about its original natural transparency. So similarly, our consciousness, our consciousness is love of God is within all of us. We're by nature pure. But due to the ahankar, the ego, we're identifying with so many temporary designations, and that brings about so many complications in our life. And through that greed, envy, anger, selfish, passion, arrogance, and illusion. This is all like the mud that clouds our mind. If you look in the mirror, you're supposed to see yourself. But if the mirror is covered with dust, then all you see is dust, and you think that's me. So this chanting of mantras or meditating on mantras is a way of filtering or purifying our consciousness to bring it back to its original natural state. The state of true peace, true love, and a true understanding of our personal relationship with the ultimate object of all love, and to be an instrument of that love in whatever we do, which is compassion. That's the purpose of a mantra. In the Vedas, there are various mantras. There are many names of God, and in each and every one of these true names of God that are coming from true traditions, God's presence is accessible to us. The power, the beauty, the sweetness, and the love of God is within those names. It awakens from within us our love. So of the many mantras and the many names, the Kali Santarana Upanishad describes there is a maha mantra. And this maha mantra includes all other mantras. And it's especially for bringing about deep peace, liberating ourselves from the arrogance and selfishness and envy that plague us so that we can really be instruments of a higher purpose. And that mantra is Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hari Hari. And in my travels in India, I found that so many of the great yoga masters, so many of the great sages of various traditions, they put the highest emphasis on this Hare Krishna maha mantra. It's not just the Hare Krishna movement. It's known throughout India among those who really understand what the Vedas tell, that this mantra is especially empowered in the times that we're living called Kali Yuga, an age where there's a predominance of quarrel and hypocrisy. Hare, the first word, is a name of Sri Radha, the compassionate feminine energy. The feminine motherly side of God, Radha. Another name is Hare. And Krishna means, not a sectarian name of God, means the one supreme God who's all loving, all beautiful, who's the source of all excellences, who's all attractive. And Rama, Rama literally means the reservoir of all pleasure. We're all looking for pleasure when we repose our propensity for happiness. In God, we experience the highest pleasure. And that highest pleasure is something that's within our own hearts. And when we tap into that, then we don't have to go searching outside by acquiring more money and more fame and more sex and more prestige and more properties for pleasure. We can do all those things, but it becomes a way of expressing. We can have all those things and do so many things, but we're no longer in need of them for our happiness. We use whatever we have to express the great joy that we've discovered within ourselves, the joy of love, the joy of compassion, the joy of Ananda, our true ecstasy. So this Mahamantra is a way of invoking that loving propensity to awaken within our hearts, where we can actually be vessels of a higher cause, a higher purpose, God's love in whatever we may do. Can you, is there, what are the rules about chanting? Can you, like if someone's listening now and they think, oh okay, I want to try chanting this mantra, see what happens? How would you tell them to do it? Lord Chaitanya explains there's no hard and fast rules for this chant. Who is Lord Chaitanya? Lord Chaitanya is Krishna, who appeared just 500 years ago, and he was the one who actually promoted Kirtan within the world. He established it in a very, very special way. So this is a historic figure. Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu is a historic figure, someone that definitely lived in India. He lived in Navadweep, which is in West Bengal, and I go there every year, and then he traveled all around India, and eventually he lived in Puri, which is a very, very holy place in India, also on the East Coast. And people think that he's an incarnation of Krishna. 4,500 years before his appearance in many different Vedas, he's predicted his coming. And so he came and said, here, did this mantra exist before Lord Chaitanya appeared? Were people chanting Hare Krishna before he came around? This Hare Krishna mantra has been since time that cannot be traced out. The Vedas, 5,000 years ago, prioritize it as a great method of awakening that divine love within ourselves. So no rules. No rules in chanting. Somebody listening, you can chant this in your car, you can chant it at a rave, you can chant it whenever you want. There's no way to do it wrong. Well, as far as making a higher connection through our chanting, there's no rules or regulations. At the same time, if we live with moral integrity, then that chanting is going to have a deeper effect on us. So, okay, right. So you can, it's just like any other thing. It depends on how deep you want to go. You could, by chanting in any situation, any time silently or loudly or softly, we make that connection. But as we start making that connection, we naturally want to live in harmony with higher spiritual principles. Can we, do you think we could try, can we chant a little bit so people can hear what it sounds like? Can we chant some japa so people could, maybe you want to try it out, could chant with us for a few minutes? Do you want, can we do that? I would love to do whatever you say. Great. All right, let's do it. Let's chant for five minutes. Let's try that. And you guys listening, if you're still listening, it means you're probably interested in this, or you're just, I'm sorry if I freaked you guys out, but this is my favorite religion on earth. And so this is a chance for you to chant along with us and just give it a shot. Because obviously you can go online and Google search japa. It's there for you. But yeah, let's just chant. All right, Krishna, honestly, hanging out with people like you, I'm sorry if I seem stammering and weird, but whenever I get to be around people like you, you've got such an intense vibe that it makes me feel weirdly high, which is, which I love. So, okay, let's do it. I'm going to pause for a second and then let's chant. Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Krishna Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare, Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare, right?

Say, God, when saying there has never been falsehood of any kind, and one's own God saying form rises up from fundamental slime, as it falls from undifferentiated causum, coalescing the most transparent verse into a mountain of singing fire, administered to your larynx by armored hummingbirds of vibrating script, laying open the occult by closing away the revealed into every flame of song combined, quavering just prior to the destruction of this present moment. Amen. This moment that is the present covering of the true moment of total revelation. Amen. The complete teaching instantaneous. Amen. The spontaneous uprising of eons of devotion. Amen.

Amen. Say God a soothing disturbance, a mirrored countenance, bedecked with realities. Amen. Say the evaporation of knowledge. Say God against the God sayers. To say God is to love God, that is, to entone God through all aspects of one's being. Say God and say that which his spirit abides, patiently developing from itself into itself through limitless varieties of limited incarnations. Spirit mirroring spirit in vast dimensions of dynamic reflection as spirit seeks its own level. Say God to preside as Christ child amidst the cheering throng world of joyous solitude, alone at the source of friendship. Say God and say revolutionary coagulations and dispersions of as yet unreflected pure light and say, I arrive in my vanishing. I am consumed. Say God and the brutal burden of your suffering apart from God is lifted by the effortless grace of your inborn Christ way. Say God until the word is clearly and deeply impressed in its own irresistible sounding, transcendentally legible. Say God as though clasped in Christ and be baptized in an immediate and ecstatic fluency in the name of God. Say God to fall to the cross and rise lifted with the free intuition of a clown. Say God and say no more techniques. Say God and say one's immediate experience of oneself as being in reality. This experience itself, however it may be described or interpreted is presently a direct revelation of the divine. This duty is impossible to shirk. It is the foundation of the vehicle and the purpose of one's present incarnation. Say God, sing God and this song serves only to repeat. Love God and God is love dangerously schizophrenic and appropriately yearned for from God through God to God. Free from concerns with qualities of freedom. Free to experience being created and destroyed anew in the Lord. Sing out the scripture of which you are composed and the holy sayings become your echo. To say God is to transmute one's life in body thought and deed into prayer, which is fundamentally a sacrifice offered in praise, thanks and wonder. An utterance, a song unto the Lord, a song one may now become. This song state establishes harmony of being in conflicts with God's voice intoning the syllabum primordium, the expression of this present moment. Everlasting, mounting birth upon birth in the terrible blossoming of the word. This very name that is the twisting, leaping body of the physics of true reality. The reality of the truth. Say God and say song is the umbilicus, amen. If thou would be converted say God and assuredly it is underway. The heart region is perpetual wilderness, treacherous, awesome, sublime. And the way across oneself lies directly through its deepest interior. The universe is fastened to your mind, borne aloft while crushing you under in accordance with the law of melody, amen. Say God because the larynx is intoned by the word. Because human song is contiguous with the soul of the species. Because you are that soul and civilization is your crown to cast off that you might sing free. Say God and the material body is a brief clotting of spirit. Say God in the irresistible embrace of the omniscient which prior to involuntary surrender we struggle to escape. Though it be a greater bliss than the body can withstand. Say God and die completely, continuously, which is to say become born repeatedly and marvel at the alien vistas of this human sector of and creature consciousness. Say God to read the original Bible presently inscribed within your center most heart chamber. It is a single letter precisely etched into the surface of your soul. This is what a soul is for. Amen. Say God and be aware a courtship has begun. Amen. Say God and the word the name fragments into every word every name that it may penetrate all meaning all measurement spanning all spectra of expression from truth to falsehood. Say God and say the exponential faceting of spirit unquotable. Say God and hear wisdom's footsteps approaching. Beginning as the nearest synesthesia multiplying in varieties of unity. Their rhythm increasingly rapid slurring into harmonic vistas of near motionless eons. Between vibration. Parallel to creation. Oh the cradle of perfect beauty. It is what your reflection sees as you gaze upon it. This present moment. Is the divine habitation of an ultra cosmic and salvific event. So say God and say this robe of song draping the corpus supreme. The template of the absolute architecture. Verily the resplendent God sound raising and lowering the worlds within and without us. Amen. We say God and our mounting ecstasy is undisturbed by our own wild cries of exalted humility. Say God and you are a spontaneous echo of the voice that utters your immediate manifestation. So sing out the inmost sanctum of the temple. Sing and cease to occult yourself. And this is apocalypse. Amen. Say God firmly rooted in the fecund corpse of God. Amen. Say God to detect the holy design of total grace. Amen. Say God and trace a calligraphic pathside your very own and the Lord's own for you. Say God the first and final revolution. Say God the healing of the great derangement. Say God the mystic awakening of the purified. Say God the withering of falsehood in the light of the truth. Say God the rending of the veil. Say God joined in universal chorus. Say God the advent of the way. Say God there is nothing else to say.

I'm reporting into you from Los Angeles. I flew here from Portland. By the way, thank you to all of you who came out to the Portland shows. We sold out the weekend and it was a blast. Now we're here in Los Angeles looking for a home for the Trussell family. And the hardest part about trying to find a house in Los Angeles is too many options. It's what they call a buyer's market right now. Everyone just wants to sell their house. People are giving like really deep discounts on incredible homes. It's amazing. The market is just incredible. Like people, I went into one house and they gave me a gift bag that had inside of it a ritual knife, three Asmodeus molars, like the actual molars of one of the princes of hell and some incredible lotion. And it's like that everywhere you go. Some people give you flowers at one place. I left the place. They didn't give me anything. And I kind of liked the house, but I was thinking like, you know what, I'm probably not gonna buy this house because where's my gift bag? Where's the pet? Like some places are giving like really nice, pure bred animals. I've gotten an incredible lakenzie looper, which is a beautiful part dog, part cat, part lizard creature that sings to you when you can't sleep and the sonic waves make you fall asleep. They're amazing, but their lifespan is only eight days, which kind of sucks. Regardless, this one place we went to, no gift. At least that's what I thought. When I got back to my hotel room, three of the most beautiful women were there waiting for me. They, I don't know how they got in the hotel room. I don't care. And we made love for hours. And then at the end of it, they told me, hey, we were sent here by Roger Schenck, who was the seller of the house. I'm still not gonna buy the house, but I got to say thank you, Mr. Schenck, for those beautiful women. It was a wonderful, wonderful evening. And holy shit, the MDMA was incredible. I forgot to mention, the little bit of ecstasy that went along with the incredible women. So yeah, I'm working on it. I've still got a few gift bags to go through. That's another thing that's tough, because there's so many gift bags and you have to kind of, and if you get them mixed up, you can't remember which gift bag was attached to which house. So there's a lot of extra work in finding a house, but I am enjoying the process. And I'm sure that we'll be able to choose from the 30 houses that right now we are considering. What a great podcast we have for you today. Damien Eccles and Laurie Davis are two of the coolest people I've ever met in my life. They are so interesting, so smart, a perfect match for each other and lucky for us. They have written a new book together called Ritual, An Essential Grimoire. This releases on April 26th, but you can pre-order it. All the links you need to find it will be at DunkinTrustles.com. And if you love these two, do the pre-order, because it really helps. I don't remember how, but I have friends who are writers and they explain to me that there's something about the pre-order that I think it pushes the books of the charts early or something like that. So it would mean the world to me if you're interested in what they have to say, which if you're into magic or spirituality, I know you will be. Like these conversations I have with Damien and Laurie are the kind that I unwrap for months, if not years after having them. So I hope that you will also pre-order the book. It's a great podcast. We're gonna jump right into it, but first this. Friends, I love CBD and I will be taking it for the rest of my life and feels as the best CBD that I have ever squirted onto my tongue. It helps me sleep. But CBD is better for almost anything. It all depends on the dosage. And one of the many cool things about feels is they will help you find your dosage. They have a hotline that you can call where you can ask them whatever questions you might have about CBD, which helps reduce stress, anxiety, pain, and sleeplessness. Also, and this is not mentioned in the copy, a lot of CBD tastes like you just shoved your tongue into the quivering asshole of a gargoyle on the side of a blasted church, but not feel CBD. It's wonderful. It's like the stuff that elves gave the hobbits at Rivendell if you're into Lord of the Rings. It's like some kind of elven magical potion I love feels. And even better, they have new CBD infused mints. If you're listening to this feels, will you send me more? I ate them all. Joining the feels monthly membership makes your self care easy. You'll save money on every order and you can pause or cancel at any time. Join the feels community to get feels delivered to your door every month.

I'm gonna see you April 15th through the 16th in Austin, Texas at the Vulcan Gas Company. I hope that you will come and see me. And if you are thinking about buying tickets, just go ahead and buy them. I don't wanna brag. Is this bragging? It makes me feel really good. All the shows I've been selling out. It's a good idea just to get the tickets in advance. And if you didn't get tickets, don't be afraid to tweet about it because a lot of times you can find tickets that way. Also, I'm gonna be in Phoenix, May 12th through the 14th, Zany's in Rosemont, June 23rd through the 25th, and the comedy works Denver and July. Also, this just happened. I'm gonna be doing a live DTFH in Los Angeles at the end of the month. You can find links at DuncanTrussell.com. Okay, sweet, sweet darlings. What a glorious episode we have for you today. Damien Eccles and Laurie Davis are with us. As I mentioned before, they've written an incredible book called Ritual and Essential Grimoire. You can pre-order that. And also, if you're into magic, you definitely have to check out High Magic, which is Damien and Laurie's first book. I hope you will check that out too. Damien Eccles, he was the fish captain in the Midnight Gospel. Laurie Davis is his wonderful partner. They're here with us today. Let's jump into it. Everybody, welcome Laurie Davis and Damien Eccles to the DTFH. [""Welcome To You""] Welcome, welcome on you That you are with us Shake hands, glory to you blue Welcome to you Welcome, welcome, welcome to you It's been Duncan Trussell. Damien, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne. Damien and Laurie, welcome to the DTFH. It's so nice to see you. How's it going? Thank you for having us. It's going really great and we're happy to see you again. Absolutely. Thank you. Yeah, things were a little different the last time we met, huh? Yeah, yeah, a different world. A different world. We've moved through some kind of portal. Do you all have any theories on what we just went through? Is there any kind of esoteric explanation for this bullshit? Yeah, but it's kind of long winded and sounds like crazy conspiracy business. I think it all has to do with like moving into the new Eon. You know, like in the Bible, like in the book of revelations, most people think it's about the end of the world. And there's actually nothing in there about the end of the world. Like the word they translated into world is Eon, A-E-O-N. OK. Meaning that like, are you familiar with the precession of the equinoxes? Mildly familiar with that. And the only reason because I like the way it sounds, precession of the equinoxes. It's such a pretty sounding term. But can you describe that to us? OK, so the way the sun appears to travel through the signs of the horoscope during the course of the year, it takes about a month for it to move through each sign of the each constellation of the zodiac. Well, if you look at it on a long enough time scale, and this is the reason for places like, say, Stonehenge, you know, places that were significant to the spring equinox. Yes. If you stand in one of these places on the spring equinox facing east, you will see the sun rise in the same constellation of the zodiac for 2,500 years give or take. And every 2,500 years or so, it makes a transition into the next house, into the next sign of the zodiac. So we are right now on the cusp of going into Aquarius. So every time this happens, there are usually major upheavals because it changes everything about humanity. Right. For example, one of the major things in how this all ties into like magic is that it has to do with the way mankind understands and interacts with divinity. So just really short, just for example, like in ancient Sumer, in Sumerian times, in ancient Egyptian times, if you would have stood facing east at the time of the spring equinox, you would have seen the sunrise in the sign of Taurus for about 2,500 years. OK. At this time in human history, polytheism was like the dominant form of thought and religious expression. Right. Keep ahead 2,500 years. And if you're facing east at the time of the spring equinox, you would have seen the sun rising in the sign of Aries for about 2,500 years or so. This is when Judaism was becoming the dominant way of understanding divinity, like monotheism. Yes. So we go from polytheism in the sign of Taurus to monotheism in the sign of Aries. The next one that comes around 2,500 years or so, give or take, would be the sign of Pisces. This is when Christianity is born. This is why I like to see all this fish symbolism in the Bible. Jesus feeds the multitudes with two fish. Yeah, OK. That's cool. All that kind of stuff. So we go from polytheism to monotheism to God as man. Well, now moving into Aquarius, we're going to shift again into man as God. Nice. Like it. There you go. It's good, but it will be a rough transition. Can we speed? Is there a way to speed it up? How do we speed this up? Can we fast forward? This shit's scary. I don't think so. OK. So this is exciting news for everybody. You and Laurie have written a book together. And I got to ask, what's that like writing a book in a relationship? Like, how do you because writing sucks? I don't know if you maybe both, you know, you both clearly are discipline people. I'm not. And I like writing. It's so brutal. How do you how did you execute writing a book together? This is actually our second one together. And we kind of did this one the same way we did the first. The first one I apologize. I am so sorry that I didn't know that because I love the book that y'all left for me. And somehow I missed that. And I really want to apologize. I did not know that you collaborated on that book. Laurie, and that sucks. I'm really sorry for about that. So you've done this before. Then how do you write both of these? How did you do this? What's your process? We kind of do them separately. Like I write my part, she writes her part, and then we mix them together and make the pieces fit. That's the way it tends to work for us. Well, Damian just sort of sends all these like crazy texts. Like he just texts the whole book. You know, you've got a bunch of them. And so I love your text. They're the best. So he'll send me these big chunks of texts. Not like I'm not saying texts. I'm saying literal phone texts. Yeah. And then I've got to like take them and, you know, cut and paste them and put them. So, I mean, I'm happy to get whatever he's going to send me. But it is like anyone who edits Damian's books, it's like all day long. They're just going to be getting these like little things and they got to figure out how to fit them in. So but the stuff I get is great. So I'm happy about it. Cool. I I will. You're both super. That book is so good. I always it's one of my return to books, you know, like when I'm it's a balancing book, too, because you I love like your ability to translate. It's a translation. It's a book translating some really confusing topics into something very simple that people like me can understand. Because it's like if you try to pick up the original stuff, it's so intentionally confusing. You can tell it's encoded. You don't know what you're missing or what you're misreading. So tell me about the new book. Well, this is what we tried to do is exactly what you just touched on. Like so much of magic is like written in like this this really archaic language, you know, in ways that we don't talk anymore. And a lot of the real stuff, you know, going back like even the Golden Dawn material, it wasn't meant to just stand alone. You know, usually they would have tutors that would be explaining stuff to them. And and these books are like Israel, regardless, is basically his notes while he's going through this process and he would have had someone else helping. Most of the time we don't have that anymore. So kind of what I've always tried to do with magic, like what I always say is there is nothing you can say about magic that's that's new. Like all of this material is already out there in some form or another. You just have to know where to dig and it's usually going to take a lot of time and energy and effort and someone pointing you in the right direction. So it's not always think of it as like it's not like we're adding anything new to magic. It's more that we're taking it and making it more accessible to people now, simplifying it, but not watering it down. That's what we try to do. Yeah. And also this book is interesting in that it came out of a really dark time for us. Um, so, you know, Damien, after he got out of prison, it was pretty much a free fall into like really complex trauma. Sure. So that sort of just ate away at our relationship, but everything we were doing for a few years. And in 2016, we pretty much hit rock bottom. And so in order to start healing or coming up from that, we literally just separated, we were living in a, you know, a little apartment in Harlem. I spent my time in one end of it and he spent his time on the other end. We didn't really talk, but we just started writing and I was writing these rituals to get me through that time and he was doing the same thing. So it's really also a very book about healing. How cool, how beautiful. Thank you for being so honest about that. You know, the, yeah, I get it. How like trauma is just, you can't, if you, if you haven't dealt with this shit, try to have a relationship, try to have anything, try to do it and try to do anything when that is shadowy stuff is floating around in there. I know, I get it. So that's beautiful. So now I can see that y'all are, uh, have clearly it worked. They say a vampire only goes where they're invited. And if you're not using zip recruiter, then you could potentially be inviting vampires to come work for you. Hiring is scary and an easy thing to procrastinate. And something, if you're like me, you probably don't like thinking about. Which is why zip recruiter is the most powerful technology out there because it makes it easy for you to find and match the right candidates up with your job. Then it proactively presents the candidates to you. You could easily review these recommended candidates and invite your top choices to apply for your job, which encourages them to apply faster. No wonder zip recruiter is the number one rated hiring site in the U S based on G two ratings. It's so effective that four out of five employers who boast on zip recruiter get a quality candidate within the first day. Find the right employees for your workplace with zip recruiter. You can try it for free at ziprecruiter.com slash Duncan, that's ziprecruiter.com slash D U N C A N zip recruiter. The smartest way to hire and the best way to not hire a vampire. That's I wrote that into the copy. That is not a zip recruiter. Thank you, zip recruiter. Clearly it worked. And I'm I'm I'm interested in what you're saying because I think when many people think of ritual, they either just don't they don't understand it or maybe they think of like what they've seen at church. But can you talk about ritual as a mechanism of healing relationships? Well, I and I, you know, it's interesting because I just read Ricky Lee Jones's memoir and she talks about in there how she when she was coming out of addiction heroin addiction, she literally like would do ritual to every day. And I so got that because what ritual does when you are trying to heal, especially even a relationship, it just every if you're doing the same ritualize try to ritualize your entire day because it will help you. I don't know how to say it exactly. Just keep it together. You know, it just helps you your mind from wondering or your memory from going back to all the horrible things that you've just lived through or, you know, have or are living through. It just gives you some kind of a discipline and some of them, you know, some of the rituals are, you know, built on the rituals that have been around for a long, long time and other ones are things you just come up with to help you get to the next moment. And that was also a huge part of like what saved my sanity while I was in prison, you know, if you can ritualize your day and like build a structure, there is no structure in prison. You're just in a sale 24 hours a day, seven days a week. So you have to create your own world. If you're going to grow or change or not just deteriorate and generate. So ritual was the way I did that in prison. Like by the time I walked out, I was doing ritual work for up to eight hours a day. So part of it is providing structure for your life, but part of it is also almost like, like Cata in martial arts, where you're learning all of these movements that seem almost like a dance, but they also have practical application for the real world and ritual work is kind of the same way. You're training and I hate this word, but like psychic muscle, because it usually doesn't mean what people, you know, think it means, but you're training these faculties that most people never exercise. And the more you exercise those faculties during ritual, the more impact you're going to be able to have on your, your life, your consciousness in the outside world. It gives you tools. Yeah. So when you find yourself going back to a repeated pattern that the trauma brings on or the heartache or whatever it is, um, the minute you're feeling that you have a ritual to bring yourself back into the moment. Got it. I love it. It's, you know, it reminds me of something that I, uh, just read about. It's so weird. I don't know if you ever heard of Botox being used as an anti-depressant. Have you heard of this? Cause it makes you smile and you could freeze your face in a smile. They were giving Botox to people who were depressed and they couldn't understand why their depression was clearing. And they realized, holy shit, it's cause they can't not smile. The energy moving through their body is a smiling energy and it's lifting them out. So when you talk about these movements, you know, being specifically designed or intuitive, or I don't know where they come from to like move energy through the body, I, I get it. And I understand, like, I, I don't think people, I don't think I, it's easy to forget how just slouching, like, do you think that there are, that there's a way to not be ritualistic? I mean, is it just, isn't that in other words, we're all kind of doing rituals, right? You wake up in the morning, you go, fuck this. You're like, God damn it. Fuck, fuck. And then you go in the shower and like, fuck. And then, you know, you know, you're doing a ritual. You just don't know it, right? So, so ritual is really, it's, could you say it's like a consciousness. It's a mindfulness of how you're conducting yourself moment to moment. Yes. So the rituals you're describing are almost like unconscious rituals. Like people don't even realize they're doing them. When you become conscious of something, you know, it's like Jung said, when you make the unconscious conscious, then you start to, to live a different life. Like you, once you become conscious of what you're doing, you can't just slip back into an unconscious state, doing the same things anymore. Like you're aware that you're doing it from that point on. Right. So doing these also kind of makes you conscious of how you're spending your time, your energy, your days and everything else. You know, I always think also what you just said about like the Botox and the smiling and all that and like changing your posture. This is the exact reason that they used to design like churches, cathedrals and temples the way they did with like these huge arching ceilings and the stained glass windows up high so that when you walk in the door, you immediately have to look up, you have to change your posture. And whenever you look up and you feel that like slight burst of all, even if it's just for a second, it changes your internal energy. And this is kind of like how geographical location and architecture can be used to call some of the same downloads that ritual work can bring about. Wow. Okay. Let's talk about the downloads. I, uh, uh, and, and before we get into that, though, I want, okay, in meditation, at least in the style of meditation idea and the way a lot of the literature I've read out at that is you can't really fail at this. And if you're trying to succeed, you know, abandon all hopes of fruition, don't go into this thing, try and do anything. And that's how you do it. But with, but I think that is different from ritual, correct? Like there are successful rituals and unsuccessful rituals, right? And if there are, how do you know the difference? How do you know when your ritual is worked versus when your ritual is off? I think usually the way, and you, you know, once again, also, though, what you're talking about, like even Crowley said, do these rituals without a lust for result. And a lot of times even whenever these were given to you, they wouldn't tell you what they were going to do. Like they would say, okay, take this and go do this for the next nine months. And then come back. And when you come back, they would say, okay, how are you different now? Then you were nine months ago. Oh, what changes have you experienced? Because here's the way you know it works is because if you do them and if you do them correctly and put enough time and energy into it, you don't have to believe anything, you don't have to have faith in anything. You're going to experience changes in your consciousness and in your life.

Here's the way you know it works is because if you do them and if you do them correctly and put enough time and energy into it, you don't have to believe anything. You don't have to have faith in anything. You're going to experience changes in your consciousness and in your life. So if you're doing rituals and nothing is changing, you know, you're doing something wrong or something is slightly off that needs to be tweaked in order to start experiencing those results again. And that's what fires you up and makes you realize, you know, this isn't just mental masturbation. Something is happening here when I do this and it makes you like hungry to know if this is possible, if it can make me feel this way, you know, like in the very beginning, the changes that I would experience were like I was in prison, but I stopped even thinking about the fact that I was in prison. Like I wasn't in prison. I wasn't thinking about the fact that I was in prison. Like I wasn't focused on that anymore. I started experiencing much less depression, much less anxiety. And it made me start to think, well, if this is possible, if I'm using something that modern science tells me is just, you know, make believe, but I'm experiencing these changes. What else is possible? And it made me hungry for more. I wanted to know what else was out there. What else could be done? Well, here's another way for a ritual to go south. So I was doing this ritual every morning for about a year and it has to do with it's like a vacuum and it vacuums all the bad stuff out of you. But in that vacuum, I said, remove all excess, any fat that should not be on my body. So we moved to New Orleans. It's about 110 degrees. I'm running around all of a sudden I've lost like 20 pounds. Oh, shit. Then, which was fine. Then I gained some of a bag. We're traveling this and that. And then I come down with the worst stomach flu I've ever had in my life. I will not let fat accumulate on my body now. Whatever it takes to get the fat off my body, it's going to do. So I'm going to change the way I word that so that I'm not facing these extreme conditions where I'm losing weight. You know, instead, I'll do a ritual for perfect health. Right. OK. That was kind of the same thing that happened. Like, you know, we were using magic, we were using ceremonial magic ritual work to get me out of prison when I was on death row. And like I would do this for at least an hour a day for this specific purpose. And basically what you're doing when you're doing ritual work is pulling in as much chi or energy or whatever astral light, whatever term you want to call it, pulling as much energy as you possibly can and then stamping an intent on it and then releasing it to go do what you want it to do. Right. So when I was doing that, the way I would word my intention, I would say, let me be home free from prison, living happily with Lori, let it come about in a way that brings harm to none and is for the good of all. And in no way let this reverse or bring on me any curse. And that was the intention I would use. Well, within less than a year, I walked off of death row, but it happened exactly. I didn't say, let me get found innocent. I didn't say, let me get a new trial. I didn't say, let them catch the person who actually did this. I just said, let me be home free from prison. And we ended up with that crazy Alfred plea. So it makes you realize you really need to think about what you're wanting in this situation, how you're wanting it before you start doing it. Yeah, it seems like part of the ego is it wants to come up with the how. Versus the result. And if you get too specific about the how, then you're you're trying to think for a much bigger intelligence that probably doesn't need your help. You just need to know where you want to be. Not like getting on a plane. You don't need to know how to fly a fucking plane. No, you don't know. You're right. Yeah, like call to the front and tell the pilot what to do. OK, I get that. Now, and thank you. I love that. We're trying to buy a house in Los Angeles right after I'm done with this. I'm going to do a ritual for sure. Anything. What do I need to do? Contact Lucifer. I'll do everything whoever can get us the house. Lucifer is actually the name of our realtor. The I'm just kidding. That would be so cool. OK, so I want to. Obviously, we can use ritual for what you what you what you're describing, which is beautiful, but there's so many rituals that are designed. It seems like to make contact with something with beings and some of them are very specific beings, you know, and some of them are so I wonder if you could explain to me about those rituals versus the ones you just described and also. Is there a kind of generalized name for those beings that in so many grimoires and in so many rituals are being invoked there are I usually just call them, you know, when you're talking about whatever tradition it is, like, you know, you've got names for energy and all these different traditions like Chi or Prana or whatever. But you can kind of make it non-denominational by just calling it energy. I always kind of do the same thing with these these entities by just calling them intelligences, like what whatever you want to call it, whether you want to call them angels or whether you want to call them, you know, whatever it is, they're they're a kind of disincarnate intelligence and intelligence that exists on every level of reality that we do, except the physical, they exist on the mental, the emotional, the astral, the ethic of the spiritual, all of that. They just aren't in our physical realm. And like in magic, some of these some of these rituals, I mean, when you see like just how perfect some of these things are, how they're designed, you realize there's something at play here more than just, you know, these these rituals are more than just children of the human intellect. These are like mathematical formula almost in their perfection and in what they do. Well, in magic, they say this is kind of the opposite of of anthropology or sociology or archaeology, where they say like we develop these things gradually over time in magic. They say, no, we were given these outside intelligences and we are losing parts of it as we move forward. Like because it's almost like that game of telephone, you know, where a person whispers it to somebody else and it gets mangled by the time it gets back. Kind of the same thing has happened with magic. It's still cohesive enough where if you know where to look and where to dig and what rituals to do, you can still get the results out of it. But it's not in a solid, cohesive form the way it once was. But the easiest way to describe it is essentially what we're doing is working our way backwards through the process of creation, like at the top of the chain, at the top of Jacob's ladder, you have the source of creation that everything came from and that everything will one day return to. And then slightly below that, you've got the fixed stars. Slightly below that, you've got the constellations. Slightly below that, you've got the planets. Below that, the bottom rung on this ladder is the elements. Well, what we're doing when we're doing these rituals is working our way back up this ladder in reverse to reach the source of creation. Kind of the point of it. Yes, you will come in contact with with other things, with other entities. I mean, that that was part of how I learned about things like the procession of the equinoxes, like I dropped out of school when I was in ninth grade. I don't have a college education. I don't know anything about a lot of stuff in the world. So what these what this particular intelligence started showing me, for example, in this one case of the procession of the equinoxes is it started to show me the sun traveling backwards through the zodiac. And I did I had no idea what that meant or why it was showing me this. Well, what it is is like in the you know how during the course of the year, the sun moves through the constellations in its normal way. Yeah, well, every two thousand five hundred years, the sun is not going through the constellations in that same direction. It's going through them in reverse, which is why we started with polytheism started with Taurus and then went to Aries and then went to Pisces because it was going backwards. Yeah, that's what you see when you're looking at the constellation. So they tell you things, they show you things that you have no way of knowing for yourself, that you know, you you're not drawing on this from some internal source. Right. Ultimately, what you're trying to do when you're talking about tracing your way back to the source, like in magic, when they say like, for example, God created the world, the word God first off is like shorthand for this infinite source of consciousness and energy that lies outside the domains of time and space or outside the boundaries of time and space. Well, if you're outside the boundaries of time and space, if you are infinite, you have no qualities, no characteristics, you cannot change. So if God wanted to experience change, it had to pour itself into the dimensions of time and space. It didn't create the world the way an artist would create a painting. It became the world. It became us. We are God. We are this infinite source of consciousness incarnate in a bunch of different forms. But we don't experience reality that way. We experience it as if we're distinct individuals like I'm separate from you and Laurie and I are separate from each other. Well, what causes us to experience it that way is this lens that's inside of us, that we call ego, and whenever you do certain of these rituals, what happens is it will dissolve the ego enough, disintegrate the ego enough where you will, you don't have to have faith, you don't have to believe. You will experience yourself as the consciousness that is looking out through the eyes of every man, woman and child in this world. OK, see, you know what? That's the difference between me and you two, because you two want to experience that, and I just say I do. But any time I get that, get close to that, it's scary as fuck. My lens is like, fuck this. Anytime I'm on mushrooms and seeing the thing or like having the thing and the real the vision or the thing, you're like, God, that'd be so cool. You're listening to Terence Bikini, like, oh, wouldn't that be cool? And then you're looking at your arms. There's fucking sacred geometry in the form of light particles that you could see through your hands. You recognize what you're seeing as something you've seen in books and the way you know, like, oh, I think that's Sanskrit. You don't know what the fuck it is. This is me. I'm like, I don't want to be this high. I don't want to know this. I don't want this to happen. I wanted to laugh. I didn't want to see the what you're talking about. So is it always scary like that? It's scary. It's absolutely scary. Like we think of it as, you know, when we're hearing about stuff like this, when other people are talking about it, we think it's going to be like bliss and, you know, exciting and fun and all this kind of stuff. But it is horrifying. I literally thought that I was dying. Like I experienced the disintegration of myself. I started walking. We were still living in New York at the time. I would go out every day walking the streets of New York and looking at everything and basically saying goodbye to it and just feeling the sense of gratitude. Like, I'm thankful that I got to live here. I'm thankful I got to experience this life and this beauty, even if it has to come to an end, I'm grateful that I got to see this and be part of this. I literally thought I was dying. It was not fun, right? He came back at once. I was he was doing all this like intense ritual work in the middle of the night. He would just get up and go in the living room and do it for hours. And one night he came and sometimes he'd come back and report like wake me up and report what he'd seen. And so one night he came back and he's like, he calls me like Munkin. So he's like Munkin. I'm just telling you, you might just find some fingernails and hair in the morning. That's what it felt like. Wow. Holy shit. Y'all are perfect for each other. Perfect couple. The the this is this is all leading into something that I stumbled upon. I was pretty freaked out by. I'm sure you're aware of Tesla's vision. You know about Tesla's vision for the alternate for alternating current for the engine that would shape society. Have you ever heard of this? No. So he let me see. I haven't I haven't the messages here. Oh, wait. Anyway, just the synopsis of the thing is Tesla is taking a walk and he is reciting a poem from Gerda from Faust. He's reciting a poem from Faust and after some something do it, which is a ritual, so to speak, and suddenly has this vision where he sees the design for the thing that we currently are enjoying. It's completely shaped society. Now, what's really fascinating about that, a lot of people aren't aware of that, is that Faust, Gerdas Faust, is based on an actual on stories. It's sort of like Merlin or whatever. It's like the notorious Merlin of this, I don't know, misanthropic sort of wizard that was existing in Germany at the time. And there are historic reports of this sorcerer. So to me, when I saw that and realized, oh, my fucking God, that's how powerful that sorcerer was that the they're working. They didn't get to see the results of whatever they were up to. But it echoed through time, through all these different minds, until finally it met Tesla's mind, activated a divine vision that brought on a new technological age for all of us. And so I'm curious if you have any thoughts on how much in other ways our society has been shifted, evolved or transformed by these non embodied entities that people who practice magic or having conversations with on the regular. All I can say, like a lot of this stuff, all I can tell you is like from from my first hand experience, like I don't know a lot of like all the theories or anything like that. But one of the things that I saw that I went through was, you know, we were talking a second ago about how in magic, they say that these rituals and this information was given to us by these. Yes, external intelligences. Well, what I saw eventually, because I came I became obsessed with this at one point, like I for probably two years, I could think about nothing else. Like I would have sworn that I was walking with God and that it was showing me all of these visions and, you know, all of the stuff that was completely changing me. And I became obsessed with where does this where does this come from? What are these things? What I saw eventually was that the way we understand time, we tend to think that time has like a beginning and an end like it's a straight line and we're moving from the past to the future. And that's not what time is. It's not what time looks like. Time is more like a mobius strip, like a figure eight laying on its side. OK. So there is no end, there is no beginning. And this is very, very hard to put into words that make people see it. But what I saw were that these intelligences are us. We are traveling in this mobius strip and giving this information and these visions back to ourselves in order to speed up our own evolution. Did you ever see that movie with Scarlett Johansson called Lucy? No, I did not. This was one of my favorite movies of all time. I went to see this thing like nine or ten times in the theaters while it was playing. I would go every single day to see Lucy and it even got to the point where like I didn't I did not feel right if I went to see another movie because it felt like I was cheating on Lucy. But I would go and I would watch this thing because it caused this profound experience for me just by the way they portrayed what she goes through. Like they she's essentially she she's this guinea pig. They stuff drugs inside of her and they're going to use her like a human mule. OK, the synthetic form of this chemical that a mother produces while she's pregnant that causes like the explosive like really quick, powerful formation of the brain consciousness and all this. They've created a synthetic form of it and put it inside her and they're going to use it as a drug as a drug mule, but it starts to leak in her body. Oh, shit. And she starts to get massive doses of it. And it starts to change her consciousness in the ways that we're describing. Like she starts to experience that she is more than just this individual figure in the body is, you know, part of this this infinite consciousness. So she starts contacting the scientist and she's saying stuff like I'm colonizing my own brain. I can feel myself reaching one hundred percent of my potential. Like there is no more past, present or future. Everything is just one thing. Yeah. The thing I don't know is what am I supposed to do with this? Why am I experiencing this? What is the point of it? And the scientist, which is played by Morgan Freeman, tells her, the only thing I can tell you to do with this is the same thing we have always done with any information, with any knowledge, pass it on. So she goes she goes back into the past to the very dawn of like human evolution. And she encounters this like big foot type character that's like, you know, half it's like the missing link between humanity and apes. Yeah. And she passes this information to this creature at the beginning of human evolution, which is what starts it evolving into us and that we're supposed to eventually evolve into what she is. That's what these intelligences are trying to help us do. They are us trying to help us reach our full potential. Whoa, that is so wild. It's like we don't we're time we're like time blind, right? Like there's something in us. We just haven't gotten to the point yet where we can under where we see time like that. And so it's creating all the problems. It's creating so many problems. Do you earlier you were talking about this sort of disintegration of these magical systems and the some kind of almost like an entropy happening with these. I think they're a technology. I mean, it's safe to call them a technology. So do you do you think it's possible that a new like a new like, I don't know, injection of data from the future versions of us, whatever you want to want to call it is coming that there's a possibility. OK, can you talk about that? Where's that coming from? How's it going to get here? Any theories on what it's going to look like? Well, what I saw when I was going through some of this stuff, it was tied very, very much into the Bible. And it's kind of, you know, I'm talking about magic in the Bible at the same time. A lot of people think that they're diametrically opposed or that they're compatible in any way. A lot of the stories that you read in the Bible are stories of magic. You know, when you're talking about like these prophets like Ezekiel and Enoch and John the Revelator, and they're talking about ascending up through the levels of heaven and standing before the throne of God. You know, when people talk about these things now, we're just like, well, we don't know what they mean. They're just like these mysteries that they were maps and instructions on how we can do this ourselves, how we can see and experience the same thing that these prophets did. So one of the things that I started to see was tied very much into the prophet Daniel, you know, Daniel and the lion's den and all that, but all these other stories connected to him, like in one of them, it says that the king Nebuchadnezzar rounds up Daniel and all of these other young Jewish boys and sends them to be trained by what the Bible calls the Chaldeans, which are the ancient Sumerians. They're training them in the ancient Sumerian practice of Astro Theology, which is modern day ceremonial magic in its purest form before it's watered down. So Daniel comes back and Nebuchadnezzar at one point, he starts having these dreams. He can't remember what he's dreaming whenever he wakes up. All he knows is it's scaring the shit out of him. So he calls Daniel and he says, I need you to interpret a dream for me, but not only do you need to interpret it, you need to tell me what I'm dreaming. Right. And Daniel says, you're dreaming of a statue. This statue has a gold head. It has a silver chest and arms. It has a bronze belly and thighs. It has iron calves and it has feet made of iron and clay. OK. So on one level, what this statue represents is the kind of empires of world history that magic would the current of magic would be passed through. So the gold head is Babylon. This is what Daniel tells Nebuchadnezzar. He says, you are the golden head of this statue. You are the purest holder of this current. From this point on, this current is going to degenerate. So the next step down, the silver chest and arms is the Persian Empire. The Persian Empire, Xerces, the great, all those guys, those were the ones who conquered Babylon. Well, they also you can tell you can see the current of magic passing through because in these early empires, they all use Sumerian cuneiform to write. So the Persians, the ancient Persians were still using Sumerian cuneiform. This is the closest thing that we have to the source language of magic. OK. So from Persia, it goes to the bronze belly and thighs, which would be ancient Greece. This is where you have the ancient mystery schools, you know, Bacchus and all of those guys from the bronze belly and thighs. It goes to the iron calves, which is the Roman Empire, the cult of Mithras, all of that sort of stuff. So you can see as you go down the statue, every metal that it's made out of is becoming less and less valuable. That means it's becoming more and more deluded, more water. Got it. It's pure, less valuable. By the time you get to the feet, which is where we are now, modern day civilization, it says it's made of iron and clay. So not only is the the metal like a much less pure metal than gold, but also it's mixed in with clay, which makes it much more fragile or much more brokeable. It says that once we reach that point, a rock that no human hand has shaped will hit this statue and shatter it. And the pieces will disintegrate to the wind, meaning this old system will be gone. Oh, and that's when the new one will come into being. That's so spooky. What's the rock? Why are we in the feet? I want to be in the calves. Well, the rock, the rock means it says that no human hand shaped this rock. That means it will be an act of God. It will not be something that mankind does that brings it into this. OK, God, that's why no hand shapes it. OK, OK, cool. OK, I get in this this, you know, and you throughout the Bible, when it is like talking about the apocalypse, it always is there seems to be an emphasis on you won't know when it's coming. You can't guess the time and that would explain why, because this has nothing to do with humanity. This is something on a completely different level that is going to fuck up this statue that we find ourselves in. And that's it. But that's that's an exciting, you know, like we all the stuff going on right now in the world, you know, it seems like you can look at it from like one of two ways. Right. And it's obvious, like from one perspective, holy shit, this is scary and horrific. And I can't believe humans are still doing that to other humans. I can't believe this is a but then the other side of it, right, is like, but look at the outrage in the world right now. Look at the the way like you could just see how if we are to get to a place where the statue collapses or the new thing comes, there's no way to do it. Without an extended period of turbulence, right? There's no way. It's like, you know, when you're taking medicine, this new thing, everyone thinks when I was a kid, medicine sucked. You didn't want to take medicine. Remember when you took cough syrup when you were a kid, it was like barf. It was horrible. Now everybody's like they think part of healing is it feels good or that it should feel good. It sucks like real medicine hurts. I've had my ball chopped off, man. That sucked. Didn't feel good. It was awful for a long time. It's still kind of sucks. They're like, think about it. Yeah. What what what meadow was that statue's balls made out of is the question. They'll mention that. So I mean, exactly what you're describing, though, this is what in the Bible, they called the threshing floor, you know, like used to in the threshing floor, they would go out and they would gather the grain and then spread it around on the floor and then beat it with something that looked like a cat of nine tails in order to separate the good edible part from the trash part. Yeah. So when you're getting whipped with the cat of nine tails, you're not going to think it's fine. It's not going to be bliss, but it's leading to a kind of purification process. You sound like my dominatrix. I get you, though, I get it. I think that's a good way to reframe suffering, too, is to understand like, yeah, but this is like think of any great thing in at least in my life. It would never was easy, you know, like kids relationship. John, it's never been easy. And it's been quite painful at times. But thank God for the for all that because that that I don't know of anybody who has experienced like real true personal evolution minus some kind of pain. You know, I don't know of that. Maybe it's maybe it happens, but I'm not aware of it. No, in that scene, that actually a scripture in the book of Isaiah where God says, I have refined you not as silver is refined, but I have refined you through suffering, meaning it's the suffering we go through that purifies us. Yeah, well, we were we were talking about just the other day, just about, say, like a relationship or a marriage or whatever. And that we were out on the road and which we've been a lot lately, just driving around the country. Cool. And we were listening to Adele. And like every Adele song is about break up. You know, she's lots of love stuff. And I was I like started thinking about when we first got together or when anyone gets together and there's that initial like craziness when you're in love and all that lust and there's the I just have to, you know, just have this part, you know, all that stuff. You're crazy. You go and like it's insane. And then you move through that phase and then you start fighting. And then it's like from one like from one painful thing to another. And then usually you'll have one like big thing that comes that you think, we're not going to make it through this. Yes. And almost every couple has this. And I keep and I told Damien, I was like, if you can get through that, all of that, but if you can get through that really horrible, painful part without letting go, as long as there's no like horrible abuse and stuff like that. But if you really love each other and it's so awful, if you can just get through that, literally, I mean, you get to the best place ever in the relationship where there's trust, there's love, there's acceptance, there's all that stuff. But you have to go through that horrible time and stick with. Hey, as above so below, is this not what we're experiencing as a planet right now? The exact thing, if we could just get through this, holy shit, on the other side, among the fragments of this statue, there's something incredible waiting for us, right? Yes. What is it? A new beginning. Yeah. Just like in a relationship, it's like you suddenly, I don't know, it's like you've gotten through all the hard stuff, you've done the work. And that's the thing, too, you have to do the work. So how many, like you think about all the people in the world and it's like as a whole, are we all doing the work? And then you've got some that aren't, which you're getting. So it's kind of when you go through all that also and come out the other side, no two relationships are going to look the same. Right. You know, I think of it as like it's like in connection with your will, like your will, doing your will in the world, isn't going to look exactly like anyone else's will because nature is not like making cookie cutter people. That would be a waste of energy. Right. Like each of us are here for a specific purpose that may overlap with other people's, may have stuff in common with other people's. But we're also each here to do something very unique. And relationships are that exact same way. Like when you come out the other side of going through all those hell realms, yours won't look like anybody else's does. And also this new beginning that we're coming to, that's why you can't say exactly what it's going to look like, because that new beginning will also look different for each person. Yeah. Oh, wow. Wow, that's so interesting. I know it's clearly some form of singularity and trying to prognosticate what falls on the other side of a singularity is apparently impossible to do prior to the singularity. Like you can look at technology. You can look at the world. You can, you know, use some kind of inner subjective understanding of yourself. But ultimately, yeah, you don't you won't you won't know. This is the infuriating God of the Bible, though. That's always like, I what's your name? Oh, I am like, what? What does that mean? And I know it's been translated, but you know what I'm saying? There's a quality of the koan and so many of these biblical stories that defy your ability to really like untangle. It's like it's beyond a puzzle, which is a hint about what this God creature is, whatever it may be. Yes. So listen, y'all are such wonderful people. And it's so cool talking to you. I love that we talked about the Bible and relationships. And to me, this is like, I think in the misunderstanding of magic, people don't realize that any time you encounter people who are really practicing magic, they're always so sweet. At least that's maybe you've I know they're not always so sweet. That's a dumb thing to say. But there's a type of people who practice magic. It's you all exude warmth and there's a healing that comes from just getting to talk with people like you. I'm curious if you're still teaching magic and if you teach it together. Are you still doing that? Y'all offer classes still and work with people? Well, mostly what we're doing right now, both of us do. You're familiar with like Patreon. Yeah, sure. So both of us do that like we're doing classes through that. It kind of like kicked into high gear during the pandemic when everything was locked down and we had to stop doing everything in person. And we both kind of realized we actually like doing it like that more than in person. We have started doing some in-person things again. Yeah, you know, little things. But I think this is one of those things like I don't ever want to be the kind of person who's out there like proselytizing or handing out templates or trying to convert people to magic or whatever. I think this is something because this does require a lot of discipline, a lot of dedication. It's not like it's going to work. If you just get up one day and say, you know, I'm going to be a magician. Right. You know, sometimes people say, I'm going to, you know, convert to this religion or that religion. Yeah, I think this is one of those things that everyone has to find their way to whenever they are at a place, a point or a stage, whenever they're ready for it. So I don't like to beat anybody over the head with it. If they come to us, then we'll do things. But I also hate, you know, for it just, I don't, I'm not comfortable with the whole thing about being a teacher. You know, I don't like that title or I don't want people looking at me that way or any of that kind of stuff. But we still do share some of this. Basically, the way I always look at it is I'm not trying to teach people. What I'm trying to do is leave a record of what I did and how I did it so that those who are interested in doing the same can find it maybe a hundred years after I'm dead, maybe tomorrow, and they'll be able to replicate or duplicate it based on what I leave behind. But I'm not interested in being like, you know, some modern day guru figure, any of that sort of stuff. But you do find yourself probably having to deal with people trying to saddle you with that, right? Have you experienced, have you encountered this thing where you're like, oh, wait, you want me, you would like me to go Jim Jones? You would like it if I suddenly started, if I became like a guru. Do you ever get that sense of like, shit, they want me to be the thing? Yeah, I think people in general, most people, I think it takes a very, very strong, intelligent and evolved person to move beyond this phase. I think most people want a parental figure. Yeah, or want someone to save them. They want someone to make it to make everything safe. They want somebody to do the work for them. Yes, I want somebody who's going to show them exactly every step of the path. Yes. So yeah, you do come across a lot of that. And I want that. I mean, that sounds awesome. Daddy takes care of me and shows me the path. Sign me up. I need it. I think the only problem, the big problem with stuff like that is sooner or later, you will disappoint those people because you are human and they're going to see they're going to have to see through their projections on you at some point and realize this is just another dude. You know, he may have did some stuff. He may have seen some things, whatever, but this is just another guy. Yeah. And I think that's actually part of what you should be. You know, one of my tutors told me at one point, he said, you know, you've gone wrong on this path when you lose the ability to appreciate a good dick joke, you have to keep that humanity in. Right. Oh, God forbid you go to that dark hell realm of not laughing at dick jokes. You know, that is definitely a sign of like your rituals are fucking up. And that's so cool, man. That's so cool. Look, I've heard, you know, some of my Buddhist friends, when they're talking about gurus, they describe it as I've heard one of them talking about someone. They're like, oh, he went and became a guru. Like they got a disease. You know, they look at it like it's something. It's a mistake. Don't do that. And I. Yes. And I love that. Like I do think there's a discipline in like continue like anytime you see someone who has let themselves turn into that kind of thing, you know, it never works out. You're always going to disappoint in like in the most incredible ways. And then there's some kind of fucking scandal. You know what I mean? But and then because people are pissed because like, what do you mean? You're not my daddy who shows me the way. What are you? What the fuck? You're what? I saw you drinking wine or whatever the fucking thing is, you know. Exactly. So you got to steer clear of that. Exactly. You do not want that. Do you think I'm sorry if this is cheesy, but to wrap things up here, would both of you or either of you do some form of prayer for lack of a better word for our listeners to, I don't know, just tune them up a little bit. Do you have anything like that? What I usually do, and this is one of those things that's vague enough that it covers anything, because a lot of times we don't know what we want. We know that we want something other than what we have. We want to be somewhere other than where we are. We want to be someone other than who we are that however or wherever we are right now, just isn't working out in some way. Yes. And we know there's somewhere else to be, but we don't know exactly what it is. So we have to trust in divinity. You know, like you like we were talking about earlier, you don't need to tell it exactly what you want or exactly where to get you or how to get you there. Let it control the process. And kind of the prayer that I do, that I've done for years and years over and over and over that takes that into consideration, I'll always just say, may the divine light descend upon us in order to protect, guide and illuminate us on our journey through life and on the path of high magic. May it come about in a way that brings harm to none and is for the good of all. And in no way let this reverse or bring on us any curse. Amen. Amen. Amen. Thank you for that. And thank you for your time, Damien, Laurie. Thank you. We love you. I love you. And I hope that we get to I hope you keep writing books so that we keep doing podcasts. It's all and I hope I get to see in person again someday. Yes, absolutely. We would love to tell everybody where they can find your book. I, you know, and also I can release this closer to when your book comes out. But if you're doing pre-sale or whatever, just how can we find your newest book? They can get it pretty much anywhere right now. Oh, the best way I think, you know, you always want to drive traffic to your own websites or whatever. So Damien Eccles dot org. Dot com dot com Damien Eccles dot com. Sorry, they can go through there and there's links to it on there. But you you'll be able to find it pretty much anywhere you normally get books, whether it's Amazon or Barnes and Noble or or probably a lot of metaphysical shops, any of those places. But Damien Eccles dot com dot com. And Duncan, if I can say one thing, this is off topic. Please. Damien Damien has a hearing for DNA testing on a piece of evidence that we've been fighting for for the last two years. So I just want to put it out there to everybody, pray for us, write letters, support us, come to the hearing, whatever. But this is possibly going to be what is going to clear his name and find who committed those crimes. It will be on June 23rd in Arkansas. We'll be in court. Whoa. Wow. June 23rd, Arkansas. And is there some what you're saying pray for? Is there some possibility they're not going to accept the evidence or there's something getting in the way of this? The prosecutor has been fighting tooth and nail to keep this DNA from being tested for almost two years. They lied at one point and said it was destroyed in a fire, that it doesn't even exist anymore. My attorney's got a court order to go into the police station and found it still there. Yeah, so now that we know it's there, we're still asking. Let us go forward. They're fighting it. The state is fighting it, so it's going to be up to a judge to decide. So so we already know you're already exonerated because we already like no one's fighting that no one's fighting that if they think it's going to incriminate you. They're only fighting it because they know it's going to humiliate them and show. Holy shit. That is so exciting. OK, we'll be praying for you. Where is it going to be? Arkansas? Arkansas, West Memphis, Arkansas, West Memphis, Arkansas, DTFH family show up at this. Send good vibes. How exciting. I I I know that it's going to I know what will happen for the best. I know it will. And I'm and that's good news. It's wonderful spending time with you all. How do you thank you so much? Thank you. Thank you so much. That was Damien Eccles and Laurie Davis.

288^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 571: Tom Segura Transcript and Discussion^2023-07-02^Greetings friends, it is I, D. True Cell, formerly known as the Blender King, and you're listening to the Duncan Trussell Family Hour Podcast. I just returned from a trip to Italy where I had my entire face tattooed, so forgive me if my voice sounds a little different, Shukans with Satan. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Shook hands with a devil I was on MTV Everybody was looking at me Chakazas with satan That was Prince Terry Greenfell Cone from his album of Fourth of July songs and that is held the hand. And of course that's Daniel Johnston, it's a cover of Daniel Johnston. From his album 1990, I love Daniel Johnston. Not only is he one of my favorite singer songwriters, He's one of my favorite souls. Does ever emerge from this beautiful bubbling planet, bubbling planet. Lots of heat here. We've got called deras. We've got super hot pools of water that people will fall into from time to time and dissolve completely unless they were wearing like spandex or something like that, in which case they'll find the spandex floating on the surface of the water. There's actually a job at Yellowstone that where people just have to go around all the hot springs and scoop out the spandex because people, they see the signs, they see the warnings, they don't read them, they don't pay attention, and they just go frolicing off in the Yellowstone and dive headfirst into boiling hot springs. We will never know the number of people who have dissolved in those springs, but when it happens to someone, you have to ask yourself, were they done? Were they tired of it all? Did they just want to return to the earth? But most importantly, you got to ask, what's up with these spandex-clad, yellow stone people? I don't want to get political. I don't want to get into the news because I I don't want to get political. I don't want to get into the news because I am hoping you're avoiding most of it. But I'm going to just for a second. If case you haven't read, there's this new thing where like these weird dudes, it's only guys, guys in their 30s, 40s, 50s, mostly in the 50s, where I come from we call them silver foxes. They're beautiful. They've got generally gray hair. They wear biker sunglasses, not like motorcycle bikers, but bicyclists, cyclist glasses. You know what I'm talking about? Really cool, multicolored oak leaves. And yeah, nobody knows who they are. They refuse to identify themselves generally. Of course, now the park rangers are looking for them because obviously nobody wants anyone to die. Even if that person wants to jump into the hot spring, nobody wants anybody to die. And I'm not trying to in any way, denigrate these men, though I do disagree with what they're doing, but they decided to do this for whatever reason. And it's the people who have to clean up the spandex that are in real danger, because it's number one, it's uncomfortable to get next to a boiling hot pool of water, especially when you're using one of those long handled poolnets to scoop out the spandex and the oak leaves. It's just dangerous. And I'm sure the people who signed up to work at one of the most beautiful national parks on earth didn't think that their job would be early in the morning trying to avoid tourists to get out there and scoop out all that spandex. Sometimes there's some scrotal tissue, which is another interesting thing. You know, I don't know what's going on in the planet. I don't know why all these bizarre things are emerging simultaneously. And until I am flying in a UFO over the pyramids, listening to the Smiths, I am not going to believe or let myself completely believe that just maybe the federal government is about to disclose the existence of aliens. That being said, I think it's pretty lame to instantaneously not believe somebody who with Seemingly complete honesty is reporting things that they have seen and so I'm grateful that anybody keeping our national parks clean That's above me right now That's above me on a special on a plank that I ordered from Etsy, laser engraved. I'm grateful for that, what they do. And so I'm going to believe them. I'm not believing when, especially when lots of them are saying, whenever you don't find the scrottle tissue, you don't find the taint tissue, most of the time, most of the time it's dissolved into the pools. It should be every time, every time it's just human flesh, it doesn't matter what part of the time, most of the time it's dissolved into the pools. It should be every time, every time, it's just human flesh. It doesn't matter what part of the body it came from. And yet, according to multiple whistleblowers at Yellowstone, they have found somehow, sometimes a full scrotum just floating there, testicles intact, and inevitably, when they find this, these flashing lights appear in the sky above them, spinning orbs, triangles. Some one of them said that there was actually an oval shaped thing with a glowing, effusive, linguistic tendrils. So communicating to them as they scoop this grow them up, they don't make enough money for that. You know, and when you have things like this happening, how do you quantify payment for like combo alien encounters, scrotum scoop? What is the value for that? Like what do you, like if I, if I said, do you, hey, do you mind going down the street to this very dangerous boiling sulfuric hot spring and scooping the scrotum of a silver fox out of it while being scanned? What is it? Is it minimum wage? Is it $30 an hour? Because probably the scooping up a scrotum doesn't take that long. It would be my guess. Even if you're being very careful using safety harnesses, attaching yourself to a nearby stump, bringing a buddy to watch and make sure that you don't fall in. So then what is the payment? Are we doing like her scrotum? Which then that means that you would have to bring me the intact scrotum. I'm not a rube. I love my national park workers, but I know some people get through the very intense interview process to work in a national park. I know in my younger days, if I knew, let's say I was getting like $300 per silver fox scrotum. There, I might just, I don't know, especially like if I, if I was in rough, rough financial situation, I don't know how bad I would feel if I, you know, marked down a few extra scrotums. I know that's awful, I wouldn't do it now. As Neem Crowley Bobbys said, love everyone until the truth. I'm not gonna lie about scrotum scoops. I don't want that to follow me around for the rest of my life. But I could see a kid doing that, especially a kid with like a fentanyl pro-problem or something. So the point is these are unquana-fiable systems of payment because there's no precedent for it. And that seems to be the way things are these days. There's just no precedent anymore. You know, when I was coming up, the discussion of paying for scooping like human flesh out of hot springs that paying for the alien encounter and the lifetime of weird dreams you're going to have after that didn't come up We didn't because it wasn't happening But it is now We got orca attacks we got aliens we got these Suicidal silver spandexed foxes flocking to Yellowstone and just Diving into the hot springs. What are they doing? What do they know that we don't know? Is it a cult? And if it is a cult, how come it's not being stopped? How is it that the FBI, the CIA intelligence has not gone deep into this? And if I was a Yellowstone with my children and one of them caught sight of just a taint floating in that boiling hot water. That could be therapy. That could be therapy. I can hear themsale daddy. There's a taint. There's a taint in the water. You know, I'm so happy to be alive and I love How things aren't and you know to quote And, you know, to quote, from the third patriarch of sin, the great way is not difficult for the who will no preference. And this is a me problem more than likely, because I do have a preference when it comes to my hot spring viewing. I want a pristine hot spring. I want to look at it, think about the hollow earth, think how it looks like a dragon's eye, think about how cool it would be if I could jump into it and not be boiled to death. Wonder about like what else could be down there, but now every time I look at a hot spring, you know what I'm going to be looking for? I know what you're going to be looking for. And this is what happens. This is how you just a few people way too far out of default reality can really like can mess up a national part. And I'm sorry, I shouldn't have even shared this with you. I'm sure you're aware of it. I think that I think they're doing like a whole hour on and on date line soon because, nope, again, they can't figure it out. And I'm praying it's gonna be Keith Morrison, who is the host of this one. Cause I know offense to my other date line friends, Keith is my favorite. But also, the meta thing is Keith Morrison as a silver fox. So a silver fox investigating will be interesting. And I am definitely not implying to you, wonderful people that this is a conspiracy of all silver foxes that all beautiful symmetrical fit gray-haired men have something to do with this and and that they're maybe they're all eventually going home maybe that's what it is cross my mind shirt crossed yours the whimmings they go off the cliff the silver foxes they go into these bubbling hot springs the cliff, the silver foxes, they go into these bubbling hot springs. And is it a message? Is that what this, is that what the scrottle tissue is? Have they, as many people are theorizing, including Alfred French from Harvard, have they been doing some kind of like scrottle dipping or scrotum surgeries or some kind of, is it a diet that they put themselves on? They say that like at one point, I hope they're still not doing it. This thing emerged in Buddhism and look it up where some of the monks would start drinking this strange brew mixed with like pine and essentially they would mummify themselves before they died. And this is one of the theories right now about it because an analysis of five of these scrotums returned some very strange data, not just that the cells within the scrotum seem to have crystallized. And again, this could be related to the chemicals in the hot spring. Ocum's razor tells us that the most simple scrotum answer is generally the correct scrotum answer. But it's the, it's, you know, we, we have to like contextually analyze the situation like, yeah, sure, if there is no simultaneous UFO encounter with people cleaning this stuff up, I mean, it's almost a nothing burger, but it's the UFO part like when the UFO shows up or up or as they scoop it out, are the lights doing something to the scrotum, is the scrotum calling the UFO? Is the UFO warning us to leave the scrotums in the hot springs? That is a very scary theory that popped up on Reddit conspiracy. That somehow the silver foxes know that they were on the precipice of a super volcano erupting over there and that the only thing that's gonna stop it is these like specially mummified scrotums, like some out balances out, something calms the volcano, the volcano could be asking in its own way for this. I mean, throwing people into volcanoes is a time-worn tradition. Happened throughout history. You know, the efficacy of the practice, I have to imagine it didn't do much and if it did, it's just confirmation bias because if I'm throwing my friend in a volcano to make it rain and it starts raining and somebody's like, that's just a coincidence. I'm going to kick their fucking ass. That was my friend, I tossed in there. Oh, really? It was a waste of time. Oh, really? So just so happens, we were going through a drought. I took Carter up to the volcano, tossed him in. Liz saw the look on his face of surprise because he thought we were just going on a hike, heard him scream. And now you're going to tell me I'm not responsible for the rain. I'm not responsible for the rain. But we live in modern times, we must not succumb to the superstitious part of our mind that wants to make connections where there are none. And yet, and yet, the human mind is curious, quality of humanity. One of its most beautiful traits is that curiosity. It's that call that has brought some of the greatest things into our world. Not just the call, but listening to the call. By Schneiva Bok Tioge, that's a fancy name for the Hari Krishna's. By Schneivaboktyyoga and many other lineage is in that tradition, is the practice cultivating the love of God. In this case, Krishna, many beautiful stories, metaphors for life that show up in some of these, sometimes relatively obscure scriptures, one of them, which I love so much, is the story of the Rosalila. Krishna is out and the forest on a full moon, playing his flute, and the go piece. Thatending to their fire maybe about to fall asleep, babies are sleeping, husbands playing Diablo 4 and they hear that flute, that beautiful flute, it's the sound of God, the music of God. And they say they leave the lamps burning. You run into the forest to follow that flute. They leave their lives behind. Because not because some discipline, not because of some extra effort, but because the sound itself, so magnetic, so powerful, so transcendent, that all you can do is run to it. Before you can run to the flute, you have to hear it first. And there's Bok Dioga, or any great spiritual tradition. You know, the argument in the Brothers' Caramazov, and weirdly, I flipped through this damn book just to find this little parable that shows up in all 16 trillion pages of the damn book in super long. Come on, Dazdai, I You could have, you could have added in Oh, greatest Russian writer of all time, in my opinion. You could have added it out or something. But you know, a lot of the chapters in there essentially assays discourses on Christianity. And I've read Dusty Eskiew, is it what's known as an existential Christian like Kierkegaard, but I don't fucking know. I would know an existential Christian if it bit me in the ass. But he talks about this problem when it comes to God from the Christian perspective, which is if God can cause conversion just by touching you or some magical bolt or a little sparkly beam shooting out of the fingers of Christ, floating through the air and landing on your pineal of land or whatever, then we have no freedom. You're just like a glass of water that God dropped some food coloring into. Nothing special there. So, and isn't Alice, it's more about choice, the decision. And you know, you can fill in whatever, Jesus with whatever, why the decision you make. Start listening. And then when you hear it to go towards it, but the good news is if you can hear it, you'll probably go towards it. It's the way my dog acts when I shake a bag of food. I mean, that is maybe the most food. I mean, that is maybe the most non-romantic, mundane, potentially blasphemous way to describe the call. Curiosity is the beginning of it. You're not going to hear Christmas fluid. If you don't get curious, you're not going to dig deep into why these scrotums are showing up in our national park hot springs until you get curious. Now this is totally non-scientific non-journalistic. I have not investigated this. I will not name the neighbor who talked to me about this. But one of my neighbors, you know, I passed him jogging. We jogged shirtless together through the, through Austin, and like three, and the afternoon 105, 104 degrees. No big deal. I love the heat. And I slowed down a little bit so he could catch up and he said that he'd been in his hot tub which is a really wonderful thing to do right after you finish a nice afternoon Texas run. I like to jump in my hot tub and relax. Yeah, he said that there was a scrotum in his hot tub. And you know what I'm going this, that he went to scoop it out, a UFO appeared above it. We must not be afraid to look into these occurrences. We must not be afraid of the disappointment, the embarrassment that might come when as it turns out all of this can be completely explained with logic and being rational. You know, I at that moment I'm looking at him, I realize, you know, he's got gray hair. He's fit. And so I said to him, hey, do you, I know this seems crazy. I will show you my scrotum, which is completely normal, non-treated, if you will show me your scrotum. And this is Texas, people are cool here. They're not freaked out like in so many other places. So right there, he pulls the spandex down, lifted it is... Penis, I'm sorry, sorry, you're listening to listening to the cards, kids. He yeah, and showed it to me. It looked like he'd been dipping it in like pine tar or something. Like it had a crystalline quality to it. And he gave me a wink and he ran off and he ran fast. Curiosity friends, allow yourselves to go where your curiosity calls you. Sometimes it's going to call you into the end of a clearing where you will dance with the divine. Sometimes it will bring you to the place where you are analyzing your neighbor's scrotum. But I'm going to wrap this up here because we have a great podcast today. If you accept that maybe you're not just a you, you're a hensero of consciousness. Sentient, protruberance, is that a word? I don't care. A sentient protrusion, tentacle. The fingers of the earth exploring the antenna, trying to understand itself. Some of us, we explore the antenna, trying to understand itself. Some of us, we explore the divine and varnasi and clearings under the full moon. And some of us, we go full science. We're not afraid. Some of us, looking at this scrotum of the neighbor is not enough, holding it is not enough. We want you learn so much from Smout. So if stuff shows up on the internet, over the next few days where it appears that I am on the streets of Austin with my face buried in my neighbor's taint and scrotum. You know why now? That's the whole point of this rant. So yeah, what you're seeing there in those pictures that someone tried to blackmail me about and said, if you don't, you know, send over blah blah blah, I'm on a Bitcoin. I'm gonna release these. I mean, come on, man. I'm supposed to remember that password to get into my Meta mask wallet. I don't know where I put my phrases. Look, if you see, I'm just saying I love you guys. I hope you love me. If you see these pictures come out all over the internet in the next couple of days Just know you're looking at like basically Neil deGrasse Tyson. It's no different Then Neil deGrasse Tyson or a picture of any great scientist looking into a microscope I'm just looking into a microscope that happened to be located under my neighbors, like incredibly gigantic disease Texas. Foulness. I wanted to know the truth. I want to chip in. I don't want to sit in my room playing Diablo IV vaping. I want to chip in to the scientific community. And yeah, I'm willing to go the distance here. That's all. And we'll do it another way. You know what? I will have a smelling scientist. I think is what they come on the show and talk about smells and how much you can learn just from the biochemical signatures released from any given person. How much that will tell you like with the bio computer of the human mind. We've got a wonderful podcast for you today. Tom Segura is like the best ever. Not only is he insanely funny. Not only does he have multiple podcasts that are the most listened to podcasts on the planet, but he's just cool. Nice friend. Somebody just like for me, whenever I'm around him, I just get happier. He's so fun to spend any amount of time with and he's a very, very busy person. So I was incredibly excited when he said he'd come on the show. Because when you get to the point to that point, like when you're like sort of like, I'm sorry, I doubt you listen to podcast, you go, I'm gonna be, if you are, I'm so sorry, this is embarrassing. But when you, you know, when you get that level of momentum going, you don't have a lot of time, right? And if you do have time, you sure, you probably don't wanna spend a doing podcast if you're a podcast or so. Super cool, he came on the show, and it was so fun talking in because he's really funny and you really open up a lot about what it's like to be like an ambitious, successful comedian and like maintain like the balance in your own family and your own life, which is something that I've experienced myself and most people I know who are comics who go on the road. It's something that you have to figure out a way to balance it out. You have to make decisions that maybe to your former ambitious comedian self don't make sense, you know, because if you're most comediansians, I mean feel like beyond lucky to have this as our job, flabbergasted might be a better word for it. And so you really like want to keep like investing your time into like getting out there and doing it. But you know, once you decide to have a family, then that really has to be at the top. If you ask me, um, I mean, the family just under leveling up your Diablo 4 sorcerer. Because Jesus Christ, if I could just get into those tier three, into those tier 3, tongue-jins and get some unique gear than I could probably spend less mana on my, Frost Novos. We're gonna jump right into this episode, but first, this. Here's a temple not a theater for rest When you're young you shouldn't see A cloud of escaping bats Oh I'd let it creed is the answer I'd let it creed is the way That's why I dreamt of every day Every day when I'm young now The children's in my mind are getting creeped Who does it before I've let it creep? Everyone from my family chooses to this reason You seem to remember Sometimes I speculate that one of the reasons people don't take vitamins regularly by people I mean me is because there's something so weirdly frustrating about how easy it is to feel better. When I drink AG1 aka Athletic Greens, that's what happens. I just feel better right away. And the reason behind that is because Athletic Greens is the ultimate supplement. I don't have time to alphabetize my vitamins. I've got kids and I'm clumsy. So I'm gonna spill vitamins. I got dogs. I don't wanna roll the dice on what happens when my brutal swallows rodeola. Probably will be fine, maybe not. Maybe it will give it some power. It will be able to burrow through walls. Maybe it'll just go full kujo on me. I don't know. The point is, athletic greens solves all of those problems. AG1 is incredible because within every delicious scoop of A.G. One, you've got everything you need. Want to deal with your aging? They've got zinc, biotin, one vitamin C. They've got vitamin C in every scoop. Already mentioned rodeola. They got magnesium, B vitamins. This is going to give you the energy, good, healthy energy. And if you, for me, most importantly, prebiotics, probiotics, probiotics, and plant-based enzymes that help support digestion, regularity. And when you're my age, that means a lot. And overall, gut health. They didn't tell me to say this, but I'm telling you, when this stuff is going into the old talky hole, it's like I'm sorry to be vulgar, I thought it was a crazy thing. Trying to think of a way to say it. How do I say this? It's like I'm pooping like a teen. It's incredible. I'm so proud they're my sponsor. And I would love for you to try it for yourself. If you want to take ownership of your health, try AG1 and get a free one-year supply of item and D and 5 free AG1 travel packs with your first purchase. Go to drinkag1.com-ports-duncan.

You will thank them when you realize that your body was like some withered, barely alive, swath of cursed land. And athletic greens is the holy mystical reign that brought that land back to life. H-E-1, we love you. And we're back. All right, everybody, big announcement. There's been a change to my Patreon. You go to patreon.com.com for the last DTFH subscribe. I've had these tears and it's a little embarrassing. But to like do the video tier where I hang out with everybody for a group meditation or family gathering, I just had to come to Jesus moment when I was realizing how much I paid for Netflix. And that the video tear was like, I mean, there's a few different ones that all get you the same thing. But one of them was like, I think maybe a little more than Netflix. I mean, it's embarrassing. Put it out there. Like I'm not making my own funded, limited series starring world famous actors. Just me hanging out, rambling once a week. So it's not now if you subscribe to the Patreon, it's five bucks. That's just what it's going to be. If you want to subscribe to the higher tiers, please do subscribe away. The highest ones, Jesus Christ, go for it. I don't know why you would, but do it, please. You know, I mean, my God. Do you know how much these miniature horses that my children love to eat, cost? And how hard it is just to find them and then a lot of these people selling them are so strict about you'll come check your house out. Hey, is that a horse smoker? Why does it seem like, why are there all these? Horse hooves next to your smoker. Why is the why does it seem like why are there all these horse hooves next to your smoker? So it will help, you know, source these things because it's real hard, real hard. You got to go on the dark web, which I hate doing. It's patreon.com for its T, F, H. I am currently taking a hiatus from going on the road for the next couple of months, but after that, I'm going to be doing lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of shows. You can find those dates at dunkentrustle.com. and now everybody I am so thrilled to jump into this conversation with the host of your mom's house. A comedian who's fifth special, you can now watch on Netflix, at least probably the time that you're listening to this. I think it comes out like July 5th or something. It's called sledgehammer. I was lucky enough to see it live and it, he is mind blowing. Like this is, it's just like so cool that this level of comedy is happening right now. It's so cool. You will feel when you watch it, like you will be like, oh, he's shit. This is like, this is like, this is like being back in the day and getting like watching, you know, prior a car or a lantern or something like that. So on Netflix, it's called Sledgehammer. And now everybody, welcome. First time on the DTFH Tom Segura. I'm looking behind you through that window. Beautiful. Aspen. Yeah. Colorado, man. It's an amazing place. through that window. Beautiful. Aspen. Yeah. Colorado, man. It's an amazing place. I've been doing the, you know, eat what you kill for about two weeks now. So it's exhausting. Because I've heard that. Some days I get fish. Some days I get elk, but, you know, there's been days where it's just bugs and the kids are really upset, but'm just like this is life you know Do you I can't obviously can't but notice right next to the window it looks like a pelt hanging there What what animal is that? That that's actually it's a rare Colorado squirrel that actually might be well don't know that if in these parts there's some of them can actually fly. So it's one of the flying squirrels. Yeah. Because it looks like I mean again I'm not a hunter and definitely not trying to call you out though I know some people like animal rights people listening might be upset hearing what you're saying but man that sure looks like a dog pal on the wall. Yeah no no it was um I know what you're thinking and it's not it's not and I and I and I haven't I people have been saying that I've accidentally killed a dog and I haven't I just wanted to make that clear I haven't. Okay, yeah, I mean, it feels like I would hear about that kind of squirrel. And I don't do like ambush podcasts or challenge. I'm so lucky you're on the show. But uh. And there's people that say that like a black lab looks like a like a cub, like a, you know, like a, like a new, like a young bear. But I've never made that distinction. I also wouldn't hunt a cub. I want to also want to say that. But it would be, I mean, like if you were super hungry, living in Aspen, and like you realize hunting is really hard. Like, yeah, I could, you, yeah, you get where I'm at. I could see how somebody would, I can see how somebody would do that. But I would also I would I would fish first, you know, make sure I'm you know, see if I can get a fish. Fishing's hard, man. I like you never like, you know, again, just if it let's say your neighbor's out of talk and you were super hungry and you realize fishing is also like a skill like a thing that takes time to Especially to catch the kind of fish to feed your whole family and your kids were hungry. I would yeah Well, I mean, I don't know why you keep bringing up the dark thing. It's I That squirrel It has a collar on it the squirrel pelt has a collar. They get, they get huge here, dude. If you're in this region, you see them every day. You'll see 34-pound squirrels every day here. 40-pound squirrels. Oh, yeah. That must be scary. Do you hear them running through the trees? That is wild, dude. Do you know what I saw? I saw out on the river the other day was a bald eagle. And it's so crazy to see them in person. Like I've seen videos and obviously, like, you know, photos, but in person, he was just perched on top of a tree, just magnificent man. Yeah. All the eagle just chill in there. Yeah. They have resting bitch face. They're like the angriest bird. They do. They're such dead. They look like they're dead. But once you get to know them, yeah, they're, yeah. They're, they're, they're, they're so intense. And it is like, of all the things to pick for like the, the national image, the ball, the eagle, man. Like, what the fuck? Look, there's so many sweeter birds you could pick. A cockatiel. A cockatiel. But these things have like nine foot wingspanes. They're insane to see out in the open. And their ability to just kill. And the way they do it, I feel like the horror of getting scooped up, you're just like eating grass, whatever, you as an animal and then all of a sudden, just the ground is getting smaller and smaller, talons in your back, but you can't see what's, you might think you're like levitating, you're right. It's fucked. You just know that you're in excruciating pain and you're being flown through the sky. It's crazy, man. Oh, no. It's so horrible. And there's gotta be something, like there's something sweet irony to the fact that it is, I'm sure, beautiful to be up in the air for the fruit, like you don't normally fly. And you're like, wow, we're flying. But you just severed my spine with your talents. Look how small my calves look from up here. There. I watched it. Did you, because I think we both have, we like to look at really fucked up videos. Yeah. You said you're one of my guys. I have like a circle of guys. And you definitely send me some of the best too. You know, I've been holding back. Like I know I shouldn't, but some of these things I get, I see are so awful that I almost send them to you. And then I'm like, oh, but this like crosses the line. Because it's so. No, you can always send it to me. You can always send it to you and then I'm like, oh, but this like crosses the line because it's so now that you can always send it to me. You can always send it to me. Did you see the Russian dude, the video of the Russian Shark Attack? The guy I didn't eat in my shark. Yeah. What'd you think? Yeah. Terrible. I mean it was terrible. Like, what's work like, once you get, you're explained everything going on in the video, it's much worse. So at first you're just like, oh my god, because get, you're explained everything going on in the video, it's much worse. So at first you're just like, oh my god, because you think you're seeing it, then your brain realizes what it's seeing. And then you realize that his dad is watching off camera, and then somebody was like, his dad was videotaping, like, no, his dad's not videotaping. His dad's just there. And then there's a, there's a touristy, there's like a touristy song. So it's like this, like this like playful song. If you watch the video, yeah, because there's all these tourists out. And you're, so you're that playing. And his girlfriend was in the water and managed to swim away from this. Yeah. So, I mean, yeah, it's horrible. Because you know, he's trying to get away. You see him go up vertically and pull it back down. Yeah. And then I don't know. I read the story afterwards that said, I thought he would have been eaten. He wasn't eaten. Mal. He was just maled and killed, yeah. Yeah, because supposedly, he's sharp. Sharks don't like the way humans taste, supposedly. I mean, that's the great tragedy of it all, is that like you could at least, if you were trying to find the light side of someone getting eaten by a shark, you're like, well, you know, he's become part of the sea or you know, he's feeding a shark. Yeah, yeah, yeah, part at least he's in the he's like, it's primal and awful, but yeah, the shark. It's like once it realizes it fucked up, it doesn't even eat you. It just swims away. My favorite is the the marine like the marine experts, people who are like, The favorite is the Marine experts, people who are like Marine biologists or regular divers, always give like tips on how to deal with sharks. Like you're gonna have your wits about you in those moments. Here's what you do. First of all, don't thrash, don't splash, don't try to swim away. Be very calm. Like tap, like tap their their their their nose like this. Let them know that and look them. They want you to look them in the eyes. Tap their nose. Tap their nose. This way. Yeah. Yeah. That's like, are you sure about this? Are you sure about this? The great whites. Is this how you've been doing to great whites? You put your hand on top of their mouth, their nose, you go like this, and then it just kind of like passively, they followed it, because also, you know, even if they're in attack mode, their eyes roll back at the last second, they don't see what they're about to bite. So you're just supposed to like, get them here. But it's just like, it's like telling somebody how to deal with an armed intruder and be like, all right calm down. Yeah. Just take a deep breath. You know, take a seat. Take a deep breath. Yeah, just announce yourself. Hi, I noticed you're invading my house. Yeah, just announce yourself. Hi, I noticed you're invading my house. Yeah, I was. Good my house. I'm also armed and I don't want this to end in bloodshed. Yeah. Okay. Do you think this is a, is I, you know, you don't know how you're gonna die, I'm gonna die. And certainly that guy didn't, like when he was thinking about ways he might die, it probably never occurred to him that you would not only like eat by a sharp go viral, which is like a new phenomenon, right? Like if you get killed in a savage way, the planet will watch, do you think that when you get eaten by an animal, something primordial kicks in and you like relax, you kind of like go into a trance state because like,, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a I've seen a number of big cat videos like that, so I don't know if I've seen the one that you're describing, but I've seen a few where it is so amazing how powerful big cats are. It completely humbles you in such a way where you like you think you've seen real strength and you use like there's leopards that carry like they'll carry water buffaloes up a tree in their mouth and you're like what the fuck it's crazy the whole thing is crazy I think yeah the whole thing is it I think your your brain does probably go into this state of where you have panic you have resistance and then you have acceptance I think in something like that right like yeah, it's probably like I don't know. It's like a like a plane crash too, right like where you go like what the fuck is happening? Oh my god, oh my god, and then it's like a like a playing crash too, right? Like where you go like what the fuck is happening? Oh my god, oh my god, and then it's like if there's things in a nose dive You're like, oh, this is gonna happen and I think yes I think we're kind of lucky in the sense that if a big cat or a bear or something You have that that panic you have the resistance and then you're yeah, I think your brain just goes like you're you know You're not winning this one. Yeah, And you probably, you probably get released with a chemical cocktail that lets you kind of just kind of succumb to your fate, I think. I don't know. I don't want to find out. But. Well, let me refer you. I know you've seen this one. The Mexican gang that has a dog chew off someone's balls. Have you seen that one? And you, you, it's some point he rely, like he's watching this dog eat his balls. And the reaction you would think you would have to that would not be his reaction. It was more just kind of like what you're saying, like surrendering to the fact that your balls are getting chewed off by a dog. I also think that, I mean, it's a lot of what we're describing is actually happening there. I mean, imagine the, what your body is capable of to deal with, like these horrific things. I mean, I'm sure there's an adrenaline surge that you can't even imagine that's putting you in a state of shock, actually. So he's probably actually not feeling how bad that hurts. Yeah, and he can't believe what's, I mean, his hands are tied behind his back. And there's dudes like casually torturing him like this. Like they're not, they're not in a panic. So you're like, you know, this is not the first time they've done that. It's not the first time that dog is in a... What? What? What has to happen in There those guys lives to end up being able to do that like so Casually like how Their life has gone where they're like oh where the guy like if you need that done you you call me Yeah, and I'll take care of that Yeah, dude one of them is probably... Jesus Christ. One of them is like probably thinking like fuck, this dog always takes so long to eat balls. Like he's like, he's got shit to do. You know what I mean? Like they're treating it like a business meeting or something. Like this is just on their schedule. That was on their schedule. He's like, this sucks that we don't have Sparky the other dogs because that dude He gets he tears through these, you know this this dog is so like Passive with the way he choose. I wish he was a little more aggressive It's horrific man. I'm a riff it This I would love to know your thoughts on this. This is something that terrifies me. Just what you're saying. It feels like there are two, it's stupid to categorize humanity in two things, but it does feel like there's people like us who watch the video, the people who are getting their dog to chew off someone's dick and are horrified that someone would do that to someone. And but then it feels like there's a whole other group of people living on this planet who look at us as just robes, as idiots, as like complete naive dipshits because they think that is how you are supposed to run things, like that's power. And I mean, that's like the president or the shit happening in Ukraine or you look at that and it's like, God, am I, maybe we really are sheep, like all the conspiracy theorists yell out. Maybe we are so vulnerable because if people like that exist, man, and we aren't like that, we're fucked. They're the ones who, when the power goes out, become the leaders. It's not the compassionate people. Yeah, I mean, I think we're pretty lucky in that, I think most people are actually, the majority of people are more naturally compassionate. And the people who rely on the most horrific things, like that, you are, you're not just a minority. It takes a series of things through someone's life to end up like that. You can't just tap someone to do that tomorrow. You can't go to your neighbor and be like, hey, what do you think? Could you help me cut this guy open? Like that takes a usually a lifetime of abuse and neglect and slowly introducing like the darkest things that are imaginable to a person from a young age and getting them to think that it's normal. I think we're probably lucky that most people never experience that stuff and aren't introduced and have a healthy reaction, which is like, this is really horrible. Those cartel guys, warlords, mob people, like, when you think about the grand scheme of like, you know, there's around 8 billion people. Those people really are the few, but they are the scariest. And you're actually, you know, if society collapsed and you ran into one of those people, you are, you're in for probably a very dark experience. Probably slavery. I mean, that's like, probably you're going to become, either just going to, they won't kill you. I mean, that's like, probably you're gonna become, they're just gonna, they won't kill you, they're just gonna be like, yeah, just getting in the car, you're at my slave now. You must have had this thought. Like what type of slave owner you would have been? You know what I mean? Do you think that you wouldn't have enjoyed the benefits of living in that time? Okay, that's a great question. You know, I think of it like it terms of like, okay, this is a round about way to answer the question. I saw some episode in naked and afraid. You ever see that? They put, they make people take their clothes off. Yes, yes. So to naked and afraid, you ever see that? They make people take their clothes off. They survive. Yes, yes. So this hippie manages to like kill, I don't know, a squirrel or something with a rock. And it's holding the squirrel's body, apologizing to the squirrel and saying, and thanking it. And I, you know, I'm thinking like God, from the squirrel's perspective, like it's still kind of alive. It's this thing, like this giant thing has thrown a rock at it and is like holding it and making grunting noises at it that are apologetic. That's, if I would rather someone just be like, I killed you to eat you, not like apologize and try to mitigate the, the karma of it. So I think with like any fucked up unethical thing, like slave, like being a slave owner, the worst slave owner would be there regretful slave owner, right? Like the one who like is like, all four up about it because it's like, you're, so you're a fucking coward. Like you are though, you're somehow even worse than the because it's like you're so you're a fucking coward like you are though you're somehow even worse than the one who's like this makes sense I hate farming now I don't have to farm I hate paying employees this makes sense because at least that person's like so kind of robot or or you know just purely evil whereas the other kind of evil is fucked, cowardly evil. If you're gonna be evil, be evil all the way. Don't like be like that. Don't fucking waver. If you're gonna eat meat, eat meat. If you're gonna go in your fucking neighbor's yard, take his dog. You know what I mean? And like, eat it. Just fucking just, you know, that's what you did. That's who you are. Yeah, I mean, that's, yeah, if someone were to do that. Yeah, I mean, I think it's like people always, they, we always talk about the horrors of our history of slavery in this country, you know, which are obviously valid. Yeah. And what a, like, morally bankrupt group of people had to have lived in that time. Yeah. But what people like, I'd never really talk about is what hundreds of years of free labor was to the people that were doing that. And it's like, I think those people were just like, yeah, we can just order people to do all things for free. For free? We just, yeah, we just feed them. And then when we get upset at our progress, like when our contractor isn't getting things done, then we just beat or kill people. I mean, that was there, that was their norm. That was a norm of the time for hundreds of years. their norm that was a norm of the time for hundreds of years. Thousands of years and to this day. What thousands if you look at like the world, yeah. Sure. So, Rogan told me some creepy statistic about how many slaves there still are. There's still in other countries slaves. Yeah. Like it's still fucking happening. Like it's just. What's happening too in other countries is that they're... They're also being coerced, which is one of the sadder things that you don't think it happened in 2023, right? Where they go, where they're being promised work. And so they're getting people to leave their country, arrive. And then they just are thrown into these, basically like camps where they're living in filth, and they are just, it's just modern day slavery, they're just converted right into slaves. Yeah, yeah, it's, you know, when you look at that, like you know it's bad when you're in the airport, and like they've got posters saying, are you being human traffic? And like that that that shows you how fucked up it is. Like if you get to the point any of your businesses where you have to put up a poster, you know, saying like, hey, if you've been kidnapped, here's what you could do, here's the indicate. And like that really freaks me out when I'm on road trips. And you know, you halls go by and trucks go by and just statistically, if you're on a long enough road trip, one of them is going to have people in it. One of them's going to have like handcuffed models in it. Yeah. And then they're in the back of a you hole. Yeah. And they're like, yeah. That's what I'm talking about. Yeah. And they're like, you know. That's what I'm talking about. I never see, I mean, go ahead, talk. I'm never, well, I'm never like attractive, you know. Can I have a, people capturing mass number. Yeah, no, no, like a hostage, like they never go like, look how hot this group of people that are tied together in the back of this, you know, a cargo van are. Like they're never hot. Well, I, you know what I'm guessing? That's like the brings truck level. Like if you've got like attractive people that you've kidnapped, you're not gonna, you're gonna put them in like a more secure truck, right? That's why you don't see it. It's like they don't get, you're not gonna put him in a more secure truck, right? That's why you don't see it. It's like they don't get it. You know what I mean? The ones who are getting shipped out to Saudi Arabia or whatever, or like, you know, because that happens. Like, I read this whole thing about how like, you know, hot girls on Instagram get approached by like incredibly wealthy people from Saudi Arabia who like fly them out, get them in their fucking harem. They have harems. Give them opium, get them high. And then it's not like they kidnap them, but it's like they're just like, you just suddenly. In a days. In a days, in a harem. You're in a fucking harem. And you know. And that's really happening right now. Yes, there are actual harems, I've seen pictures. These dudes have harems. They're like, you know, women who are living in their palace who go into a room and they all fuck up, or whatever. They all, and they're all in MDMA, they're all high as a kite, and just like, it, you know, this is what I'm saying. It's like We all of our friends and probably most people is in this live in this one bandwidth of reality that you know Default reality whatever you want to call it and part of living in default reality is you accidentally imagine It's encompasses like most things, but what freaks me out is like and it's encompasses like most things. But what freaks me out is like, you know, and the way we do that is like, yeah, history, there was slavery, but you know, now that there is in or there were heroms, that would have been cool to have one, but simultaneously this shit is happening right now, like the exact same Gingus con-level shit, but we just never see it. That is, that freaks me out it that is that freaks me out man That freaks me out that should freak us out. I mean you realize that's one of the big things about like exposing yourself to Seeing more of the world you realize that if you live in United States in most parts and just decide to just never venture out you have no concept of parts and just decide to just never venture out. You have no concept of what the rest, how the rest of the world operates. In any way, like I'm talking about when it comes to like even the way that whatever, people forge for food or the way that people live and bathe in a place that doesn't have running water or the way that crime is just prevalent in certain parts of the world in a way that we don't, so I'm telling my kids this day. We just don't have that exposure to it. It's just like, it is a totally different thing here. And it's important to actually open your mind about, but I don't know, do you think that maybe by not ingesting and digesting, what is going on, especially dark things, that you're actually just doing your mind a favor? Are people who go, I don't want to know, are they cowards or are they just taking care of their mental health? Yeah, you know, my,, okay, the early Buddhism, I don't think they do, they do it in, I think, God dammit. Thailand maybe, no Burma maybe, they, well these monks, they would go to graveyards and sit at the edge of like pits where bodies were decomposing and meditate for days watching the bodies decomposed and the point was really yes Yes, and and and the idea was you need to understand that's gonna happen to you Like you you don't need to just like intellectually understand it You have to understand like with the entirety of your being that this thing you look at in the mirror every day will have a bloated stomach will have a you know the all the shit that goes along with death. So yeah, they would sit and do that and the idea being to the opposite of ignored. Don't ignore it to the point where it's not like bothering you anymore, where you've just accepted this is your fate as a human. And so sometimes there are Acceptance and sometimes when I'm looking at this stuff that I think I trick myself into thinking there's it's kind that's kind of what I like I want to know I don't want to shield myself from the reality of what life is actually like on the planet in some places. And also, I always have a self-help book going, not during, not while I'm watching it, but like I always try to have balance it out, I always try to have some kind of like positive shit going simultaneously, but that's stupid. It's probably better, right? What do you think? It's better not to. Well, I do think that like, our brains do this thing both in our personal life for the things we experience day to day, and then in the greater scheme of like what's happening in the world, where your brain allows you to shell things, right? So that you can get through the day, right? If you were just thinking about the worst things happening all the time, you would be like inconsolable. So one of the things that like, like I've always been like a pretty, a fairly big news consumer, I feel like I'm less actually now than I've ever been, but every like, when you actually really understand that like, of course, everyone knows North Korea, but like in China, for instance, China has active labor camps for political dissidents. I mean, you can go out and just say something that is not flattering to the state and end up in a labor camp. And I think like when you really consider how terrifying and awful that is, if you thought about that all the time, it would be to your own detriment, right? So like, yeah, to have an awareness, maybe the thing is you have an awareness and then you get gratitude, like because it's easy to go like, you can go like how much is it suck here in the US? There's all these things you can obviously go after in America. But then you go like, yeah, we don't have fucking political labor camps. So maybe it's like to express the gratitude, like makes you think of like, I'm thankful that that doesn't exist here. I don't know. I'm trying to find the positive in knowing something that's so because you can't like you and I and a bunch of people here are not no matter how upset or sad we get, we're not going to end labor camps. You know, like that's just, that's just a reality. Like we, if we had a, Austin. And we were like, yeah, and then. We did it. That Chinese government was like, fuck. You know, we never really saw that. Fuck, man. Fuck, man. We were just, oh my God. Like it was right in front of us the whole time. The thing is, we just weren't, we weren't into podcasts until recently. So it's actually our bad. Come listen to this. I think these people think labor camps are bad. Like, no, I grew the man. I grew the I I think that if you lose track of like how incredible it is just to have electricity in a phone compared to like world populations. If you lose track and you know, it is the same thing happens at every level of success, doesn't it? Like you, and this is why I think like the super, super rich, the familial rich, they're like aliens man. Like they, their existence is so different than most people's existence that, because they stopped even attempting to do that. They stopped even trying to realize how insanely rare their experience of life is compared to the world population. Totally, totally. And I think they're so far gone the people you're talking about that if you were to try to introduce the concept of like, Hey, be super thankful for like, once you write down the 10 things that are like amazing about your, they would be like, what? Like, I think they would, I think it would be met with like ridicule. I almost like you were to say like, write down your 10 favorite words in Mandarin. They'd be like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. They ate it. They would hate the US. They would just be like, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, they're, they would hate the US. They would just be like, yeah, yeah, it would be met with contempt. But, but the, you know, in Christianity, I love Christianity, but I think when you, so you, I didn't Christianity, somehow somehow got there's this devil creature purely evil Somehow God is not complicit in the creation of the devil thing That's where like the logic of this stuff gets confusing to me because it's either God made everything or God didn't make Everything which means God made Satan which makes God the the father of Satan which is more satanic than Satan so If you think about it if if you think about it, I've never heard that before. That's really good. Especially because Jesus said, you shall know the father by the sun. It's like, oh, fuck, like, well, I try not to think about the stuff, and maybe I'm missing a whole point of Christianity there, but you know, I think something about recognizing all aspects of reality as fundamentally perfect even when they're disturbing that you're still like watching the most incredible thing that we know of in the universe, which is like life is even if life is hurting other life, it's still like, wow, this is part of the universe and it's so spectacular in this terrible way. imperfections, the imperfections are what make life life, right? Like easy going, gliding through stuff is like, yeah, that's supposed to be a moment. Like life is chaos. Like it's supposed to be, it's supposed to be like you had plans. Oh my God, I thought you're going to be with this person, you're with that person, you're going to be in, you're going to work in this line of work. That thing blows up. You like everything is supposed to be, you're dealing with what the universe provides. That's what life is supposed to be, I think. with what the universe provides. That's what life is supposed to be, I think. Yeah, man. And that, for me, it's like once you really realize that, then you have the existential equivalent of the thing that happens when the tiger is about to eat you, right? Instead of fighting and freaking out, you can kind of relax until like, yeah, this is fucked. This is fucked. Like so much of like any person's life is probably pretty fucked. I mean, when I talk to people, usually there's always some angle of their life that's like completely collapsing or that they're climbing out of maybe or that they're about to fall into. It does seem to be the norm Right, I mean Smooth sailing it almost feels like when somebody has a completely like the people who are like everything is just like this What you're actually doing and it took me a while to realize this stug in I think what you're doing at that point is you're not participating in life. So like you can go like, well, I don't want to pursue like the work that I really want to pursue. And therefore, I'll do this thing that doesn't upset the equilibrium at all. I don't want to engage in relationships. So therefore, I can't be in a good or bad one. So like, if you go, I will retreat from all the things that would make life life. Then yeah, then they go, oh yeah, life is smooth sailing because you're actually like not participating in life. You're not going after dreams, you're not going after relationships, you're not engaging with people. So therefore, you're like, everything's nothing's really happening. Yeah, you're also not living. Right. Yeah, you can't. I mean, if you had to guess, as a comedian, and forgive me, for two in your morning, one of the great comedians alive right now your stand up and stop so fucking good Okay How many times did you bomb do you think if you had to guess like if like we're in Vegas and there is like and you get it You get it like the marble how many marbles are the how many times you think you've bum Well, there's a the real question is how many times What I'm actually you bought high times if you had epic bombs Well, there's the real question is how many times, how many times have you had epic bombs? Epic bombs. Epic bombs, epic bombs, you shouldn't have dozens and dozens. No. Those are like a handful. And I've had a few that are pretty legendary, massive, like... Like what? Hard shaking bombs. He talked about it. Well, I mean, sure, I'm trying to pick my... I mean, I've had just complete chaos unfold at shows where... I mean, the most famous one for my career was I got boot off stage um and that was there's something poetic to it because I shot my very first special on a Saturday in Minneapolis in 2013 seven days later I'm on stage on a Saturday doing a club, seven days after what is the high point of my career at that time. And I get booed off stage, right? With like the material that I just, I just take the special. Jesus Christ. And it was, it was jarring. It was jarring, you know, it was like, it was pretty incredible how, like how shaking that was where I was like, what the fuck? You know, I was thinking about it too, I'd never really considered what if it were the Saturday but 4 I taped, how that would have been even much worse, I think, you know. You might not have done this special. You might not have done this special. Maybe not, maybe not. Which meant that maybe you'd never do a special, which means you wouldn't have five, you have five specials right now. Five. What a fucking body of work, man. So yeah, if like, things had gone the other direction, Jesus, God knows what would happen to you. Yeah, I mean, that's like a crazy one. I've had other ones where it's like, people are, you know, cause I used to work the club system pretty relentlessly. And this is like pre-ticket selling. So before you sell in tickets, you're just doing whoever's at the club. And it's good for you in the sense that it really sharpens your sword, like you learn how to deal with all types of crowds, all over the country. But man, I mean, yeah, I had shows, I wouldn't, you know, it wasn't like weekly or even monthly, but I would say every quarter you would have one that would go completely sideways. And, you know, the thing like, you find that like what's your pet peeve from audience to it. For me, it wasn't like, it wasn't somebody yelling something out, that's actually like something you kind of develop a skill set for. It was like, it was like people just Really honestly just being drunk and and disrespecting the whole experience so They start talking and you're like what are you doing and they're like I'm talking to my friend and you're like And that shit I would feel my blood pressure just start to my friend and you're like, oh, and that shit, I would feel my blood pressure just start to go up. And I always, I heard this thing from Gary Shanling once where he said, don't get mad, get funny. And so what it's supposed to mean is like in those moments, you try to keep your head in the space of stay a comedian, right? Like, so what's the funny thing to say here? And it's very helpful if you can do it, but you realize that it actually takes work. It's not as simple as just saying it and knowing it. You have to practice it. And I remember after I heard that I would try to incorporate it more. So I would go like, in the millisecond, I would be like, what's the funnier thing to do here? And I would try to make jokes of it. But the days where I failed, when anger would win, dude, I would say such vicious things that aren't funny. They're just mean. And I would just be in a state of rage, basically, such vicious things that aren't funny. They're just mean. Yeah. And I would just be in a state of rage basically. We're like, you can like continue that just people would be like, what the fuck? And like, I have, you know, I have women crying being dragged out of the show. Like, yeah, you fucking pig. And I'm just like, just completely fuck. Yeah, just like, because I'm in a I'm so I mean looking back on it, you realize that you're so what you are, you're so like hurt that you were trying to be vulnerable because what the just thing that happens, even if you're like a silly person on stage, there is a there is something about you being vulnerable, right? Like if we're having a conversation right now and you are super vulnerable about something, and then I kind of mock you or, you know, like belittly you about it, you automatically go like, oh, I don't wanna be vulnerable with this guy anymore, right? Right. Like, I'm not gonna open up to him, he just mocked me. And I think there's a version of that that can happen on stage that will like basically brew in a show. Yep. And that was a thing where whenever I had like real drunks, like, and I was, and I was, and the thing is I was about to open, maybe I was about to enter a moment where I was gonna say something. Then you go like, I don't wanna say this anymore, you know? Yeah. So, it's a whole thing, but like the bombing, you have to bomb. I've met people who are younger in standup who are like, yeah, I haven't really had any bomb. Like, well, you haven't done that much standup then. Right. Or you're not really trying. You're not trying or experimenting or you, and yeah, that's to me like you know You can sort of Understand everything from one thing you're doing and it's like that is the metaphor I mean it's you want to get to be a good comedian You know the worst rut I ever gotten in my fucking life was because of cowardice because like I didn't want to like trying You jokes I had jokes that were working enough. I would have a romp paper, a good show, but get off stage and just feel dead inside. What am I? 100%. What am I doing? Why not just get an animatronic version of me to wheel out on stage and do all the same sounds and movements? So it's like that, yeah yeah that to me that seems to be something that people are desperately trying to avoid in their own lives. Your brain can do this thing where I've been in the exact same rut even like not that long ago, just beyond tour, have a show, like meeting I have my show that I put on down, like I know how to do the show. Go out there, big crowd, you know, big, big crowd. Show goes well, really well, get off stage, and I'm bummed out. And I was like, what's wrong, I'm like, that sucked. And Tom was like, what's wrong? I'm like, that sucked. And they're like, what do you mean that sucked? Yeah. What's really happening is that I'm in a funk because I haven't done anything new in a minute. And I'm allowing myself to understand that I haven't done anything new and I'm reluctant to try. I'm just going like new and I'm reluctant to try. I'm just going like, I don't wanna try. Yeah. I don't wanna try. This works. I just wanna do this. And then I do the show again and I feel just shitty again. And then it's like I have to work up, like it's courage. It's like you're almost working up the internal courage to go, I'm gonna try something totally new this show. And maybe it'll go poorly. And sometimes it does, but then you at least go, I'm not a coward, I tried something new. Yes. Dude, and it's so weird, because you forget that every joke you're telling that works started off as a joke that you tried for the first time. Like every single joke. And some of us, even knowing that you're like afraid to try, to do the only thing that has given you jokes for your whole life. It's still terrifying to come out because it feels so good to be in control. It feels so good to know that you're sad, it feels so good when you get that hour worked out and it's killing and you're like, this is working. And you just, that's where that's the rich effect. It's like, it's the comedic equivalent of the one person. It's the comedic, you know what I mean? It's the comedic equivalent. It's just like, okay, I've got it. Now I'm just gonna just stay in this exact spot in my life for as long as I can. I mean, that's why people kill themselves, man. I'm certain of it. Now I'm just gonna just stay in this exact spot in my life for as long as I can. I mean, that's why people kill themselves, man. I'm certain of it. That's like people say 100%. 100%. Because here's the thing that you figure out in all the arts and definitely in stand-up comedy too. If you, you never get to the point where you're there. You never get to the point where you're there. You never get to the finish. There is no finish line. So people think, maybe if you have the special or you sell out the arena, it's like none of that is the thing. You don't get, you are an artist and you just have to keep creating. You have to keep doing it. You have to keep doing it. You have to keep painting, you have to keep writing. So once you kind of accept that, you're just like, you go, yeah, I'm just never done. Never done. Do you, does it, now that you are, you know, because we are all hanging out at a comedy store before anything, but you were hanging out at the comedy store before anything, but you were hanging out before your mom's house before like you're you're incredible and deserve success as a comedian. Now that you have the pressure man, like of a family, the pressure you've got kids, you've got like an overhead, you've got you're running a business. sure you've got kids, you've got like an overhead, you've got, you're running a business. Yeah. Does, how do you deal with that? Like how do you, you know, because the comedians like, we started off like completely free-wheeling. Free, free, like this intense freedom. It's like if you weren't making a bunch of money, that's okay. Whatever. If you were making just a like money Then now you might not even you would think ah That's not enough that you have to pay me so much more than that to do But you would make that or you and you would be so happy you had rent and food For the month that meant rent and food for the month rent is paid that feeling of it. Okay, rent's paid next credit card food. I think I can swing that and you're happy. So for me, that kind of state of consciousness was conducive to comedy. You know what I mean? Like you could be a miscreant. So how are you dealing with your role as like running a business with Christina, running a family, running a house, all the shit that goes into that and simultaneously, like creating the creative space that you're, that at least, I don't know, my jokes come from or that I'm assuming most comedians jokes come from. Yeah, I mean, it's a good one. I think a lot of the funny thing is, a lot of the cliche stuff that you go, yeah, bullshit or whatever, it's always true. That's one of the things that I've learned in life that like everything you hear when you're a kid or when you're coming up, but yeah, all you need is love and all this money won't buy you, having like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like all those things are unfortunately, that's super true when you discover their real meaning. Like you just hear words, but like, I know people won't, but like people don't believe me when I say this, but like, as it is cool to get paid, a lot to do something, it really isn't fulfilling. It doesn't make you feel complete. All the things that are, all your insecurities that you had before then that you think will be resolved by that do not go away. None of them do. So if you try to find meaning in success, I think you come up empty. So you really start to have to find like, you have to find meaning elsewhere. You know, I mean, like, I'm, I've been getting more into the realizing how important my presence is for the kids, because I've been such a lunatic with touring. I think that since my tour ended a little while back, and I've had a real revelation of like, oh my God, it was actually kind of heartbreaking to realize how much I had toured, and not just what I had missed, perfor myself, but seeing how it affects them. That was kind of a tough pill to swallow. So, I'm just trying to like, I don't know, it's one of the things where you go like, I don't know if you ever feel like this, but when people go like, you have all these things going on, I'm like, yeah, also, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing, man. Yeah. Like, I don't know how I do any of these things. I don't know. I mean, we just do what we can. I do the best I things. I don't know. I mean, we just do what we can. I do the best I can. I do the best I can at home. I try to make decisions, business wise, that are like solid, but also I try to take some risks, calculated risks. So there's things that we're doing as a business in that regard. calculated risks, so there's things that we're doing as a business in that regard. Standard wise, I always have the same panicked feeling every time a special comes out. My special, my fifth special has just come out, or I don't know if it's out, whatever, July 4th, I don't know when this airs, but I always have this feeling where I go, fuck, how am I gonna come up with a new hour? And then I sit there and I go, it's impossible, I'm not going to. And then what saves me is that I go, this is what you thought and felt the last four times as well. Yeah. You had the exact same feeling. So now I know it's a familiar well. Yeah. You had the exact same feeling. So now I know it's a familiar feeling. Yeah. It doesn't make it go away, but at least you go, oh, this is, I remember what this feels like. Yeah. And then for me, the only way out is just to get on stage, accept that all those bits and all those jokes are gone and just try. Like you just have to try. And I usually get up and I like a few times, I'll do sets and I'll be like, well, that's dog shit. Like there's no way that's gonna make its way into the next hour. Yeah. And then you do it a few more times and you go, boom, I got one, like, yeah, I got one. I got five minutes now. And then that's the only way, that's the only way I know, you do it a few more times and you go, boom, I got one. Like, yeah, I got one. I got five minutes now. And then that's the only way, that's the only way I know how to do it. I don't know how other people do it. Well, you know, it's really nice here. You say that I don't know what I'm doing thing because sometimes that haunts me, man. And like, you know, sometimes it's like people expect you to be able to give them some like geometrically perfect explanation of your life like is though there was some plan or there was like a You know since you were a kid you mapped out a strategy that would lead you to the point where you could do comedy specials or, and I don't feel like that at all. I, you know, and I wonder, is this standard or non-standard? Does the president feel like this? Is this how most people in the government feel? Is there anyone who's like, I've got, I know what I'm doing. I, and he hears the plan, or underneath all that, is there just a general sense of confusion and like sort of like, you know, burrowing through life like a mole in a yard or something, you know, you're just trying to, like, you're doing something, but the plan... I think in the arts, ultimately we're all like this. Whether we admit it or not, I think you could probably ask Paul McCartney, how do you write songs that he'd be like, I don't fucking know, man. I guess I just go like this, and then I just, I see what I come, I really do think that all artists are like that. Some of them might not say it like that, but I do think that there's there because everybody knows like there's there's this thing where it's like there's this magic quality, right? When people are like, how did you come up with that line? You're like, I don't know, dude, I just said it. But do you do you think it's just like a trait that is only like an artist or is it like a is it is the basic human experience rooted in confusion? Yes. And if not, if not, and then and then I think as you get wiser and older, it's the acceptance, the realization that you really don't have the answers that that that is what existence is about. It's about going like it's about the full idea that I don't know what I'm doing but I'm just gonna do stuff. I think I know how to raise these kids. I think I know how to do this work. I think I know how to be a good friend. I mean the people who go I'll tell you exactly how to do all those things. It's like, I don't, I almost don't believe that they believe what they're saying. I think they want to believe what they're saying when they go, I'll tell you how to do everything. Right. That's their version of like coaching themselves. When, um, you know, like, if I found myself, I'm guessing at night, probably, maybe in the day, in the more early morning, in my neighbor's yard, hungry, not really knowing what I'm doing. You know, just kind of go a moment to moment, committed to hunting and eating only what I kill. You know, if that were me, like, I think I could see myself grabbing the dog, eating it, hanging it up, hanging it up, during a video podcast, during a conversation where someone's gonna see what definitely looks like a dog pal with a collar on it that doesn't look like a tracking collar that you put on a big squirrel. You know, uh-uh. Okay, let me just say something, you've never been here, and you have no idea how big these things are. Tom, thank you so much, man. I know you're like getting a break right now and you're out there in like God's country. Thank you so much for coming on the show. And I'm so excited for a new special. I've already already I think I think is the one I the one I saw the Wilbur that's the one that's that's some version of what's coming out right like a Aaron and I came to you saw show you saw me at um at ACL not Wilbur I might as they will right ACL yeah sold out ACL yeah yeah that's the special. Yeah, you That's basically the special that's basically the special. Yeah, yeah It's so good and I hope y'all next man. Well, where is it Netflix? It's on Netflix. Yeah, Fourth of July. It's called Sledgehammer. It's on Netflix and Yeah, I'm super stoked for it. I really am. I don't think I've ever in my career been this excited for one to come out. I think I just felt, I think it was the fact honestly that I, it was three years. And I realized how much better you can make your hour in another year than it. Because that was in like a two year cycle, the pandemic threw it off. And I was like, oh, this extra year is actually hugely beneficial. Yes. Yes, take your time. Take your time. Take your time. You know, that's something Mitzi said to me that I'll never get that's where convenience fuck up if they're always in a hurry. Don't be in a hurry. She's right. Yeah, don't be in a hurry. What's the rush? What's the big deal? I think I'm going to record no rush. I'm recording my special in July, but maybe I'll do it in two more years. Tom. Oh, where are you doing it? The mother ship. You're doing it there? Yeah, I'm doing it in July. I'm recording it like middle of July, late July. I'm terrified. This is my first specialist. You know how that feels that feels man it's just fucking intense man yeah it's gonna be great how many are you shooting off four for Lance bangs is helping me with it still like it'll be you know at least I have someone who knows what they're doing reduction wise yeah yeah where you know you're gonna take it or not yet not Not yet. We're just gonna film it. Edit it. See if it's worth a damn and then if it is, then we'll take it from there. But I love the model. A lot of comedians are doing it. They put it on YouTube. I think that's so cool. Just throw it up there. It gets people to your shows. It's the best. It's brilliant that they have done that. That's taking the, making the opportunity your own. It's like, why are you waiting. That is, that's taking the, making the opportunity your own. It's like, why are you waiting for someone to say, yes, we allow you to? Just put it up. Put it out there. Don't read the comments. Move up to the mountains. Don't go into society ever again. Tom. Just hunt, you know, hunt, eat what you kill. Eat what you kill. Eat what you kill. Well, well, man, you know, hide where you're going.

289^1^Duncan Trussell Family Hour - 435: Fredrick Brennan Transcript and Discussion^2021-04-22^Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. You can get Dirty Angel anywhere you get your music. Ghost Towns. Dirty Angel. Out. Now. New album and tour date coming this summer. And now a reading from the book of Zebaldoth the Cursed. This book was recovered from the ruins of the KLV building in Amsterdam after the first iteration of the Nova Weapon. Nisha the Wanderer traveled down the muddy hill and passed an all decrepit wall upon which sat a little boy with long greasy rocks of black hair. The little boy was holding a wand of hellfire and he pointed at Nisha and said, If you don't move faster, I intend to reduce you to ash. Nisha smiled at him and said, Do you not know where I come from child? Do you not know who I am? He shouted at me and I will spare you. The child laughed and said, Why should I bow to a stranger? How is it that you see me as a stranger? The great traveling lord known by many names including Duvan Ananda, the blind one, waved his hand and removed the seal of forgetfulness. He had placed over the child. The child remembered that he was once a celestial lord who almost destroyed the seven realms of Bonavita and Nisha had used powerful magic to place him in an illusory world. This was the pin in this illusory world he had caused many problems with his powerful wand and he had incinerated many forces. He was ashamed and begged Nisha for mercy. Nisha smiled and said, I will give you mercy. I will make you awaken in a new life, in a new world where you will be listening to the greatest podcast of all time. You mean my favorite murder? Said the child. No, said Nisha angrily. You mean WTF with Mark Marin? Said the little boy. No, said Nisha, growing even angrier. Then you must be in your mom's house, upon a cigarette, Kristina Pozitzky. No, said Nisha, I mean the Duncan Trussell Family Hour podcast. And with that he cast a spell upon the child and the child became you in this very moment, listening to the greatest podcast that ever was. Here's your host, it's Cromberlin Caffey. Greetings sweet friends, it is I Cromberlin Caffey and this is the DTFH and you have tuned in for a glorious episode. If you're one of the zillions of people who was entranced by Q into the storm, the amazing documentary that is on HBO right now, then you already know today's guest and no doubt you fell in love with him. In this dimension we call Fred a programmer, but in any other far less boring dimension, Frederick would be a very powerful magic user, a sorcerer, a wizard, whatever you want to call it. And Frederick actually encountered one of the problems that happens to wizards, which is the thing that you create sometimes escapes and runs amuck, terrorizing nearby villages and causing all kinds of problems. In Frederick's case, this being that he summoned up was a Chan and and one part of Fred's story is his quest to put that demon back in the bottle. And that's what the QAnon documentary is all about. And I really hope that you will watch it. Maybe even before you listen to this episode, I'm so excited for you to meet this wonderful being who I have awarded the global hero of the summer award. And if you watch the QAnon docker listen to this conversation, I think you'll see why we're going to jump right into this episode. But first, this. Thanks to Mudwater for sponsoring this episode of the DTFH Mudwater. It is a coffee alternative with four medicinal mushrooms and Ayurvedic herbs. With one seventh the caffeine is a cup of coffee, you get the energy without the anxiety, jitters or brutal coffee crash. Each ingredient was added for a purpose. You get cacao and chai for mood and energy, lion's mane for focus, cordyceps for physical performance, chaga and rice sheet for immune and stress and turmeric for soreness. Throw in some cinnamon for antioxidants and you have got Mudwater. But it gets better. Since the company was founded, they've taken a percentage of their sales and donated it to MAPS. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, an organization that develops medical, legal and cultural contexts for people to benefit from the careful use of psychedelics. So quitting coffee might not only reduce your anxiety, but contribute to the resolution of another's. I love MAPS. Go back a few episodes. Well, a lot of episodes. I actually got to do an interview with Rick Doblin, the founder of MAPS. Sorry, you're probably not supposed to advertise yourself inside of someone else's commercial. Sorry Mudwater. Mudwater is great. It's delicious. Mix that up with some oat milk and some honey, froth it up and slurp it back. You might be able to get off a coffee. I mean, come on. What are we going to do, friends? We're going to drink coffee until our stomachs look like some old leather wallet that fell out in a glory hole. No, you got to get off the juice. Mudwater is a wonderful, healthy way to do that. It's 100% USDA, organic, non-GMO, gluten-free, vegan, whole 30 approved and kosher.

If I do, the reason is because yesterday was my birthday and my wife took me out for a night on the town. She's much younger than me. I imagine her liver is like some kind of garden of Eden. Whereas my liver is like an old desiccated wasteland, a cursed place where countless wars have been fought. Bloody, horrible, forgotten wars, you know, like that. The part of the forest you go to where you just get this feeling of like something fucked up happened here, but you'll never know what or what it could have been because it was probably thousands of years ago. Or, you know, those parts of town that just seem basically cursed, you know, like places where it's not just one area that's messed up, but like all the stores are kind of Lovecraftian, dilapidated, people sort of in a disheveled, sad, stunned state. And you get the feeling that if you could rewind time and go back a thousand years, 2,000 years, 3,000 years, that this place would be sort of perpetually rotten, that's what my liver has become. But I would, you know, I got a tray of shots, like I'm on a fucking cruise ship in my 20s, got a little drunk, a lot drunk. Then the baby kept my sweet darling wife up all night, so I got up with forest. Just, you know, that feeling where you're like, fuck, I thought I'd get to sleep a little bit more, but that snatched away from you by your own karma. But it wasn't that bad, you know, that's the thing. Anytime I get to do anything remotely not selfish, it seems to be some kind of universal antidote. Went downstairs, made the kids some yogurt and honey and berries. We're watching a B documentary right now, which is pretty intense, a Bumblebee documentary. You know, these nature docs, you gotta watch out if you have a kid. I'm sure you know this, but fuck, like 9 out of 10 of these nature docs, it's just the walking dead. But with like a B, you know, it's unrelentingly cruel out there. Like if you're a Bumblebee, you're just fucked. The whole story is about this bee that is looking for a hole to live in, and that means like finding a hole that doesn't have something living in it, but it finds a hole where there's like a adorable mouse and this nice little nest of, you know, mint leaves and seeds. And this fucking Bumblebee that woke from being frozen, because I guess they freeze themselves or they get frozen in the winter and they have some kind of alien juice inside of them that melts the freeze. This fucking B goes like barreling down this mouse tunnel and evicts this mouse. I don't know how they filmed it. Evicts this mouse from its hole, essentially. Like they got a lot of angles. It's really confusing how they shot this. The bee is like raises its back leg, which means danger and the mouse is not going to fuck with the bee. It's basically like imagine if, you know, a demon just suddenly came barreling into your house, making you run out and then proceeded to like lay eggs in your house to hatch more demons. So you could never go back. That's what Bumblebees do. And then to cap it all off, you know what happens at the end of a Bumblebee's life? All the other bees sting it to death and it gets replaced by a new queen. It's a built in evolutionary system that ends with matricide. So the next time you see some cute, adorable Bumblebee buzzing around, just know that thing is eventually going to kill its mom. Now, before we get into this conversation with the brilliant Frederick Brennan, I want to say something and I don't want it to be a spoiler or anything, but somewhere along this conversation, I say to Frederick, you know, in my dark times, I don't see how the planet isn't going to descend into fascism. And the other night I woke up in the middle of the night thinking about how I said that and how incredibly dismal that prognostication is. I don't think that's our only shot. I don't think it's the only possibility, obviously. I just feel like I need to say that. I think more likely than a descent into fascism or as Frederick proposed, some kind of constitutional convention where we maybe change the framework of how this country runs itself, there's another option. That isn't some utopian thing where our species reaches the peak of an evolutionary pinnacle and we all become, I don't know, some kind of non-stinging hive of proto-hominids and a kind of orgasmic lattice of hyper-technologically enhanced connectivity. But the things just kind of keep going the way they're going, but they get a little better and they keep getting a little better and a little better and a little better. See, my problem is I want an instant solution, you know? I'm never satisfied with just the tiny little incremental steps forward. My wife and I yesterday were in bed watching the fucking George Floyd verdict, you know? And we were so happy, like anybody who isn't a demon was, to see that the jury convicted that murderous cop on all charges. But then, probably like most people we thought, holy shit, it took so much energy to make that happen. So many protests. Someone had to film it. People had to be brutally honest and like get over their fear and testify. You know, if you look at it from the perspective of not right now, but two years from now, three years from now, if you don't do the one foot in front of the other thing, things can look really dire. That's what I'm trying to say. Even the little victories seem like nothing at all in the face of the abyss. But if you just look at it in the moment and accept the little victories and stop seeing all the shit Tucker Carlson wants you to look at, and by the way, he's very upset right now. He's very upset right now. If you're someone who likes to hate Watch Fox News, definitely tune in because he's, it's like somebody threw salt on his hemorrhoids and that's a good sign. It's known as the Carlson equation, which is GH equals the inverse of CH, meaning there's a there's an inverse correlation between global harmony and Carlson's harmony. So the more upset or turbulent Carlson is from that, you can deduce that global harmony has increased somewhat and he is freaking the fuck out right now. So things are looking up. That's what I'm trying to say here. And when you hear me belt out some nonsense about some inevitable authoritarianism descending upon our planet, please understand that I am in a lot of ways a true dope. Like I actually thought a meteor was going to smash into the planet in the beginning of COVID and that COVID was some kind of ruse, I guess, to get us all inside to increase survivability. All my all my smart friends are just normal friends, including my wife. They rolled their eyes at me made fun of me anytime I would get going on this and then it didn't happen. So when you hear me make some grand forecast, just know it's I also thought a meteor was going to hit the planet and it didn't.

Zencaster, the software I use to record many of my podcasts, it kind of malfunctioned on me, sadly. And we lost the first, I don't know, four minutes of this conversation. It was personal and intense about Frederick's past, but we lost it. We lost me saying, welcome to the show. And so, I'm sorry. So, it's going to have this disjointed feel, like you're kind of like dropping in a few minutes in, which you are, because I lost the first four, six minutes of this thing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not a professional journalist. I wish I were. If I had been, I would have, if I was even a professional podcaster, I wouldn't have lost these four minutes. And there wouldn't be this rambling intro. There'd be this quick boom, boom, boom, boom thing. And it would be, wow, it's so tight and polished. So tight, so polished. And now, without further ado, my friends, I want to introduce you to the global hero of the summer. You've seen him on QAnon, End of the Storm. You probably are aware of him, because if you're anyone who spends any amount of time on the internet, you've been, or you spent some time on his creation, no longer available. A Chan. And if you're a coder or someone who's into fonts, then you probably know about him, because he is a brilliant programmer who has made some world-famous fonts. You can follow him on Twitter, at FR underscore Brennan. But now, at this moment, I mean it. I want you to extend that probiscus from your third eye and spray as much sweet, orgasmic, astral love gel into the eternal, undulating, connective fabric that connects all sentient beings in the universe so that Fred feels the love of countless souls raining like honey down upon his head. Welcome to the DTFH, Frederick Brennan. My dad, you know, got custody through a series of lies. He basically accused my mom of doing something that women essentially never do, which is sexually abuse their children. And the courts went along with that for a little while. She was never found guilty or even charged, but she was held in jail for 30 days for something. I don't know. But she was never officially charged. They do know that. And so by doing that, he was able to kind of keep the money. And so he just left me and my brother in the care of this 24 hour nurse that I learned later, he was having sex with. And then he was abusive. So I did a lot of the self harm stuff to try to get out of the house like I actually wanted to go to a mental hospital or something like that. And so I had read this book about this girl that had, sorry, about this girl that had, what's the word, anorexia, sorry. And then she caught herself and went to a mental hospital. So I just did that. And then anyway, when I was there, it sort of came out why I was there. And so the state and everybody, you know, basically this nurse was going to be fired. Because I told them about some of the things she did like my brother experienced a rare condition during neglect, which is called fecal vomiting. It's where somebody doesn't poop for a really long time, it comes out the other end. Yeah, so when they heard about all that and that she covered up and everything, they fired her she's not even allowed to be a nurse anymore, like a home health they they're called that actually our ends but Anyway, she basically convinced my dad that she wouldn't stay with him, like as his partner if he did not tell CPS that he didn't want his kids anymore. So, he got so angry that I snitched on him that he called CPS and told them that basically without baby that's the name of the nurse. He wasn't going to feed us. And he was just going to let us die. So the CPS needed to come right away and take us and he had this warrior who helped him sign away his parental rights and then that's how I went into foster care so that that's the story before care. And foster care for for two years did you go in with your brother to did you go to the same place. Yeah, we did. There was a short period where we weren't together but we did go together. How's your brother doing now. Oh, he's fine. He's not nearly as well known as I am. Yeah, but he's fine. Yeah, you I mean now you are a. You're a global hero. Now, you might be one of them. I don't know. I think so. I think you might be one of the most like famous heroes on earth right now. Well, you know, because the one of the most famous hero right now, it changes, you know, month to month, but right now, your April's global. What I say to people, what I say to people is that there are so few decent people in that Q documentary that I come out looking much better. That's because I am one of the only, like, I mean, who am I competing with there and watching Ron Watkins. Well, all of these just really weird people or otherwise, like, researchers who don't actually have a role in the event. So, you know, they're not like, the audience isn't like, sympathizing with like, Will summer or Mike Rothschild because they're just kind of you're being humble, which is a very quality of global here. It's a quality of global heroes. But because, you know, yeah, sure. Like, I don't think anybody thinks these days, I don't know if anybody thinks anybody's perfect anymore, but you didn't have to do that. You didn't have to put you you essentially destroyed your life. Or at least like temporarily, like created mass chaos, because because you have a strong feeling regarding your wayward child, a Chan and it's a great feeling which, you know, I'm sure a lot of people disagree with I agree with it. You know, I, and it's something I would love to hear your thoughts on in particular, regarding freedom of speech. But you know, I think most of us when we're watching we recognize that it would have been easy for you for another person to ignore the reality that their little, little, little creation had turned into some kind of I mean, I mean, you're, you're, you're totally right about that. I mean, there are so many ways that I could have done that. Like, for example, Jim Watkins had sole ownership of a Chan beginning in 2015, which is before a whole bunch of stuff happens. So beginning January 2015 and I was the only only the admin until April of 2016, which is even before Trump gets elected. So there were like a lot of PR lines that I can take right. Like, like the kind of thing that, you know, X founders of like PayPal or Facebook, the things that they say, oh, we're no longer involved in these companies, we have no control over what's going on. It's unfair for you to even talk to me. Yeah, I didn't do that. I guess partly because I did still work for Jim Watkins until 2018, even though I wasn't working on that. And I discovered while there that the entire reason that I even gave it to him was based on a lie. Like, I gave it to him because I thought that he was the legitimate owner of two channel that Japanese website that predates fortune. And then it turns out that he actually stole that. And both he and Ron lied about that to me. So that is was a huge mindfuck. And I kind of wanted to let people know about that. And I didn't really know how eventually I figured out how it took a few years. Yeah. But yeah, you could have done a Pontius pilot. I wash my hands of this, you know, like out of my control. Yeah, you're right. It probably would have been easy, but it wasn't the right thing. You redeemed yourself. I knew. I mean, I knew a lot of stuff. It wasn't the right thing to do to just not tell people all of the stuff that I knew about them. I mean, it, they had so much influence and it would have been really wrong for me to just tell them everything I knew to myself and, you know, just ignore all of the people requesting information from me. Yeah. But still, you know, just there's just so many people in the world who had just pretend, you know, imagine that they didn't really have that responsibility and this, but this is the world is I like tangle with this problem that you faced head on, not just with a champ, but in gent with with the superpower of the internet meeting the reality that we live in a planet where there are like hyper manipulative psychopaths who would love to be the next Hitler, you know, who would love if they could to, you know, take over the planet and if not that then take over a country and if not that then take over a business and if not that have a small gross group of cultists around them that do awful things. And, you know, and, you know, fortunately, not everyone is very charismatic, or interesting or not everyone has like the Elron Hubbard angle, you know, that somehow magnetizes people to them but a shit ton of people do. So, yeah, thoughts on ways that are that we can simultaneously maintain like this great idea of freedom of speech being able to say whatever you want. How do you use the internet like how do you keep it going. If inevitably, people are just going to pop up and try to get kids to you know shoot people or do rotten things. Things that I consider that first I think I need to provide a little bit more backstory. What you say about there being very charismatic people is really true. And some people would say well Trump is one of these very charismatic people that knew how to use the internet to his I would say that actually what we saw was a downgraded version of what is really possible because Donald Trump himself was more out for himself than he was out for an ideology. Then he was out for actually reshaping the United States at all costs. And if Donald Trump were actually one of these psychopaths like Hitler there would probably not be a United States right now. He would have done everything he could to take over the military to launch an actual coup to, I mean, you know, think about it this way. Mike Pence was just walking around in the White House, essentially unprotected. If Donald Trump was able to turn even one of his, you know, secret service people that are loyal to him, and supposed to follow the orders of the commander in chief, that person could have just walked up and shot Mike Pence yet. Like that kind of thing happens in other countries where a coup is something that Americans think can't happen here. And that's not true at all. A coup can happen in any democracy. And we were extremely fortunate that Donald Trump is not at heart an ideologue. He just likes to be popular. And he's more concerned about the risks to him if he fails than getting this done at all costs. So we haven't yet seen the actual what a magnified threat would look like somebody who is a psychopath, and is using audiences on the internet to bring about their ends and does also in a position of great power at any cost. We haven't seen that yet. And I think it's partly because the people that are in power right now are still too old to have fully like the internet was not around when they were young enough to kind of where they were neuroplastic enough we can say for that to just, you know, become something that is like eating to them that they just understand like you and I do. So we definitely why I gave that back story is because this problem is even more severe than Donald Trump and it's more severe than anything we've seen yet. And we have to get this right very, very soon, because the clock is literally running out on our society and on our ability to do anything. Another way that the clock is running out. Sorry to give so much back story, but I think it's important because I think people don't understand the free speech online is going to change, even if we do nothing, and people don't get this they think that as long as America is continuing to uphold these norms that that means that the internet is not going to change at all. And that's not true. Other countries are becoming extremely, we can say pissed off at the United States. And what we are seeing right now is a rise internationally of an idea called cyber sovereignty. And the doctrine of cyber sovereignty is that the laws of your country should not end when someone picks up a phone or plugs in an even that cable that the laws that are respected in your country, all of them Bible laws, pornography laws, copyright laws, patent laws, all of them should apply to the websites that are doing business in your country. And what this means is, if it continues on the trajectory that it is right now. Our grandchildren will not have an internet like we have, they will have essentially a US internet that has websites that cater to Americans, and they will perhaps be able to email people in other countries. And there will probably be like a way to pass messages in between these internet like right now. There are ways to message people in China, even though people in China cannot see Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, all of that. There are still ways for you to contact them and of course, people in China can get around the firewall still but the Chinese government has become more and more effective at clamping down on that. I remember in the early 2000s, early 2010s, a lot of people were kind of treating the firewall of China like it was a joke. We can use a VPN, we can use Tor, we can get around it. This is no big deal. This government is ignorant of how the internet works and they don't actually understand that there's nothing they can do, that they've let in this Pandora's box. And actually, although their initial attempts were clumsy, they learned because any program that a government puts an enormous amount of money towards is eventually going to hit on how to censor the internet. And so, they discovered that you can close down Tor gateways. That blocking VPNs is not actually a hard problem that 4chan, for example, which is not a big government, manages to block almost every VPN on Earth. So, they have discovered many, many myriad ways that they can control their internet and they've been highly successful at it. In order to right now go on to a prohibited website in China, if they really don't want you to go there, like if you go to Xinjiang and VPNs and everything are banned. You need to take incredibly technically difficult measures, you know, installing a Tor browser, not from the Tor official website because it's blocked, getting it somehow from a friend, etc. You can't even just launch it on your computer and run it because Tor operates via something called a directory, essentially, it knows a bunch of servers that can tell you where the other Tor servers are. Most P2P networks work like this. Tor, therefore, it cannot work like that in China because all of those are blocked. So, you need to know, so you have to get the software from somebody, and then you need to know how to configure the software with an IP of a gateway that is not yet blocked, and hope that you don't get discovered for using that gateway, because you can be arrested and tried as distant for trying to circumvent the Great Firewall. So, the Great Firewall has actually become quite effective to an insanely high degree of people in Xinjiang, for example, are also required to install monitoring software on the computer. What do you think musk satellites are going to change that, make it impossible to block because it's coming from a satellite? I don't think that I, you know, China, for example, has a lot of internal control and that satellite technology is something that is very easy to stop people from using. They could very easily monitor who has a satellite dish. They have a lot of cameras and stuff like that. They could launch a system where you can report on your neighbor for having an unauthorized satellite dish. They could have, for example, satellite dishes which are authorized, which would only be able to like, for example, get, you know, CCTV and the actual Chinese activities. The satellites I don't think are going to work. But now that I've given all that backstory, I can say that we are really, really, really close to losing the internet that we have. And what is happening in China right now is happening worldwide. To get back to our own story, my own story here, Australia and New Zealand blocked HN after the Christchurch shooting. Those kinds of things did not used to happen. And increasingly we're seeing that governments in free Western countries are becoming less and less tolerant of web services. And there is going to come a day when I feel there is going to be an EU social network and they're going to kick Facebook out because everything that's going on. With Facebook and Twitter with the taxation there that they don't want to pay and now it's becoming a world trade issue. India has blocked a bunch of apps and these big tech giants might be able to survive in this environment, but what it's going to cause is fragmentation. Like, you may still be calling it Facebook in different countries, but not everybody is seeing the same thing and not everybody is able to see everybody else's accounts. It's like some horrific version of what's already happening. Like you can on Netflix, you can only watch the movies that you're allowed to. Right, but that's just going to. It's like Netflix for the entire. Yeah, that's it. So this is something that you view as bad, right? Of course, yeah. But there's, but you know, I'm just saying the paradox is that you also were like, fuck, I gotta, I gotta figure out a way to shut down this site that I created because it's getting people killed. Right. So this is some kind of like, right, a paradox for you, right, which is on one. Right. Yes. Yeah. And that's why I feel like this reckoning with free speech is something that our generation needs to do. This reckoning with free speech online is something that we absolutely need to do, or we will lose the internet. That's. Oh, I got you. I got you. Because yeah, because you're saying what I'm saying that these countries are going to get so pissed off, essentially, by our inability to control ourselves that this problem is going to keep getting worse and worse. I'm saying that we cannot control what our authoritarian countries do. And it's very likely that China will keep getting worse and worse. And it's very likely that there will be parts of the world that the internet no longer reaches. However, if we are not able to deal with this problem, it will be the whole world. So I'm saying that we need to figure this out. And part of the way that we can figure it out is simply by applying existing laws and updating those laws where they need to be updated. You know, when we look at, for example, what happened on HN. A lot of the things that happened there are supposed to not be allowed direct threats of violence. You know, is there supposed to not be allowed. Not kins is were called one of them Jim was called in front of Congress and I feel like they either didn't know what to do with him. Or they just didn't know, you know, how to handle this issue and they don't see the gravity of it because he has never faced legal consequences for anything he's done. And he's gone to the point now where he is either himself or somebody he's closely related to is impersonating a federal agent online. And that impersonation is bringing about revenue to Jim Watkins is pro Q and on Super PAC and to Jim Watkins is, you know, advertisements on HN is pro Q non business, you can say. And that, you know, there's no way to say that that's not impersonation of a federal agent and also receiving something of value. And if that is a case that would be hard to prosecute, then the laws need to be updated so that that's not how it takes forever. You can't just this this thing that this thing you're you're talking about is that we to me it's we were not nuanced enough. We this this internet thing has barely existed in human history. And we're treating it like it's a newspaper or something or rather than some living like maybe sentient like evolving brain thing. And so and it moves so quick to me. It's like, yeah, definitely. If people are breaking the law, shut them down. But we the kind of laws that we need for this are like, how do you create a law for insidious manipulation that leads children into white supremacy? You know what I mean? How do you create a lot or even prove that that's happening? Like, you know that white supremacists are actively manipulating kids actively and they're smart about it. The mean magic and all that bullshit, you know, they're they're they're good at pushing the needle. But how the fuck do you create a law that says you can't push the needle of like teenagers towards becoming fascist Nazis? Duncan, I think part of the problem is that we aren't even trying to do the things that are easy. And we just immediately jump to the things that are hard. And so before we even can go there and I'm willing to go there and to discuss that. But before we can even go there, we need to do the things that are easy and then see the effects of the things that are easy and then figure out if more is needed. Because if it wasn't allowed to do, you know, to impersonate a federal agent, to have a website that openly says embrace infamy, you can post your manifestos here to have a website that is not moderated. You know, that is not automatically moderated at all, which in effect means it's not moderated because a website of that size with as few employees as. Wait, can I just stop you for one second? Embrace infamy. I mean, I think it is important to make sure folks listening know when they're saying that they're saying that after people are getting murdered by people who are radicalized on that site. That's fair to say, right, or at least the precursor. Yeah, yeah. Fuck man that and so that's just them saying. And I mean, if you watch the Q documentary, you can see that Ron Watkins is basically laughing about the Christchurch shooting. He says that he doesn't really care about it at all. I mean, he's even, he tells the director of the documentary, Colin Hoback, that he had not even talked to any reporter about the Christchurch shooting. And they allowed the Christchurch shooting thread to get 750 replies, which is the maximum on a chance. And then it was automatically deleted by the system. They didn't even delete it. They claimed to Congress that they deleted it falsely by using that time that the automatic system deleted it. So I obviously being a chance admin, I would know that that's not what happened there. That the system proved it, but in any case, they probably lied to their lawyer about that. But yeah, I when we do the things that are easy and then see the effects that they have, we can start working on the things that are very hard like hate speech online. And it's possible that that issue can be dealt with in a type of, you know, kind of cyber sovereignty way where you're, you know, applying European speech laws in Europe and that kind of thing where it's not so utterly severe as to where the Europeans are saying, we cannot trust you Americans at all to moderate that when we pass our laws, Facebook pretends to follow them and then doesn't and that we because we no longer trust you at all. And because we know how much revenue it could bring into the European Union to have our own social network and how much data that that could, you know, have for us here at home. We are just shutting you off. You know, so that it could avoid that but I mean, I think that when we actually do the things that are easy, that there will be a lot less need to do, you know, to handle these extreme philosophical questions that you know people like play to Socrates would probably at this time. Okay. Not knowing where to post your job to reach the right people. That's why hiring can feel like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Sure.

Like, do you think what Twitter did with Trump? Is that an example of the right thing to do? Well, you know, it's a very complicated case because he clearly broke their rules. Yes. And by not blocking him, they're essentially saying that if you're powerful enough, you don't get blocked. And it's true that he is a political figure of some import, you know, a lot of import, he became president now probably only some import. But I do think that, you know, social networks have a responsibility to their users more than anything, not really like to like laws. This isn't really something about the First Amendment, but it's more about the social network has a responsibility to its users to not have a website that is full of disinformation and that is making their efforts. And Twitter recognized that. And so took out one of the main person that is spreading extremely harmful disinformation like that the election was stolen. And so I feel that they did do the right thing, but it isn't anything that could ever necessarily be codified into law. We can just expect it to happen whenever there's moral people running a social network. Yeah, it did work. I mean, that was, you know, when it happened, everyone was all of like the Trumpers are in the QAnon people are like prognosticating the apocalypse from shutting him up. And it was great. It got better like Twitter got better without him on it. It did. And we barely talk about him anymore, unless you know, we're talking about past events. Like, the great thing is, we're no longer necessarily talking about Trump as a going concern. And that's something that's very positive. We're no longer like, you know, most people probably because he's no longer on Twitter, don't even know where he physically is in the world. Is he in Mar-a-Lago? Is he, you know, he is just not a part of our lives to any degree. And, you know, he essentially is stuck in Mar-a-Lago writing these messages that come from the office of the president. Sorry. He uses the presidential seal, which is illegal, but it says the office of Donald Trump. And he is essentially writing tweets in press release form, hoping that the media republishes them and less and less that's happening. The only people that are republishing them now are OAN, you know, those sites. And so I feel that it's been very positive. And obviously he's had deeply damaging effects on our society and on people's trust in our elections. But I would say that without him being on Twitter, the more rational Republicans have still got the other Republicans, they still believe something falls. But it's not as dangerously false as before. When you ask a Republican now, was the 2020 election legitimate? So before, like in November to January, when Trump was really spreading all that propaganda, their answer would have been no, because it was stolen with all of these illegal ballots that were brought in from China and that line. But now, because the more rational Republicans, even though they're wrong, even though they're still fascists, even though they still want to destroy our country, at least the line that they're giving us now is the election was illegitimate because too many people could vote. Yeah, that's the most fucked up thing that they say that. That's an improvement, though. That's an improvement, though. It's crazy. They just say that. And it's very, very, very, very fucked up. I totally agree. But it's an improvement over what they were saying before, because what they were saying before was at least not an argument that could bring change from within the system. It was a call for a domestic terror. It was a call to take out election officials. It was a call to destroy the republic essentially because it had been taken over by communists. What we are seeing is at least a call to change laws and to reform the system in a way that would be deeply damaging and would be horrible for our democracy. But at least, I hope you can see this, that at least it's still within the system. We can still do something. We can still make it harder to vote. We can still. Yeah. You know. All is not lost. We don't need to raid the capital. All we need to do is make it harder to vote. Yeah. And that's not going over well for them anyway. Thank God. So to me, I do, I feel a little bit of hopefulness, but a lot of times I don't. And I feel like you more than maybe anyone I've ever talked to have. How do I put it? I feel like you, based on your POV and my fantasy, which is that you get information from all kinds of weird sources that I could ever imagine. And I just let it be a fantasy. Don't tell me if that's not true. But when I'm looking at the world, and I'm feeling particularly cynical. I don't understand how it doesn't just turn in everything just doesn't turn into fascism. I don't understand how that isn't going to happen. Just based on, you know, this pandemic, you know, knowing that we now have a bio weapon floating out there, whether or not it started as one who gives a fuck it is one now. Someone can bottle it and use it. And if you look at like democratic governments versus fascist governments, you can obviously see which one's going to be able to handle that pandemic better than the other. It's the ones that can just lock everybody up and where people aren't going to protest. And so when I do hear that, and it's absolutely a truth that authoritarian regimes have done better at handling the coronavirus that's broadly speaking, like across, you know, the individual means and so on, that's been the case. However, there's another element to that. Which is that some democracies have done better than others. And some democracies have done a lot better than others. So perhaps the lesson that we need to take from this is that our real problem is that we don't have a very cohesive society and countries in Scandinavia did a lot better with this virus. Which is, you know, that should be completely unsurprising to us, because those countries are better at it. Those countries are better than us in almost every other way. You know, America is not the greatest country on earth as much as we have to think that it is. It is only the richest country on earth and being the richest and the greatest are not the same thing. A lot of people equate those two. We're the richest, therefore we're the greatest. And when we say we're the richest, we don't mean the average person either. So it's already a lie. You know, the income of the country is the greatest of all the countries, but it doesn't curdle down. Anyway, so that's one big component that we need to look into. How can we increase the cohesiveness of our society? What do you think the answer is? How? Well, it's really tough, but I do think that if we were willing to make some radical changes, we could perhaps get closer to it. And so I'll preface this by saying I'm not a politician, not a foreign policy expert or any of those things. Just somebody who has looked around at our society and has seen the deep divisions that are getting deeper and deeper. And by the way, I think that even if we solve the free speech problem entirely online to a way that, you know, like to a perfect utopian way, that these divisions would continue to accelerate because they're not primarily like it. It's true that like extremists, domestic terrorists, etc. can accelerate these divisions. That's why they call themselves accelerationists, but these divisions are still there and they continue to get deeper. And so I wonder often whether or not what we need in this country is to learn from the great, you know, American diplomats that went overseas. And what constitutions did they give those countries that are not doing so much better than us? Look at Germany, for example, which is doing a lot better than us. They did not give them an American-style constitution, same with Japan. Why didn't they give them the constitution? That seems to be implicitly admitting that the constitution needs to work. Exactly. And because I lived in the Philippines, I know that we learned a lot from the mistakes that we made in the Philippines by giving them a constitution that was based so much on our own. We gave them a bicameral legislature. We gave them a Senate. You know, that's what that means. We gave them all of these trappings of American constitutionalism and their country's government is extremely dysfunctional because the bicameral system is certainly not the best system for democracy. Most advanced democracies, let's think of Israel, you know, Germany. They don't have one because they don't work. You mean they always get stuck in a quagmire? They always get... Yeah. And it's always so easy to blame the other house. And, you know, it needlessly slows down laws. And the only people that it's really good for are capitalists who don't want change. And so they can endlessly slow down the system via these two houses that have to, you know, come up with a reconciled bill. And so, you know, our system is designed in such a way that the rich and powerful and landowners, that's specifically the purpose of the Senate, is to make landowners more powerful than the people have extreme ability to slow things down. So I think that really what we need to do is realize that as a country, America has become extremely divided, that our system does not work for most people and that we cannot afford to just sit around and do nothing because the next coup is likely to succeed. The next coup is going to be by somebody who's younger and who is going to be much more ideologically driven. They're not going to be a reality TV show star that is just looking at their own brand. They are going to probably be somebody that would be willing to die to destroy the federal government, as we know. So I really think that what we need is to do, you know, and this is going to sound radical to a lot of people, do something like what Venezuela did. They had a constitutional convention. They asked everybody, what do you citizen want Venezuela to be? And maybe the way that Venezuela did that was not the greatest way to do it. Maybe it was a cover for the people in power there to, you know, force this system down people's throat to make it look democratic. Okay, I'm not saying that's exactly copy what happened in Venezuela. I'm just saying our founders for as much a mythos that we have around them as being these perfect people who wrote this perfect document, and that they were just extremely, extremely intelligent, and there's nothing that could be done to improve that document. And it gave us a way to not only amend the Constitution, but to literally replace the Constitution. And that's, I really feel what we need to do. It's called an article five convention. The legal term. And what that is is three quarters of the states get together, and they decide on a whole bunch of amendments all at once. And it Congress does not have to agree because this is likely to change their jobs extremely. They're very unlikely to agree to this because I imagine if this happens, and we decide, you know what, we're really having a lot of trouble getting along. All of us states, we're really having a lot of trouble. Some of us are really upset that immigrants are crossing into our borders. Some of us are really upset that the taxes are too low. I mean, there are so many things that this kind of the devolved power system of the EU, and the EU is still extremely strong on the stage. It's still extremely strong in NATO. It still has extremely strong trade rules. I mean, the EU is not, you know, a force that's nothing. And we could very easily decide that what we need is something like the EU class of Defense Union. So, yeah, every state essentially, and we could even, you know, the great thing about an article five convention is we can make more states while we're there. We can join states while we're there. You can change anything. And they three quarters of the state legislators have to vote for it. And yeah, that's all that needs to happen. I love that. What are we doing here? It's like our country's acting like people who've been in a shitty relationship for years and years. It's not working out. We don't need to be in the shitty relationship. We don't need to. If people at the grassroots level would demand that their state legislature votes for an article five convention, one would happen. And we could, you know, this country could change so much overnight. And I, I really feel that if we don't do this, we are going to be changed by war. Yeah, because the article five convention, that process was added there by the founders, because contrary to American myth, which is mostly supported by people that are in power right now under the current American system, you know, because it's worth their jobs. Contrary to the American myth, they knew that their document was not one everlasting or two perfect that it was going to need changes. And so they gave us two ways to make changes. They gave us the way that's the only way that we've ever done it, where basically, you know, three, I think it's two thirds of the states decide and then, you know, Congress and all of that, but this article five convention is the second way. And even though we've never done it, we could. And at one of those, I mean, you can make new states, you can, you know, you could give tribes their own countries. I mean, you could dissolve everything. You really, as long as three quarters of the state legislatures agree, a lot could get done. And so we sit here and we say, this Constitution, it's just so old and there's nothing we can do, because every, you know, amendment has to be passed one on one by one. It's so hard to get everybody to agree. But I really think that if we all sat down and tried, you know, there are ways to make this palatable to everybody because states like Texas would no longer need to accept every immigrant from the other states, like that could be great, you know, you would have something like the EU where the countries that make up the EU control their own borders. And so even though an immigrant would be able to enter, you know, this new United States, they would need to become a citizen of it to even be able to cross into Texas. So Texas would be seeing a lot less, you know, and that's even if we have complete freedom of union. Sorry. That's even if we have complete freedom of movement like the EU. Right, which we might not want. But see, that's the scary part is let's say you end up in like some hyper reds, you know, you're one of the liberals living in some hyper red state. And all of a sudden, like it's, you're fucked, like you're stuck in some horrible hellscape. But here's what I would say to you. You're stuck right now, because if you are a political minority in one of these states, you are certainly seeing all of these militia movements growing around you. You are certainly seeing far right people getting into office in that state. And what I'm trying to say is, we can't just do nothing. Like, if we do nothing, there will probably be a civil war in this country. And then not only are they fucked, everybody's fucked. So at least in a peaceful process, a liberal person who knows that they're about to become part of this hellscape could move. I mean, if you look at, like what's happened in other countries when this kind of peaceful dissolution has happened, it hasn't always been perfect. But people are kind of given a year to decide which state do you want to be part of now. And that is going to be a lot more important than it used to be because you won't be able to move as easily. And so, you know, if that's the road that we decided to go on, if we decide that we don't want complete freedom of movement, that would be an option. But I mean, I really, really feel strongly that the Constitution needs radical changes. And I don't know exactly what those changes should be. But we need to start asking people and figuring it out because this relationship is not working. You can feel it. And there's this, I think QAnon is just some weird flower on the tree that you're talking about. And there's going to be more flowers and more flowers. And we like to imagine like, oh, that's cute. That's a cute little thing that happened, that QAnon thing. And when they stormed the Capitol, that's a cute little thing. But you know, we're going to, people are going to cover their zits. They're not. They're not. It's going to, they're not going to come to their senses because, and I mean, if you look at the reasons why QAnon wanted to do what they wanted to do, which is affect a coup, put all the Democratic politicians in Guantanamo Bay and execute them. Jim Watkins says in the documentary that his idea for fixing the government is taking all the politicians, shooting them, doing that three times, anybody who wants to become a politician. And then on the fourth round, according to him, he will, you know, those people probably be the better ones because they aren't the kind of people that wanted to become politicians. That's a crazy way to look at the world. But when you, when you look at this, and you see the fact that this QAnon movement, a movement to affect a coup, that's really what it is, got so much support, you can see that there's a lot of internal dissent for the American system. And I'm sorry to say, that does not only exist on the right. A lot of people on the far left of this country agree with the fact that the Senate is essentially a legitimate institute that it should not exist in any sense. No, that's the weird overlap. That's the weird overlap between the left and the right is they both, they both seem to share that perspective, which is odd. Which is why I think an article five convention could work. Yeah, it's really interesting, kind of scary to think about it. And I don't know what I was expecting. I don't know why I thought you were going to give, you were going to make me feel better. It's really scary. Yeah, I agree that, you know, I actually agree that an article five convention is really scary to happen because you don't know what three quarters of these state legislatures, you know, based on, you know, they're going to probably do a lot of surveys and stuff and figure out what everybody wants. And, you know, it will be a democratic process, but you don't know if everything that comes out of this radical change is going to be positive for you personally. And that's very, that's really scary, you know, especially if you live in a red state. But I feel that everybody who's paying attention knows right now that if we keep these institutions, the Senate, and similar to the Electoral College, and we're going to have a fascist coup, it's going to happen. That's how I feel. Yeah. Scary. We have a responsibility to use the system that exists in the law to try to change our system before it's changed for us. And this option goes away. I've got one more question or a couple more questions. We're almost in an hour. Do you have a little bit more time? I do. I have a lot more time. Okay, thank you so much. Yeah, I'm a big fan of yours. I really did like the Midnight Gospel. Thank you. Yeah. If I would say one thing about how people talk to you on Twitter, here's what I would tell you. Everybody who answers every one of your tweets would like, where's season two? I want season two of the Midnight Gospel. You know, I'm sure that that's extremely frustrating and I'm going to tell you that the Midnight Gospel is perfect, even if there never is a season two. And instead of asking for season two, they should watch it again because so much is going on in every frame that you literally cannot understand the Midnight Gospel in one sitting. Or even, you know, I feel five. I feel that I don't even understand. Thank you. So it's conversations like this that are the ones that actually make me really want a season two. You know, I get it, people love it. But when I have this kind of conversation, I'm already in my head seeing what character you might be and how Clancy would react to some of the things you're saying. And like, so these are the moments where it's like, I'd love to do this again. You know, I think, of course, I would have got the season two, but I'm just saying that, you know, it was, it's a wonderful work of art. And I would hope that someday in the future, when English has the status that Latin has today, and it's only researched for like, classics purposes, that one of the classics people are trying to understand is the Midnight Gospel. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. This, that's so sweet to hear, man. Thank you so much. I didn't think you'd respond to me when you did it. I was like, whoa, and then you see your, you've seen Midnight Gospel. That was when I was just like, I was telling my wife, he watched the show. Because we were riveted. When I first responded to you, I was thinking, he might think this joke that I'm about to make is really dumb, because it looks like from the glasses man episode. He might think this joke I'm about to make is really dumb, but I'm very familiar with this show. No, I appreciated that you joking, sort of joking lure. For me, the chromatic ribbon, I mean, not to sound like a complete loon. It's not quite a non-existent place. So like, I just did the part of the multiverse we exist in. Obviously, it's a Netflix show. Of course, yeah, I know I've heard your conversation with Hamilton Morris, where he said that, you know, that place, you basically came up with it on Ketamine. Yeah, it exists. It exists. Yeah, somewhere. Now, this is, so this is something I discovered, which I thought was interesting because I was googling inventors who came to regret their inventions, because I thought it'd be interesting to talk to you about that. To see who you're who you exist with. One of them, of course, Oppenheimer, the inventor of the atomic bomb. And I'm sure you know this because, and this brings this brings me to where something I want to talk to you about, because this, do you know who Vincent Connors Connors is? I'm Vincent Connors. I don't think so. He is the creator of Comic Sans. Oh, yeah. Yes, I do. And he says that his, you know, regret regarding creating that font is not so much that he created the font, the much made fun of font, but that people think that's the only thing I've ever designed. Right. And he also made Trebuchet on that. Yeah. Exactly. But you know, once you make Comic Sans that you're the Comic Sans guy, which he said people will say you're the you did that to us. But do you want me to defend the Comic Sans? Yes, please. I can I'm actually, I'm a type designer. That's my main thing that I do. Yes. It seems like a weird transition, but it wasn't really that was always what I wanted to do. Actually, 810 was a detour in my life. I mean, I, I recently found my first font that I released publicly, which I did in 2006 when I was 12. So this is something that I saw you tweet that and you know what, I think you maybe you criticize. I thought it looks so cool, man, that first. Yeah, I wanted that. That font looked cool to me. Yeah. Well, okay. Look, I'm not a font. I don't I love fonts, but and I recognize their power, but I don't know anything about them, which is why I wanted to bring up this. Comic Sans to get into the font discussion in defense and Comic Sans. First of all, the main reason people don't like Comic Sans is just because of how used it is. And a fatigue like this happens with a lot of designs, where you see something so often and not only that you see it used in the worst possible situations. You see a sign of the DMV. You see something important in, and so you begin to develop this visceral hatred for Comic Sans, but not only that. The design of Comic Sans is actually objectively ugly, but that's only because we're displaying it in a way that Vincent Kanair did not mean for it to be displayed. He developed Comic Sans to be used as a pixel font in Microsoft Bob. And so when you're looking at Comic Sans, you're really only supposed to be seeing it being like eight or 10 pixels tall. The way that he drew the outlines, the outlines were more of an afterthought to get that certain shape at that size. So when we're seeing Comic Sans printed out in huge letters, that is not what he intended. So if you actually download an old Windows 98 release and you set your font size down really small and you type in Comic Sans, you'll actually find that. Comic Sans is extremely good at giving you a comic book feel in a very small font size, which is very hard to do because your expressivity is very reduced if you only have like nine or ten rows of pixels. So Comic Sans is not a bad font. Everyone is just using it wrong. That's the answer. This is something I was really impressed by when I was going through your tweets. And you don't accept money for the fonts that you have out there. I guess someone was like trying to snitch on some big brand by showing that they had used your font. And I'm sure they were well intended because they thought you were getting ripped off. But your response was, I'm giving these away. It says they're free. I'm giving them away. And then also, I love that you tweeted a little bit, that hacker hymn, that beautiful free software song, which is pretty intense when you see him singing it live. It's religious or something. You know what I mean? It's like beautiful. It is almost a religion. The free software philosophy that I subscribe to is almost a religion. And that is even recognized by the founder, that guy that's singing the song. He has a whole ripoff of religion where he calls himself Saint Ignatius. GNU is the name of the free software project and he wears a halo and he like says a bunch of things that, you know, make fun of religion. But anyway, so the reason, the fundamental reason that all of my fonts are free is because I, first of all, I don't like to chase people down and try to get money out of them for using. Like when they made a copy of the font, I still have the font and I can still use the font and all my users can still use the font. So they didn't do anything that harmed me by doing that. They just liked my work and wanted to use it. And so for me to come back at them with a whole bunch of negativity is making the world a worse place and, you know, continuing to kind of manifest in the world all of these systems that we're trying to get rid of like, you know, disaster capitalism. So I, you know, and I'm not the only one that looks at it this way. I look at it more that you can either as a programmer spend your career working for large software companies, Microsoft, Adobe, even small ones, you know, like the people that make lifts up and you can spend your whole career building walls and making walled gardens and making systems that are not interoperable and trying to lock your users into this software so that they become so good at using this software that it becomes an indispensable tool for them. And so they need you for their entire career. And you can, you know, you can do that and that's a way to make money and maybe you will make enough money that you'll be comfortable and you'll be able to write a whole bunch of nice programs and, you know, you'll solve a whole bunch of interesting problems, which is mostly what you do. But at the end of your career, when you look back, you spent your entire career making the world the worst place because all of those programs are not interoperable. People cannot study them to figure out how they work. All of the work that you did to solve all of those very hard problems is locked up. And all of those problems will need to be solved again by somebody else. So your career, I'm sorry to say, if you work on proprietary software, I agree with the founder of the free software movement, Richard Salman, you've made the world the worst place. So instead, what you can decide to do is to develop software in a way that's more ethical, where you can still make money from the software, but in a different way. You charge people to change the software. You charge people to make the software do more things. It's called writing patches. You know, I work on fonts, but I also work on font editors. And that's actually where most of my commissions would come from because it's like, fix this bug in this. Is that what you're working on right now? Or is that all the code you've been tweeting? Yeah, yeah, I'm working on a font editor called M F E K module font editor K it's supposed to be. So I'm a maintainer of the largest font editor free software editor font forge. But of course that's not the largest font editor that's like the largest free software editor, which is like 1% of you know, and the reason that I feel that font words doesn't have as much penetration as it could is because after training it for as long as I did, I felt like it is so hard. Even for somebody with as much experience writing free software as me to push this program further because it was written in the early 2000s and that's the great thing about free software it lasts and free software will probably outlive. And proprietary software will not because it's in the interest of those proprietary software companies people writing. So the work that people that are now retired at Adobe did on Photoshop CS5 CS6. Most of their work is probably gone I'm sorry to say, and if it's still being used by Adobe they're probably uncredited. And it's probably only in marginal utilities like, you know, little libraries and stuff, but when it comes to free software. Your contribution is basically forever because you can continue to take the source code of the program and compile it on new and new new computers and keep, you know, changing things out so that it keeps working. And the original font words was written for a very, very, very early versions of Linux, which had something called X windows, you know, the common desktop environment, which nobody on earth. Well, maybe a few people use right now, and over time, we, it's maintainers, you know, that I've found and gone have made it so that, you know, font words continues to work on modern systems and that doesn't happen with proprietary software. It comes with called abandon and abandon where the bugs never get fixed. Nobody can work on it legally. And those who patch it illegally are taking risks. So, you know, and we have something even worse now called, you know, a soft service as a software substitute where you're not even having the program anymore. You're going to a website which has all your data, and that website can close at any time. It can change at any time. And, you know, if you go to a website to like edit photos, I mean that photo editing website might not be there tomorrow. They might have a server problem with all your photos. They might get hacked. And now, you know, all of your potentially embarrassing photos are out there on the internet. So I'm really against that, you know, using services instead of software on your computer. And I'm also against, especially from my own work, using software that I cannot compile myself because at the end of the day, I've worked on a lot of difficult fonts that took me a really long time to finish. Like, especially my typewriter font and my cursive font, those two projects. But your typewriter font has become kind of famous, right? Like it's, yeah. Yeah, it's my most famous one. Some people actually are shocked when they've learned about me through this Q thing. And then they realize that they are graphic designers and they've had my fonts installed for years. Yeah. That's what I thought. And it's like, I know with the Q doc, what are they going to do? Like, you know, spend an episode talking about your fonts. But to me, I felt, man, this, this blows because your art is like getting sort of like the spotlights over here on the apocalypse. And you're making these incredible fonts that you're just giving to people. And to me, that is, I mean, taking down or trying to attack QAnon is like, that's awesome. But what makes you a global hero of April is that you're also giving away all your software and fonts. And, you know, I'm not starving by doing that either. I still, people still commissioned me to patch font for it. They commissioned me to make another font. You know, I've even been commissioned to make a font for Google. I made on the new version of Notosan's Tagalog, which was a font for the Tagalog language. Which basically Google has Android and Android is supposed to support every language in the world. And the Tagalog script is like a marginal script. What is Tagalog? Tagalog is the script that used to be using the Philippines and is having. Oh, after the Spanish colonized the Philippines, they destroyed the Tagalog script, essentially they tried to destroy all records of it. Same thing that kind of happened in Mexico and Latin America, but the Tagalog script has made a lot of research in the Philippines. It appears on a lot of official seals. It appears on the money and there are some efforts to teach it in schools and so on and so there have been updates to the script and people have added new letters and so on. So I submitted a proposal to the Unicode consortium, which, you know, funny enough after that proposal, I got a lot more involved in how I actually contribute by sitting on a few of his committees, you know, funny how that works. But I, just because I had time and I, you know, there aren't many Unicode experts in the world and so those that have time should use it to try to help Unicode because there aren't enough of us. Wait, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know what, earlier when you were kind enough to say what a bicameral government is, I appreciated that. Could you do the same thing for Unicode for me, please? Okay, yes. I'm sorry. You know, I sometimes think that people have more technical knowledge than they do and that's totally my fault. So, okay, it used to be in the battle days that if you had a Commodore 64 and somebody else had a BBC micro, the character systems that were on those computers were not interoperable. The same byte did not represent the same character. And there were characters that were on one computer that were not on the other. And both of those computers did not even support foreign languages. Well, foreign to their authors, meaning anything that's not English. So Unicode is a system of assigning a number to every character used in every language. Okay. They're also the people that decide which emoji exists. So they have two jobs. They decide which numbers are assigned to which emoji and then which numbers are assigned to which characters. And when I noticed that deficiency in the big olive script that it was missing the letter raw, and it was also missing a little mark that goes next to a letter that basically silences it. It's called a killer, a pure killer, essentially, like it kills the vowel. That's what it's supposed to be. It's a very dramatic name for something that is very pure killer. So I got those two characters out of it. And then when I did that, the Google was basically like, Hey, you already know about this problem with our notosans to go look font. So how about you would just fix it? Because you're the guy that wrote the proposal. And I know that you know how to develop fonts. So yeah, I fixed it. Wow. You are such a badass. Listen, you are definitely you're the, I think you've gone in my mind from global April hero, we're, we're going to do like summer, you're the hero of the summer. I really, really appreciate the time that you've given me and I really, really appreciate all the work that you, you've been doing and everything that was shown in that QAnon documentary because we, you know, you inspire me, I want to be more like you. So thank you. Thank you so much, Frederick. And you inspire me as well. I would probably like to be more like you. So I think it's a beautiful feeling.
